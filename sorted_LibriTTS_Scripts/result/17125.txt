none	none	 one hundred ninety seven XIII William and the Ancient Souls two hundred thirteen XIV William s Christmas Eve two hundred twenty eight CHAPTER I A BUSY DAY William awoke and rubbed his eyes It was Christmas Day the day to which he had looked forward with mingled feelings for twelve months It was a jolly day of course presents and turkey and crackers and staying up late On the other hand there were generally too many relations about too much was often expected of one the curious taste displayed by people who gave one presents often marred one s pleasure He looked round his bedroom expectantly On the wall just opposite his bed was a large illuminated card hanging by a string from a nail A Busy Day is a Happy Day That had not been there the day before Brightly coloured roses and forget me nots and honeysuckle twined round all the words William hastily thought over the three aunts staying in the house and put it down to Aunt Lucy He looked at it with a doubtful frown He distrusted the sentiment A copy of Portraits of our Kings and Queens he put aside as beneath contempt Things a Boy Can Do was more promising Much more promising After inspecting a penknife a pocket compass and a pencil box which shared the fate of Portraits of our Kings and Queens William returned to Things a Boy Can Do As he turned the pages his face lit up He leapt lightly out of bed and dressed Then he began to arrange his own gifts to his family For his father he had bought a bottle of highly coloured sweets for his elder brother Robert aged nineteen he had expended a vast sum of money on a copy of The Pirates of the Bloody Hand These gifts had cost him much thought The knowledge that his father never touched sweets and that Robert professed scorn of pirate stories had led him to hope that the recipients of his gifts would make no objection to the unobtrusive theft of them by their recent donor in the course of the next few days For his grown up sister Ethel he had bought a box of coloured chalks That also might come in useful later Funds now had been running low but for his mother he had bought a small cream jug which after fierce bargaining the man had let him have at half price because it was cracked Singing Christians Awake at the top of his lusty young voice he went along the landing putting his gifts outside the doors of his family and pausing to yell Happy Christmas as he did so From within he was greeted in each case by muffled groans He went downstairs into the hall still singing It was earlier than he thought just five o clock The maids were not down yet He switched on lights recklessly and discovered that he was not the only person in the hall His four year old cousin Jimmy was sitting on the bottom step in an attitude of despondency holding an empty tin Jimmy s mother had influenza at home and Jimmy and his small sister Barbara were in the happy position of spending Christmas with relations but immune from parental or maternal interference They ve gotten out said Jimmy sadly I got em for presents yesterday an they ve gotten out I ve been feeling for em in the dark but I can t find em What said William Snails Great big suge ones wiv great big suge shells I put em in a tin for presents an they ve gotten out an I ve gotten no presents for nobody He relapsed into despondency William surveyed the hall They ve got out right enough he said sternly They ve got out right enough Jus look at our hall Jus look at our clothes They ve got out right enough Innumerable slimy iridescent trails shone over hats and coats and umbrellas and wall paper Huh grunted William who was apt to overwork his phrases They ve got out right enough He looked at the tracks again and brightened Jimmy was frankly delighted Oo Look he cried Oo funny William s thoughts flew back to his bedroom wall A Busy Day is a Happy Day Let s clean it up he said Let s have it all nice an clean for when they come down We ll be busy You tell me if you feel happy when we ve done It might be true wot it says but I don t like the flowers messin all over it Investigation in the kitchen provided them with a large pail of water and a scrubbing brush each For a long time they worked in silence They used plenty of water When they had finished the trails were all gone Each soaked garment on the hat stand was sending a steady drip on to the already flooded floor The wall paper was sodden With a feeling of blankness they realised that there was nothing else to clean It was Jimmy who conceived the exquisite idea of dipping his brush in the bucket and sprinkling William with water A scrubbing brush is in many ways almost as good as a hose Each had a pail of ammunition Each had a good sized brush During the next few minutes they experienced purest joy Then William heard threatening movements above and decided hastily that the battle must cease Backstairs he said shortly Come on Marking their track by a running stream of water they crept up the backstairs But two small boys soaked to the skin could not disclaim all knowledge of a flooded hall William was calm and collected when confronted with a distracted mother We was tryin to clean up he said We found all snail marks an we was tryin to clean up We was tryin to help You said so last night you know when you was talkin to me You said to help Well I thought it was helpin to try an clean up You can t clean up with water an not get wet not if you do it prop ly You said to try an make Christmas Day happy for other folks and then I d be happy Well I don t know as I m very happy he said bitterly but I ve been workin hard enough since early this mornin I ve been workin he went on pathetically His eye wandered to the notice on his wall I ve been busy all right but it doesn t make me happy not jus now he added with memories of the rapture of the fight That certainly must be repeated some time Buckets of water and scrubbing brushes He wondered he d never thought of that before William s mother looked down at his dripping form Did you get all that water with just cleaning up the snail marks she said William coughed and cleared his throat Well he said deprecatingly most of it I think I got most of it If it wasn t Christmas Day she went on darkly

none	none	There was certainly something to be said for Christmas Day It was decided to hide the traces of the crime as far as possible from William s father It was felt and not without reason that William s father s feelings of respect for the sanctity of Christmas Day might be overcome by his feelings of paternal ire Half an hour later William dried dressed brushed and chastened descended the stairs as the gong sounded in a hall which was bare of hats and coats and whose floor shone with cleanliness And jus to think said William despondently that it s only jus got to brekfust time William s father was at the bottom of the stairs William s father frankly disliked Christmas Day Good morning William he said and a happy Christmas and I hope it s not too much to ask of you that on this relation infested day one s feelings may be harrowed by you as little as possible And why the deu dickens they think it necessary to wash the hall floor before breakfast Heaven only knows William coughed a cough meant to be a polite mixture of greeting and deference William s face was a study in holy innocence His father glanced at him suspiciously There were certain expressions of William s that he distrusted William entered the dining room morosely Jimmy s sister Barbara a small bundle of curls and white frills was already beginning her porridge Goo mornin she said politely did you hear me cleanin my teef He crushed her with a glance He sat eating in silence till everyone had come down and Aunts Jane Evangeline and Lucy were consuming porridge with that mixture of festivity and solemnity that they felt the occasion demanded Then Jimmy entered radiant with a tin in his hand Got presents he said proudly Got presents lots of presents He deposited on Barbara s plate a worm which Barbara promptly threw at his face Jimmy looked at her reproachfully and proceeded to Aunt Evangeline Aunt Evangeline s gift was a centipede a live centipede that ran gaily off the tablecloth on to Aunt Evangeline s lap before anyone could stop it With a yell that sent William s father to the library with his hands to his ears Aunt Evangeline leapt to her chair and stood with her skirts held to her knees Help Help she cried The horrible boy Catch it Kill it Jimmy gazed at her in amazement and Barbara looked with interest at Aunt Evangeline s long expanse of shin My legs isn t like your legs she said pleasantly and conversationally My legs is knees It was some time before order was restored the centipede killed and Jimmy s remaining gifts thrown out of the window William looked across the table at Jimmy with respect in his eye Jimmy in spite of his youth was an acquaintance worth cultivating Jimmy was eating porridge unconcernedly Aunt Evangeline had rushed from the room when the slaughter of the centipede had left the coast clear and refused to return She carried on a conversation from the top of the stairs When that horrible child has gone I ll come He may have insects concealed on his person And someone s been dropping water all over these stairs They re damp Dear dear murmured Aunt Jane sadly Jimmy looked up from his porridge How was I to know she didn t like insecks he said aggrievedly I like em William s mother s despair was only tempered by the fact that this time William was not the culprit To William also it was a novel sensation He realised the advantages of a fellow criminal After breakfast peace reigned William s father went out for a walk with Robert The aunts sat round the drawing room fire talking and doing crochet work In this consists the whole art and duty of aunthood All aunts do crochet work They had made careful inquiries about the time of the service You needn t worry had said William s mother It s at ten point thirty and if you go to get ready when the clock in the library strikes ten it will give you heaps of time Illustration AROUND THEM LAY MOST INDECENTLY EXPOSED THE INTERNAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE LIBRARY CLOCK Peace calm quiet missus Brown and Ethel in the kitchen supervising the arrangements for the day The aunts in the drawing room discussing over their crochet work the terrible way in which their sisters had brought up their children That also is a necessary part of aunthood Time slipped by happily and peacefully Then William s mother came into the drawing room I thought you were going to church she said We are The clock hasn t struck But it s eleven o clock There was a gasp of dismay The clock never struck Indignantly they set off to the library Peace and quiet reigned also in the library On the floor sat William and Jimmy gazing with frowns of concentration at an open page of Things a Boy Can Do Around them lay most indecently exposed the internal arrangements of the library clock William You wicked boy William raised a frowning face It s not put together right he said it s not been put together right all this time We re makin it right now It must have wanted mendin for ever so long I dunno how it s been goin at all It s lucky we found it out It s put together wrong I guess it s made wrong It s goin to be a lot of trouble to us to put it right an we can t do much when you re all standin in the light We re very busy workin at tryin to mend this ole clock for you all Clever said Jimmy admiringly Mendin the clock Clever William groaned his mother you ve ruined the clock What will your father say Well the cog wheels was wrong said William doggedly See An this ratchet wheel isn t on the pawl prop ly not like what this book says it ought to be Seems we ve got to take it all to pieces to get it right Seems to me the person wot made this clock didn t know much about clock making Seems to me Be quiet William We was be quietin fore you came in said Jimmy severely You sturbed us Leave it just as it is William said his mother You don t unnerstand said William with the excitement of the fanatic The cog wheel an the ratchet ought to be put on the arbor different See this is the cog wheel Well it oughtn t to be like wot it was It was put on all wrong Well we was mendin it An we was doin it for you he ended bitterly jus to help an to to make other folks happy It makes folks happy havin clocks goin right anyone would think But if you want your clocks put together wrong I don t care He picked up his book and walked proudly from the room followed by the admiring Jimmy William said Aunt Lucy patiently as he passed I don t want to say anything unkind and I hope you won t remember all your life that you have completely spoilt this Christmas Day for me Oh dear murmured Aunt Jane sadly William with a look before which she should have sunk into the earth answered shortly that he didn t think he would During the midday dinner the grown ups as is the foolish fashion of grown ups wasted much valuable time in the discussion of such futilities as the weather and the political state of the nation Aunt Lucy was still suffering and aggrieved I can go this evening of course she said but it s not quite the same The morning service is different

none	none	please dear and stuffing Yes I ll have a little more turkey too And of course the vicar may not preach to night That makes such a difference The gravy on the potatoes please It s almost the first Christmas I ve not been in the morning It seems quite to have spoilt the day for me She bent on William a glance of gentle reproach William was quite capable of meeting adequately that or any other glance but at present he was too busy for minor hostilities He was extremely busy He was doing his utmost to do full justice to a meal that only happens once a year William said Barbara pleasantly I can dweam Can you He made no answer Answer your cousin William said his mother He swallowed then spoke plaintively You always say not to talk with my mouth full he said You could speak when you ve finished the mouthful No Cause I want to fill it again then said William firmly Dear dear murmured Aunt Jane This was Aunt Jane s usual contribution to any conversation He looked coldly at the three pairs of horrified aunts eyes around him then placidly continued his meal missus Brown hastily changed the subject of conversation The art of combining the duties of mother and hostess is sometimes a difficult one Christmas afternoon is a time of rest The three aunts withdrew from public life Aunt Lucy found a book of sermons in the library and retired to her bedroom with it It s the next best thing I think she said with a sad glance at William William was beginning definitely to dislike Aunt Lucy Please m said the cook an hour later the mincing machine s disappeared Disappeared said William s mother raising her hand to her head Clean gone m Ow m I to get the supper m You said as ow I could get it done this afternoon so as to go to church this evening I can t do nuffink with the mincing machine gone I ll come and look They searched every corner of the kitchen then William s mother had an idea William s mother had not been William s mother for eleven years without learning many things She went wearily up to William s bedroom William was sitting on the floor Open beside him was Things a Boy Can Do Around him lay various parts of the mincing machine His face was set and strained in mental and physical effort He looked up as she entered It s a funny kind of mincing machine he said crushingly It s not got enough parts It s made wrong Do you know she said slowly that we ve all been looking for that mincin machine for the last half hour No he said without much interest I di n t I d have told you I was mendin it if you d told me you was lookin for it It s wrong he went on aggrievedly I can t make anything with it Look It says in my book How to make a model railway signal with parts of a mincing machine Listen It says Borrow a mincing machine from your mother Did you borrow it said missus Brown Yes Well I ve got it haven t I I went all the way down to the kitchen for it Who lent it to you No one lent it me I borrowed it I thought you d like to see a model railway signal I thought you d be interested Anyone would think anyone would be interested in seein a railway signal made out of a mincin machine His tone implied that the dullness of people in general was simply beyond him An you haven t got a right sort of mincin machine It s wrong Its parts are the wrong shape I ve been hammerin them tryin to make them right but they re made wrong missus Brown was past expostulating Take them all down to the kitchen to cook she said She s waiting for them On the stairs William met Aunt Lucy carrying her volume of sermons It s not quite the same as the spoken word William dear she said It hasn t the force The written word doesn t reach the heart as the spoken word does but I don t want you to worry about it William walked on as if he had not heard her It was Aunt Jane who insisted on the little entertainment after tea I love to hear the dear children recite she said I m sure they all have some little recitation they can say Barbara arose with shy delight to say her piece Lickle bwown seed lickle bwown bwother And what pway are you goin to be I ll be a poppy as white as my mother Oh DO be a poppy like me What you ll be a sunflower Oh how I shall miss you When you are golden and high But I ll send all the bees up to tiss you Lickle bwown bwother good bye She sat down blushing amid rapturous applause Next Jimmy was dragged from his corner He stood up as one prepared for the worst shut his eyes and Licklaxokindness lickledeedsolove make thisearfanedenliketheeav nabovethasalliknow he gasped all in one breath and sat down panting This was greeted with slightly milder applause Now William I don t know any he said Oh you do said his mother Say the one you learnt at school last term Stand up dear and speak clearly Slowly William rose to his feet It was the schooner Hesperus that sailed the wintry sea he began Here

none	none	an get it ready He went out of the room mister Brown took out his handkerchief and mopped his brow May I ask he said patiently how long this exhibition is to be allowed to continue Here William returned his pockets bulging He held a large handkerchief in his hand This is a handkerchief he announced If anyone d like to feel it to see if it s a real one they can Now I want a shilling he looked round expectantly but no one moved or a penny would do he said with a slightly disgusted air Robert threw one across the room Well I put the penny into the handkerchief You can see me do it can t you If anyone wants to come an feel the penny is in the handkerchief they can Well he turned his back on them and took something out of his pocket After a few contortions he turned round again holding the handkerchief tightly Now you look close he went over to them an you ll see the shil I mean penny he looked scornfully at Robert has changed to an egg It s a real egg If anyone thinks it isn t a real egg But it was a real egg It confirmed his statement by giving a resounding crack and sending a shining stream partly on to the carpet and partly on to Aunt Evangeline s black silk knee A storm of reproaches burst out First that horrible insect almost wept Aunt Evangeline and then this messy stuff all over me It s a good thing I don t live here One day a year is enough My nerves Dear dear said Aunt Jane Fancy taking a new laid egg for that said Ethel severely William was pale and indignant Well I did jus what the book said to do Look at it It says Take an egg Conceal it in the pocket Well I took an egg an I concealed it in the pocket Seems to me he said bitterly seems to me this book isn t Things a Boy Can Do It s Things a Boy Can t Do mister Brown rose slowly from his chair You re just about right there my son Thank you he said with elaborate politeness as he took the book from William s reluctant hands and went over with it to a small cupboard in the wall In this cupboard reposed an airgun a bugle a catapult and a mouth organ As he unlocked it to put the book inside the fleeting glimpse of his confiscated treasures added to the bitterness of William s soul On Christmas Day too While he was still afire with silent indignation Aunt Lucy returned from church The vicar didn t preach she said They say that this morning s sermon was beautiful As I say I don t want William to reproach himself but I feel that he has deprived me of a very great treat Nice Willum murmured Jimmy sleepily from his corner As William undressed that night his gaze fell upon the flower bedecked motto A Busy Day is a Happy Day It s a story he said indignantly It s jus a wicked ole story CHAPTER II RICE MOULD Rice mould said the little girl next door bitterly Rice mould Rice mould every single day I hate it don t you She turned gloomy blue eyes upon William who was perched perilously on the ivy covered wall

none	none	thoughtfully Dunno he said I just eat it I never thought about it It s hateful just hateful Ugh I ve had it at dinner and I ll have it at supper bet you anything I say you are going to have a party to night aren t you William nodded carelessly Are you going to be there Me ejaculated William in a tone of amused surprise I should think so You don t think they could have it without me do you Huh Not much She gazed at him enviously You are lucky I expect you ll have a lovely supper not rice mould bitterly Rather said William with an air of superiority What are you going to have to eat at your party Oh everything said William vaguely Cream blanc mange Heaps of it buckets of it The little girl next door clasped her hands Oh just think of it Your eating cream blanc mange and me eating rice mould It is impossible to convey in print the intense scorn and hatred which the little girl next door could compress into the two syllables Here an idea struck William What time do you have supper Seven Well now magnanimously if you ll be in your summer house at half past I ll bring you some cream blanc mange Truly I will The little girl s face beamed with pleasure Will you Will you really You won t forget Not me I ll be there I ll slip away from our show on the quiet with it Oh how lovely I ll be thinking of it every minute Don t forget Good bye She blew him a kiss and flitted daintily into the house William blushed furiously at the blown kiss and descended from his precarious perch He went to the library where his grown up sister Ethel and his elder brother Robert were standing on ladders at opposite ends of the room engaged in hanging up festoons of ivy and holly across the wall There was to be dancing in the library after supper William s mother watched them from a safe position on the floor Illustration IF YOU LL BE IN YOUR SUMMER HOUSE AT HALF PAST I LL BRING YOU SOME CREAM BLANC MANGE TRULY I WILL SAID WILLIAM Look here mother began William Am I or am I not coming to the party to night William s mother sighed For goodness sake William don t open that discussion again For the tenth time to day you are not But why not he persisted I only want to know why not That s all I want to know It looks a bit funny doesn t it to give a party and leave out your only son at least with a glance at Robert and a slight concession to accuracy to leave out one of your only two sons It looks a bit queer surely That s all I m thinking of how it will look A bit higher your end said Ethel Yes that s better said William s mother It s a young folks party went on William warming to his subject I heard you tell Aunt Jane it was a young folks party Well I m young aren t I I m eleven Do you want me any younger You aren t ashamed of folks seeing me are you I m not deformed or anything That s right Put the nail in there Ethel Just a bit higher That s right P raps you re afraid of what I ll eat went on William bitterly Well everyone eats don t they They ve got to to live And you ve got things for us them to eat to night You don t grudge me just a bit of supper do you You d think it was less trouble for me to have my bit of supper with you all than in a separate room That s all I m thinking of the trouble William s sister turned round on her ladder and faced the room Can t anyone she said desperately stop that child talking William s brother began to descend his ladder I think I can he said grimly But William had thrown dignity to the winds and fled He went down the hall to the kitchen where cook hastily interposed herself between him and the table that was laden with cakes and jellies and other delicacies Now Master William she said sharply you clear out of here I don t want any of your things cook said William magnificently but untruthfully I only came to see how you were getting on That s all I came for We re getting on very well indeed thank you Master William she said with sarcastic politeness but nothing for you till to morrow when we can see how much they ve left She returned to her task of cutting sandwiches William from a respectful distance surveyed the table with its enticing burden Huh he ejaculated bitterly think of them sitting and stuffing and stuffing and stuffing away at our food all night I don t suppose they ll leave much not if I know the set that lives round here Don t judge them all by yourself Master William said cook unkindly keeping a watchful eye upon him Here Emma put that rice mould away in the pantry It s for to morrow s lunch Rice mould That reminded him Cook he said ingratiatingly are you going to make cream blanc mange I am not Master William she said firmly Well he said with a short laugh it ll be a queer party without cream blanc mange I ve never heard of a party without cream blanc mange They ll think it s a bit funny No one ever gives a party round here without cream blanc mange Don t they indeed Master William said cook with ironic interest No You ll be making one p raps later on just a little one won t you And why should I Well I d like to think they had a cream blanc mange I think they d enjoy it That s all I m thinking of Oh is it Well it s your ma that tells me what to make and pays me for it not you This was a novel idea to William He thought deeply Look here he said at last if I gave you he paused for effect then brought out the startling offer sixpence would you make a cream blanc mange I d want to see your sixpence first said cook with a wink at Emma William retired upstairs to his bedroom and counted out his money twopence was all he possessed He had expended the enormous sum of a shilling the day before on a grass snake It had died in the night He must get a cream blanc mange somehow His reputation for omnipotence in the eyes of the little girl next door a reputation very dear to him depended on it And if cook would do it for sixpence he must find sixpence By fair means or foul it must be done He d tried fair means and there only remained foul He went softly downstairs to the dining room where upon the mantel piece reposed the missionary box He d tell someone next day or put it back or something Anyway people did worse things than that in the pictures With a knife from the table he extracted the contents three halfpence He glared at it balefully Three halfpence he said aloud in righteous indignation This supposed to be a Christian house and three halfpence is all they can give to the poor heathen They can spend pounds and pounds on he glanced round the room and saw a pyramid of pears on the sideboard tons of pears an an green stuff to put on the walls and they give three halfpence to the poor heathen Huh He opened the door and heard his sister s voice from the library He s probably in mischief somewhere He ll be a perfect nuisance all the evening Mother couldn t you make him go to bed an hour earlier William had no doubt as to the subject of the conversation Make him go to bed early He d like to see them He d just like to see them And he d show them anyway Yes he would show them Exactly what he would show them and how he would show them he was not as yet very clear He looked round the room again There were no eatables in it so far except the piled up plate of huge pears on the sideboard He looked at it longingly They d probably counted them and knew just how many there ought to be Mean sort of thing they would do And they d be in counting them every other minute just to see if he d taken one Well he was going to score off somebody somehow Make him go to bed early indeed He stood with knit brows deep in thought then his face cleared and he smiled He d got it For the next five minutes he munched the delicious pears but at the end the piled up pyramid was apparently exactly as he found it not a pear gone only on the inner side of each pear the side that didn t show was a huge semicircular bite William wiped his mouth with his coat sleeve They were jolly good pears And a blissful vision came to him of the faces of the guests as they took the pears of the faces of his father and mother and Robert and Ethel Oh crumbs He chuckled to himself as he went down to the kitchen again I say cook could you make a small one quite a small one for threepence halfpenny Cook laughed I was only pulling your leg Master William I ve got one made and locked up in the larder That s all right said William I wanted them to have a cream blanc mange that s all Oh they ll have it all right they won t leave much for you I only made one Did you say locked in the larder said William carelessly It must be a bother for you to lock the larder door each time you go in Oh no trouble Master William thank you said cook sarcastically there s more than the cream blanc mange there there s pasties and cakes and other things I m thinking of the last party your ma gave William had the grace to blush On that occasion William and a friend had spent the hour before supper in the larder and supper had to be postponed while fresh provisions were beaten up from any and every quarter William had passed a troubled night and spent the next day in bed Oh then That was a long time ago I was only a kid then Umph grunted cook Then relenting Well if there s any cream blanc mange left I ll bring it up to you in bed Now that s a promise Here Emma put these sandwiches in the larder Here s the key Now mind you lock it after you Cook Just come here for a minute It was the voice of William s mother from the library William s heart rose With cook away from the scene of action great things might happen Emma took the dish of sandwiches unlocked the pantry door and entered There was a crash of crockery from the back kitchen Emma fled out leaving the door unlocked After she had picked up several broken plates which had unaccountably slipped from the shelves she returned and locked the pantry door William in the darkness within heaved a sigh of relief He was in anyway how he was going to get out he wasn t quite sure He stood for a few minutes in rapt admiration of his own cleverness He d scored off cook Crumbs He d scored off cook So far at any rate The first thing to do was to find the cream blanc mange He found it at last and sat down with it on the bread pan to consider his next step Suddenly he became aware of two green eyes staring at him in the darkness The cat was in too Crumbs The cat was in too The cat recognising its inveterate enemy set up a vindictive wail William grew cold with fright The rotten old cat was going to give the show away Here Pussy Good ole Pussy he whispered hoarsely Nice ole Pussy Good ole Pussy The cat gazed at him in surprise This form of address from William was unusual Good ole Pussy went on William feverishly Shut up then Here s some nice blanc mange Just have a bit Go on have a bit and shut up He put the dish down on the larder floor before the cat and the cat after a few preliminary licks decided that it was good William sat watching for a bit Then he came to the conclusion that it was no use wasting time and began to sample the plates around him He ate a whole jelly and then took four sandwiches off each plate and four cakes and pasties off each plate He had learnt wisdom since the last party Meanwhile the cat licked away at the cream blanc mange with every evidence of satisfaction It even began to purr and as its satisfaction increased so did the purr It possessed a peculiar penetrating purr Cook called out Emma from the kitchen Cook came out of the library where she was assisting with the festoon hanging What s the matter There s a funny buzzing noise in the larder Well go in and see what it is It s probably a wasp that s all Emma approached with the key and William clasping the blanc mange to his bosom withdrew behind the door slipping off his shoes in readiness for action Poor Puss said Emma opening the door and meeting the cat s green unabashed gaze Did it get shut up in the nasty dark larder then Who did it then She was bending down with her back to William stroking the cat in the doorway William seized his chance He dashed past her and up the stairs in stockinged feet like a flash of lightning But Emma leaning over the cat had espied a dark flying figure out of the corner of her eye She set up a scream Out of the library came William s mother William s sister William s brother and cook A burglar in the larder gasped Emma I seed im I did Out of the corner of my eye like and when I looked up e wasn t there no more Flittin up the all like a shadder e was Oh lor It s fairly turned me inside Oh lor What rubbish said William s mother Emma you must control yourself I went into the larder myself m said cook indignantly just before I came in to elp with the greenery ornaments and it was hempty as hair It s all that silly Emma Always avin the jumps she is Where s William said William s mother with sudden suspicion William William came out of his bedroom and looked over the balusters Yes mother he said with that wondering innocence of voice and look which he had brought to a fine art and which proved one of his greatest assets in times of stress and strain What are you doing Jus readin quietly in my room mother Oh for heaven s sake don t disturb him then said William s sister It s those silly books you read Emma You re always imagining things If you d read the ones I recommend instead of the foolish ones you will get hold of William s mother was safely mounted on one of her favourite hobby horses William withdrew to his room and carefully concealed the cream blanc mange beneath his bed He then waited till he heard the guests arrive and exchange greetings in the hall William listening with his door open carefully committed to memory the voice and manner of his sister s greeting to her friends That would come in useful later on probably No weapon of offence against the world in general and his own family in particular was to be despised He held a rehearsal in his room when the guests were all safely assembled in the drawing room Oh how are you missus Green he said in a high falsetto meant to represent the feminine voice And how s the darling baby Such a duck I m dying to see him again Oh Delia darling There you are So glad you could come What a perfect darling of a dress my dear I know whose heart you ll break in that Oh mister Thompson here William languished bridled and ogled in a fashion seen nowhere on earth except in his imitations of his sister when engaged in conversation with one of the male sex If reproduced at the right moment it was guaranteed to drive her to frenzy I m so glad to see you Yes of course I really am I wouldn t say it if I wasn t The drawing room door opened and a chatter of conversation and a rustling of dresses arose from the hall Oh crumbs They were going in to supper Yes the dining room door closed the coast was clear William took out the rather battered looking delicacy from under the bed and considered it thoughtfully The dish was big and awkwardly shaped He must find something that would go under his coat better than that He couldn t march through the hall and out of the front door bearing a cream blanc mange naked and unashamed And the back door through the kitchen was impossible With infinite care but little success as far as the shape of the blanc mange was concerned he removed it from its dish on to his soap dish He forgot in the excitement of the moment to remove the soap but after all it was only a small piece The soap dish was decidedly too small for it but clasped to William s bosom inside his coat it could be partly supported by his arm outside He descended the stairs cautiously He tip toed lightly past the dining room door which was slightly ajar from which came the shrill noisy meaningless conversation of the grown ups He was just about to open the front door when there came the sound of a key turning in the lock William s heart sank He had forgotten the fact that his father generally returned from his office about this time William s father came into the hall and glanced at his youngest offspring suspiciously Hello he said where are you going William cleared his throat nervously Me he questioned lightly Oh I was jus jus goin a little walk up the road before I went to bed That s all I was goin to do father Flop A large segment of the cream blanc mange had disintegrated itself from the fast melting mass and evading William s encircling arm had fallen on to the floor at his feet With praiseworthy presence of mind William promptly stepped on to it and covered it with his feet William s father turned round quickly from the stand where he was replacing his walking stick What was that William looked round the hall absently What father William s father now fastened his eyes upon William s person What have you got under your coat Where said William with apparent surprise Then looking down at the damp excrescence of his coat as if he noticed it for the first time Oh that with a mirthless smile Do you mean that Oh that s jus jus somethin I m takin out with me that s all Again William s father grunted Well he said if you re going for this walk up the road why on earth don t you go instead of standing as if you d lost the use of your feet William s father was hanging up his overcoat with his back to William and the front door was open William wanted no second bidding He darted out of the door and down the drive but he was just in time to hear the thud of a falling body and to hear a muttered curse as the Head of the House entered the dining room feet first on a long slide of some white glutinous substance Oh crumbs gasped William as he ran The little girl next door was sitting in the summer house armed with a spoon when William arrived His precious burden had now saturated his shirt and was striking cold and damp on his chest He drew it from his coat and displayed it proudly It had certainly lost its pristine white rounded appearance The marks of the cat s licks were very evident grime from William s coat adhered to its surface it wobbled limply over the soap dish but the little girl s eyes sparkled as she saw it Oh William I never thought you really would Oh you are wonderful And I had it What Rice mould for supper but I didn t mind because I thought I hoped you d come with it Oh William you are a nice boy William glowed with pride William bellowed an irate voice from William s front door William knew that voice It was the voice of the male parent who has stood all he s jolly well going to stand from that kid and is out for vengeance They d got to the pears Oh crumbs They d got to the pears And even the thought of Nemesis to come could not dull for William the bliss of that vision Illustration WILLIAM LEANT BACK IN A SUPERIOR BENEVOLENT MANNER AND WATCHED THE SMILE FREEZE UPON HER FACE AND HER LOOK OF ECSTASY CHANGE TO ONE OF FURY Oh William said the little girl next door sadly they re calling you Will you have to go Not me said William earnestly I m not going not till they fetch me Here you begin I don t want any I ve had lots of things You eat it all Her face radiant with anticipation the little girl took up her spoon William leant back in a superior benevolent manner and watched the smile freeze upon her face and her look of ecstasy change to one of fury With a horrible suspicion at his heart he seized the spoon she had dropped and took a mouthful himself He had brought the rice mould by mistake CHAPTER III WILLIAM S BURGLAR When William first saw him he was leaning against the wall of the White Lion gazing at the passers by with a moody smile upon his villainous looking countenance It was evident to any careful observer that he had not confined his attentions to the exterior of the White Lion William at whose heels trotted his beloved mongrel rightly named Jumble was passing him with a casual glance when something attracted his attention He stopped and looked back then turning round stood in front of the tall untidy figure gazing up at him with frank and unabashed curiosity Who cut em off he said at last in an awed whisper The figure raised his hands and stroked the long hair down the side of his face Now yer arskin he said with a grin Well who did persisted William That ud be tellin answered his new friend moving unsteadily from one foot to the other See You got em cut off in the war said William firmly I didn t I bin in the wor orl right Stroike me pink I bin in the wor and that s the truth But I didn t get em cut orf in the wor Well I ll stop kiddin yer I ll tell yer strite I never ad none Nar William stood on tiptoe to peer under the untidy hair at the small apertures that in his strange new friend took the place of ears Admiration shone in William s eyes Was you born without em he said enviously His friend nodded Nar don t yer go torkin about it he went on modestly though seeming to bask in the sun of William s evident awe and respect I don t want all folks knowin bout it See It kinder marks a man this ere sort of thing See Makes im too easy to track loike That s why I grow me hair long See Ere ave a drink He put his head inside the window of the White Lion and roared out Bottle o lemonide fer the young gent William followed him to a small table in the little sunny porch and his heart swelled with pride as he sat and quaffed his beverage with a manly air His friend who said his name was mister Blank showed a most flattering interest in him He elicited from him the whereabouts of his house and the number of his family a description of the door and window fastenings of the dining room silver and his mother s jewellery William his eyes fixed with a fascinated stare upon mister Blank s ears gave the required information readily glad to be able in any way to interest this intriguing and mysterious being Tell me about the war said William at last It were orl right while it larsted said mister Blank with a sigh It were orl right but I s pose like mos things in this ere world it couldn t larst fer ever See William set down the empty glass of lemonade and leant across the table almost dizzy with the romance of the moment Had Douglas had Henry had Ginger had any of those boys who sat next him at school and joined in the feeble relaxations provided by the authorities out of school ever done this ever sat at a real table outside a real public house drinking lemonade and talking to a man with no ears who d fought in the war and who looked as if he might have done anything Jumble meanwhile sat and snapped at flies frankly bored Did you said William in a sibilant whisper did you ever kill anyone mister Blank laughed a laugh that made William s blood curdle Me kill anyone Me kill anyone Ondreds William breathed a sigh of satisfaction Here was romance and adventure incarnate What do you do now the war s over mister Blank closed one eye That ud be tellin wudn t it Illustration DID YOU SAID WILLIAM IN A SIBILANT WHISPER DID YOU EVER KILL ANYONE I ll keep it awfully secret pleaded William I ll never tell anyone mister Blank shook his head What yer want ter know fer anyway he said William answered eagerly his eyes alight Cause I d like to do jus the same when I grow up mister Blank flung back his head and emitted guffaw after guffaw of unaffected mirth Oh ell he said wiping his eyes Oh stroike me pink That s good that is You wait young gent you wait till you ve growed up and see what yer pa says to it Oh ell He rose and pulled his cap down over his eyes Well I ll say good day to yer young gent William looked at him wistfully I d like to see you again mister Blank I would honest Will you be here this afternoon Wot d yer want to see me agine fer said mister Blank suspiciously I like you said William fervently I like the way you talk and I like the things you say and I want to know about what you do mister Blank was obviously flattered I may be round ere agine this arter though I mike no promise See I ve gotter be careful I ave I ve gotter be careful oo sees me an oo ears me and where I go That s the worst of aving no ears See William did not see but he was thrilled to the soul by the mystery An you don t tell no one you seen me nor nothing abart me went on mister Blank Pulling his cap still farther over his head mister Blank set off unsteadily down the road leaving William to pay for his lemonade with his last penny He walked home his heart set firmly on a lawless career of crime Opposition he expected from his father and mother and Robert and Ethel but his determination was fixed He wondered if it would be very painful to have his ears cut off He entered the dining room with an air of intense mystery pulling his cap over his eyes and looking round in a threatening manner William what do you mean by coming into the house in your cap Take it off at once William sighed He wondered if mister Blank had a mother When he returned he sat down and began quietly to remodel his life He would not be an explorer after all nor an engine driver nor chimney sweep He would be a man of mystery a murderer fighter forger He fingered his ears tentatively They seemed fixed on jolly fast He glanced with utter contempt at his father who had just come in His father s life of blameless respectability seemed to him at that minute utterly despicable The Wilkinsons over at Todfoot have had their house broken into now missus Brown was saying All her jewellery gone They think it s a gang It s just the villages round here There seems to be one every day William expressed his surprise Oh ell he ejaculated with a slightly self conscious air mister Brown turned round and looked at his son May I ask he said politely where you picked up that expression I got it off one of my fren s said William with quiet pride Then I d take it as a personal favour went on mister Brown if you d kindly refrain from airing your friends vocabularies in this house He means you re never to say it again William translated missus Brown sternly Never All right said William I won t See I da jolly well won t Strike me pink See He departed with an air of scowling mystery and dignity combined leaving his parents speechless with amazement That afternoon he returned to the White Lion mister Blank was standing unobtrusively in the shadow of the wall Ello young gent he greeted William nice dorg you ve got William looked proudly down at Jumble You won t find he said proudly and with some truth you won t find another dog like this not for miles Will e be much good as a watch dog now asked mister Blank carelessly Good said William almost indignant at the question There isn t any sort of dog he isn t good at Umph said mister Blank looking at him thoughtfully Tell me about things you ve done said William earnestly Yus I will too said mister Blank But jus you tell me first oo lives at all these ere nice ouses an all about em See Illustration WILLIAM DEPARTED WITH AN AIR OF SCOWLING MYSTERY LEAVING HIS PARENTS SPEECHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT William readily complied and the strange couple gradually wended their way along the road towards William s house William stopped at the gate and considered deeply He was torn between instincts of hospitality and a dim suspicion that his family would not afford to mister Blank that courtesy which is a guest s due He looked at mister Blank s old green black cap long untidy hair dirty lined sly old face muddy clothes and gaping boots and decided quite finally that his mother would not allow him in her drawing room Will you he said tentatively will you come roun an see our back garden If we go behind these ole bushes and keep close along the wall no one ll see us To William s relief mister Blank did not seem to resent the suggestion of secrecy They crept along the wall in silence except for Jumble who loudly worried mister Blank s trailing boot strings as he walked They reached a part of the back garden that was not visible from the house and sat down together under a shady tree P raps began mister Blank politely you could bring a bit o tea out to me on the quiet like I ll ask mother began William Oh no said mister Blank modestly I don t want ter give no one no trouble Just a slice o bread if you can find it without troublin no one See William had a brilliant idea Let s go cross to that window an get in he said eagerly That s the lib ry and no one uses it cept father and he s not in till later mister Blank insisted on tying Jumble up then he swung himself dexterously through the window William gave a gasp of admiration You did that fine he said Again mister Blank closed one eye Not the first time I ve got in at a winder young gent nor the larst I bet Not by a long way See William followed more slowly His eye gleamed with pride This hero of romance and adventure was now his guest under his roof Make yourself quite at home mister Blank he said with an air of intense politeness mister Blank did He emptied mister Brown s cigar box into his pocket He drank three glasses of mister Brown s whiskey and soda While William s back was turned he filled his pockets with the silver ornaments from the mantel piece He began to inspect the drawers in mister Brown s desk Then Illustration mister BLANK MADE HIMSELF QUITE AT HOME William Come to tea You stay here whispered William I ll bring you some But luck was against him It was a visitors tea in the drawing room and missus de Vere Carter a neighbour there in all her glory She rose from her seat with an ecstatic murmur Willie Dear child Sweet little soul With one arm she crushed the infuriated William against her belt with the other she caressed his hair Then William in moody silence sat down in a corner and began to eat bread and butter Every time he prepared to slip a piece into his pocket he found his mother s or missus de Vere Carter s eye fixed upon him and hastily began to eat it himself He sat miserable and hot seeing only the heroic figure starving in the next room and planned a raid on the larder as soon as he could reasonably depart Every now and then he scowled across at missus de Vere Carter and made a movement with his hands as though pulling a cap over his eyes He invested even his eating with an air of dark mystery Then Robert his elder brother came in followed by a thin pale man with eye glasses and long hair This is mister Lewes mother said Robert with an air of pride and triumph He s editor of Fiddle Strings There was an immediate stir and sensation Robert had often talked of his famous friend In fact Robert s family was weary of the sound of his name but this was the first time Robert had induced him to leave the haunts of his genius to visit the Brown household mister Lewes bowed with a set stern self conscious expression as though to convey to all that his celebrity was more of a weight than a pleasure to him missus de Vere Carter bridled and fluttered for Fiddle Strings had a society column and a page of scrappy News of the Town and missus de Vere Carter s greatest ambition was to see her name in print mister Lewes sat back in his chair took his tea cup as though it were a fresh addition to his responsibilities and began to talk He talked apparently without even breathing He began on the weather drifted on to art and music and was just beginning a monologue on The Novel when William rose and crept from the room like a guilty spirit He found mister Blank under the library table having heard a noise in the kitchen and fearing a visitor A cigar and a silver snuffer had fallen from his pocket to the floor He hastily replaced them William went up and took another look at the wonderful ears and heaved a sigh of relief While parted from his strange friend he had had a horrible suspicion that the whole thing was a dream I ll go to the larder and get you sumthin he said You jus stay here I think young gent said mister Blank I think I ll just go an look round upstairs on the quiet like an you needn t mention it to no one See Again he performed the fascinating wink They crept on tiptoe into the hall but the drawing room door was ajar William William s heart stood still He could hear his mother coming across the room then she stood in the doorway Her face filled with horror as her eye fell upon mister Blank William she said William s feelings were beyond description Desperately he sought for an explanation for his friend s presence With what pride and sang froid had Robert announced his uninvited guest William determined to try it at any rate He advanced boldly into the drawing room This is mister Blank mother he announced jauntily He hasn t got no ears mister Blank stood in the background awaiting developments Flight was now impossible The announcement fell flat There was nothing but horror upon the five silent faces that confronted William He made a last desperate effort He s bin in the war he pleaded He s killed folks Then the unexpected happened missus de Vere Carter rose with a smile of welcome In her mind s eye she saw the touching story already in print the tattered hero the gracious lady the age of Democracy The stage was laid and that dark pale young man had only to watch and listen Ah one of our dear heroes My poor brave man A cup of tea my dear turning to William s thunderstruck mother And he may sit down may he not She kept her face well turned towards the sardonic looking mister Lewes He must not miss a word or gesture How proud we are to do anything for our dear heroes Wounded perhaps Ah poor man She floated across to him with a cup of tea and plied him with bread and butter and cake William sat down meekly on a chair looking rather pale mister Blank whose philosophy was to take the goods the gods gave and not look to the future began to make a hearty meal Are you looking for work my poor man asked missus de Vere Carter leaning forward in her chair Her poor man replied with simple manly directness that he was dam d if he was See mister Lewes began to discuss The Drama with Robert missus de Vere Carter raised her voice How you must have suffered Yes there is suffering ingrained in your face A piece of shrapnel Ten inches square Right in at one hip and out at the other Oh my poor man How I feel for you How all class distinctions vanish at such a time How Illustration ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WORK MY POOR MAN ASKED missus DE VERE CARTER She stopped while mister Blank drank his tea In fact all conversation ceased while mister Blank drank his tea just as conversation on a station ceases while a train passes through missus Brown looked helplessly around her When mister Blank had eaten a plate of sandwiches a plate of bread and butter and half a cake he rose slowly keeping one hand over the pocket in which reposed the silver ornaments Well m he said touching his cap Thank you kindly I ve ad a fine tea I ave A dam fine tea An I ll not forget yer kindness to a pore ole soldier Here he winked brazenly at William An good day ter you orl missus de Vere Carter floated out to the front door with him and William followed as in a dream missus Brown found her voice We d better have the chair disinfected she murmured to Ethel Then missus de Vere Carter returned smiling to herself and eyeing the young editor surmisingly I witnessed a pretty scene the other day in a suburban drawing room It might begin like that William followed the amazing figure round the house again to the library window Here it turned to him with a friendly grin I m just goin to ave that look round upstairs now See he said An once more yer don t need ter say nothin to no one See With the familiar beloved gesture he drew his old cap down over his eyes and was gone William wandered upstairs a few minutes later to find his visitor standing at the landing window his pockets bulging I m goin to try this ere window young gent he said in a quick business like voice I see yer pa coming in at the front gate Give me a shove Quick nar mister Brown entered the drawing room Mulroyd s had his house burgled now he said Every bit of his wife s jewellery gone They ve got some clues though It s a gang all right and one of them is a chap without ears Grows his hair long to hide it But it s a clue The police are hunting for him He looked in amazement at the horror stricken faces before him missus Brown sat down weakly Ethel my smelling salts They re on the mantel piece Robert grew pale Good Lord my silver cricket cup he gasped racing upstairs The landing window had been too small and mister Blank too big though William did his best There came to the astounded listeners the sound of a fierce scuffle then Robert descended his hair rumpled and his tie awry holding William by the arm William looked pale and apprehensive He was there panted Robert just getting out of the window He chucked the things out of his pockets and got away I couldn t stop him And and William was there William s face assumed the expression of one who is prepared for the worst The plucky little chap Struggling with him Trying to pull him back from the window All by himself I wasn t cried William excitedly I was helping him He s my friend I But they heard not a word They crowded round him praised him shook hands with him asked if he was hurt missus de Vere Carter kept up one perpetual scream of delight and congratulation The dear boy The little pet How brave What courage What an example to us all And the horrid wretched man Posing as a hero Wangling himself into the sweet child s confidence Are you hurt my precious Did the nasty man hurt you You darling boy When the babel had somewhat subsided mister Brown came forward and laid a hand on William s shoulder I m very pleased with you my boy he said You can buy anything you like to morrow up to five shillings William s bewildered countenance cleared Thank you father he said meekly CHAPTER IV THE KNIGHT AT ARMS
2598_4654_000001_000000	train-clean-360	 A knight said Miss Drew who was struggling to inspire her class with enthusiasm for Tennyson s Idylls of the King a knight was a person who spent his time going round succouring the oppressed 
2598_4654_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Suckin wot said William bewildered 
none	none	Succour means to help He spent his time helping anyone who was in trouble
2598_4654_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 How much did he get for it asked William 
2598_4654_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing of course said Miss Drew appalled by the base commercialism of the twentieth century 
none	none	He helped the poor because he loved them William 
2598_4654_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He had a lot of adventures and fighting and he helped beautiful persecuted damsels 
2598_4654_000006_000000	train-clean-360	William s respect for the knight rose 
none	none	Of course said Miss Drew hastily they needn t necessarily be beautiful but in most of the stories we have they were beautiful Followed some stories of fighting and adventure and the rescuing of beautiful damsels The idea of the thing began to take hold of William s imagination I say he said to his chum Ginger after school that knight thing sounds all right 
2598_4654_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Suckin I mean helpin people an fightin an all that 
none	none	I wun t mind doin it an you could be my squire Yes said Ginger slowly I d thought of doin it but I d thought of you bein the squire
2598_4654_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said William after a pause let s be squires in turn 
2598_4654_000011_000001	train-clean-360	You first he added hastily 
none	none	Wot ll you give me if I m first said Ginger displaying again the base commercialism of his age William considered I ll give you first drink out of a bottle of ginger ale wot I m goin to get with my next money 
2598_4654_000014_000001	train-clean-360	It ll be three weeks off cause they re takin the next two weeks to pay for an ole window wot my ball slipped into by mistake 
2598_4654_000015_000000	train-clean-360	He spoke with the bitterness that always characterised his statements of the injustice of the grown up world 
2598_4654_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 All right said Ginger 
2598_4654_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I won t forget about the drink of ginger ale 
none	none	No you won t said Ginger simply I ll remind you all right 
2598_4654_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Well let s set off 
none	none	Course said William it would be nicer with armour an horses an trumpets but I spect folks ud think anyone a bit soft wot went about in the streets in armour now cause these times is different She said so 
2598_4654_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Anyway she said we could still be knights an help people di n t she 
2598_4654_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Anyway I ll get my bugle 
none	none	That ll be something 
2598_4654_000020_000000	train-clean-360	William s bugle had just returned to public life after one of its periodic terms of retirement into his father s keeping 
2598_4654_000021_000000	train-clean-360	William took his bugle proudly in one hand and his pistol the glorious result of a dip in the bran tub at a school party in the other and sternly denying themselves the pleasures of afternoon school off the two set upon the road of romance and adventure 
2598_4654_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll carry the bugle said Ginger cause I m squire 
2598_4654_000023_000000	train-clean-360	William was loth to give up his treasure 
none	none	Well I ll carry it now he said but when I begin fightin folks I ll give it you to hold 
2598_4654_000025_000000	train-clean-360	They walked along for about a mile without meeting anyone 
none	none	William began to be aware of a sinking feeling in the region of his waist I wonder wot they eat he said at last I m gettin so s I wouldn t mind sumthin to eat We di n t ought to have set off before dinner said the squire with after the event wisdom We ought to have waited till after dinner You ought to have brought sumthin said William severely
2598_4654_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 You re the squire 
2598_4654_000028_000002	train-clean-360	You re not much of a squire not to have brought sumthin for me to eat 
none	none	An me put in Ginger If I d brought any I d have brought it for me more n for you William fingered his minute pistol If we meet any wild animals he said darkly A cow gazed at them mournfully over a hedge
2598_4654_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You might go an milk that suggested William 
none	none	Milk ud be better n nothing You go an milk it
2598_4654_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 No I m not squire 
2598_4654_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I bet squires did the milkin 
none	none	Knights wu n t of done the milkin I ll remember said Ginger bitterly when you re squire all the things wot you said a squire ought to do when I was squire They entered the field and gazed at the cow from a respectful distance 
2598_4654_000037_000001	train-clean-360	She turned her eyes upon them sadly 
2598_4654_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Go on said the knight to his reluctant squire 
none	none	I m not good at cows objected that gentleman
2598_4654_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I will then said William with reckless bravado and advanced boldly upon the animal 
none	none	The animal very slightly lowered its horns perhaps in sign of greeting and emitted a sonorous mo o o o o 
2598_4654_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Like lightning the gallant pair made for the road 
none	none	Anyway said William gloomily we d got nothin to put it in so we d only of got tossed for nothin p raps if we d gone on 
2598_4654_000042_000000	train-clean-360	They walked on down the road till they came to a pair of iron gates and a drive that led up to a big house 
none	none	William s spirits rose 
2598_4654_000042_000002	train-clean-360	His hunger was forgotten 
none	none	Come on he said We might find someone to rescue here 
2598_4654_000043_000002	train-clean-360	It looks like a place where there might be someone to rescue 
none	none	There was no one in the garden to question the right of entry of two small boys armed with a bugle and a toy pistol 
2598_4654_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Unchallenged they went up to the house 
none	none	While the knight was wondering whether to blow his bugle at the front door or by the open window they caught sight suddenly of a vision inside the window It was a girl as fair and slim and beautiful as any wandering knight could desire 
2598_4654_000044_000004	train-clean-360	And she was speaking fast and passionately 
2598_4654_000045_000000	train-clean-360	William ready for all contingencies marshalled his forces 
2598_4654_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Follow me he whispered and crept on all fours nearer the window They could see a man now an elderly man with white hair and a white beard 
none	none	And how long will you keep me in this vile prison she was saying in a voice that trembled with anger base wretch that you are
2598_4654_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Crumbs ejaculated William 
none	none	Ha Ha sneered the man I have you in my power I will keep you here a prisoner till you sign the paper which will make me master of all your wealth and beware girl if you do not sign you may answer for it with your life

2598_4654_000058_000001	train-clean-360	William quivered with excitement 
none	none	The man went along a path through the bushes William and Ginger followed on all fours with elaborate caution At every almost inaudible sound from Ginger William turned his red frowning face on to him with a resounding Sh The path ended at a small shed with a locked door The man opened the door the key stood in the lock and entered Promptly William with a snarl expressive of cunning and triumph hurled himself at the door and turned the key in the lock
2598_4654_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Here came an angry shout from inside

none	none	Miss Priscilla Greene was pouring out tea in the drawing room Two young men and a maiden were the recipients of her hospitality Dad will be here in a minute she said He s just gone to the dark room to see to some photos he d left in toning or fixing or something We ll get on with the rehearsal as soon as he comes We d just rehearsed the scene he and I have together so we re ready for the ones where we all come in

2598_4654_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh let me go Miss Greene said one of the youths ardently

none	none	We use half as a dark room and half as a coal cellar I ll go He stopped A nightmare sound as discordant as it was ear splitting filled the room 
2598_4654_000081_000002	train-clean-360	Miss Greene sank back into her chair suddenly white One of the young men let a cup of tea fall neatly from his fingers on to the floor and there crash into fragments 
2598_4654_000081_000003	train-clean-360	The young lady visitor emitted a scream that would have done credit to a factory siren 
2598_4654_000081_000004	train-clean-360	Then at the open French window appeared a small boy holding a bugle purple faced with the effort of his performance 
none	none	One of the young men was the first to recover speech He stepped away from the broken crockery on the floor as if to disclaim all responsibility for it and said sternly
2598_4654_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you make that horrible noise 
2598_4654_000084_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Greene began to laugh hysterically 
2598_4654_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Do have some tea now you ve come she said to Ginger 
2598_4654_000086_000000	train-clean-360	Ginger remembered the pangs of hunger of which excitement had momentarily rendered him oblivious and deciding that there was no time like the present took a cake from the stand and began to consume it in silence 
none	none	You d better be careful said the young lady to her hostess he might have escaped from the asylum 
2598_4654_000087_000001	train-clean-360	He looks mad

2598_4654_000092_000000	train-clean-360	Nothing loth Ginger selected an ornate pyramid of icing 
2598_4654_000093_000000	train-clean-360	At this point there came a bellowing and crashing and tramping outside and Miss Priscilla s father roaring fury and threats of vengeance hurled himself into the room 
none	none	Miss Priscilla s father had made his escape by a small window at the other end of the shed To do this he had had to climb over the coals in the dark His face and hands and clothes and once white beard were covered with coal His eyes gleamed whitely Illustration HE S GOT OUT WILLIAM SAID REPROACHFULLY WHY DI N T SOMEONE STOP HIM GETTIN OUT
2598_4654_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 An abominable attack utterly unprovoked dastardly ruffians

none	none	Look at him He s got out An all our trouble for nothing Why di n t someone stop him gettin out William and Ginger sat on the railing that separated their houses It s not really much fun bein a knight said William slowly No agreed Ginger You never know when folks is oppressed An anyway wot s one afternoon away from school to make such a fuss about Seems to me from wot father said went on William gloomily you ll have to wait a jolly long time for that drink of ginger ale An expression of dejection came over Ginger s face An you wasn t even ever squire he said 
2598_4654_000103_000001	train-clean-360	Then he brightened 
none	none	They were jolly good cakes wasn t they he said William s lips curved into a smile of blissful reminiscence Jolly good he agreed CHAPTER V WILLIAM S HOBBY Uncle George was William s godfather and he was intensely interested in William s upbringing It was an interest with which William would gladly have dispensed Uncle George s annual visit was to William a purgatory only to be endured by a resolutely philosophic attitude of mind and the knowledge that sooner or later it must come to an end Uncle George had an ideal of what a boy should be and it was a continual grief to him that William fell so short of this ideal But he never relinquished his efforts to make William conform to it His ideal was a gentle boy of exquisite courtesy and of intellectual pursuits Such a boy he could have loved It was hard that fate had endowed him with a godson like William William was neither quiet nor gentle nor courteous nor intellectual but William was intensely human The length of Uncle George s visit this year was beginning to reach the limits of William s patience He was beginning to feel that sooner or later something must happen For five weeks now he had reluctantly accompanied Uncle George upon his morning walk he had generally unsuccessfully tried to maintain that state of absolute quiet that Uncle George s afternoon rest required he had in the evening listened wearily to Uncle George s stories of his youth His usual feeling of mild contempt for Uncle George was beginning to give way to one which was much stronger Now William said Uncle George at breakfast I m afraid it s going to rain to day so we ll do a little work together this morning shall we Nothing like work is there Your Arithmetic s a bit shaky isn t it We ll rub that up We love our work don t we William eyed him coldly I don t think I d better get muddlin up my school work he said I shouldn t like to be more on than the other boys next term It wouldn t be fair to them Uncle George rubbed his hands That feeling does you credit my boy he said but if we go over some of the old work no harm can be done History now There s nothing like History is there William agreed quite heartily that there wasn t We ll do some History then said Uncle George briskly The lives of the great Most inspiring Better than those terrible things you used to waste your time on eh The terrible things had included a trumpet a beloved motor hooter and an ingenious instrument very dear to William s soul that reproduced most realistically the sound of two cats fighting These at Uncle George s request had been confiscated by William s father Uncle George had not considered them educational They also disturbed his afternoon s rest Uncle George settled himself and William down for a nice quiet morning in the library William looking round for escape found none The outside world was wholly uninviting The rain came down in torrents Moreover the five preceding weeks had broken William s spirits He realised the impossibility of evading Uncle George His own family were not sympathetic They suffered from him considerably during the rest of the year and were not sorry to see him absorbed completely by Uncle George s conscientious zeal So Uncle George seated himself slowly and ponderously in an arm chair by the fire When I was a boy William he began leaning back and joining the tips of his fingers together I loved my studies I m sure you love your studies don t you Which do you love most Me said William I like shootin and playin Red Injuns Yes yes said Uncle George impatiently but those aren t studies William You must aim at being gentle It s not much good bein gentle when you re playin Red Injuns said William stoutly A gentle Red Injun wun t get much done Ah but why play Red Indians said Uncle George A nasty rough game No we ll talk about History You must mould your character upon that of the great heroes William You must be a Clive a Napoleon a Wolfe I ve often been a wolf said William That game s nearly as good as Red Injuns An Bears is a good game too We might have Bears here he went on brightening Jus you an me Would you sooner be bear or hunter I d sooner be hunter he hinted gently You misunderstand said Uncle George I mean Wolfe the man Wolfe the hero William who had little patience with heroes who came within the school curriculum relapsed into gloom What lessons do we learn from such names my boy went on Uncle George William was on the floor behind Uncle George s chair endeavouring to turn a somersault in a very restricted space History lessons an dates an things he said shortly An the things they spect you to remember he added with disgust No no said Uncle George but the fire was hot and his chair was comfortable and his educational zeal was dying away to endure the buffets of fate with equanimity to smile at misfortune to endure whatever comes and so on He stopped suddenly William had managed the somersault but it had somehow brought his feet into collision with Uncle George s neck Uncle George sleepily shifted his position Illustration WILLIAM WAS ON THE FLOOR BEHIND UNCLE GEORGE S CHAIR ENDEAVOURING TO TURN A SOMERSAULT IN A VERY RESTRICTED SPACE Boisterous Boisterous he murmured disapprovingly You should combine the gentleness of a Moore with the courage of a Wellington William William now perceived that Uncle George s eyelids were drooping slowly and William s sudden statuesque calm would have surprised many of his instructors The silence and the warmth of the room had their effect In less than three minutes Uncle George was dead to the world around him William s form relaxed then he crept up to look closely at the face of his enemy He decided that he disliked it intensely Something must be done at once He looked round the room There were not many weapons handy Only his mother s work box stood on a chair by the window and on it a pile of socks belonging to Robert William s elder brother Beneath either arm of his chair one of Uncle George s coat tails protruded William soon departed on his way rejoicing while on to one of Uncle George s coat tails was firmly stitched a bright blue sock and on to the other a brilliant orange one Robert s taste in socks was decidedly loud William felt almost happy The rain had stopped and he spent the morning with some of his friends whom he met in the road They went bear hunting in the wood and though no bears were found still their disappointment was considerably allayed by the fact that one of them saw a mouse and another one distinctly smelt a rabbit William returned to lunch whistling to himself and had the intense satisfaction of seeing Uncle George enter the dining room obviously roused from his slumbers by the luncheon bell and obviously quite unaware of the blue and orange socks that still adorned his person Curious he ejaculated as Ethel William s grown up sister pointed out the blue sock to him Most curious William departed discreetly muttering something about better tidy up a bit which drew from his sister expressions of surprise and solicitous questions as to his state of health Most curious again said Uncle George who had now discovered the orange sock When William returned all excitement was over and Uncle George was consuming roast beef with energy Ah William he said we must complete the History lesson soon Nothing like History Nothing like History Nothing like History Teaches us to endure the buffets of fate with equanimity and to smile at misfortune Then we must do some Geography William groaned Most fascinating study Rivers mountains cities et cetera Most improving The morning should be devoted to intellectual work at your age William and the afternoon to the quiet pursuit of some improving hobby You would then find the true joy of life To judge from William s countenance he did not wholly agree but he made no objection He had learnt that objection was useless and against Uncle George s eloquence silence was his only weapon After lunch Uncle George followed his usual custom and retired to rest William went to the shed in the back garden and continued the erection of a rabbit hutch that he had begun a few days before He hoped that if he made a hutch Providence would supply a rabbit He whistled blithely as he knocked nails in at random William you mustn t do that now He turned a stern gaze upon his mother Why not he said Uncle George is resting With a crushing glance at her he strolled away from the shed Someone had left the lawn mower in the middle of the lawn With one of his rare impulses of pure virtue he determined to be useful Also he rather liked mowing the grass William don t do that now called his sister from the window Uncle George is resting He deliberately drove the mowing machine into the middle of a garden bed and left it there He was beginning to feel desperate Then What can I do he said bitterly to Ethel who was still at the window You d better find some quiet improving hobby she said unkindly as she went away It is a proof of the utterly broken state of William s spirit that he did actually begin to think of hobbies but none of those that occurred to him interested him Stamp collecting pressed flowers crest collecting Ugh He set off down the road his hands in his pockets and his brows drawn into a stern frown He amused himself by imagining Uncle George in various predicaments lost on a desert island captured by pirates or carried off by an eagle Then something in the window of a house he passed caught his eye and he stopped suddenly It was a stuffed bird under a glass case Now that was something like a hobby stuffing dead animals He wouldn t mind having that for a hobby And it was quite quiet He could do it while Uncle George was resting And it must be quite easy The first thing to do of course was to find a dead animal Any old thing would do to begin on A dead cat or dog He would do bigger ones like bears and lions later on He spent nearly an hour in a fruitless search for a dead cat or dog He searched the ditches on both sides of the road and several gardens He began to have a distinct sense of grievance against the race of cats and dogs in general for not dying in his vicinity At the end of the hour he found a small dead frog It was very dry and shrivelled but it was certainly a dead frog and would do to begin on He took it home in his pocket He wondered what they did first in stuffing dead animals He d heard something about tannin them But what was tannin and how did one get it Then he remembered suddenly having heard Ethel talk about the tannin in tea So that was all right The first thing to do was to get some tea He went to the drawing room It was empty but upon the table near the fire was a tea tray and two cups Evidently his mother and sister had just had tea there He put the frog at the bottom of a cup and carefully filled the cup with tea from the teapot Then he left it to soak and went out into the garden Illustration IN FROZEN SILENCE UNCLE GEORGE PUT A SPOON INTO HIS CUP AND INVESTIGATED THE CONTENTS IN STILL MORE FROZEN SILENCE missus BROWN AND WILLIAM WATCHED A few minutes later William s mother entered the drawing room Uncle George had finished resting and was standing by the mantel piece with a cup in his hand I see you poured out my tea for me he said But rather a curious taste Doubtless you boil the milk now Safer of course Much safer But it imparts a curious flavour He took another sip But I didn t pour out your tea began missus Brown Here William entered He looked quickly at the table Who s meddlin with my frog he said angrily It s my hobby an I m stuffin frogs an someone s been an took my frog I left it on the table On the table said his mother Yes In a cup of tea Gettin tannin You know For stuffin I was puttin him in tannin first I Uncle George grew pale In frozen silence he put a spoon into his cup and investigated the contents In still more frozen silence missus Brown and William watched That moment held all the cumulative horror of a Greek tragedy Then Uncle George put down his cup and went silently from the room On his face was the expression of one who is going to look up the first train home Fate had sent him a buffet he could not endure with equanimity a misfortune at which he could not smile and Fate had avenged William for much CHAPTER VI THE RIVALS William was aware of a vague feeling of apprehension when he heard that Joan Clive the little girl who lived next door was having a strange cousin to stay for three weeks All his life William had accepted Joan s adoration and homage with condescending indifference but he did not like to imagine a possible rival What s he coming for he demanded with an ungracious scowl perched uncomfortably and dangerously on the high wall that separated the two gardens and glaring down at Joan What s he comin for any way Cause mother s invited him explained Joan simply with a shake of her golden curls He s called Cuthbert She says he s a sweet little boy Sweet echoed William in a tone of exaggerated horror Ugh Well said Joan with the smallest note of indignation in her voice you needn t play with him if you don t like Me Play With him scowled William as if he could not believe his ears I m not likely to go playin with a kid like wot he ll be Joan raised aggrieved blue eyes You re a horrid boy sometimes William she said Any way I shall have him to play with soon It was the first time he had received anything but admiration from her He scowled speechlessly Cuthbert arrived the next morning William was restless and ill at ease and several times climbed the ladder for a glimpse of the guest but all he could see was the garden inhabited only by a cat and a gardener He amused himself by throwing stones at the cat till he hit the gardener by mistake and then fled precipitately before a storm of abuse William and the gardener were enemies of very long standing After dinner he went out again into the garden and stood gazing through a chink in the wall Cuthbert was in the garden Though as old and as tall as William he was dressed in an embroidered tunic very short knickers and white socks Over his blue eyes his curls were brushed up into a golden halo He was a picturesque child What shall we do Joan was saying Would you like to play hide and seek No leth not play at rough gameth said Cuthbert With a wild spasm of joy William realised that his enemy lisped It is always well to have a handle against one s enemies What shall we do then said Joan somewhat wearily Leth thit down an I ll tell you fairy thorieth said Cuthbert A loud snort from inside the wall just by his ear startled him and he clutched Joan s arm What th that he said There were sounds of clambering feet on the other side of the wall then William s grimy countenance appeared Hello Joan he said ignoring the stranger Joan s eyes brightened Come and play with us William she begged We don t want dirty little boyth murmured Cuthbert fastidiously William could not with justice have objected to the epithet He had spent the last half hour climbing on to the rafters of the disused coach house and dust and cobwebs adorned his face and hair He s always like that explained Joan carelessly By this time William had thought of a suitable rejoinder All right he jeered don t look at me then Go on tellin fairy thorieth Cuthbert flushed angrily You re a nathty rude little boy he said I ll tell my mother Thus war was declared He came to tea the next day Not all William s pleading could persuade his mother to cancel the invitation Well said William darkly wait till you ve seen him that s all Wait till you ve heard him speakin He can t talk even He can t play He tells fairy stories He don t like dirt He s got long hair an a funny long coat He s awful I tell you I don t want to have him to tea I don t want to be washed an all just because he s comin to tea But as usual William s eloquence availed nothing Several people came to tea that afternoon and there was a sudden silence when missus Clive Joan and Cuthbert entered Cuthbert was in a white silk tunic embroidered with blue he wore white shoes and white silk socks His golden curls shone He looked angelic Oh the darling Isn t he adorable What a picture Come here sweetheart Cuthbert was quite used to this sort of thing They were more delighted than ever with him when they discovered his lisp His manners were perfect He raised his face with a charming smile to be kissed then sat down on the sofa between Joan and missus Clive swinging long bare legs William sitting an unwilling victim on a small chair in a corner of the room brushed and washed till he shone again was conscious of a feeling of fury quite apart from the usual sense of outrage that he always felt upon such an occasion It was bad enough to be washed till the soap went into his eyes and down his ears despite all his protests It was bad enough to have had his hair brushed till his head smarted It was bad enough to be hustled out of his comfortable jersey into his Eton suit which he loathed But to see Joan his Joan sitting next the strange dressed up lisping boy smiling and talking to him that was almost more than he could bear with calmness Previously as has been said he had received Joan s adoration with coldness but previously there had been no rival William said his mother take Joan and Cuthbert and show them your engine and books and things Remember you re the host dear she murmured as he passed Try to make them happy He turned upon her a glance that would have made a stronger woman quail Silently he led them up to his play room There s my engine an my books You can play with them he said coldly to Cuthbert Let s go and play in the garden you and me Joan But Joan shook her head I don t thuppoth the d care to go out without me said Cuthbert airily I ll go with you Thith boy can play here if he liketh And William artist in vituperation as he was could think of no response He followed them into the garden and there came upon him a wild determination to show his superiority You can t climb that tree he began I can said Cuthbert sweetly Well climb it then grimly No I don t want to get my thingth all methed I can climb it but you can t He can t climb it Joan he th trying to pretend he can climb it when he can t He knowth I can climb it but I don t want to get my thingth methed Joan smiled admiringly at Cuthbert I ll show you said William desperately I ll just show you He showed them He climbed till the tree top swayed with his weight then descended hot and triumphant The tree was covered with green lichen a great part of which had deposited itself upon William s suit His efforts also had twisted his collar round till its stud was beneath his ear His heated countenance beamed with pride For a moment Cuthbert was nonplussed Then he said scornfully Don t he look a fright Joan Joan giggled But William was wholly engrossed in his self imposed task of showing them He led them to the bottom of the garden where a small stream now almost dry disappeared into a narrow tunnel to flow under the road and reappear in the field at the other side You can t crawl through that challenged William you can t do it I ve done it done it often I bet you can t I bet you can t get halfway I Well do it then jeered Cuthbert William on all fours disappeared into the mud and slime of the small round aperture Joan clasped her hands and even Cuthbert was secretly impressed They stood in silence At intervals William s muffled voice came from the tunnel It s jolly muddy too I can tell you I ve caught a frog I say I ve caught a frog Crumbs It s got away It s nearly quicksands here If I tried I could nearly drown here At last through the hedge they saw him emerge in the field across the road He swaggered across to them aglow with his own heroism As he entered the gate he was rewarded by the old light of adoration in Joan s blue eyes but on full sight of him it quickly turned to consternation His appearance was beyond description There was a malicious smile on Cuthbert s face Do thumthing elth he urged him Go on do thumthing elth Oh William said Joan anxiously you d better not But the gods had sent madness to William He was drunk with the sense of his own prowess He was regardless of consequences Illustration I CAN CLIMB UP THAT AN SLIDE DOWN THE COAL INSIDE THAT S WHAT I CAN DO THERE S NOTHIN I CAN T DO SAID WILLIAM He pointed to a little window high up in the coal house I can climb up that an slide down the coal inside That s what I can do There s nothin I can t do I All right urged Cuthbert if you can do that do it and I ll believe you can do anything For Cuthbert with unholy glee foresaw William s undoing Oh William pleaded Joan I know you re brave but don t But William was already doing it They saw his disappearance into the little window they heard plainly his descent down the coal heap inside and in less than a minute he appeared in the doorway He was almost unrecognisable Coal dust adhered freely to the moist consistency of the mud and lichen already clinging to his suit as well as to his hair and face His collar had been almost torn away from its stud William himself was smiling proudly utterly unconscious of his appearance Joan was plainly wavering between horror and admiration Then the moment for which Cuthbert had longed arrived Children come in now Cuthbert clean and dainty entered the drawing room first and pointed an accusing finger at the strange figure which followed He th been climbing treeth an crawling in the mud an rolling down the coalth He th a nathty rough boy A wild babel arose as William entered William You dreadful boy Joan come right away from him Come over here What will your father say William my carpet For the greater part of the stream s bed still clung to William s boots Doggedly William defended himself I was showin em how to do things I was bein a host I was tryin to make em happy I William don t stand there talking Go straight upstairs to the bathroom It was the end of the first battle and undoubtedly William had lost Yet William had caught sight of the smile on Cuthbert s face and William had decided that that smile was something to be avenged But fate did not favour him Indeed fate seemed to do the reverse The idea of a children s play did not emanate from William s mother or Joan s They were both free from guilt in that respect It emanated from missus de Vere Carter missus de Vere Carter was a neighbour with a genius for organisation There were few things she did not organise till their every other aspect or aim was lost but that of organisation She also had what amounted practically to a disease for getting up things She got up plays and bazaars and pageants and concerts There were in fact few things she did not get up It was the sight of Joan and Cuthbert walking together down the road the sun shining on their golden curls that had inspired her with the idea of getting up a children s play And Joan must be the Princess and little Cuthbert the Prince missus de Vere Carter was to write the play herself At first she decided on Cinderella Unfortunately there was a dearth of little girls in the neighbourhood and therefore it was decided at a meeting composed of missus de Vere Carter missus Clive missus Brown William s mother and Ethel William s sister that William could easily be dressed up to represent one of the ugly sisters It was however decided at a later meeting consisting of William and his mother and sister that William could not take the part It was William who came to this decision He was adamant against both threats and entreaties Without cherishing any delusions about his personal appearance he firmly declined to play the part of the ugly sister They took the news with deep apologies to missus de Vere Carter who was already in the middle of the first act Her already low opinion of William sank to zero Their next choice was little Red Riding Hood and William was lured by glowing pictures of a realistic costume into consenting to take the part of the Wolf Every day he had to be dragged by some elder and responsible member of his family to a rehearsal His hatred of Cuthbert was only equalled by his hatred of missus de Vere Carter He acts so unnaturally moaned missus de Vere Carter Try really to think you re a wolf darling Put some spirit into it Be animated William scowled at her and once more muttered monotonously his opening lines A wolf am I a wolf on mischief bent To eat this little maid is my intent Take a breath after bent darling Now say it again William complied introducing this time a loud and audible gasp to represent the breath missus de Vere Carter sighed Now Cuthbert darling draw your little sword and put your arm round Joan That s right Cuthbert obeyed and his clear voice rose in a high chanting monotone Avaunt Begone You wicked wolf away This gentle maid shall never be your prey That s beautiful darling Now William slink away Slink away darling Don t stand staring at Cuthbert like that Slink away I ll show you Watch me slink away missus de Vere Carter slunk away realistically and the sight of it brought momentary delight to William s weary soul Otherwise the rehearsals were not far removed from torture to him The thought of being a wolf had at first attracted him but actually a wolf character who had to repeat missus de Vere Carter s meaningless couplets and be worsted at every turn by the smiling Cuthbert who was forced to watch from behind the scenes the fond embraces of Cuthbert and Joan galled his proud spirit unspeakably Moreover Cuthbert monopolised her both before and after the rehearsals Come away Joan he th prob bly all over coal dutht and all of a meth The continued presence of unsympathetic elders prevented his proper avenging of such insults The day of the performance approached and there arose some little trouble about William s costume If the wearing of the dining room hearth rug had been forbidden by Authority it would have at once become the dearest wish of William s heart and a thing to be accomplished at all costs But because Authority decreed that that should be William s official costume as the Wolf William at once began to find insuperable difficulties It s a dirty ole thing all dust and bits of black hair come off it on me I don t think it looks like a wolf Well if I ve gotter be a wolf folks might just as well know what I am This looks like as if it came off a black sheep or sumthin You don t want folks to think I m a sheep stead of a wolf do you You don t want me to be made look ridiclus before all these folks do you He was slightly mollified by their promise to hire a wolf s head for him He practised wolf s howlings though these had no part in missus de Vere Carter s play at night in his room till he drove his family almost beyond the bounds of sanity missus de Vere Carter had hired the Village Hall for the performance and the proceeds were to go to a local charity On the night of the play the Hall was packed and missus de Vere Carter was in a flutter of excitement and importance Yes the dear children are splendid and they look beautiful We ve all worked so hard Yes entirely my own composition I only hope that William Brown won t murder my poetry as he does at rehearsals The curtain went up The scene was a wood as was evident from a few small branches of trees placed here and there at intervals on the stage Joan in a white dress and red cloak entered and began to speak quickly and breathlessly stressing every word with impartial regularity A little maid am I Red Riding Hood My journey lies along this dark thick wood Within my basket is a little jar Of jam a present for my grand mamma Then Cuthbert entered a Prince in white satin with a blue sash There was a rapt murmur of admiration in the audience as he made his appearance William waited impatiently and uneasily behind the scenes His wolf s head was very hot One of the eye holes was beyond his range of vision through the other he had a somewhat prescribed view of what went on around him He had been pinned tightly into the dining room hearth rug his arms pinioned down by his side He was distinctly uncomfortable At last his cue came Red Riding Hood and the Prince parted after a short conversation in which their acquaintance made rapid strides and at the end of which the Prince said casually as he turned to go So sweet a maid have I never seen Ere long I hope to make her my wife and queen Red Riding Hood gazed after him remarking all in the same breath and tone How kind he is how gentle and how good But see what evil beast comes through the wood Here William entered amid wild applause On the stage he found that his one eye hole gave him an excellent view of the audience His mother and father were in the second row Turning his head round slowly he discovered his sister Ethel sitting with a friend near the back William hissed the prompter go on A wolf am I But William was engrossed in the audience There was missus Clive about the middle of the room A wolf am I go on William William had now found the cook and housemaid in the last row of all and was turning his eye hole round in search of fresh discoveries The prompter grew desperate A wolf am I a wolf on mischief bent Say it William William turned his wolf s head towards the wings Well I was goin to say it he said irritably if you d lef me alone The audience tittered Well say it said the voice of the invisible prompter Well I m going to said William I m not goin to say that again wot you said cause they all heard it I ll go on from there The audience rocked in wild delight Behind the scenes missus de Vere Carter wrung her hands and sniffed strong smelling salts That boy she moaned Then William sinking his voice from the indignant clearness with which it had addressed the prompter to a muffled inaudibility continued To eat this little maid is my intent But there leapt on the stage again the radiant white and blue figure of the Prince brandishing his wooden sword Avaunt Begone You wicked wolf away This gentle maid shall never be your prey At this point William should have slunk away But the vision revealed by his one available eye hole of the Prince standing in a threatening attitude with one arm round Joan filled him with a sudden and unaccountable annoyance He advanced slowly and pugnaciously towards the Prince and the Prince who had never before acted with William in his head which was hired for one evening only fled from the stage with a wild yell of fear The curtain was lowered hastily There was consternation behind the scenes William glaring from out his eye hole and refusing to remove his head defended himself in his best manner Well I di n t tell him to run away did I I di n t mean him to run away I only looked at him Well I was goin to slink in a minit I only wanted to look at him I was goin to slink Oh never mind Get on with the play moaned missus de Vere Carter But you ve quite destroyed the atmosphere William You ve spoilt the beautiful story But hurry up it s time for the grandmother s cottage scene now Not a word of William s speeches was audible in the next scene but his attack on and consumption of the aged grandmother was one of the most realistic parts of the play especially considering the fact that his arms were imprisoned Not so roughly William said the prompter in a sibilant whisper Don t make so much noise They can t hear a word anyone s saying At last William was clothed in the nightgown and nightcap and lying in the bed ready for little Red Riding Hood s entrance The combined effect of the rug and the head and the thought of Cuthbert had made him hotter and crosser than he ever remembered having felt before He was conscious of a wild and unreasoning indignation against the world in general Then Joan entered and began to pipe monotonously Dear grandmamma I ve come with all quickness To comfort you and sooth your bed of sickness Here are some little dainties I have brought To show you how we cherish you in our thought Here William wearily rose from his bed and made an unconvincing spring in her direction But on to the stage leapt Cuthbert once more the vision in blue and white with golden curls shining and sword again drawn Ha evil beast It was too much for William The heat and discomfort of his attire the sight of the hated Cuthbert already about to embrace his Joan goaded him to temporary madness With a furious gesture he burst the pins which attached the dining room hearth rug to his person and freed his arms He tore off the white nightgown He sprang at the petrified Cuthbert a small wild figure in a jersey suit and a wolf s head Illustration THE SIGHT OF THE HATED CUTHBERT ABOUT TO EMBRACE HIS JOAN GOADED WILLIAM TO TEMPORARY MADNESS missus de Vere Carter had filled Red Riding Hood s basket with packages of simple groceries which included among other things a paper bag of flour and a jar of jam William seized these wildly and hurled handfuls of flour at the prostrate screaming Cuthbert The stage was suddenly pandemonium The other small actors promptly joined the battle The prompter was too panic stricken to lower the curtain The air was white with clouds of flour The victim scrambled to his feet and fled a ghost like figure round the table Take him off me he yelled Take him off me Take William off me His wailing was deafening The next second he was on the floor with William on top of him William now varied the proceedings by emptying the jar of jam on to Cuthbert s face and hair They were separated at last by the prompter and stage manager while the audience rose and cheered hysterically But louder than the cheering rose the sound of Cuthbert s lamentation He th a nathty rough boy He puthed me down He th methed my nith clotheth Boo hoo missus de Vere Carter was inarticulate That boy that boy that boy was all she could say William was hurried away by his family before she could regain speech You ve disgraced us publicly said missus Brown plaintively I thought you must have gone mad People will never forget it I might have known When pressed for an explanation William would only say Well I felt hot I felt awful hot an I di n t like Cuthbert He appeared to think this sufficient explanation though he was fully prepared for the want of sympathy displayed by his family Well he said firmly I d just like to see you do it I d just like to see you be in the head and that ole rug an have to say stupid things an an see folks you don t like an I bet you d do something But he felt that public feeling was against him and relapsed sadly into silence From the darkness in front of them came the sound of Cuthbert s wailing as missus Clive led her two charges home Poor little Cuthbert said missus Brown If I were Joan I don t think I d ever speak to you again Huh ejaculated William scornfully But at William s gate a small figure slipped out from the darkness and two little arms crept round William s neck Oh William she whispered he s going to morrow and I am glad Isn t he a softie Oh William I do love you you do such citing things CHAPTER VII THE GHOST William lay on the floor of the barn engrossed in a book This was a rare thing with William His bottle of lemonade lay untouched by his side and he even forgot the half eaten apple which reposed in his hand His jaws were arrested midway in the act of munching Our hero he read was awakened about midnight by the sound of the rattling of chains Raising himself on his arm he gazed into the darkness About a foot from his bed he could discern a tall white faintly gleaming figure and a ghostly arm which beckoned him

none	none	Crumbs he ejaculated Nothing perturbed he continued to read our hero rose and followed the spectre through the long winding passages of the old castle Whenever he hesitated a white luminous arm hung around with ghostly chains beckoned him on Gosh murmured the enthralled William I d have bin scared At the panel in the wall the ghost stopped and silently the panel slid aside revealing a flight of stone steps Down this went the apparition followed by our intrepid hero There was a small stone chamber at the bottom and into this the rays of moonlight poured revealing a skeleton in a sitting attitude beside a chest of golden sovereigns The gold gleamed in the moonlight Golly gasped William red with excitement William The cry came from somewhere in the sunny garden outside William frowned sternly took another bite of apple and continued to read Our hero gave a cry of astonishment Yea I d have done that all right agreed William William Oh shut up called William irritably thereby revealing his hiding place His grown up sister Ethel appeared in the doorway Mother wants you she announced Well I can t come I m busy said William coldly taking a draught of lemonade and returning to his book Cousin Mildred s come continued his sister William raised his freckled face from his book Well I can t help that can I he said with the air of one arguing patiently with a lunatic Ethel shrugged her shoulders and departed He s reading some old book in the barn he heard her announce and he says Illustration ETHEL APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY MOTHER WANTS YOU SHE ANNOUNCED Here he foresaw complications and hastily followed her Well I m comin aren t I he said as fast as I can Cousin Mildred was sitting on the lawn She was elderly and very thin and very tall and she wore a curious long shapeless garment of green silk with a golden girdle Dear child she murmured taking the grimy hand that William held out to her in dignified silence He was cheered by the sight of tea and hot cakes Cousin Mildred ate little but talked much I m living in hopes of a psychic revelation dear she said to William s mother In hopes I ve heard of wonderful experiences but so far none alas have befallen me Automatic writing I have tried but any communication the spirits may have sent me that way remained illegible quite illegible She sighed William eyed her with scorn while he consumed reckless quantities of hot cakes I would love to have a psychic revelation she sighed again Yes dear murmured missus Brown mystified William you ve had enough Enough said William in surprise Why I ve only had He decided hastily against exact statistics and in favour of vague generalities I ve only had hardly any he said aggrievedly You ve had enough anyway said missus Brown firmly The martyr rose pale but proud Well can I go then if I can t have any more tea There s plenty of bread and butter I don t want bread and butter he said scornfully Dear child murmured Cousin Mildred vaguely as he departed He returned to the story and lemonade and apple and stretched himself happily at full length in the shady barn But the ghostly visitant seemed to be fading away and with a soft sigh was gone Our hero with a start of surprise realised that he was alone with the gold and the skeleton For the first time he experienced a thrill of cold fear and slowly retreated up the stairs before the hollow and as it seemed vindictive stare of the grinning skeleton I wonder wot he was grinnin at said William But to his horror the door was shut the panel had slid back He had no means of opening it He was imprisoned on a remote part of the castle where even the servants came but rarely and at intervals of weeks Would his fate be that of the man whose bones gleamed white in the moonlight Crumbs said William earnestly Then a shadow fell upon the floor of the barn and Cousin Mildred s voice greeted him So you re here dear I m just exploring your garden and thinking I like to be alone I see that you are the same dear child I m readin said William with icy dignity Dear boy Won t you come and show me the garden and your favourite nooks and corners William looked at her thin vague amiable face and shut his book with a resigned sigh All right he said laconically He conducted her in patient silence round the kitchen garden and the shrubbery She looked sadly at the house with its red brick uncompromisingly modern appearance William I wish your house was old she said sadly William resented any aspersions on his house from outsiders Personally he considered newness in a house an attraction but if anyone wished for age then old his house should be Old he ejaculated Huh I guess it s old enough Oh is it she said delighted Restored recently I suppose Umph agreed William nodding Oh I m so glad I may have some psychic revelation here then Oh yes said William judicially I shouldn t wonder William have you ever had one Well said William guardedly I dunno His mysterious manner threw her into a transport Of course not to anyone But to me I m one of the sympathetic To me you may speak freely William William feeling that his ignorance could no longer be hidden by words maintained a discreet silence To me it shall be sacred William I will tell no one not even your parents I believe that children see clouds of glory and all that vaguely With your unstained childish vision I m eleven put in William indignantly You see things that to the wise are sealed Some manifestation some spirit some ghostly visitant Oh said William suddenly enlightened you talkin about ghosts Yes ghosts William Her air of deference flattered him She evidently expected great things of him Great things she should have At the best of times with William imagination was stronger than cold facts He gave a short laugh Oh ghosts Yes I ve seen some of em I guess I have Her face lit up Will you tell me some of your experiences William she said humbly Well said William loftily you won t go talkin about it will you Oh no Well I ve seen em you know Chains an all And skeletons And ghostly arms beckonin an all that William was enjoying himself He walked with a swagger He almost believed what he said She gasped Oh go on she said Tell me all He went on He soared aloft on the wings of imagination his hands in his pockets his freckled face puckered up in frowning mental effort He certainly enjoyed himself If only some of it could happen to me breathed his confidante Does it come to you at nights William Yes nodded William Nights mostly I shall watch to night said Cousin Mildred And you say the house is old Awful old said William reassuringly Her attitude to William was a relief to the rest of the family Visitors sometimes objected to William She seems to have almost taken to William said his mother with a note of unflattering incredulity in her voice William was pleased yet embarrassed by her attentions It was a strange experience to him to be accepted by a grown up as a fellow being She talked to him with interest and a certain humility she bought him sweets and seemed pleased that he accepted them she went for walks with him and evidently took his constrained silence for the silence of depth and wisdom Beneath his embarrassment he was certainly pleased and flattered She seemed to prefer his company to that of Ethel That was one in the eye for Ethel But he felt that something was expected from him in return for all this kindness and attention William was a sportsman He decided to supply it He took a book of ghost stories from the juvenile library at school and read them in the privacy of his room at night Many were the thrilling adventures which he had to tell to Cousin Mildred in the morning Cousin Mildred s bump of credulity was a large one She supplied him with sweets on a generous scale She listened to him with awe and wonder William you are one of the elect the chosen she said one of those whose spirits can break down the barrier between the unseen world and ours with ease And always she sighed and stroked back her thin locks sadly Oh how I wish that some experience would happen to me One morning after the gift of an exceptionally large tin of toffee William s noblest feelings were aroused Manfully he decided that something should happen to her Cousin Mildred slept in the bedroom above William s Descent from one window to the other was easy but ascent was difficult That night Cousin Mildred awoke suddenly as the clock struck twelve There was no moon and only dimly did she discern the white figure that stood in the light of the window She sat up quivering with eagerness Her short thin little pigtail stuck out horizontally from her head Her mouth was wide open Illustration SHE SAT UP QUIVERING WITH EAGERNESS HER SHORT THIN LITTLE PIGTAIL STUCK OUT HORIZONTALLY FROM HER HEAD HER MOUTH WAS WIDE OPEN Oh she gasped The white figure moved a step forward and coughed nervously Cousin Mildred clasped her hands Speak she said in a tense whisper Oh speak Some message Some revelation William was nonplussed None of the ghosts he had read of had spoken They had rattled and groaned and beckoned but they had not spoken He tried groaning and emitted a sound faintly reminiscent of a sea sick voyager Oh speak pleaded Cousin Mildred Evidently speech was a necessary part of this performance William wondered whether ghosts spoke English or a language of their own He inclined to the latter view and nobly took the plunge Honk Yonk Ponk he said firmly Cousin Mildred gasped in wonder Oh explain she pleaded ardently Explain in our poor human speech Some message William took fright It was all turning out to be much more complicated than he had expected He hastily passed through the room and out of the door closing it noisily behind him As he ran along the passage came a sound like a crash of thunder Outside in the passage were Cousin Mildred s boots William s father s boots and William s brother s boots and into these charged William in his headlong retreat They slid noisily along the polished wooden surface of the floor ricochetting into each other as they went Doors opened suddenly and William s father collided with William s brother in the dark passage where they wrestled fiercely before they discovered each other s identity I heard that confounded noise and I came out So did I Well then who made it Who did If it s that wretched boy up to any tricks again William s father left the sentence unfinished but went with determined tread towards his younger son s room William was discovered carefully spreading a sheet over his bed and smoothing it down mister Brown roused from his placid slumbers was a sight to make a brave man quail but the glance that William turned upon him was guileless and sweet Did you make that confounded row kicking boots about the passage spluttered the man of wrath No Father said William gently I ve not bin kickin no boots about Were you down on the lower landing just now said mister Brown with compressed fury William considered this question silently for a few seconds then spoke up brightly and innocently I dunno Father You see some folks walk in their sleep and when they wake up they dunno where they ve bin Why I ve heard of a man walkin down a fire escape in his sleep and then he woke up and couldn t think how he d got to be there where he was You see he didn t know he d walked down all them steps sound asleep and Be quiet thundered his father What in the name of what on earth are you doing making your bed in the middle of the night Are you insane William perfectly composed tucked in one end of his sheet No Father I m not insane My sheet just fell off me in the night and I got out to pick it up I must of bin a bit restless I suppose Sheets come off easy when folks is restless in bed and they don t know anythin about it till they wake up jus same as sleep walkin Why I ve heard of folks Be quiet At that moment William s mother arrived placid as ever in her dressing gown carrying a candle Look at him said mister Brown pointing at the meek looking William He plays Rugger up and down the passage with the boots all night and then he begins to make his bed He s mad He s William turned his calm gaze upon him I wasn t playin Rugger with the boots Father he said patiently missus Brown laid her hand soothingly upon her husband s arm You know dear she said gently a house is always full of noises at night Basket chairs creaking mister Brown s face grew purple Basket chairs he exploded violently but allowed himself to be led unresisting from the room William finished his bed making with his usual frown of concentration then lying down fell at once into the deep sleep of childish innocence But Cousin Mildred was lying awake a blissful smile upon her lips She too was now one of the elect the chosen Her rather deaf ears had caught the sound of supernatural thunder as her ghostly visitant departed and she had beamed with ecstatic joy Honk she murmured dreamily Honk Yonk Ponk William felt rather tired the next evening Cousin Mildred had departed leaving him a handsome present of a large box of chocolates William had consumed these with undue haste in view of possible maternal interference His broken night was telling upon his spirits He felt distinctly depressed and saw the world through jaundiced eyes He sat in the shrubbery his chin in his hand staring moodily at the adoring mongrel Jumble It s a rotten world he said gloomily I ve took a lot of trouble over her and she goes and makes me feel sick with chocolates Jumble wagged his tail sympathetically CHAPTER VIII THE MAY KING William was frankly bored School always bored him He disliked facts and he disliked being tied down to detail and he disliked answering questions As a politician a great future would have lain before him William attended a mixed school because his parents hoped that feminine influence might have a mellowing effect upon his character As yet the mellowing was not apparent He was roused from his day dreams by a change in the voice of Miss Dewhurst his form mistress It was evident that she was not talking about the exports of England a subject in which William took little interest any longer Children she said brightly I want to have a little May Queen for the first of May The rest of you must be her courtiers I want you all to vote to morrow Put down on a piece of paper the name of the little girl you think would make the sweetest little Queen and the rest of you shall be her swains and maidens We re goin to have a May Queen remarked William to his family at dinner an I m goin to be a swain His interest died down considerably when he discovered the meaning of the word swain Isn t it no sort of animal at all he asked indignantly Well I m not going to be in it then he said when he heard that it was not The next morning Evangeline Fish began to canvass for votes methodically Evangeline Fish was very fair and was dressed always in that shade of blue that shrieks aloud to the heavens and puts the skies to shame She was considered the beauty of the form I ll give you two bull s eyes if you ll vote for me she said to William Two said William with scorn Six she bargained All right he said you can give me six bull s eyes if you want There s nothing to stop you givin me six bull s eyes if you want is there Not that I know of But you ll have to promise to put down my name on the paper if I give you six bull s eyes she said suspiciously All right said William I can easy promise that Whereupon she handed over the six bull s eyes William returned one as being under regulation size and waited frowning till she replaced it by a larger one Now you ve promised said Evangeline Fish They ll make you ill an die if you break your promise on them William kept his promise with true political address He wrote E Fish I don t think on his voting paper and his vote was disqualified But Evangeline Fish was elected May Queen by an overwhelming majority She was after all the beauty of the form and she always wore blue And now she was to be May Queen Her prestige was established for ever Little angel murmured the elder girls The small boys fought for her favours William began to dislike her intensely Her voice and her smile and her ringlets and her blue dress began to jar upon his nerves And when anything began to jar on William s nerves something always happened It was not till about a week later that he noticed Bettine Franklin Bettine was small and dark There was nothing angelic about her William had noticed her vaguely in school before and had hardly looked upon her as a distinct personality But one recreation in the playground he stood leaning against the wall by himself scowling at Evangeline Fish She was surrounded by a crowd of admirers and was prattling to them artlessly in her angelic voice I m going to be dressed in white muslin with a blue sash Blue suits me you know I m so fair She tossed back a ringlet One of you will have to hold my train and the rest must dance round me I m going to have a crown and She turned round in order to avoid the scowling gaze of William in the distance William had discovered that his scowl annoyed her and since then had given it little rest But there was no satisfaction in scowling at the back of her well curled head so he relaxed his scowl and let his gaze wander round the playground And it fell upon Bettine Bettine was also standing by herself and gazing at Evangeline Fish But she was not scowling She was looking at Evangeline Fish with wistful envy For Evangeline Fish was angelic and a May Queen and she was neither of these things William strolled over and lolled against the wall next to her Ullo he said without looking at her for this change of position had brought him again within range of Evangeline Fish s eye and he was once more simply one concentrated scowl Ullo murmured Bettine shyly and politely You like pink rock was William s next effort Um said Bettine nodding emphatically I ll give you some next time I buy some said William munificently but I shan t be buying any for a long time he added bitterly cause an ole ball slipped out my hands on to our dining room window before I noticed it yesterday She nodded understandingly I don t mind she said sweetly I ll like you jus as much if you don t ever give me any rock William blushed I di n t know you liked me he said I do she said fervently I like your face an I like the things you say William had forgotten to scowl He was one flaming mixture of embarrassment and delight He plunged his hands into his pockets and brought out two marbles a piece of clay and a broken toy gun You can have em all he said in reckless generosity You keep em for me said Bettine sweetly I hope you dance next me at the Maypole when Evangeline s Queen Won t it be lovely and she sighed Lovely exploded William Huh Won t you like it said Bettine wonderingly Me exploded William again Dancin round a pole Round that ole girl But she s so pretty No she isn t said William firmly she jus isn t Not much I don like her narsy shiny hair an I don like her narsy blue clothes an I don like her narsy face an I don like her narsy white shoes nor her narsy necklaces nor her narsy squeaky voice He paused Bettine drew a deep breath Go on some more she said I like listening to you Do you like her said William No She s awful greedy Did you know she was awful greedy I can b lieve it said William I can b lieve anything of anyone wot talks in that squeaky voice Jus watch her when she s eatin cakes she goes on eatin and eatin and eatin She ll bust an die one day then prophesied William solemnly an I shan t be sorry But she ll look ever so beautiful when she s a May Queen You d look nicer said William Bettine s small pale face flamed Oh no she said Would you like to be a May Queen Oh yes she said Um said William and returned to the discomfiture of Evangeline Fish by his steady concentrated scowl The next day he had the opportunity of watching her eating cakes They met at the birthday party of a mutual classmate and Evangeline Fish took her stand by the table and consumed cakes with a perseverance and determination worthy of a nobler cause William accorded her a certain grudging admiration Not once did she falter or faint Iced cakes cream cakes pastries melted away before her and never did she lose her ethereal angelic appearance Tight golden ringlets blue eyes faintly flushed cheeks vivid pale blue dress remained immaculate and unruffled and still she ate cakes William watched her in amazement forgetting even to scowl at her Her capacity for cakes exceeded even William s and his was no mean one They had a rehearsal of the Maypole dance and crowning the next day Illustration WILLIAM ACCORDED HER A CERTAIN GRUDGING ADMIRATION ICED CAKES CREAM CAKES PASTRIES MELTED AWAY BEFORE HER I want William Brown to hold the queen s train said Miss Dewhurst Me ejaculated William in horror D you mean me Yes dear It s a great honour to be asked to hold little Queen Evangeline s train I m sure you feel very proud You must be her little courtier Huh said William transferring his scowl to Miss Dewhurst Evangeline beamed She wanted William s admiration William was the only boy in the form who was not her slave She smiled at William sweetly I m not good at holdin trains said William I don t like holdin trains I ve never bin taught bout holdin trains I might do it wrong on the day an spoil it all I shan t like to spoil it all he added virtuously Oh we ll have heaps of practices said Miss Dewhurst brightly As he was going Bettine pressed a small apple into his hand A present for you she murmured I saved it from my dinner He was touched I ll give you somethin to morrow he said adding hastily if I can find anythin They stood in silence till he had finished his apple I ve left a lot on the core he said in a tone of unusual politeness handing it to her would you like to finish it No thank you William you ll look so nice holding her train I don t want to an I bet I won t You don t know the things I can do he said darkly Oh William she gasped in awe and admiration I d hold your train if you was goin to be queen he volunteered I wouldn t want you to hold my train she said earnestly I d I d I d want you to be May King with me Yes Why don t they have May Kings said William stung by this insult to his sex Why shouldn t there be a May King I speck they do really only p raps Miss Dewhurst doesn t know abut it Well it doesn t seem sense not having May Kings does it I wun t mind bein May King if you was May Queen The rehearsal was on the whole a failure William Brown don t hold the train so high No not quite so low Don t stand so near the Queen William Brown No not so far away you ll pull the train off Walk when the Queen walks William Brown don t stand still Sing up please train bearer No not quite so loud That s deafening and not melodious In the end he was degraded from the position of train bearer to that of ordinary swain The swains were to be dressed in smocks and the maidens in print dresses and the Maypole dance was to be performed round Evangeline Fish who was to stand in queenly attire by the pole in the middle All the village was to be invited At the end of the rehearsal William came upon Bettine once more gazing wistfully at Evangeline Fish who was coquetting with many tosses of the fair ringlets before a crowd of admirers Isn t it lovely for her to be May Queen said Bettine She s a rotten one said William I m jolly glad I ve not to hold up her rotten ole train an listen to her narsy squeaky voice singin close to an I ll give you a present to morrow He did He found a centipede in the garden and pressed it into her hand on the way to school They re jolly int restin he said Put it in a match box and make holes for its breath and it ll live ever so long It won t bite you if you hold it the right way And because she loved William she took it without even a shudder Evangeline Fish began to pursue William She grudged him bitterly to Bettine She pirouetted near him in her sky blue garments she tossed her ringlets about him She ogled him with her pale blue eyes And in the long school hours during which he dreamed at his desk or played games with his friends while highly paid instructors poured forth their wisdom for his benefit William evolved a plan Unfortunately like most plans it required capital and William had no capital Occasionally William s elder brother Robert would supply a few shillings without inconvenient questions but it happened that Robert was ignoring William s existence at that time For Robert had not for the first time discovered his Ideal and the Ideal had been asked to lunch the previous week For days before Robert had made William s life miserable He had objected to William s unbrushed hair and unmanicured hands and untidy person and noisy habits He had bitterly demanded what She would think on being asked to a house where she might meet such an individual as William he had insisted that William should be taught habits of cleanliness and silence before She came he had hinted darkly that a man who had William for a brother was hampered considerably in his love affairs because She would think it was a queer kind of family where anyone like William was allowed to grow up He had reserved some of his fervour for the cook She must have a proper lunch not stews and stuff they often had there must be three vegetables and there must be cheese straws Cook must learn to make better cheese straws And William having swallowed insults for three whole days planned vengeance It was a vengeance which only William could have planned or carried out For only William could have seized a moment just before lunch when the meal was dished up and cook happened to be out of the kitchen to carry the principal dishes down to the coal cellar and conceal them beneath the best nuts It is well to draw a veil over the next half hour Both William and the meal had vanished Robert tore his hair and appealed vainly to the heavens He hinted darkly at suicide For what is cold tongue and coffee to offer to an Ideal The meal was discovered during the afternoon in its resting place and given to William s mongrel Jumble who crept about during the next few days in agonies of indigestion Robert had bitterly demanded of William why he went about the world spoiling people s lives and ruining their happiness He had implied that when William met with the One and Only Love of his Life he need look for no help or assistance from him Robert because he William had dashed to the ground his Robert s cup of happiness because he d never in his life met anyone before like Miss Laing and never would again and he William had simply condemned him to a lonely and miserable old age because who d want to marry anyone that asked them to lunch and then gave them coffee and cold tongue and he d never want to marry anyone else because it was the One and Only Love of his Life and he hoped he William would realise when he was old enough to realise what it meant to have your life spoilt and your happiness ruined all through coffee and tongue because someone you d never speak to again had hidden the lunch Whence it came that William optimist though he was felt that any appeal to Robert for funds would be inopportune to say the least of it But Providence was on William s side for once An old uncle came to tea and gave William five shillings Going to dance at a Maypole I hear he chuckled P raps was all William said His family were relieved by his meekness with regard to the May Day festival Sometimes William made such a foolish fuss about being dressed up and performing in public You know dear said his mother it s a dear old festival and quite an honour to take part in it and a smock is quite a nice manly garment Yes Mother said William The day was fine a real May Day The Maypole was fixed up in the field near the school and the little performers were to change in the schoolroom William went out with his brown paper parcel of stage properties under his arm and stood gazing up the road by which Evangeline Fish must come to the school For Evangeline Fish would have to pass his gate Soon he saw her her pale blue radiant in the sun Ullo he greeted her She simpered She had won him at last Waitin to walk to the school with me William she said He still loitered You re awful early Am I I thought I was late I meant to be late I don t want to be too early I m the most portant person and I want to walk in after the others then they ll all look at me She tossed her tightly wrought curls Come into our ole shed a minute said William I ve got a present for you She blushed and ogled Oh William she said and followed him into the wood shed Look he said Illustration HAVE A LOT SAID WILLIAM THEY RE ALL FOR YOU GO ON EAT EM ALL YOU CAN EAT AN EAT AN EAT His uncle s five shillings had been well expended Rows of cakes lay round the shed pastries and sugar cakes and iced cakes and currant cakes Have a lot said William They re all for you Go on Eat em all You can eat an eat an eat There s lots an lots of time and they can t begin without you can they Oh William she said She gloated over them Oh may I There s heaps of time said William Go on Eat them all Her greedy little eyes seemed to stand out of her head Oo she said in rapture She sat down on the floor and began to eat lost to everything but icing and currants and pastry William made for the door then he paused gazed wistfully at the feast stepped back and grabbing a cream bun in each hand crept quietly away Bettine in her print frock was at the door of the school Hurry up she said anxiously You re going to be late The others are all out They re waiting to begin Miss Dewhurst s out there They re all come but you an the Queen I stayed cause you asked me to stay to help you He came in and shut the door You re goin to be May Queen he announced firmly Me she said in amazement Yes An I m goin to be King He unwrapped his parcel Look he said He had ransacked his sister s bedroom Once Ethel had been to a fancy dress dance as a Fairy Over Bettine s print frock he drew a crumpled gauze slip with wings torn in several places On her brow he placed a tinsel crown at a rakish angle And she quivered with happiness Oh how lovely she said How lovely How lovely His own preparations were simpler He tied a red sash that he had taken off his sister s hat over his right shoulder and under his left arm on the top of his smock Someone had once given him a small bus conductor s cap with a toy set of tickets and clippers He placed the cap upon his head with its peak over one eye It was the only official headgear he had been able to procure Then he took a piece of burnt cork from his parcel and solemnly drew a fierce and military moustache upon his cheek and lip To William no kind of theatricals was complete without a corked moustache Then he took Bettine by the hand and led her out to the Maypole The dancers were all waiting holding the ribbons The audience was assembled and a murmur of conversation was rising from it It ceased abruptly as William and Bettine appeared William s father mother and sister were in the front row Robert was not there Robert had declined to come to anything in which that little wretch was to perform He d jolly well had enough of that little wretch to last his lifetime thank you very much Illustration WILLIAM AND BETTINE STEPPED SOLEMNLY HAND IN HAND UPON THE LITTLE PLATFORM WHICH HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE MAY QUEEN William and Bettine stepped solemnly hand in hand upon the little platform which had been provided for the May Queen Miss Dewhurst who was chatting amicably to the parents till the last of her small performers should appear seemed suddenly turned to stone with mouth gaping and eyes wide The old fiddler who was rather short sighted struck up the strains and the dancers began to dance The audience relaxed leaning back in their chairs to enjoy the scene Miss Dewhurst was still frozen There were murmured comments How curious to have that boy there A sort of attendant I suppose Yes perhaps he s something allegorical A sort of pageant Good Luck or something It s not quite the sort of thing I expected I must admit What do you think of the Queen s dress I always thought Miss Dewhurst had better taste Rather tawdry I call it I think the moustache is a mistake It gives quite a common look to the whole thing I wonder who he s meant to be Pan do you think uncertainly Oh no nothing so pagan I hope said an elderly matron horrified He s that Brown boy you know There always seems to be something queer about anything he s in I ve noticed it often But I hope he s meant to be something more Christian than Pan though one never knows in these days she added darkly William s sister had recognised her possessions and was gasping in anger William s father who knew William was smiling sardonically William s mother was smiling proudly You re always running down William she said to the world in general but look at him now He s got a very important part and he said nothing about it at home I call it very nice and modest of him And what a dear little girl Bettine standing on the platform with William s hand holding hers and the Maypole dancers dancing round her was radiant with pride and happiness And Evangeline Fish in the wood shed was just beginning the last currant cake CHAPTER IX THE REVENGE William was a scout The fact was well known There was no one within a five mile radius of William s home who did not know it Sensitive old ladies had fled shuddering from their front windows when William marched down the street singing the word is a euphemism his scout songs in his strong young voice Curious smells emanated from the depth of the garden where William performed mysterious culinary operations One old lady whose cat had disappeared looked at William with dour suspicion in her eye whenever he passed Even the return of her cat a few weeks later did not remove the hostility from her gaze whenever it happened to rest upon William William s family had welcomed the suggestion of William s becoming a scout It will keep him out of mischief they had said They were notoriously optimistic where William was concerned William s elder brother only was doubtful You know what William is he said and in that dark saying much was contained Things went fairly smoothly for some time He took the scouts law of a daily deed of kindness in its most literal sense He was to do one and one only deed of kindness a day There were times when he forced complete strangers much to their embarrassment to be the unwilling recipients of his deed of kindness There were times when he answered any demand for help with a cold No I ve done it to day He received with saint like patience the eloquence of his elder sister when she found her silk scarf tied into innumerable knots Well they re jolly good knots was all he said He had been looking forward to the holidays for a long time He was to go under canvas at the end of the first week The first day of the holidays began badly William s father had been disturbed by William whose room was just above and who had spent most of the night performing gymnastics as instructed by his scout master No he didn t say do it at nights but he said do it He said it would make us grow up strong men Don t you want me to grow up a strong man He s ever so strong an he did em Why shun t I His mother found a pan with the bottom burnt out and at once accused William of the crime William could not deny it Well I was makin sumthin sumthin he d told us an I forgot it Well I ve got to make things if I m a scout I didn t mean to forget it I won t forget it next time It s a rotten pan anyway to burn itself into a hole jus for that At this point William s father received a note from a neighbour whose garden adjoined William s and whose life had been rendered intolerable by William s efforts upon his bugle The bugle was confiscated Darkness descended upon William s soul Well he muttered I m goin under canvas next week an I m jolly glad I m goin P r aps you ll be sorry when I m gone He went out into the garden and stood gazing moodily into space his hands in the pocket of his short scout trousers for William dressed on any and every occasion in his official costume Can t even have the bugle he complained to the landscape Can t even use their rotten ole pans Can t tie knots in any of their ole things Wot s the good of bein a scout His indignation grew and with it a desire to be avenged upon his family I d like to do somethin he confided to a rose bush with a ferocious scowl Somethin jus to show em Then his face brightened He had an idea He d get lost He d get really lost They d be sorry then alright They d p r aps think he was dead and they d be sorry then alright He imagined their relief their tearful apologies when at last he returned to the bosom of his family It was worth trying anyway He set off cheerfully down the drive He decided to stay away for lunch and tea and supper and to return at dusk to a penitent conscience stricken family He first made his way to a neighbouring wood where he arranged a pile of twigs for a fire but they refused to light even with the aid of the match that William found adhering to a piece of putty in the recess of one of his pockets Slightly dispirited he turned his attention to his handkerchief and tied knots in it till it gave way under the strain William s handkerchiefs being regularly used to perform the functions of blotting paper among other duties not generally entrusted to handkerchiefs were always in the last stages of decrepitude He felt rather bored and began to wonder whether it was lunch time or not He then scouted the wood and by his wood lore traced three distinct savage tribes passage through the wood and found the tracks of several elephants He engaged in deadly warfare with about half a dozen lions then tired of the sport It must be about lunch time He could imagine Ethel his sister hunting for him wildly high and low with growing pangs of remorse She d wish she d made less fuss over that old scarf His mother would recall the scene over the pan and her heart would fail her His father would think with shame of his conduct in the matter of the bugle Poor William How cruel we were How different we shall be if only he comes home He could almost hear the words Perhaps his mother was weeping now His father wild eyed and white lipped was pacing his study waiting for news eager to atone for his unkindness to his missing son Perhaps he had the bugle on the table ready to give back to him Perhaps he d even bought him a new one He imagined the scene of his return He would be nobly forgiving He would accept the gift of the new bugle without a word of reproach His heart thrilled at the thought of it He was getting jolly hungry It must be after lunch time But it would spoil it all to go home too early Here he caught sight of a minute figure regarding him with a steady gaze and holding a paper bag in one hand William stared down at him Wot you dressed up like that for said the apparition with a touch of scorn in his voice William looked down at his sacred uniform and scowled I m a scout he said loftily Cout repeated the apparition with an air of polite boredom Wot s your name William Mine s Thomas Will you catch me a wopse Look at my wopses He opened the bag slightly and William caught sight of a crowd of wasps buzzing about inside the bag Want more demanded the infant Want lots more Look Snells He brought out a handful of snails from a miniature pocket and put them on the ground Watch em put their horns out Watch em walk Look They re walkin They re walkin His voice was a scream of ecstasy He took them up and returned them to their pocket From another he drew out a wriggling mass Wood lice he explained casually Got worms in nother pocket He returned the wood lice to his pocket except one which he held between a finger and thumb laid thoughtfully against his lip Want wopses now You get em for me William roused himself from his bewilderment How how do you catch em he said Wings replied Thomas Get hold of their wings an they don t sting Sometimes they do though he added casually Then your hands go big A wasp settled near him and very neatly the young naturalist picked him up and put him in his paper prison Now you get one he ordered William William determined not to be outshone by this minute but dauntless stranger As a wasp obligingly settled on a flower near him he put out his hand only to withdraw it with a yell of pain and apply it to his mouth Oo ou he said Crumbs Thomas emitted a peal of laughter You stung he said Did it sting you Funny William s expression of rage and pain was exquisite to him Come on boy he ordered at last Let s go somewhere else William s bewildered dignity made a last stand You can go he said I m playin by myself All right agreed Thomas You play by you self an me play by myself an we ll be together playin by ourselves He set off down a path and meekly William followed It must be jolly late almost tea time I m hungry said Thomas suddenly Give me some brekfust I haven t got any said William irritably Well find some persisted the infant I can t There isn t any to find Well buy some I haven t any money Well buy some money Goaded William turned on him Go away he bellowed Thomas s blue eyes beneath a mop of curls met his coldly Don t talk so loud he said sternly There s some blackberries there You can get me some blackberries William began to walk away but Thomas trotted by his side There he persisted Jus where I m pointing Lovely great big suge ones Get em for my brekfust Reluctantly the scout turned to perform his deed of kindness Thomas consumed blackberries faster than William could gather them Up there he commanded No the one right up there I want I want it kick I ve etten all the others William was scratched and breathless and his shirt was torn when at last the rapacious Thomas was satisfied Then he partook of a little refreshment himself while Thomas turned out his pockets I ll let em go now he said One of his wood lice however stayed motionless where he put it Wot s the matter with it said William curiously I speck me s the matter wif it said Thomas succinctly Now get me some lickle fishes an tadpoles an water sings he went on cheerfully William turned round from his blackberry bush Well I won t he said decidedly I ve had enough You ve had nuff brekfust said Thomas sternly I ve found a lickle tin for the sings so be kick Oo here s a fly A green fly It s sittin on my finger Does it like me cause it s sittin on my finger No said William turning a purple stained countenance round scornfully It must be nearly night He didn t want to be too hard on them to make his mother ill or anything He wanted to be as kind as possible He d forgive them at once when he got home He d ask for one or two things he wanted as well as the new bugle A new penknife and an engine with a real boiler Waffor does it not like me persisted Thomas William was silent Question and questioner were beneath contempt Waffor does it not like me he shouted stridently Flies don t like people silly Waffor not retorted Thomas They don t know anything about them Well I ll tell it about me My name s Thomas he said to the fly politely Now does it like me William groaned But the fly had now vanished and Thomas once more grew impatient Come on he said Come on an find sings for me William s manly spirit was by this time so far broken that he followed his new acquaintance to a neighbouring pond growling threateningly but impotently Now commanded his small tyrant take off your boots an stockings an go an find things for me Take off yours growled William an find things for yourself No said Thomas crockerdiles might be there an bite my toes An pittanopotamuses might be there If you don t go in I ll scream an scream an scream William went in He walked gingerly about the muddy pond Thomas watched him critically from the bank I don t like your hair he said confidingly William growled He caught various small swimming objects in the tin and brought them to the bank for inspection I want more n that said Thomas calmly Well you won t get it retorted William He began to put on his boots and stockings wondering desperately how to rid himself of his unwanted companion But Fate solved the problem With a loud cry a woman came running down the path Tommy she said My little darling Tommy I thought you were lost She turned furiously to William You ought to be ashamed of yourself she said A great boy of your age leading a little child like this into mischief If his father was here he d show you You ought to know better And you a scout William gasped Illustration SHE TURNED FURIOUSLY TO WILLIAM YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF SHE SAID Well he said An I ve bin doin deeds of kindness on him all morning I ve She turned away indignantly holding Thomas s hand You re never to go with that nasty rough boy again darling she said Got lots of wopses an some fishes murmured Thomas contentedly They disappeared down the path With a feeling of depression and disillusionment William turned to go home Then his spirits rose After all he d got rid of Thomas and he was going home to a contrite family It must be about supper time It would be getting dark soon But it still stayed light a long time now It wouldn t matter if he just got in for supper It would have given them time to think things over He could see his father speaking unsteadily and holding out his hand My boy let bygones be bygones if there is anything you want His father had never said anything of this sort to him yet but by a violent stretch of imagination he could just conceive it His mother of course would cry over him and so would Ethel Dear William do forgive us we have been so miserable since you went away we will never treat you so again This again was unlike the Ethel he knew but sorrow has a refining effect on all characters He entered the gate self consciously Ethel was at the front door She looked at his torn shirt and mud caked knees You d better hurry if you re going to be ready for lunch she said coldly Lunch faltered William What time is it Ten to one Father s in so I warn you she added unpleasantly He entered the house in a dazed fashion His mother was in the hall William she said impatiently Another shirt torn You really are careless You ll have to stop being a scout if that s the way you treat your clothes And look at your knees Pale and speechless he went towards the stairs His father was coming out of the library smoking a pipe He looked at his son grimly If you aren t downstairs cleaned by the time the lunch bell goes my son he said you won t see that bugle of yours this side of Christmas William swallowed Yes father he said meekly He went slowly upstairs to the bathroom Life was a rotten show CHAPTER X THE HELPER The excitement began at breakfast William descended slightly late and after receiving his parents reproaches with an air of weary boredom ate his porridge listlessly He had come to the conclusion that morning that there was a certain monotonous sameness about life One got up and had one s breakfast and went to school and had one s dinner and went to school and had one s tea and played and had one s supper and went to bed Even the fact that to day was a half term holiday did not dispel his depression One day s holiday What good was one day We all have experienced such feelings Half abstractedly he began to listen to his elders conversation They promised to be here by nine his mother was saying I do hope they won t be late Well it s not much good their coming if the other house isn t ready is it said William s grown up sister Ethel I don t believe they ve even finished painting I m so sorry it s William s half term holiday sighed missus Brown He ll be frightfully in the way William s outlook on life brightened considerably They comin removin this morning he inquired cheerfully Yes DO try not to hinder them William Me he said indignantly I m goin to help If William s going to help remarked his father thank Heaven I shan t be here Your assistance William always seems to be even more devastating in its results than your opposition William smiled politely Sarcasm was always wasted on William Well he said rising from the table I d better go an be gettin ready to help Ten minutes later missus Brown coming out of the kitchen from her interview with the cook found to her amazement that the steps of the front door were covered with small ornaments As she stood staring William appeared from the drawing room staggering under the weight of a priceless little statuette that had been the property of mister Brown s great grandfather WILLIAM she gasped I m gettin all the little things ready for em jus to carry straight down If I put everything on the steps they don t need come into the house at all You said you didn t want em trampin in dirty boots It took a quarter of an hour to replace them Over the fragments of a blue delf bowl missus Brown sighed deeply I wish you d broken anything but this William Well he excused himself you said things do get broken removin You said so yourself I didn t break it on purpose It jus got broken removin At this point the removers arrived There were three of them One was very fat and jovial and one was thin and harassed looking and a third wore a sheepish smile and walked with a slightly unsteady gait They made profuse apologies for their lateness You d better begin with the dining room said missus Brown Will you pack the china first William get out of the way She left them packing assisted by William William carried the things to them from the sideboard cupboards What s your names he asked as he stumbled over a glass bowl that he had inadvertently left on the hearth rug His progress was further delayed while he conscientiously picked up the fragments Things do get broken removin he murmured Mine is Mister Blake and is is Mister Johnson and is is Mister Jones Which is mister Jones The one that walks funny They shook with herculean laughter so much so that a china cream jug slipped from mister Blake s fingers and lay in innumerable pieces round his boot He kicked it carelessly aside Yus he said bending anew to his task im wot walks funny Why s he walk funny persisted William Has he hurt his legs Yus said Blake with a wink E urt em at the Blue Cow comin ere mister Jones sheepish smile broadened into a guffaw Well you rest said William sympathetically You lie down on the sofa an rest I ll help so s you needn t do anything mister Jones grew hilarious Come on he said My eye This young gent s all roight e is You lie down an rest e says Well ere goes To the huge delight of his companions he stretched himself at length upon the chesterfield and closed his eyes William surveyed him with pleasure That s right he said I ll I ll show you my dog when your legs are better I ve gotter fine dog What sort of a dog said mister Blake resting from his labours to ask the question He s no partic lar sort of a dog said William honestly but he s a jolly fine dog You should see him do tricks Illustration WILLIAM SURVEYED HIM WITH PLEASURE I LL SHOW YOU MY DOG WHEN YOUR LEGS ARE BETTER HE SAID Well let s ave a look at im Fetch im art William highly delighted complied and Jumble showed off his best tricks to an appreciative audience of two mister Jones had already succumbed to the drowsiness that had long been creeping over him and was lying dead to the world on the chesterfield Jumble begged for a biscuit he walked perforce for William s hand firmly imprisoned his front ones on his hind legs he leapt over William s arm He leapt into the very centre of an old Venetian glass that was on the floor by the packing case and cut his foot slightly on a piece of it but fortunately suffered no ill effects William saw consternation on mister Johnson s face and hastened to gather the pieces and fling them lightly into the waste paper basket It s all right he said soothingly She said things get broken removin When missus Brown entered the room ten minutes later mister Jones was still asleep Jumble was still performing and Messrs Blake and Johnson were standing in negligent attitudes against the wall appraising the eager Jumble with sportsmanlike eyes E s no breed mister Blake was saying but e s orl roight I d loik to see im arfter a rat I bet e d Seeing missus Brown he hastily seized a vase from the mantel piece and carried it over to the packing case where he appeared suddenly to be working against time mister Johnson followed his example missus Brown s eyes fell upon mister Jones and she gasped Whatever she began E s not very well m explained mister Blake obsequiously E ll be orl roight when e s slep it orf E s always orl roight when e s slep it orf He s hurt his legs explained William He hurt his legs at the Blue Cow He s jus restin missus Brown swallowed and counted twenty to herself It was a practice she had acquired in her youth for use in times when words crowded upon her too thick and fast for utterance At last she spoke with unusual bitterness Need he rest with his muddy boots on my chesterfield At this point mister Jones awoke from sleep hypnotised out of it by her cold eye He was profuse in his apologies He believed he had fainted He had had a bad headache brought on probably by exposure to the early morning sun He felt much better after his faint He regretted having fainted on to the lady s sofa He partially brushed off the traces of his dirty boots with an equally dirty hand You ve done nothing in this room said missus Brown We shall never get finished William come away I m sure you re hindering them Me said William in righteous indignation Me I m helpin After what seemed to missus Brown to be several hours they began on the heavy furniture They staggered out with the dining room sideboard carrying away part of the staircase with it in transit missus Brown with a paling face saw her beloved antique cabinet dismembered against the doorpost and watched her favourite collapsible card table perform a thorough and permanent collapse Even the hat stand from the hall was devoid of some pegs when it finally reached the van This is simply breaking my heart moaned missus Brown Where s William said Ethel gloomily looking round Sh I don t know He disappeared a few minutes ago I don t know where he is I only hope he ll stay there The removers now proceeded to the drawing room and prepared to take out the piano They tried it every way The first way took a piece out of the doorpost the second made a dint two inches deep in the piano the third knocked over the grandfather clock which fell with a resounding crash breaking its glass and incidentally a tall china plant stand that happened to be in its line of descent missus Brown sat down and covered her face with her hands It s like some dreadful nightmare she groaned Messrs Blake Johnson and Jones paused to wipe the sweat of honest toil from their brows I dunno ow it s to be got out said mister Blake despairingly It got in persisted missus Brown If it got in it can get out We ll ave another try said mister Blake with the air of a hero leading a forlorn hope Come on mites This time was successful and the piano passed safely into the hall leaving in its wake only a dislocated door handle and a torn chair cover It then passed slowly and devastatingly down the hall and drive The next difficulty was to get it into the van Messrs Blake Johnson and Jones tried alone and failed For ten minutes they tried alone and failed Between each attempt they paused to mop their brows and throw longing glances towards the Blue Cow whose signboard was visible down the road The gardener the cook the housemaid and Ethel all gave their assistance and at last with a superhuman effort they raised it to the van They then all rested weakly against the nearest support and gasped for breath Well said mister Jones looking reproachfully at the mistress of the house I ve never andled a pianner At this moment a well known voice was heard in the recesses of the van behind the piano and sideboard and hat stand Hey let me out What you ve gone blockin up the van for I can t get out There was a horror stricken silence Then Ethel said sharply What did you go in for The mysterious voice came again with a note of irritability Well I was restin I mus have some rest mustn t I I ve been helpin all mornin Well couldn t you see we were putting things in The unseen presence spoke again No I can t I wasn t lookin You can t get out William said missus Brown desperately We can t move everything again You must just stop there till it s unpacked We ll try to push your lunch in to you There was determination in the voice that answered I want to get out I m going to get out There came tumultuous sounds the sound of the ripping of some material of the smashing of glass and of William s voice softly ejaculating Crumbs that ole lookin glass gettin in the way You d better take out the piano again said missus Brown wanly It s the only thing to do With straining and efforts and groans and a certain amount of destruction the piano was eventually lowered again to the ground Then the sideboard and hat stand were moved to one side and finally there emerged from the struggle William and Jumble Jumble s coat was covered with little pieces of horsehair as though from the interior of a chair William s jersey was torn from shoulder to hem He looked stern and indignant Illustration WILLIAM S JERSEY WAS TORN FROM SHOULDER TO HEM HE LOOKED STERN AND INDIGNANT A nice thing to do he began bitterly Shuttin me up in that ole van How d you expect me to breathe shut in with ole bits of furniture Folks can t live without air can they A nice thing if you d found me dead Emotion had deprived his audience of speech for the time being With a certain amount of dignity he walked past them into the house followed by Jumble It took another quarter of an hour to replace the piano As they were making the final effort William came out of the house Here I ll help he said and laid a finger on the side His presence rather hindered their efforts but they succeeded in spite of it William however was under the impression that his strength alone had wrought the miracle He put on an outrageous swagger I m jolly strong he confided to mister Blake I m stronger than most folk Here the removers decided that it was time for their midday repast and retired to consume it in the shady back garden All except mister Jones who said he would go down the road for a drink of lemonade William said that there was lemonade in the larder and offered to fetch it but mister Jones said hastily that he wanted a special sort He had to be very particular what sort of lemonade he drank missus Brown and Ethel sat down to a scratch meal in the library William followed his two new friends wistfully into the garden William Come to lunch called missus Brown Oh leave him alone Mother pleaded Ethel Let us have a little peace But William did not absent himself for long I want a red handkerchief he demanded loudly from the hall There was no response He appeared in the doorway I say I want a red handkerchief Have you gotter red handkerchief Mother No dear Have you Ethel NO All right said William aggrievedly You needn t get mad need you I m only askin for a red handkerchief I don t want a red handkerchief off you if you haven t got it do I William go away and shut the door William obeyed Peace reigned throughout the house and garden for the next half hour Then missus Brown s conscience began to prick her William must have something to eat dear Do go and find him Ethel went out to the back garden A scene of happy restfulness met her gaze mister Blake reclined against one tree consuming bread and cheese while a red handkerchief covered his knees mister Johnson reclined against another tree also consuming bread and cheese while a red handkerchief covered his knees William leant against a third tree consuming a little heap of scraps collected from the larder while on his knees also reposed what was apparently a red handkerchief Jumble sat in the middle catching with nimble snapping jaws dainties flung to him from time to time by his circle of admirers Ethel advanced nearer and inspected William s red handkerchief with dawning horror in her face Then she gave a scream William that s my silk scarf It was for a hat I ve only just bought it Oh mother do do something to William He s taken my new silk scarf the one I d got to trim my Leghorn He s the most awful boy I don t think missus Brown came out hastily to pacify her William handed the silk scarf back to its rightful owner Well I m sorry I thought it was a red handkerchief It looked like a red handkerchief Well how could I know it wasn t a red handkerchief I ve given it her back It s all right Jumble s only bit one end of it And that s only jam what dropped on it Well it ll wash won t it Well I ve said I m sorry I don t get much thanks William continued bitterly Me givin up my half holiday to helpin you removin an I don t get much thanks Well William said missus Brown you can go to the new house with the first van He ll be less in the way there she confided distractedly to the world in general William was delighted with this proposal At the new house there was a fresh set of men to unload the van and there was the thrill of making their acquaintance Then the front gate was only just painted and bore a notice Wet Paint It was of course incumbent upon William to test personally the wetness of the paint His trousers bore testimony to the testing to their last day in spite of many applications of turpentine Jumble also tested it and had in fact to be disconnected with the front gate by means of a pair of scissors For many weeks the first thing that visitors to the Brown household saw was a little tuft of Jumble s hair adorning the front gate William then proceeded to help to the utmost of his power He stumbled up from the van to the house staggering under the weight of a medicine cupboard and leaving a trail of broken bottles and little pools of medicine behind Jumble sampled many of the latter and became somewhat thoughtful It was found that the door of a small bedroom at the top of the stairs was locked and this fact added to mister Jones failure to return from his lemonade rather impeded the progress of the unpackers Brike it open suggested one Better not Per aps the key s insoide suggested another brightly William had one of his brilliant ideas Tell you what I ll do he said eagerly and importantly I ll climb up to the roof an get down the chimney an open it from the inside They greeted the proposal with guffaws They did not know William It was growing dusk when missus Brown and Ethel and the second van load appeared What is that on the gate said Ethel stooping to examine the part of Jumble s coat that brightened up the dulness of the black paint It s that dog she said Then came a ghost like cry apparently from the heavens Mother missus Brown raised a startled countenance to the skies There seemed to be nothing in the skies that could have addressed her Then she suddenly saw a small face peering down over the coping of the roof It was a face that was very frightened under a superficial covering of soot It was William s face I can t get down it said hoarsely missus Brown s heart stood still Stay where you are William she said faintly Don t move The entire staff of removers was summoned A ladder was borrowed from a neighbouring garden and found to be too short Another was fetched and fastened to it William at his dizzy height was growing irritable I can t stay up here for ever he said severely At last he was rescued by his friend mister Blake and brought down to safety His account was confused I wanted to help I wanted to open that door for em so I climbed up by the scullery roof an the ivy an the drain pipe an I tried to get down the chimney I didn t know which one it was but I tried em all an they were all too little an I tried to get down by the ivy again but I couldn t so I waited till you came an hollered out I wasn t scared he said fixing them with a stern eye I wasn t scared a bit I jus wanted to get down An this ole black chimney stuff tastes beastly No I m all right he ended in answer to tender inquiries I ll go on helpin He was with difficulty persuaded to retire to bed at a slightly earlier hour than usual Well he confessed I m a bit tired with helpin all day Soon after he had gone mister Brown and Robert arrived And how have things gone to day said mister Brown cheerfully Thank heaven William goes to school to morrow said Ethel devoutly Upstairs in his room William was studying himself in the glass torn jersey paint stained trousers blackened face Well he said with a deep sigh of satisfaction I guess I ve jolly well helped to day CHAPTER XI WILLIAM AND THE SMUGGLER William s family were going to the seaside for February It was not an ideal month for the seaside but William s father s doctor had ordered him a complete rest and change We shall have to take William with us you know his wife had said as they discussed plans Good heavens groaned mister Brown I thought it was to be a rest cure Yes but you know what he is his wife urged I daren t leave him with anyone Certainly not with Ethel We shall have to take them both Ethel will help with him Ethel was William s grown up sister All right agreed her husband finally You can take all responsibility I formally disown him from now till we get back I don t care what trouble he lands you in You know what he is and you deliberately take him away with me on a rest cure It can t be helped dear said his wife mildly William was thrilled by the news It was several years since he had been at the seaside Will I be able to go swimmin It won t be too cold Well if I wrap up warm will I be able to go swimmin Can I catch fishes Are there lots of smugglers smugglin there Well I m only askin you needn t get mad One afternoon missus Brown missed her best silver tray and searched the house high and low for it wildly while dark suspicions of each servant in turn arose in her usually unsuspicious breast It was finally discovered in the garden William had dug a large hole in one of the garden beds Into the bottom of this he had fitted the tray and had lined the sides with bricks He had then filled it with water and taking off his shoes and stockings stepped up and down his narrow pool He was distinctly aggrieved by missus Brown s reproaches Well I was practisin paddlin ready for goin to the seaside I didn t mean to rune your tray You talk as if I meant to rune your tray I was only practisin paddlin At last the day of departure arrived William was instructed to put his things ready on his bed and his mother would then come and pack for him He summoned her proudly over the balusters after about twenty minutes I ve got everythin ready Mother missus Brown ascended to his room Upon his bed was a large pop gun a football a dormouse in a cage a punchball on a stand a large box of curios and a buckskin which was his dearest possession and had been presented to him by an uncle from South Africa missus Brown sat down weakly on a chair You can t possibly take any of these things she said faintly but firmly Well you said put my things on the bed for you to pack an I ve put them on the bed an now you say I meant clothes Oh clothes scornfully I never thought of clothes Well you can t take any of these things anyway William hastily began to defend his collection of treasures I mus have the pop gun cause you never know There may be pirates an smugglers down there an you can kill a man with a pop gun if you get near enough and know the right place an I might need it An I must have the football to play on the sands with an the punchball to practise boxin on an I must have the dormouse cause cause to feed him an I must have this box of things and this skin to show to folks I meet down at the seaside cause they re int restin But missus Brown was firm and William reluctantly yielded In a moment of weakness finding that his trunk was only three quarter filled by his things she slipped in his beloved buckskin while William himself put the pop gun inside when no one was looking They had been unable to obtain a furnished house so had to be content with a boarding house mister Brown was eloquent on the subject If you re deliberately turning that child loose into a boarding house full presumably of quiet inoffensive people you deserve all you get It s nothing to do with me I m going to have a rest cure I ve disowned him He can do as he likes It can t be helped dear said missus Brown mildly mister Brown had engaged one of the huts on the beach chiefly for William s use and William proudly furnished its floor with the buckskin It was killed by my uncle he announced to the small crowd of children at the door who had watched with interest his painstaking measuring of the floor in order to place his treasure in the exact centre He killed it dead jus like this William had never heard the story of the death of the buck and therefore had invented one in which he had gradually come to confuse himself with his uncle in the role of hero It was walkin about an I he met it I hadn t got no gun and it sprung at me an I caught hold of its neck with one hand an I broke off its horns with the other an I knocked it over An it got up an ran at me him again an I jus tripped it up with my foot an it fell over again an then I jus give it one big hit with my fist right on its head an it killed it an it died There was an incredulous gasp Then there came a clear high voice from behind the crowd Little boy you are not telling the truth William looked up into a thin spectacled face I wasn t tellin it to you he remarked wholly unabashed A little girl with dark curls took up the cudgels quite needlessly in William s defence He s a very brave boy to do all that she said indignantly So don t you go saying things to him Well said William flattered but modest I didn t say I did it did I I said my uncle well partly my uncle mister Percival Jones looked down at him in righteous wrath You re a very wicked little boy I ll tell your father er I ll tell your sister For Ethel was approaching in the distance and mister Percival Jones was in no way loth to converse with her Illustration YOU RE A VERY WICKED LITTLE BOY SAID mister PERCIVAL JONES mister Percival Jones was a thin pale aesthetic would be poet who lived and thrived on the admiration of the elderly ladies of his boarding house and had done so for the past ten years Once he had published a volume of poems at his own expense He lived at the same boarding house as the Browns and had seen Ethel in the distance to meals He had admired the red lights in her dark hair and the blue of her eyes and had even gone so far as to wonder whether she possessed the solid and enduring qualities which he would require of one whom in his mind he referred to as his future spouse He began to walk down the beach with her I should like to speak to you er about your brother Miss Brown he began if you can spare me the time of course I trust I do not er intrude or presume He is a charming little man but er I fear not veracious May I accompany you a little on your way I am er much attracted to your er family I er should like to know you all better I am er deeply attached to your er little brother but grieved to find that he does not er adhere to the truth in his statements I er Miss Brown s blue eyes were dancing with merriment Oh don t you worry about William she said He s awful It s much best just to leave him alone Isn t the sea gorgeous to day They walked along the sands Meanwhile William had invited his small defender into his hut You can look round he said graciously You ve seen my skin what I he killed haven t you This is my gun You put a cork in there and it comes out hard when you shoot it It would kill anyone impressively if you did it near enough to them and at the right place An I ve got a dormouse an a punchball an a box of things an a football but they wouldn t let me bring them bitterly It s a lovely skin said the little girl What s your name William What s yours Peggy Well let s be on a desert island shall we An nothin to eat nor anything shall we Come on She nodded eagerly How lovely They wandered out on to the promenade and among a large crowd of passers by bemoaned the lonely emptiness of the island and scanned the horizon for a sail In the far distance on the cliffs could be seen the figures of mister Percival Jones and William s sister walking slowly away from the town At last they turned towards the hut We must find somethin to eat said William firmly We can t let ourselves starve to death Shrimps suggested Peggy cheerfully We haven t got nets said William We couldn t save them from the wreck Periwinkles There aren t any on this island I know Seaweed An we ll cook it Oh how lovely He gathered up a handful of seaweed and they entered the hut leaving a white handkerchief tied on to the door to attract the attention of any passing ship The hut was provided with a gas ring and William disregarding his family s express injunction lit this and put on a saucepan filled with water and seaweed We ll pretend it s a wood fire he said We couldn t make a real wood fire out on the prom They d stop us So we ll pretend this is An we ll pretend we saved a saucepan from the wreck After a few minutes he took off the pan and drew out a long green strand You eat it first he said politely The smell of it was not pleasant Peggy drew back Oh no you first No you said William nobly You look hungrier than me She bit off a piece chewed it shut her eyes and swallowed Now you she said with a shade of vindictiveness in her voice You re not going to not have any William took a mouthful and shivered I think it s gone bad he said critically Peggy s rosy face had paled I m going home she said suddenly You can t go home on a desert island said William severely Well I m going to be rescued then she said I think I am too said William It was lunch time when William arrived at the boarding house mister Percival Jones had moved his place so as to be nearer Ethel He was now convinced that she was possessed of every virtue his future spouse could need He conversed brightly and incessantly during the meal mister Brown grew restive The man will drive me mad he said afterwards Bleating away What s he bleating about anyway Can t you stop him bleating Ethel You seem to have influence Bleat Bleat Bleat Good Lord And me here for a rest cure At this point he was summoned to the telephone and returned distraught It s an unknown female he said She says that a boy of the name of William from this boarding house has made her little girl sick by forcing her to eat seaweed She says it s brutal Does anyone know I m here for a rest cure Where is the boy Good heavens Where is the boy But William like Peggy had retired from the world for a space He returned later on in the afternoon looking pale and chastened He bore the reproaches of his family in stately silence mister Percival Jones was in great evidence in the drawing room And soon er soon the er Spring will be with us once more he was saying in his high pitched voice as he leant back in his chair and joined the tips of his fingers together The Spring ah the Spring I have a er little effort I er composed on er the Coming of Spring I er will read to you some time if you will ah be kind enough to er criticise ah impartially Criticise they chorused It will be above criticism Oh do read it to us mister Jones I will er this evening His eyes wandered to the door hoping and longing for his beloved s entrance But Ethel was with her father at a matinee at the Winter Gardens and he looked and longed in vain In spite of this however the springs of his eloquence did not run dry and he held forth ceaselessly to his little circle of admirers The simple ah pleasures of nature How few of us alas have the er gift of appreciating them rightly This er little seaside hamlet with its er sea its er promenade its er Winter Gardens How beautiful it is How few appreciate it rightly Here William entered and mister Percival Jones broke off abruptly He disliked William Ah here comes our little friend He looks pale Remorse my young friend Ah beware of untruthfulness Beware of the beginnings of a life of lies and deception He laid a hand on William s head and cold shivers ran down William s spine Be good sweet child and let who will be clever as the poet says There was murder in William s heart At that minute Ethel entered No she snapped I sat next a man who smelt of bad tobacco I hate men who smoke bad tobacco mister Jones assumed an expression of intense piety I may boast he said sanctimoniously that I have never thus soiled my lips with drink or smoke There was an approving murmur from the occupants of the drawing room William had met his father in the passage outside the drawing room mister Brown was wearing a hunted expression Can I go into the drawing room he said bitterly or is he bleating away in there They listened From the drawing room came the sound of a high pitched voice mister Brown groaned Good Lord he moaned And I m here for a rest cure and he comes bleating into every room in the house Is the smoking room safe Does he smoke mister Percival Jones was feeling slightly troubled in his usually peaceful conscience He could honestly say that he had never smoked He could honestly say that he had never drank But in his bedroom reposed two bottles of brandy purchased at the advice of an aunt in case of emergencies In his bedroom also was a box of cigars that he had bought for a cousin s birthday gift but which his conscience had finally forbidden to present He decided to consign these two emblems of vice to the waves that very evening Meanwhile William had returned to the hut and was composing a tale of smugglers by the light of a candle He was much intrigued by his subject He wrote fast in an illegible hand in great sloping lines his brows frowning his tongue protruding from his mouth as it always did in moments of mental strain His sympathies wavered between the smugglers and the representatives of law and order His orthography was the despair of his teachers Ho sez Dick Savage he wrote Ho Gadzooks Rol in the bottles of beer up the beech Fill your pockets with the baccy from the bote Quick now Gadzooks Methinks we are observed He glared round in the darkness In less time than wot it takes to rite this he was srounded by pleese men and stood proud and defiant in the light of there electrick torches wot they had wiped quick as litening from their busums Surrender cried one holding a gun at his brain and a drorn sord at his hart Surrender or die Never said Dick Savage throwing back his head proud and defiant Never Do to me wot you will you dirty dogs I will never surrender Soner will I die One crule brute hit him a blo on the lips and he sprang back snarling with rage In less time than wot it takes to rite this he had sprang at his torturer s throte and his teeth met in one mighty bite His torturer dropped ded and lifless at his feet Ho cried Dick Savage throwing back his head proud and defiant again So dies any of you wot insults my proud manhood I will meet my teeth in your throtes For a minit they stood trembling then one bolder than the rest lept forward and tide Dick Savage s hands with rope behind his back Another took from his pockets bottles of beer and tobacco in large quantities Ho they cried exulting Ho Dick Savage the smugler caught at last Dick Savage gave one proud and defiant laugh and bringing his tide hands over his hed he bit the rope with one mighty bite Ho ho he cried throwing back his proud hed Ho ho You dirty dogs Then draining to the dregs a large bottle of poison he had concealed in his busum he fell ded and lifless at there feet There was a timid knock at the door and William scowling impatiently rose to open it What d you want he said curtly A little voice answered from the dusk It s me Peggy I ve come to see how you are William They don t know I ve come I was awful sick after that seaweed this morning William William looked at her with a superior frown Go away he said I m busy What you doing she said poking her little curly head into the doorway I m writin a tale She clasped her hands Oh how lovely Oh William do read it to me I d love it Mollified he opened the door and she took her seat on his buckskin on the floor and William sat by the candle clearing his throat for a minute before he began During the reading she never took her eyes off him At the end she drew a deep breath Oh William it s beautiful William are there smugglers now Oh yes Millions he said carelessly Here Of course there are She went to the door and looked out at the dusk I d love to see one What do they smuggle William He came and joined her at the door walking with a slight swagger as became a man of literary fame Oh beer an cigars an things Millions of them A furtive figure was passing the door casting suspicious glances to left and right He held his coat tightly round him clasping something inside it I expect that s one said William casually They watched the figure out of sight Suddenly William s eyes shone Let s stalk him an catch him he said excitedly Come on Let s take some weapons He seized his pop gun from a corner You take he looked round the room You take the wastepaper basket to put over his head an an pin down his arms an somethin to tie him up I know the skin I he shot in Africa You can tie its paws in front of him Come on Let s catch him smugglin He stepped out boldly into the dusk with his pop gun followed by the blindly obedient Peggy carrying the wastepaper basket in one hand and the skin in the other mister Percival Jones was making quite a little ceremony of consigning his brandy and cigars to the waves He had composed a little effort upon it which began O deeps receive these objects vile Which nevermore mine eyes shall soil He went down to the edge of the sea and taking a bottle in each hand held them out at arms length while he began in his high pitched voice O deeps receive these He stopped A small boy stood beside him holding out at him the point of what in the semi darkness mister Jones took to be a loaded rifle William mistook his action in holding out the bottles It s no good tryin to drink it up he said severely We ve caught you smugglin mister Percival Jones laughed nervously My little man he said that s a very dangerous er thing for you to have Suppose you hand it over to me now like a good little chap William recognised his voice Illustration WE VE CAUGHT YOU SMUGGLING WILLIAM SAID SEVERELY Fancy you bein a smuggler all the time he said with righteous indignation in his voice Take away that er nasty gun little boy pleaded his captive plaintively You ah don t understand it It er might go off William was not a boy to indulge in half measures He meant to carry the matter off with a high hand I ll shoot you dead he said dramatically if you don t do jus what I tell you mister Percival Jones wiped the perspiration from his brow Where did you get that rifle little boy he asked in a voice he strove to make playful Is it ah is it loaded It s ah unwise little boy Most unwise Er give it to me to er take care of It er might go off you know William moved the muzzle of his weapon and mister Percival Jones shuddered from head to foot William was a brave boy but he had experienced a moment of cold terror when first he had approached his captive The first note of the quavering high pitched voice had however reassured him He instantly knew himself to be the better man His captive s obvious terror of his pop gun almost persuaded him that he held in his hand some formidable death dealing instrument As a matter of fact mister Percival Jones was temperamentally an abject coward You walk up to the seats commanded William I ve took you prisoner for smugglin an an jus walk up to the seats mister Percival Jones obeyed with alacrity Don t er press anything little boy he pleaded as he went It ah might go off by accident You might do ah untold damage Peggy armed with the wastepaper basket and the skin followed open mouthed At the seat William paused Peggy you put the basket over his head an pin his arms down case he struggles an tie the skin wot I shot round him case he struggles Peggy stood upon the seat and obeyed Their victim made no protest He seemed to himself to be in some horrible dream The only thing of which he was conscious was the dimly descried weapon that William held out at him in the darkness He was hardly aware of the wastepaper basket thrust over his head He watched William anxiously through the basket work Be careful he murmured Be careful boy He hardly felt the skin which was fastened tightly round his unresisting form by Peggy the tail tied to one front paw Unconsciously he still clasped a bottle of brandy in each arm Then came the irate summons of Peggy s nurse through the dusk Oh William she said panting with excitement I don t want to leave you Oh William he might kill you You go on I m all right he said with conscious valour He can t do nothin cause I ve got a gun an I can shoot him dead mister Percival Jones shuddered afresh an he s all tied up an I ve took him prisoner an I m goin to take him home Oh William you are brave she whispered in the darkness as she flitted away to her nurse William blushed with pride and embarrassment mister Percival Jones was convinced that he had to deal with a youthful lunatic armed with a dangerous weapon and was anxious only to humour him till the time of danger was over and he could be placed under proper restraint Unconscious of his peculiar appearance he walked before his captor casting propitiatory glances behind him It s all right little boy he said soothingly quite all right I m er your friend Don t ah get annoyed little boy Don t ah get annoyed Won t you put your gun down little man Won t you let me carry it for you William walked behind still pointing his pop gun I ve took you prisoner for smugglin he repeated doggedly I m takin you home You re my prisoner I ve took you They met no one on the road though mister Percival Jones threw longing glances around ready to appeal to any passer by for rescue He was afraid to raise his voice in case it should rouse his youthful captor to murder He saw with joy the gate of his boarding house and hastened up the walk and up the stairs The drawing room door was open There was help and assistance there was protection against this strange persecution He entered followed closely by William It was about the time he had promised to read his little effort on the Coming of Spring to his circle of admirers A group of elderly ladies sat round the fire awaiting him Ethel was writing They turned as he entered and a gasp of horror and incredulous dismay went up It was that gasp that called him to a realisation of the fact that he was wearing a wastepaper basket over his head and shoulders and that a mangy fur rug was tied round his arms mister Jones they gasped He gave a wrench to his shoulders and the rug fell to the floor revealing a bottle of brandy clasped in either arm mister Jones they repeated I caught him smugglin said William proudly I caught him smugglin beer by the sea an he was drinking those two bottles he d smuggled an he had thousands an thousands of cigars all over him an I caught him an he s a smuggler an I brought him up here with my gun He s a smuggler an I took him prisoner mister Jones red and angry his hair awry glared through the wickerwork of his basket He moistened his lips This is an outrage he spluttered Horrified elderly eyes stared at the incriminating bottles He was drinkin em by the sea said William mister Jones they chorused again He flung off his wastepaper basket and turned upon the proprietress of the establishment who stood by the door I will not brook such treatment he stammered in fury I leave your roof to night I am outraged humiliated I I disdain to explain I leave your roof to night mister Jones they said once more Illustration I CAUGHT HIM SMUGGLING WILLIAM EXPLAINED PROUDLY HE HAD THOUSANDS AN THOUSANDS OF CIGARS AND THAT BEER mister Jones still clasping his bottles withdrew pausing to glare at William on his way You wicked boy You wicked little untruthful boy he said William looked after him He s my prisoner an they ve let him go he said aggrievedly Ten minutes later he wandered into the smoking room mister Brown sat miserably in a chair by a dying fire beneath a poor light Is he still bleating there he said Is this still the only corner where I can be sure of keeping my sanity Is he reading his beastly poetry upstairs Is he He s goin said William moodily He s goin before dinner They ve sent for his cab He s mad cause I said he was a smuggler He was a smuggler cause I saw him doin it an I took him prisoner an he got mad an he s goin An they re mad at me cause I took him prisoner You d think they d be glad at me catchin smugglers but they re not bitterly An Mother says she ll tell you an you ll be mad too an mister Brown raised his hand One minute my son he said Your story is confused Do I understand that mister Jones is going and that you are the cause of his departure Yes cause he got mad cause I said he was a smuggler an he was a smuggler an they re mad at me now an mister Brown laid a hand on his son s shoulder There are moments William he said when I feel almost affectionate towards you 
2598_4662_000005_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XII
none	none	 THE REFORM OF WILLIAM 
2598_4662_000007_000000	train-clean-360	To William the idea of reform was new and startling and not wholly unattractive 
2598_4662_000007_000001	train-clean-360	It originated with the housemaid whose brother was a reformed burglar now employed in a grocer s shop 
2598_4662_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 E s got conversion she said to William 
none	none	E got it quite sudden like an e give up all is bad ways straight off E s bin like a heavenly saint ever since 
2598_4662_000009_000000	train-clean-360	William was deeply interested 
2598_4662_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The point was all innocently driven in later by the Sunday school mistress 
2598_4662_000009_000002	train-clean-360	William s family had no real faith in the Sunday school as a corrective to William s inherent wickedness but they knew that no Sabbath peace or calm was humanly possible while William was in the house 
none	none	So they brushed and cleaned and tidied him at two point forty five and sent him pained and protesting down the road every Sunday afternoon Their only regret was that Sunday school did not begin earlier and end later 
2598_4662_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Fortunately for William most of his friends parents were inspired by the same zeal so that he met his old cronies of the week days Henry Ginger Douglas and all the rest and together they beguiled the monotony of the Sabbath 
2598_4662_000011_000000	train-clean-360	But this Sunday the tall pale lady who for her sins essayed to lead William and his friends along the straight and narrow path of virtue was almost inspired 
2598_4662_000011_000001	train-clean-360	She was like some prophetess of old 
2598_4662_000011_000002	train-clean-360	She was so emphatic that the red cherries that hung coquettishly over the edge of her hat rattled against it as though in applause 
none	none	We must all start afresh she said We must all be turned that s what conversion means 
2598_4662_000013_000000	train-clean-360	William s fascinated eye wandered from the cherries to the distant view out of the window 
2598_4662_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He thought suddenly of the noble burglar who had turned his back upon the mysterious nefarious tools of his trade and now dispensed margarine to his former victims 
2598_4662_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Opposite him sat a small girl in a pink and white checked frock 
2598_4662_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He often whiled away the dullest hours of Sunday school by putting out his tongue at her or throwing paper pellets at her manufactured previously for the purpose 
2598_4662_000014_000002	train-clean-360	But to day meeting her serious eye he looked away hastily 
none	none	And we must all help someone went on the urgent voice If we have turned ourselves we must help someone else to turn 
2598_4662_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Determined and eager was the eye that the small girl turned upon William and William realised that his time had come 
2598_4662_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He was to be converted 
2598_4662_000016_000002	train-clean-360	He felt almost thrilled by the prospect 
2598_4662_000016_000003	train-clean-360	He was so enthralled that he received absent mindedly and without gratitude the mountainous bull s eye passed to him from Ginger and only gave a half hearted smile when a well aimed pellet from Henry s hand sent one of the prophetess s cherries swinging high in the air 
2598_4662_000017_000000	train-clean-360	After the class the pink checked girl whose name most appropriately was Deborah stalked William for several yards and finally cornered him 
none	none	William she said are you going to turn I m goin to think about it said William guardedly
2598_4662_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 William I think you ought to turn 
2598_4662_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I ll help you she added sweetly 
2598_4662_000021_000000	train-clean-360	William drew a deep breath 
2598_4662_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 All right I will he said 
2598_4662_000022_000000	train-clean-360	She heaved a sigh of relief 
none	none	You ll begin now won t you she said earnestly William considered 
2598_4662_000024_000001	train-clean-360	There were several things that he had wanted to do for some time but hadn t managed to do yet 
none	none	He had not tried turning off the water at the main and hiding the key and seeing what would happen he hadn t tried shutting up the cat in the hen house he hadn t tried painting his long suffering mongrel Jumble with the pot of green paint that was in the tool shed he hadn t tried pouring water into the receiver of the telephone he hadn t tried locking the cook into the larder 
2598_4662_000024_000003	train-clean-360	There were in short whole fields of crime entirely unexplored 
2598_4662_000024_000004	train-clean-360	All these things and others must be done before the reformation 
none	none	I can t begin jus yet said William
2598_4662_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Say day after to morrow 
2598_4662_000026_000000	train-clean-360	She considered this for a minute 
2598_4662_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well she said at last reluctantly day after to morrow 
2598_4662_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The next day dawned bright and fair 
2598_4662_000028_000001	train-clean-360	William arose with a distinct sense that something important had happened 
2598_4662_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Then he thought of the reformation 
2598_4662_000028_000003	train-clean-360	He saw himself leading a quiet and blameless life walking sedately to school working at high pressure in school doing his homework conscientiously in the evening being exquisitely polite to his family his instructors and the various foolish people who visited his home for the sole purpose apparently of making inane remarks to him 
2598_4662_000028_000004	train-clean-360	He saw all this and the picture was far from unattractive in the distance 
2598_4662_000028_000005	train-clean-360	In the immediate future however there were various quite important things to be done 
2598_4662_000028_000006	train-clean-360	There was a whole normal lifetime of crime to be crowded into one day 
none	none	Looking out of his window he espied the gardener bending over one of the beds 
2598_4662_000028_000008	train-clean-360	The gardener had a perfectly bald head 
2598_4662_000028_000009	train-clean-360	William had sometimes idly imagined the impact of a pea sent violently from a pea shooter with the gardener s bald head 
2598_4662_000028_000010	train-clean-360	Before there had been a lifetime of experiment before him and he had put off this one idly in favour of something more pressing 
none	none	Now there was only one day 
2598_4662_000028_000012	train-clean-360	He took up his pea shooter and aimed carefully 
2598_4662_000028_000013	train-clean-360	The pea did not embed itself deeply into the gardener s skull as William had sometimes thought it would It bounced back 
2598_4662_000028_000014	train-clean-360	It bounced back quite hard 
2598_4662_000028_000015	train-clean-360	The gardener also bounced back with a yell of anger shaking his fist at William s window 
2598_4662_000028_000016	train-clean-360	But William had discreetly retired 
2598_4662_000028_000017	train-clean-360	He hid the pea shooter assumed his famous expression of innocence and felt distinctly cheered 
2598_4662_000028_000018	train-clean-360	The question as to what exactly would happen when the pea met the baldness was now for ever solved 
2598_4662_000028_000019	train-clean-360	The gardener retired grumbling to the potting shed so for the present all was well 
2598_4662_000028_000020	train-clean-360	Later in the day the gardener might lay his formal complaint before authority but later in the day was later in the day 
2598_4662_000028_000021	train-clean-360	It did not trouble William 
2598_4662_000028_000022	train-clean-360	He dressed briskly and went down to breakfast with a frown of concentration upon his face 
2598_4662_000028_000023	train-clean-360	It was the last day of his old life 
none	none	Illustration THE PEA DID NOT EMBED ITSELF INTO THE GARDENER S SKULL AS WILLIAM HAD SOMETIMES THOUGHT IT WOULD IT BOUNCED BACK THE GARDENER ALSO BOUNCED BACK 
2598_4662_000030_000000	train-clean-360	No one else was in the dining room 
2598_4662_000030_000001	train-clean-360	It was the work of a few minutes to remove the bacon from beneath the big pewter cover and substitute the kitten to put a tablespoonful of salt into the coffee and to put a two days old paper in place of that morning s 
2598_4662_000030_000002	train-clean-360	They were all things that he had at one time or another vaguely thought of doing but for which he had never yet seemed to have time or opportunity 
none	none	Warming to his subject he removed the egg from under the egg cosy on his sister s plate and placed in its stead a worm which had just appeared in the window box in readiness for the early bird 
2598_4662_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He surveyed the scene with a deep sigh of satisfaction 
none	none	The only drawback was that he felt that he could not safely stay to watch results William possessed a true strategic instinct for the right moment for a retreat 
2598_4662_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Hearing therefore a heavy step on the stairs he seized several pieces of toast and fled 
none	none	As he fled he heard through the open window violent sounds proceeding from the enraged kitten beneath the cover and then the still more violent sounds proceeding from the unknown person who removed the cover 
2598_4662_000031_000005	train-clean-360	The kitten a mass of fury and lust for revenge came flying through the window William hid behind a laurel bush till it had passed then set off down the road 
2598_4662_000032_000000	train-clean-360	School of course was impossible 
2598_4662_000032_000001	train-clean-360	The precious hours of such a day as this could not be wasted in school 
2598_4662_000032_000002	train-clean-360	He went down the road full of his noble purpose 
2598_4662_000032_000003	train-clean-360	The wickedness of a lifetime was somehow or other to be crowded into this day 
2598_4662_000032_000004	train-clean-360	To morrow it would all be impossible 
2598_4662_000032_000005	train-clean-360	To morrow began the blameless life 
2598_4662_000032_000006	train-clean-360	It must all be worked off to day 
2598_4662_000032_000007	train-clean-360	He skirted the school by a field path in case any of those narrow souls paid to employ so aimlessly the precious hours of his youth might be there They would certainly be tactless enough to question him as he passed the door 
2598_4662_000032_000008	train-clean-360	Then he joined the main road 
2598_4662_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The main road was empty except for a caravan a caravan gaily painted in red and yellow 
2598_4662_000033_000001	train-clean-360	It had little lace curtains at the window 
2598_4662_000033_000002	train-clean-360	It was altogether a most fascinating caravan 
2598_4662_000033_000003	train-clean-360	No one seemed to be near it William looked through the windows 
2598_4662_000033_000004	train-clean-360	There was a kind of dresser with crockery hanging from it a small table and a little oil stove 
none	none	The further part was curtained off but no sound came from it so that it was presumably empty too William wandered round to inspect the quadruped in front 
2598_4662_000033_000007	train-clean-360	It appeared to be a mule a mule with a jaundiced view of life 
2598_4662_000033_000008	train-clean-360	It rolled a sad eye towards William then with a deep sigh returned to its contemplation of the landscape 
2598_4662_000033_000009	train-clean-360	William gazed upon caravan and steed fascinated 
2598_4662_000033_000010	train-clean-360	Never in his future life of noble merit would he be able to annex a caravan 
2598_4662_000033_000011	train-clean-360	It was his last chance 
none	none	No one was about He could pretend that he had mistaken it for his own caravan or had got on to it by mistake or or anything 
2598_4662_000033_000014	train-clean-360	Conscience stirred faintly in his breast but he silenced it sternly 
none	none	Conscience was to rule him for the rest of his life and it could jolly well let him alone this day With some difficulty he climbed on to the driver s seat took the reins said Gee up to the melancholy mule and the whole equipage with a jolt and faint rattle set out along the road 
2598_4662_000034_000000	train-clean-360	William did not know how to drive but it did not seem to matter 
none	none	The mule ambled along and William high up on the driver s seat the reins held with ostentatious carelessness in one hand the whip poised lightly in the other was in the seventh heaven of bliss 
2598_4662_000034_000002	train-clean-360	He was driving a caravan 
2598_4662_000034_000003	train-clean-360	He was driving a caravan 
none	none	He was driving a caravan 
2598_4662_000034_000004	train-clean-360	He was driving a caravan The very telegraph posts seemed to gape with envy and admiration as he passed 
2598_4662_000034_000005	train-clean-360	What ultimately he was going to do with his caravan he neither knew nor cared 
2598_4662_000034_000006	train-clean-360	All that mattered was it was a bright sunny morning and all the others were in school and he was driving a red and yellow caravan along the high road 
none	none	The birds seemed to be singing a paeon of praise to him 
2598_4662_000034_000008	train-clean-360	He was intoxicated with pride 
none	none	It was his caravan his road his world 
2598_4662_000034_000010	train-clean-360	Carelessly he flicked the mule with the whip 
2598_4662_000034_000011	train-clean-360	There are several explanations of what happened then 
2598_4662_000034_000012	train-clean-360	The mule may not have been used to the whip a wasp may have just stung him at that particular minute a wandering demon may have entered into him 
2598_4662_000034_000013	train-clean-360	Mules are notoriously accessible to wandering demons 
2598_4662_000034_000014	train-clean-360	Whatever the explanation the mule suddenly started forward and galloped at full speed down the hill 
2598_4662_000034_000015	train-clean-360	The reins dropped from William s hands he clung for dear life on to his seat as the caravan swaying and jolting along the uneven road seemed to be doing its utmost to fling him off 
2598_4662_000034_000016	train-clean-360	There came a rattle of crockery from within 
none	none	Then suddenly there came another sound from within a loud agonised scream 
2598_4662_000034_000018	train-clean-360	It was a female scream 
none	none	Someone who had been asleep behind the curtain had just awakened William s hair stood on end 
2598_4662_000035_000001	train-clean-360	He almost forgot to cling to the seat For not one scream came but many 
2598_4662_000035_000002	train-clean-360	They rent the still summer air mingled with the sound of breaking glass and crockery 
2598_4662_000035_000003	train-clean-360	The mule continued his mad career down the hill his reins trailing in the dust 
2598_4662_000035_000004	train-clean-360	In the distance was a little gipsy s donkey cart full of pots and pans 
none	none	William found his voice suddenly and began to warn the mule Illustration WILLIAM S HAIR STOOD ON END HE ALMOST FORGOT TO CLING TO THE SEAT FOR NOT ONE SCREAM CAME BUT MANY MINGLED WITH THE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND CROCKERY Look out you ole softie he yelled Look out for the donk you ole ass 
2598_4662_000038_000000	train-clean-360	But the mule refused to be warned 
2598_4662_000038_000001	train-clean-360	He neatly escaped the donkey cart himself but he crashed the caravan into it with such force that the caravan broke a shaft and overturned completely on to the donkey cart scattering pots and pans far and wide 
2598_4662_000038_000002	train-clean-360	From within the caravan came inhuman female yells of fear and anger 
2598_4662_000038_000003	train-clean-360	William had fallen on to a soft bank of grass 
2598_4662_000038_000004	train-clean-360	He was discovering to his amazement that he was still alive and practically unhurt 
2598_4662_000038_000005	train-clean-360	The mule was standing meekly by and smiling to himself 
2598_4662_000038_000006	train-clean-360	Then out of the window of the caravan climbed a woman a fat angry woman shaking her fist at the world in general 
2598_4662_000038_000007	train-clean-360	Her hair and face were covered with sugar and a fork was embedded in the front of her dress 
2598_4662_000038_000008	train-clean-360	Otherwise she too had escaped undamaged 
none	none	The owner of the donkey cart arose from the melee of pots and pans and turned upon her fiercely 
2598_4662_000039_000001	train-clean-360	She screamed at him furiously in reply Then along the road could be seen the figure of a fat man carrying a fishing rod 
2598_4662_000039_000002	train-clean-360	He began to run wildly towards the caravan 
none	none	Ach Gott in Himmel he cried as he ran my beautiful caravan Who has this to it done He joined the frenzied altercation that was going on between the donkey man and the fat woman 
2598_4662_000041_000001	train-clean-360	The air was rent by their angry shouts A group of highly appreciative villagers collected round them 
2598_4662_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Then one of them pointed to William who sat feeling still slightly shaken upon the bank 
none	none	It was im wot done it he said it was im that was a drivin of it down the ill 
2598_4662_000043_000000	train-clean-360	With one wild glance at the scene of devastation and anger William turned and fled through the wood 
none	none	Ach Gott in Himmel screamed the fat man beginning to pursue him 
2598_4662_000044_000002	train-clean-360	The fat woman and the donkey man joined the pursuit 
2598_4662_000044_000003	train-clean-360	To William it was like some ghastly nightmare after an evening s entertainment at the cinematograph 
none	none	Meanwhile the donkey and the mule fraternised over the debris and the villagers helped themselves to all they could find 
2598_4662_000045_000001	train-clean-360	But the fat man was very fat and the fat woman was very fat and the donkey man was very old and William was young and very fleet so in less than ten minutes they gave up the pursuit and returned panting and quarrelling to the road 
2598_4662_000045_000002	train-clean-360	William sat on the further outskirts of the wood and panted 
2598_4662_000045_000003	train-clean-360	He felt on the whole exhilarated by the adventure 
2598_4662_000045_000004	train-clean-360	It was quite a suitable adventure for his last day of unregeneration 
2598_4662_000045_000005	train-clean-360	But he felt also in need of bodily sustenance so he purchased a bun and a bottle of lemonade at a neighbouring shop and sat by the roadside to recover 
none	none	There were no signs of his pursuers 
2598_4662_000046_000000	train-clean-360	He felt reluctant to return home 
2598_4662_000046_000001	train-clean-360	It is always well to follow a morning s absence from school by an afternoon s absence from school 
2598_4662_000046_000002	train-clean-360	A return in the afternoon is ignominious and humiliating 
2598_4662_000046_000003	train-clean-360	William wandered round the neighbourhood experiencing all the thrill of the outlaw 
2598_4662_000046_000004	train-clean-360	Certainly by this time the gardener would have complained to his father probably the schoolmistress would have sent a note Also someone had been scratched by the cat 
2598_4662_000047_000000	train-clean-360	William decided that all things considered it was best to make a day of it 
none	none	Illustration WILLIAM S SPIRITS SANK A LITTLE AS HE APPROACHED THE GATE 
2598_4662_000050_000002	train-clean-360	HE COULD SEE THROUGH THE TREES THE FAT CARAVAN OWNER GESTICULATING AT THE DOOR 
none	none	He spent part of the afternoon in throwing stones at a scarecrow 
2598_4662_000049_000001	train-clean-360	His aim was fairly good and he succeeded in knocking off the hat and finally prostrating the wooden framework 
2598_4662_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Followed an exciting chase by an angry farmer 
none	none	It was after tea time when he returned home walking with careless bravado as of a criminal who has drunk of crime to its very depth and flaunts it before the world 
2598_4662_000050_000001	train-clean-360	His spirits sank a little as he approached the gate 
none	none	He could see through the trees the fat caravan owner gesticulating at the door Helped by the villagers he had tracked William 
2598_4662_000050_000004	train-clean-360	Phrases floated to him through the summer air 
none	none	Mine beautiful caravan Ach Gott in Himmel 
2598_4662_000052_000000	train-clean-360	He could see the gardener smiling in the distance 
2598_4662_000052_000001	train-clean-360	There was a small blue bruise on his shining head 
2598_4662_000052_000002	train-clean-360	William judged from the smile that he had laid his formal complaint before authority 
2598_4662_000052_000003	train-clean-360	William noticed that his father looked pale and harassed 
none	none	He noticed also with a thrill of horror that his hand was bound up and that there was a long scratch down his cheek He knew the cat had scratched somebody but Crumbs 
2598_4662_000053_000000	train-clean-360	A small boy came down the road and saw William hesitating at the open gateway 
none	none	You ll catch it he said cheerfully
2598_4662_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 They ve wrote to say you wasn t in school 
2598_4662_000055_000000	train-clean-360	William crept round to the back of the house beneath the bushes 
2598_4662_000055_000001	train-clean-360	He felt that the time had come to give himself up to justice but he wanted as the popular saying is to be sure of getting his money s worth There was the tin half full of green paint in the tool shed He d had his eye on it for some time 
2598_4662_000055_000002	train-clean-360	He went quietly round to the tool shed 
2598_4662_000055_000003	train-clean-360	Soon he was contemplating with a satisfied smile a green and enraged cat and a green and enraged hen 
2598_4662_000055_000004	train-clean-360	Then bracing himself for the effort he delivered himself up to justice 
2598_4662_000055_000005	train-clean-360	When all was said and done no punishment could be really adequate to a day like that 
2598_4662_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Dusk was falling 
2598_4662_000056_000001	train-clean-360	William gazed pensively from his bedroom window 
2598_4662_000056_000002	train-clean-360	He was reviewing his day 
2598_4662_000056_000003	train-clean-360	He had almost forgotten the stormy and decidedly unpleasant scene with his father 
2598_4662_000056_000004	train-clean-360	mister Brown s rhetoric had been rather lost on William because its pearls of sarcasm had been so far above his head 
2598_4662_000056_000005	train-clean-360	And William had not been really loth to retire at once to bed 
2598_4662_000056_000006	train-clean-360	After all it had been a very tiring day 
2598_4662_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Now his thoughts were going over some of its most exquisite moments the moments when the pea and the gardener s head met and rebounded with such satisfactory force the moment when he swung along the high road monarch of a caravan and a mule and the whole wide world the moment when the scarecrow hunched up and collapsed so realistically the cat covered with green paint 
2598_4662_000057_000001	train-clean-360	After all it was his last day 
2598_4662_000057_000002	train-clean-360	He saw himself from to morrow onward leading a quiet and blameless life walking sedately to school working at high pressure in school doing his homework conscientiously in the evening being exquisitely polite to his family and instructors and the vision failed utterly to attract 
none	none	Moreover he hadn t yet tried turning off the water at the main or locking the cook into the larder or or hundreds of things There came a gentle voice from the garden William where are you William looked down and met the earnest gaze of Deborah Hello he said William she said You won t forget that you re going to start to morrow will you William looked at her firmly I can t jus to morrow he said I m puttin it off I m puttin it off for a year or two CHAPTER XIII WILLIAM AND THE ANCIENT SOULS The house next William s had been unoccupied for several months and William made full use of its garden Its garden was in turns a jungle a desert an ocean and an enchanted island William invited select parties of his friends to it He had come to look upon it as his own property He hunted wild animals in it with Jumble his trusty hound he tracked Red Indians in it again with Jumble his trusty hound and he attacked and sank ships in it making his victims walk the plank again with the help and assistance of Jumble his trusty hound Sometimes to vary the monotony he made Jumble his trusty hound walk the plank into the rain tub This was one of the many unpleasant things that William brought into Jumble s life It was only his intense love for William that reconciled him to his existence Jumble was one of the very few beings who appreciated William The house on the other side was a much smaller one and was occupied by mister Gregorius Lambkin mister Gregorius Lambkin was a very shy and rather elderly bachelor He issued from his front door every morning at half past eight holding a neat little attache case in a neatly gloved hand He spent the day in an insurance office and returned still unruffled and immaculate at about half past six Most people considered him quite dull and negligible but he possessed the supreme virtue in William s eyes of not objecting to William William had suffered much from unsympathetic neighbours who had taken upon themselves to object to such innocent and artistic objects as catapults and pea shooters and cricket balls William had a very soft spot in his heart for mister Gregorius Lambkin William spent a good deal of his time in mister Lambkin s garden during his absence and mister Lambkin seemed to have no objection Other people s gardens always seemed to William to be more attractive than his own especially when he had no right of entry into them There was quite an excitement in the neighbourhood when the empty house was let It was rumoured that the newcomer was a Personage She was the President of the Society of Ancient Souls The Society of Ancient Souls was a society of people who remembered their previous existence The memory usually came in a flash For instance you might remember in a flash when you were looking at a box of matches that you had been Guy Fawkes Or you might look at a cow and remember in a flash that you had been Nebuchadnezzar Then you joined the Society of Ancient Souls and paid a large subscription and attended meetings at the house of its President in costume And the President was coming to live next door to William By a curious coincidence her name was Gregoria Miss Gregoria Mush William awaited her coming with anxiety He had discovered that one s next door neighbours make a great difference to one s life They may be agreeable and not object to mouth organs and whistling and occasional stone throwing or they may not They sometimes the worst kind go to the length of writing notes to one s father about one and then of course the only course left to one is one of Revenge But William hoped great things from Miss Gregoria Mush There was a friendly sound about the name On the evening of her arrival he climbed up on the roller and gazed wistfully over the fence at the territory that had once been his but from which he was now debarred He felt like Moses surveying the Promised Land Miss Gregoria Mush was walking in the garden William watched her with bated breath She was very long and very thin and very angular and she was reading poetry out loud to herself as she trailed about in her long draperies Oh moon of my delight she declaimed then her eye met William s The eyes beneath her pince nez were like little gimlets How dare you stare at me you rude boy she said William gasped Illustration HOW DARE YOU STARE AT ME YOU RUDE BOY SHE SAID I shall write to your father she said fiercely and then proceeded still ferociously that knows no wane Crumbs murmured William descending slowly from his perch She did write to his father and that note was the first of many She objected to his singing she objected to his shouting she objected to his watching her over the wall and she objected to his throwing sticks at her cat She objected both verbally and in writing This persecution was only partly compensated for by occasional glimpses of meetings of the Ancient Souls For the Ancient Souls met in costume and sometimes William could squeeze through the hole in the fence and watch the Ancient Souls meeting in the dining room Miss Gregoria Mush arrayed as Mary Queen of Scots one of her many previous existences was worth watching And always there was the garden on the other side mister Gregorius Lambkin made no objections and wrote no notes But clouds of Fate were gathering round mister Gregorius Lambkin William first heard of it one day at lunch I saw the old luny talking to poor little Lambkin to day said Robert William s elder brother In these terms did Robert refer to the august President of the Society of Ancient Souls And the next news Robert brought home was that poor little Lambkin had joined the Society of Ancient Souls but didn t seem to want to talk about it He seemed very vague as to his previous existence but he said that Miss Gregoria Mush was sure that he had been Julius Caesar The knowledge had come to her in a flash when he raised his hat and she saw his bald head There was a meeting of the Ancient Souls that evening and William crept through the hole and up to the dining room window to watch A gorgeous scene met his eye Noah conversed agreeably with Cleopatra in the window seat and by the piano Napoleon discussed the Irish question with Lobengula As William watched his small nose flattened against a corner of the window Nero and Dante arrived having shared a taxi from the station Miss Gregoria Mush tall and gaunt and angular presided in the robes of Mary Queen of Scots which was her favourite previous existence Then mister Gregorius Lambkin arrived He looked as unhappy as it is possible for man to look He was dressed in a toga and a laurel wreath Heat and nervousness had caused his small waxed moustache to droop His toga was too long and his laurel wreath was crooked Miss Gregoria Mush received him effusively She carried him off to a corner seat near the window and there they conversed or to be more accurate she talked and he listened The window was open and William could hear some of the things she said Now you are a member you must come here often you and I the only Ancient Souls in this vicinity we will work together and live only in the Past Have you remembered any other previous existence No Ah try it will come in a flash any time I must come and see your garden I feel that we have much in common you and I We have much to talk about I have all my past life to tell you of what train do you come home by We must be friends real friends I m sure I can help you much in your life as an Ancient Soul Our names are almost the same Fate in some way unites us And mister Lambkin sat miserable and dejected and yet with a certain pathetic resignation For what can one do against Fate Then the President caught sight of William and approached the window Illustration mister LAMBKIN SAT MISERABLE AND DEJECTED AND YET WITH A CERTAIN PATHETIC RESIGNATION Go away boy she called You wicked rude prying boy go away mister Lambkin shot a wretched and apologetic glance at William but William pressed his mouth to the open slit of the window All right missus Jarley s he called then turned and fled William met mister Lambkin on his way to the station the next morning mister Lambkin looked thinner and there were lines of worry on his face I m sorry she sent you away William he said It must have been interesting to watch most interesting to watch I d much rather have watched than but there it s very kind of her to take such an interest in me Most kind But I however she s very kind very kind She very kindly presented me with the costume Hardly suitable perhaps but very kind of her And of course there may be something in it One never knows I may have been Julius Caesar but I hardly think however one must keep an open mind Do you know any Latin William Jus a bit said William guardedly I ve learnt a lot but I don t know much Say some to me It might convey something to me One never knows She seems so sure Talk Latin to me William Hic haec hoc said William obligingly Julius Caesar s reincarnation shook his head No he said I m afraid it doesn t seem to mean anything to me Hunc hanc hoc went on William monotonously I m afraid it s no good said mister Lambkin I m afraid it proves that I m not still one may not retain a knowledge of one s former tongue One must keep an open mind Of course I d prefer not to but one must be fair And she s kind very kind Shaking his head sadly the little man entered the station That evening William heard his father say to his mother She came down to meet him at the station to night I m afraid his doom is sealed He s no power of resistance and she s got her eye on him Who s got her eye on him said William with interest Be quiet said his father with the brusqueness of the male parent But William began to see how things stood And William liked mister Lambkin One evening he saw from his window mister Gregorius Lambkin walking with Miss Gregoria Mush in Miss Gregoria Mush s garden mister Gregorius Lambkin did not look happy William crept down to the hole in the fence and applied his ear to it They were sitting on a seat quite close to his hole Gregorius the President of the Society of Ancient Souls was saying when I found that our names were the same I knew that our destinies were interwoven Yes murmured mister Lambkin It s so kind of you so kind But I m afraid I m overstaying my welcome I must No I must say what is in my heart Gregorius You live on the Past I live in the Past We have a common mission the mission of bringing to the thoughtless and uninitiated the memory of their former lives Gregorius our work would be more valuable if we could do it together if the common destiny that has united our nomenclatures could unite also our lives It s so kind of you murmured the writhing victim so kind I am so unfit I No friend she said kindly I have power enough for both The human speech is so poor an agent is it not A door bell clanged in the house Ah the Committee of the Ancient Souls They were coming from town to night Come here to morrow night at the same time Gregorius and I will tell you what is in my heart Meet me here at this time to morrow evening William here caught sight of a stray cat at the other end of the garden In the character of a cannibal chief he hunted the white man otherwise the cat with blood curdling war whoops but felt no real interest in the chase He bound up his scratches mechanically with an ink stained handkerchief Then he went indoors Robert was conversing with his friend in the library Well said the friend it s nearly next month Has she landed him yet By Jove said Robert First of April to morrow He looked at William suspiciously And if you try any fool s tricks on me you ll jolly well hear about it I m not thinkin of you said William crushingly I m not goin to trouble with you Has she landed him said the friend Not yet and I heard him saying in the train that he was leaving town on the second and going abroad for a holiday Well she ll probably do it yet She s got all the first It s bedtime William called his Mother Thank heaven said Robert William sat gazing into the distance not seeing or hearing William called his mother All right said William irritably I m jus thinkin something out William s family went about their ways cautiously the next morning They watched William carefully Robert even refused an egg at breakfast because you never knew with that little wretch But nothing happened Fancy your going on April Fool s day without making a fool of anyone said Robert at lunch It s not over is it not yet said William with the air of a sphinx But it doesn t count after twelve said Robert William considered deeply before he spoke then he said slowly The thing what I m going to do counts whatever time it is Reluctantly but as if drawn by a magnet mister Lambkin set off to the President s house William was in the road She told me to tell you said William unblushingly that she was busy to night an would you mind not coming The tense lines of mister Lambkin s face relaxed Oh William he said it s a great relief I m going away early to morrow but I was afraid that to night he was almost hysterical with relief She s so kind but I was afraid that well well I can t say I m sorry I d promised to come and I couldn t break it But I was afraid and I hear she s sold her house and is leaving in a month so but she s kind very kind He turned back with alacrity Thanks for letting me have the clothes said William Oh quite welcome William They re nice things for a boy to dress up in no doubt I can t say I but she s very kind Don t let her see you playing with them William William grunted and returned to his back garden Illustration GREGORIUS SAID THE PRESIDENT HOW DEAR OF YOU TO COME IN COSTUME THE FIGURE MADE NO MOVEMENT For some time silence reigned over the three back gardens Then Miss Gregoria Mush emerged and came towards the seat by the fence A figure was already seated there in the half dusk a figure swathed in a toga with the toga drawn also over its drooping head Gregorius said the President How dear of you to come in costume The figure made no movement You know what I have in my heart Gregorius Still no answer Your heart is too full for words she said kindly The thought of having your destiny linked with mine takes speech from you But have courage dear Gregorius You shall work for me We will do great things together We will be married at the little church Still no answer Gregorius she murmured tenderly She leant against him suddenly and he yielded beneath the pressure with a sudden sound of dissolution Two cushions slid to the ground the toga fell back revealing a broomstick with a turnip fixed firmly to the top It bore the legend Illustration APRIL FOOL And from the other side of the fence came a deep sigh of satisfaction from the artist behind the scenes CHAPTER XIV WILLIAM S CHRISTMAS EVE It was Christmas The air was full of excitement and secrecy William whose old time faith in notes to Father Christmas sent up the chimney had died a natural death as the result of bitter experience had thoughtfully presented each of his friends and relations with a list of his immediate requirements Things I want for Crismus one A Bicycle two A grammerfone three A pony four A snake five A monkey six A Bugal seven A trumpit eight A red Injun uniform nine A lot of sweets ten A lot of books He had a vague and not unfounded misgiving that his family would begin at the bottom of the list instead of the top He was not surprised therefore when he saw his father come home rather later than usual carrying a parcel of books under his arm A few days afterwards he announced casually at breakfast Well I only hope no one gives me The Great Chief or The Pirate Ship or The Land of Danger for Christmas His father started Why he said sharply Jus cause I ve read them that s all explained William with a bland look of innocence The glance that mister Brown threw at his offspring was not altogether devoid of suspicion but he said nothing He set off after breakfast with the same parcel of books under his arm and returned with another This time however he did not put them in the library cupboard and William searched in vain The question of Christmas festivities loomed large upon the social horizon Robert and Ethel can have their party on the day before Christmas Eve decided missus Brown and then William can have his on Christmas Eve William surveyed his elder brother and sister gloomily Yes an us eat up jus what they ve left he said with bitterness I know missus Brown changed the subject hastily Now let s see whom we ll have for your party William she said taking out pencil and paper You say whom you d like and I ll make a list Ginger an Douglas an Henry and Joan said William promptly Yes Who else I d like the milkman You can t have the milkman William Don t be so foolish Well I d like to have Fisty Green He can whistle with his fingers in his mouth He s a butcher s boy William You can t have him Well who can I have Johnnie Brent I don t like him But you must invite him He asked you to his Well I didn t want to go irritably you made me But if he asks you to his you must ask him back You don t want me to invite folks I don t want William said in the voice of one goaded against his will into exasperation You must invite people who invite you said missus Brown firmly that s what we always do in parties Then they ve got to invite you again and it goes on and on and on argued William Where s the sense of it I don t like Johnnie Brent an he don t like me an if we go on inviting each other an our mothers go on making us go it ll go on and on and on Where s the sense of it I only jus want to know where s the sense of it His logic was unanswerable Well anyway William I ll draw up the list You can go and play William walked away frowning with his hands in his pockets Where s the sense of it he muttered as he went He began to wend his way towards the spot where he and Douglas and Ginger and Henry met daily in order to wile away the hours of the Christmas holidays At present they lived and moved and had their being in the characters of Indian Chiefs As William walked down the back street which led by a short cut to their meeting place he unconsciously assumed an arrogant strut suggestive of some warrior prince surrounded by his gallant braves Garn Swank He turned with a dark scowl On a doorstep sat a little girl gazing up at him with blue eyes beneath a tousled mop of auburn hair William s eye travelled sternly from her Titian curls to her bare feet He assumed a threatening attitude and scowled fiercely You better not say that again he said darkly Why not she said with a jeering laugh Well you d just better not he said with a still more ferocious scowl What d you do she persisted He considered for a moment in silence Then You d see what I d do he said ominously Garn Swank she repeated Now do it Go on do it I ll let you off this time he said judicially Garn Softie You can t do anything you can t You re a softie I could cut your head off an scalp you an leave you hanging on a tree I could he said fiercely an I will too if you go on calling me names Softie Swank Now cut it off Go on He looked down at her mocking blue eyes You re jolly lucky I don t start on you he said threateningly Folks I do start on soon get sorry I can tell you Illustration GARN SWANK WILLIAM TURNED WITH A DARK SCOWL What you do to them He changed the subject abruptly What s your name he said Sheila What s yours Red Hand I mean William I ll tell you sumpthin if you ll come an sit down by me What ll you tell me Sumpthin I bet you don t know I bet I do Well come here an I ll tell you He advanced towards her suspiciously Through the open door he could see a bed in a corner of the dark dirty room and a woman s white face upon the pillow Oh come on said the little girl impatiently He came on and sat down beside her Well he said condescendingly I bet I knew all the time No you didn t D you know she sank her voice to a confidential whisper there s a chap called Father Christmas wot comes down chimneys Christmas Eve and leaves presents in people s houses He gave a scornful laugh Oh that rot You don t believe that rot do you Rot she repeated indignantly Why it s true true as true A boy told me wot had hanged his stocking up by the chimney an in the morning it was full of things an they was jus the things wot he d wrote on a bit of paper an thrown up the chimney to this ere Christmas chap Only kids believe that rot persisted William I left off believin it years and years ago Her face grew pink with the effort of convincing him But the boy told me the boy wot got things from this ere chap wot comes down chimneys An I ve wrote wot I want an sent it up the chimney Don t you think I ll get it William looked down at her Her blue eyes big with apprehension were fixed on him her little rosy lips were parted William s heart softened I dunno he said doubtfully You might I s pose What d you want for Christmas You won t tell if I tell you No Not to no one No Say Cross me throat William complied with much interest and stored up the phrase for future use Well she sank her voice very low and spoke into his ear Dad s comin out Christmas Eve She leant back and watched him anxious to see the effect of this stupendous piece of news Her face expressed pride and delight William s merely bewilderment Comin out he repeated Comin out of where Her expression changed to one of scorn Prison of course Silly William was half offended half thrilled Well I couldn t know it was prison could I How could I know it was prison without bein told It might of been out of anything What in hushed curiosity and awe what was he in prison for Stealin Her pride was unmistakable William looked at her in disapproval Stealin s wicked he said virtuously Huh she jeered you can t steal You re too soft Softie You can t steal without bein copped fust go you can t I could he said indignantly And any way he got copped di n t he or he d not of been in prison so there He di n t get copped fust go It was jus a sorter mistake he said He said it wun t happen again He s a jolly good stealer The cops said he was and they oughter know Well said William changing the conversation what d you want for Christmas I wrote it on a bit of paper an sent it up the chimney she said confidingly I said I di n t want no toys nor sweeties nor nuffin I said I only wanted a nice supper for Dad when he comes out Christmas Eve We ain t got much money me an Mother an we carn t get im much of a spread but if this ere Christmas chap sends one fer im it ll be fine Her eyes were dreamy with ecstasy William stirred uneasily on his seat I tol you it was rot he said There isn t any Father Christmas It s jus an ole tale folks tell you when you re a kid an you find out it s not true He won t send no supper jus cause he isn t anythin He s jus nothin jus an ole tale Oh shut up William turned sharply at the sound of the shrill voice from the bed within the room Let the kid ave a bit of pleasure lookin forward to it can t yer It s little enough she as anyway William arose with dignity All right he said Go bye He strolled away down the street Softie It was a malicious sweet little voice Swank William flushed but forbore to turn round That evening he met the little girl from next door in the road outside her house Hello Joan Hello William In these blue eyes there was no malice or mockery To Joan William was a god like hero His very wickedness partook of the divine Would you would you like to come an make a snow man in our garden William she said tentatively William knit his brows I dunno he said ungraciously I was jus kinder thinkin She looked at him silently hoping that he would deign to tell her his thoughts but not daring to ask Joan held no modern views on the subject of the equality of the sexes Do you remember that ole tale bout Father Christmas Joan he said at last She nodded Well s pose you wanted somethin very bad an you believed that ole tale and sent a bit of paper up the chimney bout what you wanted very bad and then you never got it you d feel kind of rotten wouldn t you She nodded again I did one time she said I sent a lovely list up the chimney and I never told anyone about it and I got lots of things for Christmas and not one of the things I d written for Did you feel awful rotten Yes I did Awful I say Joan importantly I ve gotter secret Do tell me William she pleaded Can t It s a crorse me throat secret She was mystified and impressed How lovely William Is it something you re going to do He considered It might be he said I d love to help She fixed adoring blue eyes upon him Well I ll see said the lord of creation I say Joan you comin to my party Oh yes Well there s an awful lot comin Johnny Brent an all that lot I m jolly well not lookin forward to it I can tell you Oh I m so sorry Why did you ask them William William laughed bitterly Why did I invite them he said I don t invite people to my parties They do that In William s vocabulary they always signified his immediate family circle William had a strong imagination When an idea took hold upon his mind it was almost impossible for him to let it go He was quite accustomed to Joan s adoring homage The scornful mockery of his auburn haired friend was something quite new and in some strange fashion it intrigued and fascinated him Mentally he recalled her excited little face flushed with eagerness as she described the expected spread Mentally also he conceived a vivid picture of the long waiting on Christmas Eve the slowly fading hope the final bitter disappointment While engaging in furious snowball fights with Ginger Douglas and Henry while annoying peaceful passers by with well aimed snow missiles while bruising himself and most of his family black and blue on long and glassy slides along the garden paths while purloining his family s clothes to adorn various unshapely snowmen while walking across all the ice preferably cracked in the neighbourhood and being several times narrowly rescued from a watery grave while following all these light holiday pursuits the picture of the little auburn haired girl s disappointment was ever vividly present in his mind The day of his party drew near My party he would echo bitterly when anyone of his family mentioned it I don t want it I don t want ole Johnnie Brent an all that lot I d just like to un invite em all But you want Ginger and Douglas and Henry coaxed his Mother I can have them any time an I don t like em at parties They re not the same I don t like anyone at parties I don t want a party But you must have a party William to ask back people who ask you William took up his previous attitude Well where s the sense of it he groaned As usual he had the last word but left his audience unconvinced They began on him a full hour before his guests were due He was brushed and scrubbed and scoured and cleaned He was compressed into an Eton suit and patent leather pumps and finally deposited in the drawing room cowed and despondent his noble spirit all but broken The guests began to arrive William shook hands politely with three strangers shining with soap brushed to excess and clothed in ceremonial Eton suits who in ordinary life were Ginger Douglas and Henry They then sat down and gazed at each other in strained and unnatural silence They could find nothing to say to each other Ordinary topics seemed to be precluded by their festive appearance and the formal nature of the occasion Their informal meetings were usually celebrated by impromptu wrestling matches This being debarred a stiff unnatural atmosphere descended upon them William was a host they were guests they had all listened to final maternal admonitions in which the word manners and politeness recurred at frequent intervals They were in fact for the time being complete strangers Then Joan arrived and broke the constrained silence Hullo William Oh William you do look nice William smiled with distant politeness but his heart warmed to her It is always some comfort to learn that one has not suffered in vain How d you do he said with a stiff bow Then Johnnie Brent came and after him a host of small boys and girls William greeted friends and foes alike with the same icy courtesy Then the conjurer arrived missus Brown had planned the arrangement most carefully The supper was laid on the big dining room table There was to be conjuring for an hour before supper to break the ice In the meantime while the conjuring was going on the grown ups who were officiating at the party were to have their meal in peace in the library William had met the conjurer at various parties and despised him utterly He despised his futile jokes and high pitched laugh and he knew his tricks by heart They sat in rows in front of him shining faced well brushed little boys in dark Eton suits and gleaming collars and dainty white dressed little girls with gay hair ribbons William sat in the back row near the window and next him sat Joan She gazed at his set expressionless face in mute sympathy He listened to the monotonous voice of the conjurer Now ladies and gentlemen I will proceed to swallow these three needles and these three strands of cotton and shortly to bring out each needle threaded with a strand of cotton Will any lady step forward and examine the needles Ladies ought to know all about needles oughtn t they You young gentlemen don t learn to sew at school do you Ha Ha Perhaps some of you young gentlemen don t know what a needle is Ha Ha William scowled and his thoughts flew off to the little house in the dirty back street It was Christmas Eve Her father was comin out She would be waiting watching with bright expectant eyes for the spread she had demanded from Father Christmas to welcome her returning parent It was a beastly shame She was a silly little ass anyway not to believe him He d told her there wasn t any Father Christmas Now ladies and gentlemen I will bring out the three needles threaded with the three strands of cotton Watch carefully ladies and gentlemen There One Two Three Now I don t advise you young ladies and gentlemen to try this trick Needles are very indigestible to some people Ha Ha Not to me of course I can digest anything needles or marbles or matches or glass bowls as you will soon see Ha Ha Now to proceed ladies and gentlemen William looked at the clock and sighed Anyway there d be supper soon and that was a jolly good one cause he d had a look at it Suddenly the inscrutable look left his countenance He gave a sudden gasp and his whole face lit up Joan turned to him Come on he whispered rising stealthily from his seat The room was in half darkness and the conjurer was just producing a white rabbit from his left toe so that few noticed William s quiet exit by the window followed by that of the blindly obedient Joan You wait he whispered in the darkness of the garden She waited shivering in her little white muslin dress till he returned from the stable wheeling a hand cart consisting of a large packing case on wheels and finished with a handle He wheeled it round to the open French window that led into the dining room Come on he whispered again Illustration FEW NOTICED WILLIAM S EXIT BY THE WINDOW FOLLOWED BY THE BLINDLY OBEDIENT JOAN Following his example she began to carry the plates of sandwiches sausage rolls meat pies bread and butter cakes and biscuits of every variety from the table to the hand cart On the top they balanced carefully the plates of jelly and blanc mange and dishes of trifle and round the sides they packed armfuls of crackers At the end she whispered softly What s it for William It s the secret he said The crorse me throat secret I told you Am I going to help she said in delight He nodded Jus wait a minute he added and crept from the dining room to the hall and upstairs He returned with a bundle of clothing which he proceeded to arrange in the garden He first donned his own red dressing gown and then wound a white scarf round his head tying it under his chin so that the ends hung down I m makin believe I m Father Christmas he deigned to explain An I m makin believe this white stuff is hair an beard An this is for you to wear so s you won t get cold He held out a little white satin cloak edged with swansdown Oh how lovely William But it s not my cloak It s Sadie Murford s Never mind you can wear it said William generously Then taking the handles of the cart he set off down the drive From the drawing room came the sound of a chorus of delight as the conjurer produced a goldfish in a glass bowl from his head From the kitchen came the sound of the hilarious laughter of the maids Only in the dining room with its horrible expanse of empty table was silence They walked down the road without speaking till Joan gave a little excited laugh This is fun William I do wonder what we re going to do You ll see said William I d better not tell you yet I promised a crorse me throat promise I wouldn t tell anyone All right William she said sweetly I don t mind a bit The evening was dark and rather foggy so that the strange couple attracted little attention except when passing beneath the street lamps Then certainly people stood still and looked at William and his cart in open mouthed amazement At last they turned down a back street towards a door that stood open to the dark foggy night Inside the room was a bare table at which sat a little girl her blue anxious eyes fixed on the open door I hope he gets here before Dad she said I wouldn t like Dad to come and find it not ready The woman on the bed closed her eyes wearily I don t think he ll come now dearie We must just get on without it The little girl sprang up her pale cheek suddenly flushed Oh listen she cried something s coming They listened in breathless silence while the sound of wheels came down the street towards the empty door Then an old hand cart appeared in the doorway and behind it William in his strange attire and Joan in her fairy like white white cloak white dress white socks and shoes her bright curls clustered with gleaming fog jewels The little girl clasped her hands Her face broke into a rapt smile Her blue eyes were like stars Illustration FIRST THE JELLIES AND BLANC MANGES THEN THE MEAT PIES AND TRIFLES Oh oh she cried It s Father Christmas and a fairy Without a word William pushed the cart through the doorway into the room and began to remove its contents and place them on the table First the jellies and trifles and blanc manges then the meat pies pastries sausage rolls sandwiches biscuits and cakes sugar coated cream interlayered full of plums and nuts and fruit William s mother had had wide experience and knew well what food most appealed to small boys and girls Moreover she had provided plentifully for her twenty guests The little girl was past speech The woman looked at them in dumb wonder Then Why you re the boy she was talkin to she said at last It s real kind of you She was gettin that upset It ud have broke her heart if nothin had come an I couldn t do nothin It s real kind of yer sir Her eyes were misty Joan placed the last cake on the table and William who was rather warm after his exertions removed his scarf The child gave a little sobbing laugh Oh isn t it lovely I m so happy You re the funny boy aren t you dressed up as Father Christmas Or did Father Christmas send you Or were you Father Christmas all the time May I kiss the fairy Would she mind She s so beautiful Joan came forward and kissed her shyly and the woman on the bed smiled unsteadily It s real kind of you both she murmured again Then the door opened and the lord and master of the house entered after his six months absence He came in no sheepish hang dog fashion He entered cheerily and boisterously as any parent might on returning from a hard earned holiday Ello Missus Ello Kid Ello Wot s all this ere His eyes fell upon William Ello young gent Happy Christmas William murmured politely Sime to you an many of them Ow are you Missus Kid looked arter you all right That s right Oh I sye Where s the grub come from Fair mikes me mouth water I aven t seen nuffin like this not fer some time There was a torrent of explanations everyone talking at once He gave a loud guffaw at the end Well we re much obliged to this young gent and this little lady and now we ll ave a good ole supper This is all right this is Now Missus you ave a good feed Now fore we begin I sye three cheers fer the young gent and little lady Come on now Ip ip ip ooray Now little lady you come ere That s fine that is Now oo ll ave a meat pie Oo s fer a meat pie Come on Missus That s right We ll all ave meat pies This ere s sumfin like Christmas eh We ve not ad a Christmas like this not for many a long year Now urry up Kid Don t spend all yer time larfin Now ladies an gents oo s fer a sausage roll All of us Come on then I mustn t eat too eavy or I won t be able to sing to yer aterwards will I I ve got some fine songs young gent And Kid ere ll dance fer yer She s a fine little dancer she is Now come on ladies an gents sandwiches More pies Come on They laughed and chattered merrily The woman sat up in bed her eyes bright and her cheeks flushed To William and Joan it was like some strange and wonderful dream And at that precise moment missus Brown had sunk down upon the nearest dining room chair on the verge of tears and twenty pairs of hungry horrified eyes in twenty clean staring open mouthed little faces surveyed the bare expanse of the dining room table And the cry that went up all round was Where s William And then Where s Joan They searched the house and garden and stable for them in vain They sent the twenty enraged guests home supperless and aggrieved Has William eaten all our suppers they said Where is he Is he dead People will never forget wailed missus Brown It s simply dreadful And where is William They rang up police stations for miles around If they ve eaten all that food the two of them said missus Brown almost distraught they ll die They may be dying in some hospital now And I do wish missus Murford would stop ringing up about Sadie s cloak I ve told her it s not here Meantime there was dancing and singing and games and cracker pulling in a small house in a back street not very far away I ve never had such a lovely time in my life gasped the Kid breathlessly at the end of one of the many games into which William had initiated them I ve never never never We won t ferget you in a urry young man her father added nor the little lady neither We ll ave many talks about this ere Joan was sitting on the bed laughing and panting her curls all disordered I wish said William wistfully I wish you d let me come with you when you go stealin some day I m not goin stealin no more young gent said his friend solemnly I got a job a real steady job brick layin an I m goin to stick to it All good things must come to an end and soon William donned his red dressing gown again and Joan her borrowed cloak and they helped to store the remnants of the feast in the larder the remnants of the feast would provide the ex burglar and his family with food for many days to come Then they took the empty hand cart and after many fond farewells set off homeward through the dark mister Brown had come home and assumed charge of operations Ethel was weeping on the sofa in the library Oh dear little William she sobbed I do wish I d always been kind to him missus Brown was reclining pale and haggard in the arm chair There s the Roughborough Canal John she was saying weakly And Joan s mother will always say it was our fault Oh poor little William It s a good ten miles away said her husband drily I don t think even William He rang up fiercely Confound these brainless police Hallo Any news A boy and girl and supper for twenty can t disappear off the face of the earth No there had been no trouble at home There probably will be when he turns up but there was none before If he wanted to run away why would he burden himself with a supper for twenty Why one minute The front door opened and missus Brown ran into the hall A well known voice was heard speaking quickly and irritably I jus went away that s all I jus thought of something I wanted to do that s all Yes I did take the supper I jus wanted it for something It s a secret what I wanted it for I Illustration WASN T SHE A JOLLY LITTLE KID WILLIAM SAID EAGERLY William said mister Brown Through the scenes that followed William preserved a dignified silence even to the point of refusing any explanation Such explanation as there was filtered through from Joan s mother by means of the telephone It was all William s idea Joan s mother said plaintively Joan would never have done anything if William hadn t practically made her I expect she s caught her death of cold She s in bed now Yes so is William I can t think what they wanted to take all the food for And he was just a common man straight from prison It s dreadful I do hope they haven t picked up any awful language Have you given Joan some quinine Oh missus Murford s just rung up to see if Sadie s cloak has turned up Will you send it round I feel so upset by it all If it wasn t Christmas Eve The houses occupied by William s and Joan s families respectively were semi detached but William s and Joan s bedroom windows faced each other and there was only about five yards between them Illustration YES A PAUSE THEN WILLIAM YOU DON T LIKE HER BETTER THAN ME DO YOU There came to William s ears as he lay drowsily in bed the sound of a gentle rattle at the window He got up and opened it At the opposite window a little white robed figure leant out whose golden curls shone in the starlight William she whispered I threw some beads to see if you were awake Were your folks mad Awful said William laconically Mine were too I di n t care did you No I di n t Not a bit William wasn t it fun I wish it was just beginning again don t you Yes I jus do I say Joan wasn t she a jolly little kid and di n t she dance fine Yes a pause then William you don t like her better n me do you William considered No I don t he said at last A soft sigh of relief came through the darkness I m so glad Go night William Go night said William sleepily drawing down his window as he spoke END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MORE WILLIAM This file
