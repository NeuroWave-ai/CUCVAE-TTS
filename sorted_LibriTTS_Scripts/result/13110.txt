her cosy New York apartment here is something that will make you sit up and take notice My dear Patsy was the reply it s already sitting up I am an taking waffles If anything at all would make me take notice it s your own pretty phiz Major remarked Uncle John helping himself to waffles from a fresh plate Nora brought in you Irish are such confirmed flatterers that you flatter your own daughters Patsy isn t at all pretty this morning She s too red and freckled Patsy laughed and her blue eyes danced That comes from living on your old farm at Millville she retorted We ve only been back three days and the sunburn sticks to me like a burr to a kitten Pay no attention to the ould rascal Patsy advised the Major composedly An stop wavin that letter like a white flag of surrender Who s it from Kenneth Aha An how is our lad Why he s got himself into a peck of trouble That s what I want to talk to you and Uncle John about she replied her happy face growing as serious as it could ever become Can t he wiggle out asked Uncle John Out of what His trouble It seems not Listen Oh tell us about it lassie said the Major If I judge right there s some sixty pages in that epistle Don t bother to read it again But every word is important declared Patsy turning the letter over except the last page with a swift flush Uncle John laughed His shrewd old eyes saw everything Then read us the last page my dear I ll tell you about it said Patsy quickly It s this way you see Kenneth has gone into politics More power to his elbow exclaimed the Major I can t imagine it in Kenneth said Uncle John soberly What s he in for For for let s see Oh here it is For member of the House of Representatives from the Eighth District He s flying high for a fledgling observed the Major But Kenneth s a bright lad and a big gun in his county He ll win hands down Patsy shook her head He s afraid not she said and it s worrying him to death He doesn t like to be beaten and that s what s troubling him Uncle John pushed back his chair Poor boy he said What ever induced him to attempt such a thing He wanted to defeat a bad man who now represents Kenneth s district explained Patsy whose wise little head was full of her friend s difficulties and And the bad man objects to the idea and won t be defeated added the Major It s a way these bad men have Uncle John was looking very serious indeed and Patsy regarded him gratefully Her father never would be serious where Kenneth was concerned Perhaps in his heart the grizzled old Major was a bit jealous of the boy I think said the girl that mister Watson got Ken into politics for he surely wouldn t have undertaken such a thing himself And now he s in he finds he s doomed to defeat and it s breaking his heart Uncle John The little man nodded silently His chubby face was for once destitute of a smile That meant a good deal with Uncle John and Patsy knew she had interested him in Kenneth s troubles Once said the Major from behind the morning paper I was in politics meself I ran for coroner an got two whole votes me own an the undertaker s It s because the public s so indiscriminating that I ve not run for anything since except th street car But it s a big game said Uncle John standing at the window with his hands deep in his pockets and an important game Every good American should take an interest in politics and Kenneth especially who has such large landed interests ought to direct the political affairs of his district I m much interested in politics too Uncle declared the girl If I were a man I d I d be President An I d vote fer ye twenty times a day mavourneen cried the Major But luckily ye ll be no president unless it s of a woman s club There s the bell cried Patsy It must be the girls No one else would call so early It s Beth s voice talking to Nora added her father listening and then the door flew open and in came two girls whose bright and eager faces might well warrant the warm welcome they received Oh Louise cried Patsy however did you get up so early I ve got a letter from Kenneth was the answer and I m so excited I couldn t wait a minute Imagine Louise being excited said Beth calmly as she kissed Uncle John and sat down by Patsy s side She read her letter in bed and bounced out of bed like a cannon ball We dressed like the lightning change artist at the vaudeville and I m sure our hats are not on straight This bids fair to be a strenuous day observed the Major Patsy s had a letter from the boy herself Oh did you inquired Louise and do you know all about it dear She knows sixty pages about it replied Major Doyle Well then what s to be done The question was addressed to Patsy who was not prepared to reply The three cousins first exchanged inquiring glances and then turned their eager eyes upon the broad chubby back of Uncle John who maintained his position at the window as if determined to shut out the morning sunlight Louise Merrick lived with her mother a few blocks away from Patsy s apartment and her cousin Beth DeGraf was staying with her for a time They had all spent the summer with Uncle John at Millville and had only returned to New York a few days before Beth s home was in Ohio but there was so little sympathy between the girl and her parents that she was happy only when away from them Her mother was Uncle John s sister but as selfish and cold as Uncle John was generous and genial Beth s father was a genius and a professor of music one of those geniuses who live only in their own atmosphere and forget there is a world around them So Beth had a loveless and disappointed childhood and only after Uncle John arrived from the far west and took his three nieces under his wing as he said did her life assume any brightness or interest Her new surroundings however had developed Beth s character wonderfully and although she still had her periods of sullen depression she was generally as gay and lovable as her two cousins but in a quieter and more self possessed way Louise was the eldest a fair dainty creature with that indescribable air which invariably wins the admiring regard of all beholders Whatever gown the girl wore looked appropriate and becoming and her manner was as delightful as her appearance She was somewhat frivolous and designing in character but warm hearted and staunch in her friendships Indeed Louise was one of those girls who are so complex as to be a puzzle to everyone including themselves Beth DeGraf was the beauty of the group of three and she also possessed great depth of character Beth did not like herself very well and was always afraid others would fail to like her so she did not win friends as easily as did Louise But those who knew the beautiful girl intimately could read much to admire in the depth of her great dark eyes and she was not the least interesting of the three nieces whose fortunes had been so greatly influenced by Aunt Jane and Uncle John Merrick But Patricia Doyle usually called Patsy by her friends was after all the general favorite with strangers and friends alike There was a subtle magnetism about the girl s laughing freckled face and dancing blue eyes that could not well be resisted Patsy was not beautiful she was not accomplished she had no especial air of distinction But she was winning from the top of her red hair to the tips of her toes and so absolutely unaffected that she won all hearts And for wisdom she s got Solomon beat to a frazzle declared the Major to Uncle John in discussing his daughter s character But it is possible that Major Doyle was prejudiced Well what s to be done demanded Louise for the second time We don t vote in Ken s district remarked the Major or there would be six votes to his credit and that would beat my own record by four Ken is so impressionable that I m afraid this defeat will ruin his life said Beth softly I wish we could get him away Couldn t we get him to withdraw He might be suddenly called to Europe suggested Louise That would take him away from the place and give him a change of scene Patsy shook her head Kenneth isn t a coward she said He won t run away He must accept his defeat like a man and some time try again Eh Uncle John Uncle John turned around and regarded his three nieces critically What makes you think he will be defeated he asked He says so himself answered Patsy He writes me he can see no hope for the people are all against him added Louise Pah said Uncle John contemptuously What else does the idiot say That he s lonely and discouraged and had to pour out his heart to some one or go wild said Patsy the tears of sympathy filling her eyes And you girls propose to sit down and allow all this inquired their uncle sternly We answered Louise lifting her brows and making a pretty gesture What can we do Go to work said Uncle John How asked Patsy eagerly Politics is a game declared mister Merrick It s never won until the last card is played And success doesn t lie so much in the cards as the way you play em Here are three girls with plenty of shrewdness and energy Why don t you take a hand in the game and win it Oh Uncle John The proposition was certainly disconcerting at first
6828_68770_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
none	none	yes laughed the Major derisively Put on some blue stockings read the history of woman s suffrage cultivate a liking for depraved eggs and then face Kenneth s enraged constituents I shouldn t mind daddy if it would help Kenneth any declared Patsy stoutly Go on Uncle John said Beth encouragingly Women in politics observed their uncle have often been a tremendous power You won t need to humiliate yourselves my dears All you ll need to do is to exercise your wits and work earnestly for the cause There are a hundred ways to do that Mention a few proposed the Major I will when I get to Elmhurst and look over the ground answered Uncle John You re going on then Yes I ll go with you said Patsy promptly So will I said Beth Kenneth needs moral encouragement and support as much as anything else just now He s imagining all sorts of horrors and making himself miserable said Louise Let s all go Uncle and try to cheer him up By this time Uncle John was smiling genially Why I was sure of you my dears from the first he said The Major s an old croaker but he d go too if it were not necessary for him to stay in New York and attend to business But we mustn t lose any time if we re going to direct the politics of the Eighth District Election the eighth of November I can go any time and so can Beth said Louise All I need is the blue stockings laughed Patsy It won t be play This means work said Uncle John seriously Well I believe we re capable of a certain amount of work replied Beth Aren t we girls We are All right said mister Merrick I ll go and look up the next train Go home Louise and pack up I ll telephone you That bad man d better look out chuckled the Major He doesn t suspect that an army of invasion is coming Daddy cried Patsy you hush up We mean business If you win said the Major I ll run for alderman on a petticoat platform and hire your services CHAPTER II THE ARTIST To most people the great rambling mansion at Elmhurst with its ample grounds and profusion of flowers and shrubbery would afford endless delight But Kenneth Forbes the youthful proprietor was at times dreadfully bored by the loneliness of it all though no one could better have appreciated the beauties of his fine estate The town an insignificant village was five miles distant and surrounding the mansion were many broad acres which rather isolated it from its neighbors Moreover Elmhurst was the one important estate in the county and the simple hard working farmers in its vicinity considered justly enough that the owner was wholly out of their class This was not the owner s fault and Kenneth had brooded upon the matter until he had come to regard it as a distinct misfortune For it isolated him and deprived him of any social intercourse with his neighbors The boy had come to live at Elmhurst when he was a mere child but only as a dependent upon the charities of Aunt Jane who had accepted the charge of the orphan because he was a nephew of her dead lover who had bequeathed her his estate of Elmhurst Aunt Jane was Kenneth s aunt merely in name since she had never even married the uncle to whom she had been betrothed and who had been killed in an accident before the boy was born She was an irritable old woman as Kenneth knew her and had never shown him any love or consideration He grew up in a secluded corner of the great house tended merely by servants and suffered to play in those quarters of the ample grounds which Aunt Jane did not herself visit The neglect which Kenneth had suffered and his lonely life had influenced the youth s temperament and he was far from being an agreeable companion at the time Aunt Jane summoned her three nieces to Elmhurst in order to choose one of them as her heiress These girls bright cheery and wholesome as they were penetrated the boy s reserve and drew him out of his misanthropic moods They discovered that he had remarkable talent as an artist and encouraged him to draw and paint something he had long loved to do in secret Then came the great surprise of the boy s life which changed his condition from one of dependency into affluence Aunt Jane died and it was discovered that she had no right to transfer the estate to one of her nieces because by the terms of his uncle s deed to her the property reverted on her death to Kenneth himself Louise Merrick Beth DeGraf and Patsy Doyle the three nieces were really glad that the boy inherited Elmhurst and returned to their eastern homes with the most cordial friendship existing between them all Kenneth was left the master of Elmhurst and possessor of considerable wealth besides and at first he could scarcely realize his good fortune or decide how to take advantage of it He had one good and helpful friend an old lawyer named Watson who had not only been a friend of his uncle and the confidant of Aunt Jane for years but had taken an interest in the lonely boy and had done his best to make his life brighter and happier When Kenneth became a landed proprietor mister Watson was appointed his guardian and the genial old lawyer abandoned the practice of law and henceforth devoted himself to his ward s welfare and service They made a trip to Europe together where Kenneth studied the pictures of the old masters and obtained instruction from some of the foremost living artists of the old world It was while they were abroad a year before the time of this story that the boy met Aunt Jane s three nieces again They were doing Europe in company with a wealthy bachelor uncle John Merrick a generous kind hearted and simple minded old gentleman who had taken the girls under his wing as he expressed it and had really provided for their worldly welfare better than Aunt Jane his sister could have done This Uncle John was indeed a whimsical character as the reader will presently perceive Becoming a millionaire against his will as he declared he had learned to know his nieces late in life and found in their society so much to enjoy that he was now wholly devoted to their interests His one friend was Major Doyle Patsy s father a dignified but agreeable old Irish gentleman who amused Uncle John nearly as much as the girls delighted him The Major managed John Merrick s financial affairs leaving the old millionaire free to do as he pleased So he took the girls to Europe and the four had a fine adventurous trip as may be imagined Kenneth and mister Watson met them in Sicily and afterward in the Italian cities and the friendship already existing between the young people was more firmly cemented than before In the spring Kenneth returned with his guardian to Elmhurst where he devoted himself largely to painting from the sketches he had made abroad while mister Watson sat beside him comfortably smoking his pipe and reading his favorite authors The elder man was contented enough in his condition but the boy grew restless and impatient and longed for social intercourse His nature was moody and he had a tendency to brood if left much to himself Uncle John had carried his nieces to a farm at Millville in the Adirondack region for the summer so that Kenneth heard but seldom from his friends Such was the disposition of the characters when our story opens Kenneth Forbes although I have called him a boy had attained his majority on the fifteenth day of May At this time mister Watson rendered his accounts and turned over the estate to its owner He would then have retired but Kenneth would not let him go Twenty one years of age sounds mature but the owner of Elmhurst was as boyish and inexperienced as it is possible for one twenty one years old to be He had grown accustomed moreover to depend much on mister Watson s legal acumen in the management of his affairs and would have been embarrassed and bewildered if obliged to shoulder the burden all at once The lawyer who had always had an affection for the young man perceived this clearly so an arrangement was made that he should remain with his young friend indefinitely and strive to teach him such elements of business as would enable him in time to attend to his extensive interests understandingly and wisely The country around Elmhurst is thickly settled with agriculturists for the farms are rich and productive in that part of the state But it is not a flat country and Nature has given it many pretty woodland glades and rocky glens to add to its charm From the hill country at the west came several rushing streams which tumbled along rocky paths to the river nine miles below Elmhurst and there are scenes along these routes that might well delight the eye of an artist Kenneth had often wandered into these out of the way places when a half forgotten neglected lad but had not visited them for years Now however with the spirit of loneliness upon him he suddenly thought of a glen that would make an interesting study for a picture so one morning he mounted his horse and rode away to pay the place a preliminary visit The farmers along the road nodded at the young fellow good naturedly as he passed them Everyone knew him well by sight yet Kenneth could not have named many of his neighbors having held little intercourse with them It struck him this morning that they had little cause to be interested in him He had been an unsociable lad and since he had become master of Elmhurst had done little to cultivate acquaintance with the people who lived around him One reason for this was that they held little in common with him The neighboring farmers were honest thrifty souls and among them were many both shrewd and thoughtful but they naturally would not force themselves upon the society of the one really rich man in their community especially as that man had shown no desire to know them Kenneth was the subject of much speculation among them and opinions widely differed concerning his character Some called him a prig and declared that he was stuck up and conceited Others said he was a namby pamby without brains or wit But there were a few who had occasionally talked with the boy who understood him better and hinted that he might develop into quite a man in time Kenneth surprised himself this morning by greeting several of his neighbors with unusual cordiality He even stopped a man who was driving along the highway to inquire about his horse which he perceived was very lame The boy knew something about horses and suggested a method of treatment that he thought would help the nag a suggestion the farmer received with real gratitude This simple incident cheered Kenneth more than you might suppose and he was actually whistling as he rode through the glen where the country road wound its way beside the noisy rushing stream Pausing in front of the picturesque table rock that he had come to inspect the boy uttered an exclamation of chagrin and disappointment Painted broadly upon the face of the rock in great white letters was the advertisement of a patent medicine The beauty of the scene was ruined only the glaring advertisement caught and held the eye of the observer At first Kenneth s mind held only a feeling of disgust that such a desecration of Nature s gifts to humanity should be allowed Then he remembered another place further along the glen which was almost as pretty as this had been before the defiling brush of the advertiser had ruined it So he spurred his horse and rode up the winding way to the spot There a red lettered announcement of Simpson s Soap stared him in the face This was too much for his temper and his disappointment quickly turned to resentment While he sat on his mare considering the matter the man with the lame horse whom he had passed overtook him Can you tell me Kenneth asked who owns this property Why I do replied the man reining up And you permitted these vile signs to be painted on the rocks demanded the boy angrily O course replied the man with a grin of amusement I can t farm the rocks can I An these ere signs pays me ten dollars a year each Kenneth groaned I ll give you fifteen dollars a year each if you ll let me wash off the letters and restore the scene to its original beauty he declared I m willin was the response But ye see they re contracted I d git into trouble with the sign painter Who is he Lives in Cleveland I ve got his name up t th house if you ll come along He comes up here every spring and paints fences an rocks payin spot cash fer th privilege Oh I see Then he contracts with the soap man an the medicine man to paint up their ads You re the young un from Elmhurst ain t ye Yes Well I d like to earn that extra five well enough My name s Parsons I ve got three signs let on my property in the glen Ef ye ll jest ride up t the house I ll giv ye the feller s name All right Come along said Kenneth with sudden resolve The farmer rode a time in silent thought He could not go fast for the beast was very lame Finally he remarked Ef ye buy up the sign painters so s ye can wash off the letters like enough ye ll hev to pay him fer th paint an paintin too I don t mind was the response The farmer chuckled Here was an interesting adventure for a fact What on earth could possess the young un from Elmhurst to object to signs and be willing to pay for having them erased Like enough ye ll hev to pay back the money the soap an medicine men guv th painter too he hazarded Like enough said Kenneth grimly One of his stubborn moods had seized him At all hazards he was resolved to eliminate those ugly signs He got the name of the sign painter accepted a glass of buttermilk at the farm house and then rode slowly home by another route so that he might not have to face the signs again But on this route he saw even more They were painted on the fences and barns as he passed along He scowled at each one but they did not appear to him quite so inharmonious as those which marred the more picturesque and retired spots which were his favorite haunts

none	none	 DON QUIXOTE 
1649_68762_000003_000000	train-clean-360	When Kenneth got home he told mister Watson of his discovery and asked the old gentleman to write to the sign painter and find out what could be done 
1649_68762_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The lawyer laughed heartily at his young friend s whim but agreed to help him 
1649_68762_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 If you are going to try to prevent rural advertising he remarked you ll find your hands full 
1649_68762_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Kenneth looked up smiling 
6696_68773_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you 
1649_68762_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you he said 
1649_68762_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 For what 
1649_68762_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 For finding me something to do 
1649_68762_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I m sick of this inaction 
1649_68762_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Again the lawyer laughed 
none	none	What is your idea he asked
1649_68762_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 To remove such eyesores as advertising signs from the neighborhood of Elmhurst 
1649_68762_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a Titan s task Ken 
1649_68762_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 So much the better 
1649_68762_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The lawyer grew thoughtful 
1649_68762_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe it s impossible he ventured 
1649_68762_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 impossible 
none	none	he ventured
1649_68762_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Better yet 
1649_68762_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I don t say I ll succeed but I promise to try 
1649_68762_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I want something to occupy myself something really difficult so that I may test my own powers 
1649_68762_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 But my dear boy 
1649_68762_000017_000001	train-clean-360	This foolish proposition isn t worthy your effort 
1649_68762_000017_000002	train-clean-360	If you want to be up and doing we ll find something else to occupy your mind 
1649_68762_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No mister Watson I m set on this 
1649_68762_000018_000001	train-clean-360	It s a crime to allow these signs to flaunt themselves in our prettiest scenes 
none	none	My instinct revolts at the desecration 
1649_68762_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Besides no one else seems to have undertaken the task of exterminating them 
1649_68762_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 True enough 
1649_68762_000019_000001	train-clean-360	If you re serious Ken I ll frankly say the thing can t be done 
1649_68762_000019_000002	train-clean-360	You may perhaps buy the privilege of maintaining the rocks of the glen free from advertising but the advertisers will paint more signs on all the approaches and you won t have gained much 
1649_68762_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll drive every advertising sign out of this country 
none	none	Impossible 
1649_68762_000021_000001	train-clean-360	The great corporations who control these industries make their fortunes by this style of advertising 
none	none	The rural districts are their strongholds 
1649_68762_000021_000003	train-clean-360	And they must advertise or they can t sell their products 
1649_68762_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Let them advertise in decent ways then 
1649_68762_000022_000001	train-clean-360	What right has any soap maker to flaunt his wares in my face whether I m interested in them or not 
1649_68762_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 The right of custom 
none	none	People have submitted to these things so long that the manufacturers consider themselves justified in covering every barn rock and fence with their signs 
1649_68762_000023_000002	train-clean-360	I see no way to stop them 
1649_68762_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Nor I at present 
none	none	But there must be a way
1649_68762_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Drive out one and another will take his place 
none	none	They pay liberally for locations Pshaw 
1649_68762_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Ten dollars a year for a rock as big as a barn 
1649_68762_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 But they rent thousands of such positions and in the aggregate our farmers get large sums from them 
1649_68762_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 And ruin the appearance of their homes and farms 
1649_68762_000029_000000	train-clean-360	mister Watson smiled 
none	none	They re not artists Ken They can t realize on appearances but they can use the money the signs bring them
1649_68762_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 They need to be educated that s all 
1649_68762_000031_000001	train-clean-360	These farmers seem very honest decent fellows 
none	none	They are Ken 
1649_68762_000032_000001	train-clean-360	I wish you knew them better 
none	none	So do I mister Watson 
1649_68762_000033_000001	train-clean-360	This campaign ought to bring us closer together for I mean to get them to help me 
1649_68762_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll have to buy them I m afraid 
1649_68762_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Not all of them 
1649_68762_000035_000001	train-clean-360	There must be some refinement among them 
1649_68762_000036_000000	train-clean-360	But the lawyer was not convinced 
1649_68762_000036_000001	train-clean-360	However it was not his desire to stifle this new born enthusiasm of Kenneth s even though he believed it misdirected 
none	none	He wanted the young man to rouse himself and take an interest in life and if his antagonism to advertising signs would effect this the futile fight against them was to be welcomed 
1649_68762_000036_000003	train-clean-360	It would cost the boy something but he would gain his money s worth in experience 
1649_68762_000037_000000	train-clean-360	After a few days the sign painter answered the letter 
1649_68762_000037_000001	train-clean-360	He would relinquish the three signs in the glen for a payment of fifty dollars each with the understanding that no other competing signs were to take their place 
1649_68762_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Kenneth promptly mailed a check for the amount demanded and early next morning started for the glen with what he called his eliminators 
1649_68762_000038_000000	train-clean-360	These eliminators consisted of two men with cans of turpentine and gasoline and an equipment of scrubbing brushes 
1649_68762_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Parsons the farmer came over to watch this novel proceeding happy in the possession of three crisp five dollar notes given in accordance with the agreement made with him 
1649_68762_000038_000002	train-clean-360	All day the two men scrubbed the rocks faithfully assisted at odd times by their impatient employer but the thick splashes of paint clung desperately to the rugged surface of the rock and the task was a hard one 
1649_68762_000038_000003	train-clean-360	When evening came the letters had almost disappeared when viewed closely but when Kenneth rode to the mouth of the glen on his way home and paused to look back he could see the injunction Take Smith s Liver Pills staring at him in grim defiance of the scrubbing brushes 
none	none	But his energy was not exhausted 
1649_68762_000039_000001	train-clean-360	No one ever knew what it cost in labor and material to erase those three signs but after ten days they had vanished completely and the boy heaved a sigh of satisfaction and turned his attention to extending the campaign 
1649_68762_000040_000000	train-clean-360	On the farm nearest to Elmhurst at the north which belonged to a man named Webb was a barn facing the road that displayed on its side a tobacco sign 
1649_68762_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Kenneth interviewed mister Webb and found that he received no money for the sign but the man contended that the paint preserved his barn from the weather on that side 
1649_68762_000040_000002	train-clean-360	So Kenneth agreed to repaint the entire barn for him and actually had the work done 
1649_68762_000040_000003	train-clean-360	As it took many coats of paint to blot out the sign it was rather a expensive operation 
1649_68762_000041_000000	train-clean-360	By this time the campaign of the youthful proprietor of Elmhurst against advertising signs began to be talked of throughout the county and was the subject of much merriment among the farmers 
1649_68762_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Some of them were intelligent enough to admire the young Quixote and acknowledged frankly that it was a pity to decorate their premises with signs of patent medicines and questionable soaps 
1649_68762_000042_000000	train-clean-360	But the majority of them sneered at the champion and many refused point blank to consider any proposition to discard the advertisements Indeed some were proud of them and believed it a mark of distinction to have their fences and sheds announce an eye remedy or several varieties of pickles 
1649_68762_000043_000000	train-clean-360	mister Watson at first an amused observer of the campaign soon became indignant at the way that Kenneth was ridiculed and reviled and he took a hand in the fight himself 
1649_68762_000043_000001	train-clean-360	He decided to call a meeting of the neighboring farmers at the district school house on Saturday night where Kenneth could address them with logical arguments and endeavor to win them over to his way of thinking 
none	none	The invitation was promptly accepted by the rural population not so much because they were interested in the novel ideas of the young artist as because they expected to be amused by hearing the boyish master of Elmhurst lecture at em So they filled the little room to overflowing and to add to the dignity of the proceedings the honorable Erastus Hopkins State Representative for the district lent his presence to the assemblage 
1649_68762_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Not that the Honorable Erastus cared a fig about this foolish talk of exterminating advertising signs 
none	none	He was himself a large stockholder in a breakfast food factory which painted signs wherever it could secure space 
1649_68762_000045_000002	train-clean-360	These signs were not works of art but they were distinctly helpful to business and only a fool in the opinion of the Honorable Erastus would protest against the inevitable 
1649_68762_000046_000000	train-clean-360	What brought the legislator to the meeting was the fact that he was coming forward for re election in November and believed that this afforded a good chance to meet some of his constituents and make a favorable impression 
none	none	So he came early and shook hands with everyone that arrived and afterward took as prominent a seat as possible 
1649_68762_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Indeed the gathering had at first the appearance of being a political one so entirely did the Representative dominate it 
1649_68762_000047_000001	train-clean-360	But mister Watson took the platform and shyly introduced the speaker of the evening 
1649_68762_000048_000000	train-clean-360	The farmers all knew mister Watson and liked him so when Kenneth rose they prepared to listen in respectful silence 
none	none	Usually a young man making his maiden speech is somewhat diffident but young Forbes was so thoroughly in earnest and so indignant at the opposition that his plans had encountered that he forgot that it was his first public speech and thought only of impressing his hearers with his views exulting in the fact that on this occasion they could not talk back as they usually did in private when he tried to argue with them So he exhorted them earnestly to keep their homes beautiful and free from the degradation of advertising and never to permit glaring commercialism to mar the scenery around them 
1649_68762_000049_000001	train-clean-360	He told them what he had been able to accomplish by himself in a short time how he had redeemed the glen from its disgraceful condition and restored it to its former beauty 
1649_68762_000049_000002	train-clean-360	He asked them to observe Webb s pretty homestead no longer marred by the unsightly sign upon the barn 
1649_68762_000049_000003	train-clean-360	And then he appealed to them to help him in driving all the advertising signs out of the community 
1649_68762_000050_000000	train-clean-360	When he ended they applauded his speech mildly but it was chiefly for the reason that he had spoken so forcibly and well 
1649_68762_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Then the Honorable Erastus Hopkins quick to catch the lack of sympathy in the audience stood up and begged leave to reply to young Forbes 
1649_68762_000052_000000	train-clean-360	He said the objection to advertising signs was only a rich man s aristocratic hobby and that it could not be indulged in a democratic community of honest people 
1649_68762_000052_000001	train-clean-360	His own firm he said bought thousands of bushels of oats from the farmers and converted them into the celebrated Eagle Eye Breakfast Food three packages for a quarter 
1649_68762_000052_000002	train-clean-360	They sold this breakfast food to thousands of farmers to give them health and strength to harvest another crop of oats 
1649_68762_000052_000003	train-clean-360	Thus he benefited the community going and coming What 
none	none	Should he not advertise this mutual benefit commodity wherever he pleased and especially among the farmers 
1649_68762_000052_000005	train-clean-360	What aristocratic notion could prevent him 
1649_68762_000052_000006	train-clean-360	It was a mighty good thing for the farmers to be reminded by means of the signs on their barns and fences of the things they needed in daily life 
1649_68762_000053_000000	train-clean-360	If the young man at Elmhurst would like to be of public service he might find some better way to do so than by advancing such crazy ideas 
1649_68762_000053_000001	train-clean-360	But this continued the Representative was a subject of small importance What he wished especially to call their attention to was the fact that he had served the district faithfully as Representative and deserved their suffrages for renomination 
1649_68762_000053_000002	train-clean-360	And then he began to discuss political questions in general and his own merits in particular so that Kenneth and mister Watson disgusted at the way in which the Honorable Erastus had captured the meeting left the school house and indignantly returned to Elmhurst 
1649_68762_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 This man Hopkins said mister Watson angrily is not a gentleman 
1649_68762_000054_000001	train-clean-360	He s an impertinent meddler 
1649_68762_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 He ruined any good effect my speech might have created said Kenneth gloomily 
1649_68762_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Give it up my boy advised the elder man laying a kindly hand on the youth s shoulder 
1649_68762_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 It really isn t worth the struggle 
1649_68762_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 But I can t give it up and acknowledge myself beaten protested Kenneth almost ready to weep with disappointment 
none	none	Well well let s think it over Ken and see what can be done Perhaps that rascally Hopkins was right when he advised you to find some other way to serve the community
1649_68762_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t do better than to make it clean to do away with these disreputable signs said the boy stubbornly 
1649_68762_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 You made a fine speech declared mister Watson gravely puffing his pipe I am very proud of you my lad 
1649_68762_000061_000000	train-clean-360	Kenneth flushed red 
1649_68762_000061_000001	train-clean-360	He was by nature shy and retiring to a degree 
1649_68762_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Only his pent up enthusiasm had carried him through the ordeal and now that it was over he was chagrined to think that the speech had been so ineffective 
none	none	He was modest enough to believe that another speaker might have done better CHAPTER IV KENNETH TAKES A BOLD STEP This man Hopkins gets on my nerves said mister Watson a week or two after the eventful meeting in the school house 
5183-68763-0001	train-other-500	He was at the breakfast table opposite Kenneth and held up a big glaring post card which was in his mail What is it now asked the boy rousing himself from a fit of abstraction
5183-68763-0002	train-other-500	An announcement offering himself for renomination at the primaries It s like a circus advertisement Isn t it a shame to think that modern politics has descended to such a level
5183-68763-0003	train-other-500	in our free and enlightened republic Kenneth nodded stirring his coffee thoughtfully
none	none	 He had lost his spirit and enthusiasm 
5183-68763-0004	train-other-500	since the meeting and was fast relapsing into his old state of apathy and boredom It grieved mister Watson to note this
none	none	 Hopkins isn t fit to be the Representative for this district 
5183-68763-0005	train-other-500	observed the old gentleman with sudden energy The boy looked at him Who is Hopkins he asked
none	none	 His mother once kept a stationery shop in town and he was stable boy at the hotel But he was shrewd and prospered and when he grew up became a county clerk or tax collector then an assessor 
5183-68763-0006	train-other-500	and finally he ran last term for State Representative from this district and was elected by a mighty small majority Why small asked Kenneth Because he s a Democrat and the
5183-68763-0007	train-other-500	district is strongly Republican But Thompson ran against him on the Republican ticket and couldn t win his party vote
none	none	 Who s Thompson 
5183-68763-0008	train-other-500	The general store keeper He has a reputation for short weights and measures The boy sipped his coffee thoughtfully Tell me sir how did you happen to know all this he asked
none	none	 I ve been looking up Hopkins s record I have disliked the man ever since he treated us so shabbily on the night of the meeting Never mind him We ve done with him 
5183-68763-0009	train-other-500	mister Watson shifted uneasily in his chair I wonder if we have he said Why not sir Well Kenneth
none	none	 we have to reside at Elmhurst which is Hopkins s district 
5183-68763-0010	train-other-500	Also I believe Elmhurst to be the most important estate in the district
none	none	 and you to be the largest taxpayer This man wishes to go to the State Legislature and make laws for you to obey Well Well it s our duty to watch him If he isn t a fit man it s our duty to prevent him from representing us The young man nodded somewhat dreamily Some of these country yokels must represent us he observed It doesn t matter much whether it s Hopkins or someone else Except that you being a prominent man owe it to the community to protect its interests added the lawyer Do you want me to mix in these petty politics asked the boy 
5183-68763-0011	train-other-500	irritably Oh do as you like my boy If you can shirk your duties with a clear conscience I ve nothing to say For a time the young man was silent Finally he asked Why isn t Hopkins a good Representative
none	none	 He s what is called a grafter a term signifying that he is willing to vote for any measure that he is paid to vote for whether it benefits his constituents or not Oh Is he singular in this By no means The grafter is all too common in politics 
5183-68763-0012	train-other-500	Again the boy fell into a thoughtful mood mister Watson am I a Democrat or a Republican
none	none	 The old gentleman laughed outright Don t you know Ken 
5183-68763-0013	train-other-500	No sir I haven t asked myself before Then I advise you to be a Republican
5183-68763-0014	train-other-500	Why Because Hopkins is a Democrat and we may then fight him openly
none	none	 What is the difference sir between the two parties There is no 
5183-68763-0015	train-other-500	difference of importance All Americans are loyal citizens whichever side they adopt in politics But the two parties are the positive and negative poles
none	none	 that provide the current of electricity for our nation 
5183-68763-0016	train-other-500	and keep it going properly Also they safeguard our interests by watching one another What is your preference sir I ve always been a Republican whenever I dabbled in politics which hasn t been often Then I will be a Republican
none	none	 Very good 
5183-68763-0017	train-other-500	I am sorry to say that I know nothing about politics and have no convictions on the subject
none	none	 Who is to oppose the Honorable Erastus on the on our side I don t know yet The primaries for the nomination are not to be held for two weeks 
5183-68763-0018	train-other-500	and the Republican candidates seem shy about coming forward Didn t you say the district was Republican Yes but since Hopkins defeated them last term
none	none	 they seem to be terrified and no one likes to offer himself as a possible sacrifice 
5183-68763-0019	train-other-500	That feeling will probably elect mister Hopkins declared Kenneth with conviction Unless Unless what sir Unless we come to the rescue of the Republicans and take a hand in local politics ourselves my lad
none	none	 Kenneth pushed back his chair and rose from the table 
5183-68763-0020	train-other-500	He walked to the window and stood there whistling for a few moments and then left the room without a word For a time mister Watson sat silently musing
5183-68763-0021	train-other-500	Perhaps I m inviting trouble he murmured but I am sure I am doing right The boy needs a good shaking up and more knowledge of his fellow men If I can get Kenneth interested this plan of mine will be of great benefit to him
5183-68763-0022	train-other-500	Then he too left the breakfast table and wandering into the garden saw Kenneth busy at his easel in a shady corner For a day or so the subject was not resumed and then mister Watson casually introduced it
5183-68763-0023	train-other-500	A law could be passed in the State Legislature forbidding the display of all advertising signs in public places in this county he suggested The boy looked at him eagerly Are you sure he asked I am positive
none	none	 was the answer 
5183-68763-0024	train-other-500	It is merely a question of privilege And you think we might hire Hopkins to pass such a law
none	none	 No we couldn t trust him Then what do you propose I ll think it over my lad and let you know 
5183-68763-0025	train-other-500	Then he walked away leaving Kenneth much pleased with the idea he had advanced Indeed he was so much interested in the suggestion that he himself referred to the subject at the first opportunity
none	none	 I don t like to be beaten sir 
5183-68763-0026	train-other-500	once I ve undertaken to do a thing he said
none	none	 So if such a law can be passed I ll do all I can to elect the man who will pass it I thought as much 
5183-68763-0027	train-other-500	the old lawyer replied smiling
none	none	 But there s only one man who could go to the legislature 
5183-68763-0028	train-other-500	with enough influence to win the votes to carry such a unique measure through And who is that sir
none	none	 Kenneth Forbes the owner of Elmhurst and 
5183-68763-0029	train-other-500	the largest taxpayer in the county Me sir You re the man
none	none	 A State Representative It s an honorable office It s an important office properly filled You 
5183-68763-0030	train-other-500	might not only beautify your district by having those objectionable signs prohibited but do many other things to better the condition of the farmers And that isn t all What s the rest mister Watson
5183-68763-0031	train-other-500	You owe something to yourself lad All your young life you ve been too self contained and exclusive in your habits The noblest study of mankind is man It would broaden you to go into politics for a time and
5183-68763-0032	train-other-500	do much to develop your character and relieve the monotony of your existence Kenneth frowned
none	none	 It won t be easy you know It ll be a fight and 
5183-68763-0033	train-other-500	a hard one for Hopkins won t give up his job if he can help it
none	none	 The boy brightened again I like a good fight he said wistfully 
5183-68763-0034	train-other-500	If I thought if I believed I could fill the position with credit I might undertake it I ll answer for that retorted the old man highly pleased with his easy victory
5183-68763-0035	train-other-500	You win the fight Ken and I ll guarantee you ll outclass the majority of your fellow Representatives It s a good state too
none	none	 So the thing was undertaken and both the young man and the old threw themselves into the contest with energy and determination mister Watson rode in his buggy all over their district during the next fortnight 
5183-68763-0036	train-other-500	and interviewed the farmers and townsmen of the legislative district
none	none	 When it became noised about that the young owner of Elmhurst now barely twenty one 
5183-68763-0037	train-other-500	had determined to enter politics and asked for the nomination of Representative no other Republican ventured to oppose him It was understood to mean a hard fight and even the most sturdy Republican was inclined
5183-68763-0038	train-other-500	to fear that the present incumbent of the office would be elected to succeed himself So the primaries were held and Kenneth attended and made a speech and was warmly applauded
none	none	 His nomination was a matter of course 
5183-68763-0039	train-other-500	and he went home the unanimous choice of his party
none	none	 because none of the older and more discreet politicians 
5183-68763-0040	train-other-500	ventured to risk defeat The honorable Erastus Hopkins well knew this feeling and smiled in his pompous and most sardonic manner when he learned who was his opponent
none	none	 Having conquered an old and tried Republican warrior in the last campaign he had no fears in regard to this mere boy who could know little of political intrigue He won t put up enough of a fight to make it interesting I m afraid 
5183-68763-0041	train-other-500	mister Hopkins confided to his cronies But he didn t intend to take chances so he began the campaign with his usual vigor It was now the middle of September
none	none	 and the election was to be early in November CHAPTER V PLANNING THE WORK The Honorable Erastus Hopkins was thoroughly enjoying his campaign He was not an especially popular man in his district and he knew it Physically he was big and stout with a florid face and small eyes that blinked continually His head was bald his hands fat and red and his feet enormous To offset this mister Hopkins wore a silk hat and a Prince Albert coat morning noon and night His gold watch chain was huge and imposing he had a big diamond shirt stud and upon his puffy fingers several rings He conveyed nevertheless the impression that he was more prosperous than refined and the farmers and townsmen were as quick to recognize this as was mister Watson himself Moreover the Honorable Erastus was dubbed close fisted by his neighbors He never spent a penny on anyone but himself and being unscrupulous in politics he was naturally unscrupulous in smaller things of a business nature But since he had risen from a stable boy to his present affluent position he had never been unwise or careless enough to be caught in any crooked action and while his acquaintances had an indefinite fear of dealing with him they could not accuse him openly It seems strange that such a man should have been chosen to represent a wealthy and important district in the State Legislature but politics can show many a similar case In the first place mister Hopkins was aggressive and knew political methods thoroughly He had usurped the position of Democratic leader in his community and the others were afraid to antagonize him openly When he was nominated for Representative he managed to dictate by shrewd methods the nomination of Thompson the store keeper on the Republican ticket Thompson owed Hopkins a large sum of money and Hopkins held a mortgage on the stock Therefore Thompson dared not make a fight and although the Republican vote was normally the largest in the district Hopkins had managed to win enough of them to his side to win He had been a little anxious about his renomination because he knew that he had not represented his district very satisfactorily but when Kenneth Forbes received the nomination on the Republican ticket he felt that all was over but the shouting and that he would win in a walk Had it been an issue between the personality of the two men Hopkins would have had little chance of success but young Forbes had already raised another issue by his anti sign speech at the school house and Hopkins intended to force that issue and so defeat Kenneth because of the ridicule the latter s position had already brought upon him He began to circulate humorous stories about Kenneth s antipathy to sign boards saying that the young man demanded that the signs be taken off the Zodiac and that he wouldn t buy goods of the village grocer because the man had a sign out mister Hopkins also printed thousands of large hand bills reading The Signs of the Times vs Aristocratic Snobbery Vote for the honorable Erastus Hopkins the man who believes in advertising These things had their effect upon all classes of people There were many good natured laughs at young Forbes s expense All this was soon realized at Elmhurst and had the effect of plunging the youthful aspirant for political honors into the depths of despair The campaign was hot against him but Kenneth made no defense At this juncture with election but three weeks away he received a telegram asking him to send the drag and baggage wagon to the noon train It was signed by John Merrick and the boy was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing his jolly old friend again And the girls Well some of them surely must be coming or Uncle John wouldn t have asked for the drag Now then the election can go to blazes said Kenneth cheerfully to mister Watson The sight of some friendly faces will be a great relief The old lawyer sighed His attempt to wake up Kenneth had resulted in failure mainly because the boy had become discouraged so early in the game Kenneth felt keenly the humiliating experiences he had passed through and had sunk back into his old moody reserve But here was a welcome diversion The visitors whoever they might prove to be would afford relief to the situation and brighten the dullness of life at the big house So both Kenneth and mister Watson were with the drag at the station when the noon train drew in And there were Patsy Doyle Beth DeGraf and Louise Merrick a bevy of dainty and sprightly girls alighting eagerly from the coaches with Uncle John handing out the grips and packages and giving the checks for the baggage with business like celerity to Thomas the groom We ve come for a visit Ken cried Palsy laughing at his eager delight Are you glad to see us boy And do you suppose old Martha has our rooms aired And it s a long visit too added Uncle John as you ll believe when you see the pile of baggage You d think these minxes were prepared for a tour of the world Each one of em brought a carload of clothes But they couldn t phase Kenneth in that way His sensitive face had not beamed with so much animation for months The guests were helped into the tall drag and merrily they drove the five miles to Elmhurst not a word of politics being spoken on the way The girls had not been to the house since Aunt Jane s death two years ago and after a hasty luncheon they began an inspection of every room as well as the garden grounds and stables The horses cows pig and chickens were alike inspected the roses and dahlias visited and admired and after all this they returned to their rooms with old Martha the housekeeper and proceeded to unpack their trunks and get settled Kenneth had been their guide and companion in these various explorations but when the girls went to their rooms he wandered into the library where Uncle John and mister Watson had been having a quiet talk over their pipes of tobacco They welcomed the young man but adroitly turned the topic of conversation and again the subject of was rejoined It was a merry dinner party that graced the table during dinner that evening and the boy forgot his troubles and was as jolly and sociable as he had ever been in his life But when they were all assembled in the long living room where they grouped themselves around the fireplace a sudden change took place in the demeanor of the young ladies Patsy the delegated leader looked gravely at the boy and asked How goes the campaign Ken Wh what campaign he stammered to gain time Why this election business Tell us about it said Patsy Some other time girls answered the boy red and distressed It it wouldn t interest you a bit Why not asked Louise softly Because it doesn t interest me he replied Are you so sure of election inquired Beth I m sure of defeat if you must know he declared scowling at the recollection of his predicament You haven t been cowardly enough to give up asked Patricia boldly What do you mean by that Patsy Doyle he asked the scowl deepening Just what I say Ken A brave man doesn t know when he s beaten much less beforehand He looked at her fixedly I m not brave my dear he replied more gently than they had expected The people here don t understand me nor I them I m laughed at and reviled a subject for contemptuous jeers and and it hurts me I don t like to be beaten I d fight to the last gasp if I had any show to win But these conditions which I foolishly but honestly brought about myself have defeated me so far in advance that I have absolutely no hope to redeem myself That s all Don t speak of it again girls Play me that nocturne that I like Beth We ve got to speak of this Kenneth and speak of it often For we girls have come down here to electioneer and for no other reason on earth declared Patsy What You electioneer a slight smile curled his lips Exactly We re here to brace up and get to work And to win added Beth quietly And to put you in the Legislature where you belong declared Louise Kenneth turned to mister Merrick Talk to them Uncle John he begged I have said the little man smiling and they ve convinced me that they mean business It s all up with you my boy as a private citizen You re as good as elected Ken s eyes filled You re all very kind sir he said as you were bound to be And and I appreciate it all very much But mister Watson will tell you that the case is hopeless and there s nothing to be done How about it Watson inquired Uncle John turning to the lawyer I ll explain the proposition sir so you will all understand it he replied and drew his chair into the circle To begin with Kenneth visited the glen one day to make a sketch and found his old table rock covered with an advertising sign How preposterous exclaimed Louise There were three of these huge signs in different parts of the glen and they ruined its natural beauty Kenneth managed to buy up the spaces and then he scrubbed away the signs By that time he had come to detest the unsightly advertisements that confronted him every time he rode out and he began a war of extermination against them Quite right said Patsy nodding energetically But our friend made little headway because the sympathies of the people were not with him Why not sir inquired Beth while Kenneth sat inwardly groaning at this baring of his terrible experiences Because through custom they had come to tolerate such things and could see no harm in them replied the lawyer They permit their buildings which face the roads to be covered with big advertisements and the fences are decorated in the same way In some places a sign board has been built in their yards or fields advertising medicines or groceries or tobacco In other words our country roads and country homes have become mere advertising mediums to proclaim the goods of more or less unscrupulous manufacturers and so all their attractiveness is destroyed Kenneth being a man of artistic instincts and loving country scenes resented this invasion of commercialism and tried to fight it And so ran my head against a stone wall added the young man with a bitter laugh But you were quite right said Patsy decidedly Such things ought not to be permitted The people think differently he replied Then we must educate the people to a different way of thinking announced Louise In three weeks That is long enough if we get to work Isn t it girls said Beth Kenneth accepted the nomination with the idea of having a law passed prohibiting such signs explained the lawyer But mister Hopkins his opponent has used this very thing to arouse public sentiment against him Farmers around here are thrifty people and they fear to lose the trifling sums paid them for the privilege of painting signs on their premises Patsy nodded gravely We will change all that she said The thing is really more serious than we expected and more difficult But we came here to work and win and we re going to do it Aren t we Uncle John I ll bet on your trio Patsy replied her uncle But I won t bet all I m worth It s all foolishness declared Kenneth I do not think so said the lawyer gravely The girls have a fine show to win I know our country people and they are more intelligent than you suppose Once they are brought to a proper way of thinking they will support Kenneth loyally Then we must bring them to a proper way of thinking said Patsy with decision From this time on Ken we become your campaign managers Don t worry any more about the matter Go on with your painting and be happy We may require you to make a few speeches but all the details will be arranged for you Do you intend to permit this Uncle John asked Kenneth I m wholly in sympathy with the girls Ken and I believe in them But consider the humiliation to which they will subject themselves I ve had a taste of that medicine myself We re going to be the most popular young ladies in this district exclaimed Patsy Don t you worry about us Ken But tell me how big is your district It includes parts of three counties Monroe Washington and Jackson Counties What county is this Monroe Any cities No only a few towns It s mostly a rural district Fairview just across the border in Washington County is the biggest village Have you an automobile No I don t like the things I ve always loved horses and prefer them to machines How much money are you prepared to spend How much what s that he asked bewildered You can t win a political election without spending money declared Patsy wisely I ll bet the bad man is scattering money in every direction It will cost something on our side to run this campaign in a way to win The young man frowned I don t mind spending money Patsy he said but I don t approve of buying votes and I won t allow it either Tut tut Who said anything about buying votes But we re going to work on a broad and liberal basis I assure you and we need money Spend all you like then so long as you don t try to corrupt the voters Very good Now then how much land do you own at Elmhurst Kenneth looked inquiringly at the lawyer About twelve hundred acres said mister Watson It is divided into small farms which are let out on shares How many votes do you control among your servants and tenants proceeded Patsy in a business like tone Perhaps thirty or forty And what is the total vote of the district Thirty five hundred Patsy gasped So many Fully that many said mister Watson smiling Then we ve got to have over seventeen hundred and fifty votes to elect Kenneth Exactly The girl drew a long breath and looked at Beth and Louise Then they all laughed Suppose you resign as campaign managers said Kenneth beginning to be amused Oh no It s it s easier than we expected Isn t it girls It s child s play observed Louise languidly The boy was astonished Very well said he Try it and see Of course said Patsy cheerfully Tomorrow morning we begin work CHAPTER VI A GOOD START At an early breakfast next morning Patsy announced the program for the day Uncle John and I will drive over to the village she said and perhaps we ll be gone all day Don t worry if we re not back for luncheon Louise and mister Watson are going in the phaeton to visit some of the near by farmers Take one road dear and follow it straight along as far as it keeps within our legislative district and visit every farm house on the way The farmers will all be busy in the fields said Kenneth Louise doesn t care about the farmers retorted Patsy She s going to talk to their wives Wives don t vote Patsy They tell their husbands how to vote though declared Louise with a laugh Let me win the women and I ll win the men What am I to do asked Beth You re to stay at home and write several articles for the newspapers There are seven important papers in our district and five of them are Republican Make a strong argument Beth You re our publicity department Also get up copy for some hand hills and circular letters I want to get a circular letter to every voter in the district All right said Beth I know what you want There was an inspiring air of business about these preparations and the girls were all eager to begin work Scarcely was breakfast finished when the two equipages were at the door Louise and mister Watson at once entered the phaeton and drove away the girl delighted at the prospect of visiting the farmers wives and winning them by her plausible speeches Conversation was Louise s strong point She loved to talk and argue and her manner was so confiding and gracious that she seldom failed to interest her listeners Patsy and Uncle John drove away In Kenneth s buggy to the town and during the five mile drive Patsy counseled gravely with her shrewd uncle in regard to ways and means This thing requires prompt action Patsy he said and if we re going to do things that count they ve got to be done on a big scale True she admitted But oughtn t we to be a little careful about spending Kenneth s money I ll be your temporary banker said the old gentleman and keep track of the accounts If we win we ll present Kenneth our bill and if we fail I ll have the satisfaction of getting rid of some of that dreadful income that is swamping me This was always Uncle John s cry His enormous fortune was a constant bugbear to him He had been so interested in his business enterprises for many years that he had failed to realize how his fortune was growing and it astounded him to wake up one day and find himself possessed of many millions He had at once retired from active business and invested his millions in ways that would cause him the least annoyance but the income on so large a sum was more than he could take care of and even Major Doyle who managed these affairs for his brother in law was often puzzled to know what to do with the money that accumulated Doubtless no one will ever know how much good these two kindly men accomplished between them in their quiet secretive way Dozens of deserving young men were furnished capital to start them in business dozens more were being educated at universities at Uncle John s expense Managers of worthy charities were familiar with John Merrick s signature on checks and yet the vast fortune grew with leaps and bounds mister Merrick s life was so simple and unostentatious that his personal expenses however erratic some of his actions could not make much headway against his interest account and nothing delighted him more than to find a way to get even with fate by reckless squandering as he quaintly expressed it He was far too shrewd to become the prey of designing people but welcomed any legitimate channel in which to unload his surplus So mister Merrick had been revolving the possibilities of this unique political campaign in his mind and had decided to do some things that would open the bucolic eyes of Kenneth s constituents in wonder He did not confide all his schemes to Patsy but having urged his nieces to attempt this conquest he had no intention of allowing them to suffer defeat if he could help it The little town of Elmwood was quiet and practically deserted when they drove into it The farmers were too busy with the harvest to come to town for trading except on Saturdays and the arrival and departure of the two daily trains did not cause more than a ripple of excitement in the village Patsy decided she would shop at each and every store in the place and engage the store keepers in conversation about the election It s important to win these people she declared because they are close to every farmer who comes to town to trade and their own votes count too I ll run over to the bank said Uncle John and get acquainted there So he tied the horses to a post and let Patsy proceed alone upon her mission while he wandered over to a little brick building of neat appearance which bore the inscription Bank in gold letters on its plate glass window mister Warren in he asked the clerk at the window The banker a dignified old gentleman of considerable ability came out of his private office and greeted his visitor very cordially He had known Uncle John when the millionaire visited Elmhurst two years before and since then had learned more particulars concerning him So there was no need of an introduction and mister Warren was delighted at the prospect of business relations with this famous personage The bank although small and only one story high was the most modern and imposing building in the village and it was fitted with modern conveniences for mister Warren had been successful and prosperous In his private office were local and long distance telephones a direct connection with the telegraph operator at the station and other facilities for accomplishing business promptly Uncle John had remembered this fact and it had a prominent place in his plans He followed the banker into his private office and told him briefly his intention to forward the interests of his young friend Kenneth Forbes for Member of the Legislature The old gentleman shook his head at first predicting failure Young Forbes was his most important customer and he respected him highly but this anti sign issue bade fair to ruin all his chances The idea is too progressive and advanced to be considered at this time he stated positively The encroachments of advertisers on personal property may lead to a revolt in the future but it is still too early to direct popular opinion against them Isn t Forbes a better man for the place than Hopkins asked Uncle John Undoubtedly sir And I think Forbes would have won had not Hopkins forced this unfortunate issue upon him As it is our young friend cannot avoid the consequences of his quixotic action He doesn t wish to avoid them was the quiet reply We re going to win on that issue or not at all I m afraid it s hopeless sir May I count on your assistance In every way Thank you mister Warren I m going to spend a lot of money Put this draft for fifty thousand to my credit as a starter Ah I begin to understand But You don t understand at all yet May I use your long distance telephone Of course sir Uncle John had secured considerable information from mister Watson and this enabled him to act comprehensively The advertising sign business in this part of the state was controlled by two firms who contracted directly with the advertisers and then had the signs painted upon spaces secured from the farmers by their wide awake agents These signs were contracted for by the year but the firms controlling the spaces always inserted protective clauses that provided for the removal of any sign when certain conditions required such removal In such cases a rebate was allowed to the advertiser This protective clause was absolutely necessary in case of fire alteration or removal of buildings or destruction of fences and sign boards by weather or the requirements of the owners It was this saving clause in the contracts of which Uncle John had decided to take advantage The contracting sign painters were merely in the business to make money mister Merrick got the head of the concern in Cleveland over the telephone within half an hour He talked with the man at length and talked with the convincing effect that the mention of money has When he hung up the receiver Uncle John was smiling Then he called for the Chicago firm With this second advertising company he met with more difficulties and mister Warren had to come to the telephone and assure the man that mister Merrick was able to pay all he agreed to and that the money was on deposit in his bank That enabled mister Merrick to conclude his arrangements He knew that he was being robbed but the company operation of the big Chicago firm was necessary to his plans Then the telephone having served its purpose mister Warren took Uncle John across the street to the newspaper office and introduced him to Charley Briggs the editor Briggs was a man with one eye a sallow complexion and sandy hair that stuck straight up from his head He set type for his paper besides editing it and Uncle John found him wearing a much soiled apron with his bare arms and fingers smeared with printer s ink mister Merrick wants to see you on business Charley said the banker Whatever he agrees to I will guarantee to the full resources of my bank The editor pricked up his ears and dusted a chair for his visitor with his apron It wasn t easy to make a living running a paper in Elmwood and if there was any business pending he was anxious to secure it Uncle John waited until mister Warren had left him alone with the newspaper man Then he said I understand your paper is Democratic mister Briggs That s a mistake sir replied the editor evasively The Herald is really independent but in political campaigns we adopt the side we consider the most deserving of support You re supporting Hopkins just now Only mildly only mildly sir What is he paying you Why Rast and I haven t come to a definite settlement yet I ought to get a hundred dollars out of this campaign but Rast thinks fifty is enough You see he plans on my support anyhow and don t like to spend more than he s obliged to Why does he plan on your support He s the only live one in the game mister Merrick Rast is one of us he s one of the people and it s policy for me to support him instead of the icicle up at Elmhurst who don t need the job and don t care whether he gets it or not Is that true I think so 
6828_68770_000068_000002	train-clean-360	And there s another thing 
none	none	Young Forbes is dead against advertising and advertising is the life of a newspaper Why there isn t a paper in the district that s supporting Forbes this year You ve a wrong idea of the campaign mister Briggs said Uncle John It is because mister Forbes believes in newspaper advertising and wants to protect it that he s against these signs That s one reason anyhow Can t you understand that every dollar spent for painting signs takes that much away from your newspapers Why perhaps there s something in that mister Merrick I d never looked at it that way before Now see here mister Briggs I ll make you a proposition I ll give you two hundred and fifty to support mister Forbes in this campaign and if he s elected I ll give you five hundred extra Do you mean that sir asked the editor scarcely able to believe the evidence of his ears I do Draw up a contract and I ll sign it And here s a check for your two fifty in advance The editor drew up the agreement with a pen that trembled a little And now said Uncle John get busy and hustle for Kenneth Forbes I will sir said Briggs with unexpected energy I mean to win that extra five hundred CHAPTER VII PATSY MAKES PROGRESS Meantime Patsy was in the thick of the fray The druggist was a deep dyed Democrat and sniffed when she asked him what he thought of Forbes for Representative He s no politician at all just an aristocrat declared Latham a dapper little man with his hair slicked down to his ears and a waxed moustache And he s got fool notions too If he stopped the advertising signs I wouldn t sell half as many pain killers and liver pills He s my cousin said Patsy mendaciously for although they called themselves cousins there was no relationship even of marriage as Patsy s Aunt Jane had merely been betrothed to Kenneth s uncle when he died I m sorry for that miss replied the druggist He s going to be badly beaten I think I ll take two ounces of this perfumery It is really delightful Some druggists have so little taste in selecting such things Yes miss I do rather pride myself on my perfumes replied Latham graciously Now here s a sachet powder that gives fine satisfaction I ll take a couple of packets of that too since you recommend it Latham began doing up the purchases There was no other customer in the store You know miss I haven t anything against mister Forbes myself His people are good customers It s his ideas I object to and he s a Republican Haven t you ever voted for a Republican asked the girl Don t you think it better to vote for the best man rather than the best party in a case like this Why perhaps it is But in what way is mister Forbes the best man He s honest He doesn t want to make any money out of the office On the contrary he s willing and able to spend a good deal in passing laws that will benefit his district And Hopkins Don t you know mister Hopkins she asked pointedly Yes miss I do And Latham frowned a little As regards the advertising signs continued the girl I ve heard you spoken of as a man of excellent taste and I can believe it since I ve examined the class of goods you keep And your store is as neat and attractive as can be The fight is not against the signs themselves but against putting them on fences and barns and so making great glaring spots in a landscape where all should be beautiful and harmonious I suppose a man of your refinement and good taste has often thought of that and said the same thing Why ahem yes of course miss I agree with you that the signs are often out of place and and inharmonious To be sure and so you must sympathize with mister Forbes s campaign In that way yes of course said mister Latham puzzled to find himself changing front so suddenly mister Hopkins has taken a lot of money out of this town remarked Patsy examining a new kind of tooth wash But I can t find that he s ever given much of it back That s true He buys his cigars of Thompson the general store man and I keep the finest line ever brought to this town Oh that reminds me exclaimed Patsy mister Forbes wanted me to purchase a box of your choicest brand and have you just hand them out to your customers with his compliments He thinks he ought to show a little cordiality to the men who vote for him and he said you would know just the people to give them to Latham gasped but he assumed an air of much importance I know every man that comes to this town miss as well as any you ll find he said The best brand mind you mister Latham said the girl How much will they be Why the very best these imported perfectos you know are worth six dollars a box of fifty Perhaps for election purposes something a little cheaper Oh no the best is none too good for the friends of mister Forbes you know And fifty why fifty will scarcely go around I ll pay for a hundred mister Latham and you ll see they go to the right persons Of course of course miss And much obliged You see young Forbes is well liked and he s quite a decent fellow I wouldn t be surprised if he gave Hopkins a hard fight I ll tell you a secret said Patsy sweetly mister Forbes is bound to be elected Why it s all arranged in advance mister Latham and the better element like yourself is sure to support him By the way you won t forget to tell people about those signs I hope That the fight is not against advertising but for beautiful rural homes and scenes Oh I ll fix that Miss Doyle I m Miss Doyle mister Forbes s cousin I ll see that the people understand this campaign Miss Doyle You can depend on me And if the cigars give out don t hesitate to open more boxes I ll call in now and then and settle for them I really think this young lady might have been ashamed of herself but she wasn t She smiled sweetly upon the druggist when he bowed her out and mister Latham from that moment began to seek for friends of mister Forbes to give cigars to If they were not friends he argued with them until they were for he was an honest little man in his way and tried to act in good faith So the girl went from one shop to another making liberal purchases and seeking for every opening that would enable her to make a convert And her shrewd Irish wit made her quick to take advantage of any weakness she discovered in the characters of the people she interviewed When noon came Uncle John hunted her up which was not difficult in Elmwood and together they went to the village hotel to get something to eat The mid day dinner was not very inviting but Patsy praised the cooking to the landlord s wife who waited upon the table and Uncle John bought one of the landlord s cigars after the meal and talked politics with him while he smoked it Then Patsy went over to the general store and there she met her first rebuff Thompson the proprietor was a sour visaged man tall and lanky and evidently a dyspeptic Having been beaten by Hopkins at the last election when he ran against him on the Republican ticket Thompson had no desire to see Forbes more successful than he had been himself And there were other reasons that made it necessary for him to support Hopkins So he was both gruff and disagreeable when Patsy after buying a lot of ribbons of him broached the subject of politics He told her plainly that her cousin hadn t a ghost of a show and that he was glad of it The young fool had no business to monkey with politics he added and this will teach him to keep his fingers out of someone else s pie It isn t mister Hopkins s pie declared Patsy stoutly It belongs to whoever gets the votes Well that s Hopkins He knows the game and Forbes don t Can t he learn asked the girl No He s an idiot Always was a crank and an unsociable cuss when a boy and he s worse now he s grown up Oh I know Forbes all right and I haven t got no use for him neither Argument was useless in this case The girl sighed gathered up her purchases and went into the hardware store Immediately her spirits rose Here was a man who knew Kenneth believed in him and was going to vote for him She had a nice talk with the hardware man and he gave her much useful information about the most important people in the neighborhood those it would be desirable to win for their candidate When he mentioned Thompson she said Oh he s impossible I ve talked with him Thompson is really a good Republican replied mister Andrews the hardware man But he s under Hopkins s thumb and doesn t dare defy him Doesn t he like mister Hopkins asked Patsy in surprise No he really hates him You see Thompson isn t a very successful merchant He has needed money at times and borrowed it of Hopkins at a high rate of interest It s a pretty big sum now and Hopkins holds a mortgage on the stock If he ever forecloses as he will do some day Thompson will be ruined So he s obliged to shout for Hopkins whether he believes in him or not I think I understand him now said Patsy smiling But he needn t have been so disagreeable He s a disagreeable man at any time returned mister Andrews Has he any political influence asked the girl Yes considerable Otherwise he couldn t have secured the nomination when he pretended to run against Hopkins for it was only a pretense You see he s a well known Republican and when he sides for Hopkins he s bound to carry many Republicans with him But there were other important people whom mister Andrews thought might be influenced and he gave Patsy a list of their names He seemed much amused at the earnestness of this girlish champion of the Republican candidate I do not think we can win he said as she left him but we ought to make a good showing for your cousin and I ll do my very best to help you As she rode home with Uncle John in the afternoon after a day of really hard work Patsy sized up the situation and declared that she was satisfied that she had made progress She told mister Merrick of the mortgage held over Thompson by mister Hopkins and the little man made a mental note of the fact He also was satisfied with his day s work and agreed to ride over to Fairview the next day with her and carry the war into this the largest village in Kenneth s district Meantime Louise and mister Watson were having some interesting interviews with the farmers wives along the Marville road The old lawyer knew nearly everyone in this part of the country for he had lived here all his life But he let Louise do the talking and was much pleased at the tact and good nature she displayed in dealing with the widely different types of character she encountered Her method was quite simple and for that reason doubly effective She sat down in missus Simmons s kitchen where the good woman was ironing and said I m a cousin of mister Forbes up at Elmhurst you know He s running for a political office so as to do some good for his county and district and I ve come to see if you ll help me get votes for him Law sakes child exclaimed missus Simmons I ain t got nuthin to do with politics No but you ve got a lot to do with mister Simmons and that s where we need your help You see mister Forbes thinks mister Simmons is one of the most important men in this district and he s very anxious to win his vote Why don t you see Dan then He s out n the rye field replied the woman It s because I m only a girl and he wouldn t listen to me replied Louise sweetly But he takes your advice about everything I hear He don t take it as often as he orter don t Dan interrupted missus Simmons pausing to feel whether her iron was hot Perhaps not agreed Louise but in important things such as this he s sure to listen to you and we women must stick together if we want to win this election But I don t know nothin about it protested missus Simmons an I don t believe Dan does You don t need to know much missus Simmons replied the girl What a pretty baby that is All you need do is to tell Dan he must vote for mister Forbes and see that he agrees to do so Why was the pointed query Well there are several reasons One is that mister Hopkins mister Erastus Hopkins you know is the other candidate and a person must vote for either one or the other of them Dan s a friend o Rastus said the woman thoughtfully I seen em talkin together the other day But this isn t a matter of friendship it s business and mister Forbes is very anxious to have your husband with him If mister Forbes is elected it means lighter taxes better roads and good schools If mister Hopkins is elected it does not mean anything good except for mister Hopkins I guess you re right about that laughed the woman Rast don t let much get away from him You re very clever missus Simmons You have discovered the fact without being told Oh I know Rast Hopkins an so does Dan Then I can depend on you to help us asked the girl patting the tousled head of a little girl who stood by staring at the pretty lady I ll talk to him but I dunno what good it ll do said missus Simmons thoughtfully I know He won t refuse to do what you ask him for a man always listens to his wife when he knows she s right You ll win missus Simmons and I want to thank you for saving the election for us If we get mister Simmons on our side I believe we ll be sure to defeat Hopkins Oh I ll do what I kin was the ready promise and after a few more remarks about the children and the neatness of the house Louise took her leave Will she win him over asked the girl of mister Watson when they were jogging on to the next homestead I really can t say my dear replied the old lawyer thoughtfully but I imagine she ll try to and if Dan doesn t give in missus Simmons will probably make his life miserable for a time You flattered them both outrageously but that will do no harm And so it went on throughout the day Sometimes the farmer himself was around the house and then they held a sort of conference Louise asked his advice about the best way to win votes and said she depended a great deal upon his judgment She never asked a man which side he favored but took it for granted that he was anxious to support mister Forbes and this subtle flattery was so acceptable that not one declared outright that he was for Hopkins whatever his private views might have been When evening came and they had arrived at Elmhurst again Louise was enthusiastic over her work of the day and had many amusing tales to tell of her experiences How many votes did you win asked Uncle John smiling at her I can t say she replied but I didn t lose any If one sows plenty of seed some of it is bound to sprout We can tell better after election said mister Watson But I m satisfied that this is the right sort of work mister Merrick to get results So am I returned Uncle John heartily Are you willing to keep it up Louise Of course she exclaimed We start again bright and early tomorrow morning CHAPTER VIII THE HONORABLE ERASTUS IS ASTONISHED The Honorable Erastus Hopkins had been absent at the state capital for several days looking after various matters of business for he was a thrifty man and watched his investments carefully Whenever his acquaintances asked about his chances for re election the Honorable Erastus Hopkins winked laughed and declared it s a regular walk over Who is opposing you once asked a gray haired Senator of much political experience who had met mister Hopkins at luncheon Young feller named Forbes a boy sir with no notion about the game at all He was pledged to an unpopular issue so I was mighty glad to have him run against me What issue is he pledged to asked the Senator Oh he s agin putting advertising signs on fences and barns and wants to have them prohibited like the infernal fool he is Indeed Then he s a progressive fellow And you say his issue is unpopular That s what it is It ll kill his chances if he ever had any Strange mused the Senator That issue has been a winning one usually What do you mean asked the astonished Hopkins Why the anti sign fight has won in several places throughout the country and local laws have been passed prohibiting them Didn t you know that No said Hopkins Well it s true Of course I do not know the temper of your people but in a country district such as yours I would think an issue of that sort very hard to combat Nonsense exclaimed the Honorable Erastus Ev ry man Jack s agin the fool notion Then perhaps the people don t understand it Forbes has given up already continued Hopkins laughing at the recollection He s gone back into his shell like a turtle an won t come out to fight I tell you Senator he s the worst licked candidate that ever ran for office Nevertheless the suggestion that the anti sign issue had been successful in other localities made mister Hopkins a trifle uneasy and he decided to return home and keep the fight going until after election whether young Forbes came out of his shell or not He arrived at Hilldale on the early morning train and went to his house for breakfast To his amazement he found two great banners strung across the village streets bearing the words Vote for Forbes the People s Champion Who in thunder could a done that murmured mister Hopkins staring open mouthed at the great banners Then he scratched his head with a puzzled air and went home missus Hopkins a tired looking woman in a bedraggled morning wrapper was getting the breakfast She did not participate largely in the prosperity of her husband and often declared she was worked to death although there were no children to care for When did those Forbes banners go up asked mister Hopkins irritably I dunno Rast I don t keep track o such things But all the town was out to the girls meetin last night an I went along to watch the fun What girls meeting The girls thet air workin fer to elect mister Forbes It was in the town hall an all three of the girls made speeches What about About mister Forbes and how he orter be elected He wants to beautify the farm places by doin away with signs an he wants better roads an three new school houses cause the ones we ve got now ain t big enough An You blamed idiot What are you talking about roared the exasperated Hopkins Oh you needn t rave at me Rast Hopkins just cause you re gettin licked I thought your goose was cooked the minnit these girls got to work mister Hopkins stared at her with a dazed expression Be sensible Mary and tell me who these girls are I haven t heard of em Why they re cousins o Kenneth Forbes it seems an come from New York to git him elected What are they like They re swell dressers Rast an nice appearin girls and mighty sharp with their tongues They had a good meetin last night and there ll be another at the town hall next week Pah Girls Forbes oughter be ashamed of himself to send a bunch o girls out electioneerin I never heard of such an irregular thing What do the boys say Folks don t say much to me Rast They wouldn t you know But I guess your game is up He made no reply Here indeed was information of a startling character And it came upon him like thunder out of a clear sky Yet the thing might not be so important as missus Hopkins feared Very thoughtfully he unfolded the morning paper and the next moment uttered a roar of wrath and vexation Briggs was one of his stand bys and the Herald heretofore had always supported him yet here across the first page were big black letters saying Vote for Forbes And the columns were full of articles and paragraphs praising Forbes and declaring that he could and would do more for the district than Hopkins I must see Briggs muttered the Honorable Erastus He s tryin to make me put up that hundred an I guess I ll have to do it He looked over the other newspapers which were heaped upon his desk in the sitting room and was disgusted to find all but one of the seven papers in the district supporting Forbes Really the thing began to look serious And he had only been absent a week He had not much appetite for breakfast when missus Hopkins set it before him But the Honorable Erastus was a born fighter and his discovery had only dismayed him for a brief time Already he was revolving ways of contesting this new activity in the enemy s camp and decided that he must talk with the boys at once So he hurried away from the breakfast table and walked down town Latham was first on his route and he entered the drug store Hullo Jim Good morning mister Hopkins Anything I can do for you asked the polite druggist Yes a lot Tell me what these fool girls are up to that are plugging for Forbes I ve been away for a week you know Can t say mister Hopkins I m sure Business is pretty lively these days and it keeps me hustling I ve no time for politics But we ve got to wake up Jim we Democrats or they ll give us a run for our money Oh this is a Republican district sir We can t hope to win it often and especially in a case like this Why not Looks to me as if you d bungled things Hopkins But I m not interested in this campaign Excuse me if there s nothing you want I ve got a prescription to fill mister Hopkins walked out moodily It was very evident that Latham had changed front But they had never been very staunch friends and he could find a way to even scores with the little druggist later Thompson was behind his desk at the general store when Hopkins walked in Look here said the Honorable Representative angrily what s been going on in Elmwood What s all this plugging for Forbes mean Thompson gave him a sour look over the top of his desk Addressin them remarks to me Rast Yes to you You ve been loafing on your job old man and it won t do it won t do at all You should have put a stop to these things What right have these girls to interfere in a game like this Oh shut up Rast Thompson By crickey I won t stand this from you Goin back on me eh I m a Republication Rast So you are said mister Hopkins slowly his temper at white heat And that mortgage is two months overdue Go over to the bank and get your money then It s waiting for you Hopkins interest and all Go and get it and let me alone I m busy Perhaps the politician had never been so surprised in his life Anger gave way to sudden fear and he scrutinized the averted countenance of Thompson carefully Where d you raise the money Thompson None of your business I raised it Forbes eh Forbes has bought you up I see Grateful fellow ain t you when I loaned you money to keep you from bankruptcy You did Hopkins You made me your slave and threatened me every minute unless I did all your dirty work Grateful You ve led me a dog s life But I m through with you now for good and all Hopkins turned and walked out without another word In the dentist s office doctor Squiers was sharpening and polishing his instruments Hello Archie Hello Rast Bout time you was getting back old man We re having a big fight on our hands I can tell you Tell me more said mister Hopkins taking a chair with a sigh of relief at finding one faithful friend What s up Archie An invasion of girls mostly They took us by surprise the other day and started a campaign worthy of old political war horses There s some shrewd politician behind them I know or they wouldn t have nailed us up in our coffins with such business like celerity Talk sense Archie What have they done What can they do Pah Girls Don t make a mistake Rast That s what I did before I understood When I heard that three girls were electioneering for Forbes I just laughed Then I made a discovery They re young and rich and evidently ladies They re pretty too and the men give in at the first attack They don t try to roast you That s their cleverness They tell what Forbes can do with all his money if he s Representative and they swear he ll do it Never mind said Hopkins easily We ll win the men back again But these girls are riding all over the country talking to farmers wives and they re organizing a woman s political club The club is to meet at Elmhurst and to be fed on the fat of the land so every woman wants to belong They ve got two expensive automobiles down from the city with men to make them go and they re spending money right and left That s bad said Hopkins shifting uneasily for I haven t much to spend myself But most money is fooled away in politics When I spend a cent it counts I can tell you You ll have to spend some Rast to keep your end up I m glad you re back for we Democrats have been getting demoralized Some of the boys are out for Forbes already Hopkins nodded busy with his thoughts I ve talked with Latham But he didn t count And they ve bought up Thompson What else they ve done I can t tell yet But one thing s certain Doc we ll win out in a canter I m too old a rat to be caught in a trap like this I ve got resources they don t suspect I believe you Rast They ve caught on to the outside fakes to win votes but they don t know the inside deals yet You re right But I must make a bluff to offset their daylight campaign so as not to lose ground with the farmers They re the ones that count after all not the town people See here Doc I had an idea something might happen and so I arranged with my breakfast food company to let me paint a hundred signs in this neighborhood A hundred mind you and that means a big laugh on Forbes and the good will of the farmers who sell their spaces and not a cent out of my pocket How s that for a checkmate That s fine replied doctor Squiers There s been considerable talk about this sign business and I m told that at the meeting last night one of the girls made a speech about it and said the farmers were being converted and were now standing out for clean fences and barns That s all humbug I think so myself These people are like a flock of sheep Get them started a certain way and you can t head them off observed the dentist Then we must start them our way declared Hopkins I ve got the order for these signs in my pocket and I ll have em painted all over the district in a week Keep your eyes open Doc If we ve got to fight we won t shirk it but I don t look for much trouble from a parcel of girls mister Hopkins was quite cheerful by this time for he had thought out the situation and his fighting blood was up as he expressed it He walked away whistling softly to himself and decided that he would go over to the livery stable get a horse and buggy drive out into the country and spend the day talking with the farmers But when he turned the corner into the side street where the livery was located he was astonished to find a row of horses and wagons lining each side of the street and in each vehicle two men in white jumpers and overalls The men were in charge of huge cans of paints assorted brushes ladders scaffolds and other paraphernalia There must have been twenty vehicles altogether and some of the rigs were already starting out and driving briskly away in different directions mister Hopkins was puzzled He approached one of the white overalled men who was loading cans of paint into a wagon and inquired Who are you fellows Sign painters answered the man with an amused look Who do you work for The Carson Advertising Sign Company of Cleveland Oh I see replied Hopkins Got a big job in this neighborhood Pretty big sir Who s your foreman Smith He s in the livery office Then the man climbed into his wagon and drove away and Hopkins turned into the livery office A thin faced man with sharp eyes was Talking with the proprietor Is this mister Smith asked Hopkins Yes Of the Carson Advertising Sign Company Yes Well I ve got a big job for you My name s Hopkins I want a hundred big signs painted mighty quick Sorry sir we ve got all we can handle here for two or three weeks It s got to be done quick or not at all Can t you send for more men We ve got thirty eight on this job and can t get any more for love or money Had to send to Chicago for some of these Rush job Yes sir You ll have to excuse me I ve got to get started This is only our second day and we re pretty busy Wait a minute called the bewildered Hopkins following Smith to his buggy What concern is your firm doing all this painting for A man named Merrick Then the foreman drove away and mister Hopkins was left greatly puzzled Merrick Merrick he repeated I don t remember any big advertiser by that name It must be some new concern Anyhow it all helps in my fight against Forbes He again returned to the livery office and asked for a rig Everything out mister Hopkins I ve hired everything to be had in town for this sign painting gang But mister Hopkins was not to be balked As long as these sign painters were doing missionary work for his cause among the farmers he decided to drive over to Fairview and see the party leaders in that important town So he went back to doctor Squiers s house and borrowed the Doctor s horse and buggy He drove along the turnpike for a time in silence Then it struck him that there was a peculiar air of neatness about the places he passed The barns and fences all seemed newly painted and he remembered that he hadn t seen an advertising sign since he left town A mile farther on he came upon a gang of the sign painters who with their huge brushes were rapidly painting the entire length of a weather worn fence with white paint mister Hopkins reined in and watched them for a few moments You sign painters don t seem to be getting any signs started he observed No replied one of the men laughing This is a peculiar job for our firm to tackle We ve made a contract to paint out every sign in the district Paint em out Yes cover them up with new paint and get rid of them But how about the advertisers Don t they own the spaces now They did but they ve all been bought up John Merrick owns the spaces now and we re working for John Merrick Who s he Some friend of mister Forbes up at Elmhurst mister Hopkins was not a profane man but he said a naughty word And then he cut his horse so fiercely with the whip that the poor beast gave a neigh of terror and started down the road at a gallop CHAPTER IX OL WILL ROGERS Beth had her folding table out in the rose garden where Kenneth was working at his easel and while the boy painted she wrote her campaign letters and editorials At first Ken had resented the management of his campaign by his three girl friends but soon he was grateful for their assistance and proud of their talents It was at their own request that he refrained from any active work himself merely appearing at the meetings they planned where he made his speeches and impressed his hearers with his earnestness He was really an excellent speaker and his youth and enthusiasm counted much in his favor He protested mildly when Louise invited the Women s Political Club to meet at Elmhurst on Thursday afternoon but mister Watson assured him that this was an important play for popularity so he promised to meet them Tables were to be spread upon the lawn for the late October weather was mild and delightful and Louise planned to feed the women in a way that they would long remember Patsy had charge of the towns and Louise of the country districts but Beth often aided Louise who had a great deal of territory to cover The automobiles Uncle John had ordered sent down were a great assistance to the girls and enabled them to cover twice as much territory in a day as would have been done with horses But although they worked so tirelessly and earnestly it was not all plain sailing with the girl campaigners Yet though they met with many rebuffs they met very little downright impertinence Twice Louise was asked to leave a house where she had attempted to make a proselyte and once a dog was set upon Beth by an irate farmer who resented her automobile as much as he did her mission As for Patsy she was often told in the towns that a young girl ought to be in better business than mixing up in politics and she was sensitive enough once or twice to cry over these reproaches when alone in her chamber But she maintained a cheerful front and in truth all the girls enjoyed their work immensely While Beth and Kenneth were in the garden this sunny afternoon James came to say that a man wanted to see one of the politics young ladies Shall we send him about his business Beth asked the boy Oh no we can t afford to lose a single vote Bring him here James please said the girl So presently a wizened little man in worn and threadbare garments his hat in his hand came slowly into the garden His sunken cheeks were covered with stubby gray whiskers his shoulders were stooped and bent from hard work and his hands bore evidences of a life of toil Yet the eyes he turned upon Beth as she faced him had a wistful and pleading look that affected her strangely Afternoon miss he said in a hesitating voice I I m Rogers miss ol Will Rogers I I s pose you hain t heerd o me before I m glad to meet you mister Rogers replied the girl in her pleasant voice Have you come to see me about the election It s it s sump n bout the lection an then agin it ain t But I run the chanct o seein ye because we re in desprit straits an Nell advised that I hev a talk with ye Frank an outright says Nell Don t beat about the bush says she Go right to th point an they ll say yes or no Beth laughed merrily and the boy smiled as he wielded his brush with delicate strokes Ye mustn t mind me miss said Will Rogers in a deprecating tone I m I m sommut broke up an discouraged an ain t th man I used to be Nell knows that an she orter came herself but it jes made her cry to think o it an so I says I ll come an do the best I kin Beth was really interested now Sit down on this bench mister Rogers she said and I ll listen to whatever you have to say He sat down willingly bent forward as he rested upon the garden bench and twirled his hat slowly in his hands Taint easy ye know miss to say some things an this is one o the hardest he began Go on said Beth encouragingly for old Will had suddenly stopped short and seemed unable to proceed They say miss as you folks is a spendin uv a lot o money on this election a gittin votes an sich like he said in an altered tone It costs a little to run a political campaign acknowledged Beth They say money s bein poured out liken water to git votes he persisted Well mister Rogers Well thet s how it started ye see We re so agonizin poor Nell thought we orter git some o the money while it s goin The girl was much amused Such frankness was both unusual and refreshing Have you a vote to sell she asked He did not answer at once but sat slowly twirling his hat That s jet what Nell thought ye d ask he said finally an she knew if ye did it was all up with our plan Guess I ll be goin miss He rose slowly from his seat
6828_68770_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 but the girl 
none	none	did not intend to lose any of the fun this queer individual might yet furnish Sit down mister Rogers she said and tell me why you can t answer my questions I guess I ll hev to speak out an tell all said he his voice trembling a little although I thought fer a minnit I could see my way without I can t sell my vote miss cause I ve been plannin t vote fer mister Forbes anyhow But we wanted some uv th money that s being wasted an we wanted it mighty bad Why Thet s the hard part uv it miss but I m goin to tell you Did ye ever hear o Lucy No mister Rogers Lucy s our girl the on y chick er child we ever had She s a pretty girl is Lucy a good deal liken her mother wi the same high spirits my Nell had afore she broke down Mostly Nell cries nowadays Yes Go on Lucy had a schoolin an we worked hard to give it her fer my land ain t much account nohow An when she grew up she had more boys comin to see her than any gal this side o Fairview an one o em caught Lucy s fancy But she was too young to marry an she wanted to be earnin money so she got a job workin fer Doc Squiers over to Elmwood He s the dentist there an Lucy helped with the housework an kept the office slicked up an earned ev ry penny she got He stopped here and looked vacantly around Beth tried to help the old man And then she asked softly Then come the trouble miss One day ol Mis Squiers the Doc s mother missed a di mon ring She laid it on the mantel an it was gone an she said as Lucy took it Lucy didn t take it an after they d tried to make my gal confess as she was a thief they give er three days to hand up the ring or the money it was worth or else they d hev her arrested and sent t jail Lucy didn t take it ye know She jes couldn t do sech a thing natcherly I know said Beth sympathetically So she comes home heartbroken an told us about it an we didn t hev th money nuther It were sixty dollars they wanted or th ring an we didn t hev neither of em Of course not Well Tom come over thet night to see Lucy hearin she was home an Who is Tom Thet s Tom Gates him thet but I m comin to thet miss Tom always loved Lucy an wanted to marry her but his folks is as poor as we are so the young uns had to wait Tom worked at the mill over t Fairview the big saw mill where they make the lumber an things I know He was the bookkeeper fer Tom had schoolin too an he took private lessons in bookkeepin from ol Cheeseman So he had got hired at the mill an had a likely job an was doin well An when Tom heerd about Lucy s trouble an thet she had only two days left before goin to jail he up an says I ll get the money Lucy don you worry a bit Oh Tom says she hev you got sixty dollars saved already I ve got it Lucy says he an I ll go over tomorrow an pay Doc Squiers Don you worry any more Forget all about it Well o course miss that helped a lot Nell an Lucy both felt the disgrace of the thing but it wouldn t be a public disgrace like goin to jail so we was all mighty glad Tom had that sixty dollars It was very fortunate said Beth filling in another pause The nex day Tom were as good as his word He paid Doc Squiers an got a receipt an giv it to Lucy Then we thought th trouble was over but it had on y just begun Monday mornin Tom was arrested over t the mill fer passin a forged check an gettin sixty dollars on it Lucy was near frantic with grief She walked all the way to Fairview an they let her see Tom in the jail He tol her it was true he forged th check but he did it to save her He was a man an it wouldn t hurt fer him to go to jail so much as it would a girl He said he was glad he did it an didn t mind servin a sentence in prison I think miss as Tom meant thet ev ry word uv it But Lucy broke down under the thing an raved an cried an nuther Nell ner I could do anything with her She said she d ruined Tom s life an all thet an she didn t want to live herself Then she took sick an Nell an I nursed her as careful as we could How n the wurld she ever got away we can t make out nohow Did she get away asked the girl noting that the old man s eyes were full of tears and his lips trembling Yes miss She s bin gone over ten days now an we don t even know where to look fer her our girl our poor Lucy She ain t right in her head ye know or she d never a done it She d never a left us like this in th world Taint like our Lucy Kenneth had turned around on his stool and was regarding old Will Rogers earnestly brush and pallet alike forgotten Beth was trying to keep the tears out of her own eyes for the old man s voice was even more pathetic than his words Ten days ago said Kenneth And she hasn t been found yet We can t trace her anywhere an Nell has broke down at las an don t do much but cry It s hard sir I can t bear to see Nell cry She d sich high sperrits onct Where s the boy Tom asked Kenneth somewhat gruffly He s in the jail yet waitin to be tried Court don t set till next week they say And where do you live Rogers Five miles up the Fairview road Taint much of a place Nell says I ve always bin a shif les lot an I guess it s true Yesterday your hired men painted all the front o my fence painted it white not only where th signs was but th whole length of it We didn t ask it done but they jes done it I watched em an Nell says if we on y had th money thet was wasted on thet paint an labor we might find our Lucy It s a shame says Nell all thet lection money bein thrown away on paint when it might save our poor crazy child I hope it ain t wrong sir but thet s what I thought too So we laid plans fer me to come here today Ef I kin get a hold o any o thet money honest I want to do it Have you got a horse asked Kenneth Not now I owned one las year but he died on me an I can t get another nohow Did you walk here asked Beth Yes miss o course I ve walked the hull county over a tryin to find Lucy I don mind the walking much There was another pause while old Will Rogers looked anxiously at the boy and the girl and they looked at each other Then Beth took out her purse I want to hire your services to help us in the election she said briskly I ll furnish you a horse and buggy and you can drive around and talk with people and try to find Lucy at the same time This twenty dollars is to help you pay expenses You needn t account for it just help us as much as you can The old man straightened up and his eyes filled again Nell said if it was a matter o charity I mustn t take a cent he observed in a low voice It isn t charity It s business And now that we know your story we mean to help you find your girl Anyone would do that you know Tell me what is Lucy like She s like Nell used to be But we don t know your wife Describe Lucy as well as you can Is she tall Middlin miss Light or dark Heh Is her hair light or dark colored Middlin jes middlin miss Well is she stout or thin I should say sorter betwixt an between miss How old is Lucy Jes turned eighteen miss Never mind Beth interrupted the boy you won t learn much from old Will s description But we ll see what can be done tomorrow Call James and have him sent home in the rig he s going to use It seems to me you re disposing rather freely of my horses and carts Yes Ken You ve nothing to say about your belongings just now But if you object to this plan I don t The girl must be found and her father is more likely to find her than a dozen other searchers He shall have the rig and welcome So it was that Will Rogers drove back to his heartbroken wife in a smart top buggy with twenty dollars in his pocket and a heart full of wonder and thanksgiving CHAPTER X THE FORGED CHECK Kenneth and Beth refrained from telling the other girls or Uncle John of old Will Rogers s visit but they got mister Watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check It was a serious crime indeed mister Watson told them and Tom Gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in state s prison as a consequence of his rash act But it was a generous act too said Beth I can t see it in that light said the old lawyer It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved I do not doubt the girl was unjustly accused The Squierses are a selfish hard fisted lot and the old lady especially is a well known virago But they could not have proven a case against Lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff So this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get sixty dollars to pay an unjust demand He was soft hearted and impetuous said Beth and being in love he didn t stop to count the cost That is no excuse my dear declared mister Watson Indeed there is never an excuse for crime The young man is guilty and he must suffer the penalty Is there no way to save him asked Kenneth If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom But under the circumstances I doubt if such an arrangement could be made We re going to try it anyhow was the prompt decision So as soon as breakfast was over the next morning Beth and Kenneth took one of the automobiles the boy consenting unwillingly to this sort of locomotion because it would save much time Fairview was twelve miles away but by ten o clock they drew up at the county jail They were received in the little office by a man named Markham who was the jailer He was a round faced respectable appearing fellow but his mood was distinctly unsociable Want to see Tom Gates eh Well what for he demanded We wish to talk with him answered Kenneth Talk what s the good You re no friend of Tom Gates I can t be bothered this way anyhow I am Kenneth Forbes of Elmhurst I m running for Representative on the Republican ticket said Kenneth quietly Oh say that s different observed Markham altering his demeanor You mustn t mind my being gruff and grumpy mister Forbes I ve just stopped smoking a few days ago and it s got on my nerves something awful May we see Gates at once asked Kenneth Sure ly I ll take you to his cell myself It s just shocking how such a little thing as stoppin smoking will rile up a fellow Come this way please They followed the jailer along a succession of passages Smoked ever sence I was a boy you know an had to stop last week because Doc said it would kill me if I didn t remarked the jailer leading the way Sometimes I m that yearning for a smoke I m nearly crazy an I dunno which is worst dyin one way or another This is Gates cell the best in the shop He unlocked the door and called Here s visitors Tom Thank you mister Markham replied a quiet voice as a young man came forward from the dim interior of the cell How are you feeling today Worse Tom worse n ever replied the jailer gloomily Well stick it out old man don t give in I won t Tom Smokin ll kill me sure an there s a faint hope o livin through this struggle to give it up This visitor is mister Forbes of Elmhurst an the young lady is Miss DeGraf said Kenneth noticing the boy s face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it Will you leave us alone please mister Markham Sure ly mister Forbes You ve got twenty minutes according to regulations I ll come and get you then Sorry we haven t any reception room in the jail All visits has to be made in the cells Then he deliberately locked Kenneth and Beth in with the forger and retreated along the passage Sit down please said Gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice There s a bench here We ve come to inquire about your case Gates said Kenneth It seems you have forged a check Yes sir I plead guilty although I ve been told I ought not to confess But the fact is that I forged the check and got the money and I m willing to stand the consequences Why did you do it asked Beth He was silent and turned his face away A fresh wholesome looking boy was Tom Gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth He was of sturdy athletic build and dressed neatly in a suit that was of coarse material but well brushed and cared for Beth thought his appearance pleasing and manly Kenneth decided that he was ill at ease and in a state of dogged self repression We have heard something of your story said Kenneth and are interested in it But there is no doubt you have acted very foolishly Do you know Lucy sir asked the young man No Lucy is very proud The thing was killing her and I couldn t bear it I didn t stop to think whether it was foolish or not I did it and I m glad I did You have made her still more unhappy said Beth gently Yes she ll worry about me I know I m disgraced for life but I ve saved Lucy from any disgrace and she s young She ll forget me before I ve served my term and and take up with some other young fellow Would you like that asked Beth No indeed he replied frankly But it will be best that way I had to stand by Lucy she s so sweet and gentle and so sensitive I don t say I did right I only say I d do the same thing again Couldn t her parents have helped her inquired Kenneth No Old Will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus Rogers had her accident Oh did she have an accident asked Beth Yes Didn t you know She s blind Her husband didn t tell us that said the girl He was fairly prosperous before that for missus Rogers was an energetic and sensible woman and kept old Will hard at work One morning she tried to light the fire with kerosene and lost her sight Then Rogers wouldn t do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin I understand now said Beth Lucy could have looked after her mother said young Bates but old Will was stubborn and wouldn t let her So the girl saw something must be done and went to work That s how all the trouble came about He spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them It was evident that his feelings were deeper than he cared to make evident Whose name did you sign to the check asked Kenneth That of John E Marshall the manager of the mill He is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern It s a stock company and rich I was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature As regards my robbing the company I ll say that I saved them a heavy loss one day I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant But Marshall never even thanked me He only discharged the man who was responsible for the fire How long ago were you arrested asked Beth It s nearly two weeks now But I ll have a trial in a few days they say My crime is so serious that the circuit judge has to sit on the case Do you know where Lucy is She s at home I suppose I haven t heard from her since the day she came here to see me right after my arrest They did not think best to enlighten him at that time It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth I m going to see mister Marshall said Kenneth and discover what I can do to assist you Thank you sir It won t be much but I m grateful to find a friend I m guilty you know and there s no one to blame but myself They left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office Tom s a very decent lad remarked the jailer on the way He ain t a natural criminal you know just one o them that gives in to temptation and is foolish enough to get caught I ve seen lots of that kind in my day You don t smoke do you mister Forbes No mister Markham Then don t begin it or if you do never try to quit It s it s awful it is And it ruins a man s disposition The mill was at the outskirts of the town It was a busy place perhaps the busiest in the whole of the Eighth District and in it were employed a large number of men The office was a small brick edifice separated from the main buildings in which the noise of machinery was so great that one speaking could scarcely be heard The manager was in Kenneth and Beth learned but could not see them until he had signed the letters he had dictated for the noon mail So they sat on a bench until a summons came to admit them to mister Marshall s private office He looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated mister Forbes of Elmhurst he asked glancing at the card Kenneth had sent in Yes sir I ve been bothered already over your election campaign resumed the manager arranging his papers in a bored manner Some girl has been here twice to interview my men and I have refused to admit her You may as well understand sir that I stand for the Democratic candidate and have no sympathy with your side That doesn t interest me especially sir answered Kenneth smiling I m not electioneering just now I ve come to talk with you about young Gates Oh Well sir what about him I m interested in the boy and want to save him from prosecution He s a forger mister Forbes a deliberate criminal I admit that But he s very young and his youth is largely responsible for his folly He stole my money It is true mister Marshall And he deserves a term in state s prison I agree to all that Nevertheless I should like to save him said Kenneth His trial has not yet taken place and instead of your devoting considerable of your valuable time appearing against him it would be much simpler to settle the matter right here and now In what way mister Forbes I ll make your money loss good It has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance I can well believe it sir I ll pay twice sixty dollars for the delivery to me of the forged check and the withdrawal of the prosecution And the costs I ll pay all the costs besides You re foolish Why should you do all this I have my own reasons mister Marshall Please look at the matter from a business standpoint If you send the boy to prison you will still suffer the loss of the money By compromising with me you can recover your loss and are paid for your annoyance You re right Give me a check for a hundred and fifty and I ll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings Kenneth hesitated a moment He detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young Gates He had hoped to find mister Marshall a man of sympathy but the manager was as cold as an icicle Beth uneasy at his silence nudged him Pay it Ken she whispered Very well mister Marshall said he I accept your terms The check was written and handed over and Marshall took the forged check from his safe and delivered it with the other papers in the case to mister Forbes He also wrote a note to his lawyer directing him to withdraw the prosecution Kenneth and Beth went away quite happy with their success and the manager stood in his little window and watched them depart There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face Of all the easy marks I ever encountered muttered mister Marshall this young Forbes is the easiest Why he s a fool that s what he is He might have had that forged check for the face of it if he d been sharp You wouldn t catch Rast Hopkins doing such a fool stunt Not in a thousand years Meantime Beth was pressing Kenneth s arm as she sat beside him and saying happily I m so glad Ken so glad And to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars And now we must find the girl Yes replied the boy cheerfully we must find Lucy

none	none	 A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE A woman was sitting in a low room engaged in knitting 
6828_68770_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Her feet were stretched out toward a small fire that smouldered in an open hearth 
6828_68770_000004_000002	train-clean-360	She wore a simple calico gown neat and well fitting and her face bore traces of much beauty that time and care had been unable wholly to efface 
6828_68770_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly she paused in her work her head turned slightly to one side to listen 
6828_68770_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Come in sir she called in a soft but distinct voice come in miss 
6828_68770_000007_000000	train-clean-360	So Kenneth and Beth entered at the half open porch door and advanced into the room 
6828_68770_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Is this missus Rogers asked Beth looking at the woman curiously 
none	none	The woman s eyes were closed but the lashes fell in graceful dark curves over her withered cheeks The girl wondered how she had been able to know her visitors sex so accurately Yes I am missus Rogers said the sweet sad voice And I think you are one of the young ladies from Elmhurst perhaps the one Will talked to You are right missus Rogers 
6828_68770_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I am Elizabeth DeGraf 
6828_68770_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 And your companion is it mister Forbes the woman asked 
none	none	Yes madam replied Kenneth astonished to find Will s wife speaking with so much refinement and gracious ease You are very welcome 
6828_68770_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Will you please find seats 
none	none	My affliction renders me helpless as you may see We are very comfortable I assure you missus Rogers said Beth
6828_68770_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 We have come to ask if you have heard anything of your daughter 
none	none	Not a word as yet Miss DeGraf Will is out with the horse and buggy doing his best to get information But Lucy has been gone so long now that I realize it will be difficult to find her if indeed the poor girl has not is not 
6828_68770_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Her voice broke 
none	none	Oh you don t fear that do you missus Rogers asked Beth quickly I fear anything everything wailed the poor creature the tears streaming from between her closed lids My darling was frantic with grief and she couldn t bear the humiliation and disgrace of her position 
6828_68770_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Will told you didn t he 
none	none	Yes of course 
6828_68770_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But it wasn t so bad missus Rogers it wasn t a desperate condition by any means 
6828_68770_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 With poor Tom in prison for years and just for trying to help her 
6828_68770_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Tom isn t in prison you know any more said Beth quietly 
6828_68770_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 He has been released 
none	none	Released When
6828_68770_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Last evening 
6828_68770_000023_000001	train-clean-360	His fault has been forgiven and he is now free 
6828_68770_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The woman sat silent for a time 
none	none	Then she asked
6828_68770_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 You have done this mister Forbes 
6828_68770_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Miss DeGraf and I assisted perhaps 
none	none	The young man is not really bad and Tom s a fine boy she cried with eagerness
6828_68770_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 He s honest and true mister Forbes he is indeed 
none	none	I think so said Kenneth If he wasn t my Lucy would never have loved him 
6828_68770_000029_000001	train-clean-360	He had a bright future before him sir and that s why my child went mad when he ruined his life for her sake 
6828_68770_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Was she mad do you think asked Beth softly 
none	none	She must have been said the mother sadly
6828_68770_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Lucy was a sensible girl and until this thing happened she was as bright and cheerful as the day is long 
6828_68770_000031_000002	train-clean-360	But she is very sensitive she inherited that from me I think and Tom s action drove her distracted 
none	none	At first she raved and rambled incoherently and Will and I feared brain fever would set in Then she disappeared in the night without leaving a word or message for us which was unlike her and we ve never heard a word of her since The the river has a strange fascination for people in that condition At times in my life it has almost drawn me into its depths and I am not mad I have never been mad
6828_68770_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us hope for the best missus Rogers said Beth 
none	none	Somehow I have an idea this trouble will all turn out well in the end
6828_68770_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you asked the woman earnestly 
none	none	Yes It all came about through such a little thing merely an unjust accusation The little things are the ones that ruin lives she said Will you let me tell you something of myself You have been so kind to us my dear that I feel you ought to know
6828_68770_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall be glad to know whatever you care to tell me said Beth simply 
6828_68770_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I am the wife of a poor farmer began the woman speaking softly and with some hesitation but gaining strength as she proceeded 
none	none	As a girl I was considered attractive and my father was a man of great wealth and social standing 
6828_68770_000037_000002	train-clean-360	We lived in Baltimore 
6828_68770_000037_000003	train-clean-360	Then I fell in love with a young man who after obtaining my promise to marry him found some one he loved better and carelessly discarded me 
none	none	As I have said I have a sensitive nature In my girlhood I was especially susceptible to any slight and this young man s heartless action made it impossible for me to remain at home and face the humiliation he had thrust upon me My father was a hard man and demanded that I marry the man he had himself chosen but I resented this command and ran away 
6828_68770_000037_000007	train-clean-360	My mother had passed on long before and there was nothing to keep me at home 
6828_68770_000037_000008	train-clean-360	I came west and secured a position to teach school in this county and for a time I was quite contented and succeeded in living down my disappointment 
6828_68770_000037_000009	train-clean-360	I heard but once from my father 
6828_68770_000037_000010	train-clean-360	He had married again and disinherited me He forbade me to ever communicate with him again 
none	none	At that time Will Rogers was one of the most promising and manly of the country lads around here 
6828_68770_000038_000001	train-clean-360	He was desperately in love with me and at this period when I seemed completely cut off from my old life and the future contained no promise I thought it best to wear out the remainder of my existence in the seclusion of a farm house 
6828_68770_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I put all the past behind me and told Will Rogers I would marry him and be a faithful wife but that my heart was dead 
6828_68770_000038_000003	train-clean-360	He accepted me on that condition and it was not until after we were married some time that my husband realized how impossible it would ever be to arouse my affection 
6828_68770_000038_000004	train-clean-360	Then he lost courage and became careless and reckless 
6828_68770_000038_000005	train-clean-360	When our child came our Lucy Will was devoted to her and the baby wakened in me all the old passionate capacity to love 
6828_68770_000038_000006	train-clean-360	Lucy drew Will and me a little closer together but he never recovered his youthful ambition 
6828_68770_000038_000007	train-clean-360	He was a disappointed man and went from bad to worse 
none	none	I don t say Will hasn t always been tender and true to me and absolutely devoted to Lucy 
6828_68770_000038_000009	train-clean-360	But he lost all hope of being loved as he loved me and the disappointment broke him down 
6828_68770_000038_000010	train-clean-360	He became an old man early in life and his lack of energy kept us very poor 
6828_68770_000038_000011	train-clean-360	I used to take in sewing before the accident to my eyes and that helped a good deal to pay expenses 
6828_68770_000038_000012	train-clean-360	But now I am helpless and my husband devotes all his time to me although I beg him to work the farm and try to earn some money 
none	none	I wouldn t have minded the poverty I wouldn t mind being blind even if Lucy had been spared to me 
6828_68770_000039_000001	train-clean-360	I have had to bear so much in my life that I could even bear my child s death 
none	none	But to have her disappear and not know what has become of her whether she is living miserably or lying at the bottom of the river it is this that is driving me distracted 
6828_68770_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Kenneth and Beth remained silent for a time after missus Rogers had finished her tragic story for their hearts were full of sympathy for the poor woman 
6828_68770_000040_000001	train-clean-360	It was hard to realize that a refined beautiful and educated girl had made so sad a mistake of her life and suffered so many afflictions as a consequence 
none	none	That old Will had never been a fitting mate for his wife could readily be understood and yet the man was still devoted to his helpless unresponsive spouse 
6828_68770_000040_000003	train-clean-360	The fault was not his 
none	none	The boy and the girl both perceived that there was but one way they could assist missus Rogers and that was to discover what had become of her child
6828_68770_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Was Lucy like you or did she resemble her father asked Beth 
none	none	She is she was very like me when I was young replied the woman There is a photograph of her on the wall there between the windows but it was taken five years ago when she was a child Now she is she was eighteen and a well developed young woman
6828_68770_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve been looking at the picture said Kenneth 
6828_68770_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 And you mustn t think of her as dead missus Rogers said Beth pleadingly 
6828_68770_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 I m sure she is alive and that we shall find her 
6828_68770_000045_000002	train-clean-360	We re going right to work and everything possible shall be done to trace your daughter 
6828_68770_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Don t worry please 
6828_68770_000045_000004	train-clean-360	Be as cheerful as you can and leave the search to us 
none	none	The woman sighed Will believes she is alive too she said
6828_68770_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 He can t sleep or rest till he finds her for my husband loves her as well as I do 
none	none	But sometimes I feel it s wicked to hope she is alive 
6828_68770_000047_000003	train-clean-360	I know what she suffers for I suffered myself and life isn t worth living when despair and disappointment fills it 
6828_68770_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I cannot see why Lucy shouldn t yet be happy protested Beth 
6828_68770_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 Tom Gates is now free and can begin life anew 
none	none	His trouble will follow him everywhere said missus Rogers with conviction
6828_68770_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 Who will employ a bookkeeper or even a clerk who has been guilty of forgery 
6828_68770_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 I think I shall give him employment replied Kenneth 
none	none	You mister Forbes Yes 
6828_68770_000052_000001	train-clean-360	I m not afraid of a boy who became a criminal to save the girl he loved 
none	none	But all the world knows of his crime she exclaimed
6828_68770_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 The world forgets these things sooner than you suppose he answered I need a secretary and in that position Tom Gates will quickly be able to live down this unfortunate affair 
6828_68770_000054_000001	train-clean-360	And if he turns out as well as I expect he will soon be able to marry Lucy and give her a comfortable home 
6828_68770_000054_000002	train-clean-360	So now nothing remains but to find your girl and we ll try to do that I assure you 
6828_68770_000055_000000	train-clean-360	missus Rogers was crying softly by this time but it was from joy and relief 
6828_68770_000055_000001	train-clean-360	When they left her she promised to be as cheerful as possible and to look on the bright side of life 
6828_68770_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t thank you she said so I won t try 
6828_68770_000056_000001	train-clean-360	You must know how grateful we are to you 
6828_68770_000057_000000	train-clean-360	As Beth and Kenneth drove back to Elmhurst they were both rather silent for they had been strongly affected by the scene at the farm house 
none	none	It s so good of you Ken to take Tom Gates into your employ said the girl pressing her cousin s arm
6828_68770_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 And I m sure he ll be true and grateful 
6828_68770_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 I really need him Beth said the boy 
6828_68770_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 There is getting to be too much correspondence for mister Watson to attend to and I ought to relieve him of many other details 
6828_68770_000059_000002	train-clean-360	It s a good arrangement and I m glad I thought of it 
6828_68770_000060_000000	train-clean-360	They had almost reached Elmhurst when they met the Honorable Erastus Hopkins driving along the road 
6828_68770_000060_000001	train-clean-360	On the seat beside him was a young girl and as the vehicles passed each other Beth gave a start and clung to the boy s arm 
none	none	Oh Ken she cried did you see 
6828_68770_000061_000001	train-clean-360	Did you see that 
6828_68770_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes it s my respected adversary 
none	none	But the girl 
6828_68770_000063_000001	train-clean-360	It s Lucy I m sure it s Lucy 
6818_68772_000021_000001	train-clean-100	 She s the living image of missus Rogers 
6828_68770_000063_000003	train-clean-360	Stop stop and let s go back 
none	none	Nonsense Beth said the boy
6828_68770_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 It can t be 
none	none	But it is 
6828_68770_000065_000001	train-clean-360	I m sure it is 
none	none	I saw the girl he said
6828_68770_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 She was laughing gaily and talking with the Honorable Erastus 
none	none	Is that your idea of the mad broken hearted Lucy Rogers N no She was laughing Ken I noticed it
6828_68770_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 And she wasn t unhappy a bit 
none	none	You mustn t think that every pretty girl with dark eyes you meet is Lucy Rogers you know And there s another thing What Ken
6828_68770_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Any companion of mister Hopkins can be easily traced 
6828_68770_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 That s true answered the girl thoughtfully 
none	none	I must have been mistaken she added with a sigh CHAPTER XII BETH MEETS A REBUFF The campaign was now growing warm mister Hopkins had come to realize that he had the fight of his life on his hands and that defeat meant his political ruin Close fisted and miserly as he was no one knew so well as the Honorable Erastus how valuable this position of Representative was to him in a financial way and that by winning re election he could find means to reimburse himself for all he had expended in the fight So to the surprise of the Democratic Committee and all his friends mister Hopkins announced that he would oppose Forbes s aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary He did not laugh at his opponents any longer To himself he admitted their shrewdness and activity and acknowledged that an experienced head was managing their affairs One of mister Hopkins s first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen around him was to make a careful canvass of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished This canvass was quite satisfactory for final report showed only about a hundred majority for Forbes The district was naturally Republican by six hundred majority and Hopkins had previously been elected by a plurality of eighty three so that all the electioneering of the girl politicians and the expenditure of vast sums of money in painting fences and barns buying newspapers and flaunting Forbes banners in the breezes had not cut into the Hopkins following to any serious extent But to offset this cheering condition the Democratic agents who made the canvass reported that there was an air of uncertainty throughout the district and that many of those who declared for Hopkins were lukewarm and faint hearted and might easily be induced to change their votes This was what must be prevented The weak kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or another secured from the opposition The Democratic Committee figured out a way to do this Monroe County where both Forbes and Hopkins resided was one of the Democratic strongholds of the State The portions of Washington and Jefferson Counties included in the Eighth District were as strongly Republican and being more populous gave to the district its natural Republican majority On the same ticket that was to elect a Representative to the State Legislature was the candidate for Sheriff of Monroe County A man named Cummings was the Republican and Seth Reynolds the liveryman the Democratic nominee Under ordinary conditions Reynolds was sure to be elected but the Committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect Hopkins The Democrats would bargain with the Republicans to vote for the Republican Sheriff if the Republicans would vote for the Democratic Representative This trading votes which was often done was considered by the politicians quite legitimate The only thing necessary was to fix Seth Reynolds and this Hopkins arranged personally The office of Sheriff would pay about two thousand a year and this sum Hopkins agreed to pay the liveryman and so relieve him of all the annoyance of earning it Reynolds saw the political necessity of this sacrifice and consented readily to the arrangement mister Cummings who was to profit by the deal was called to a private consultation and agreed to slaughter Kenneth Forbes to secure votes for himself It was thought that this clever arrangement would easily win the fight for Hopkins But the Honorable Erastus had no intention of taking chances or monkeying with fate as he tersely expressed it Every scheme known to politicians must be worked and none knew the intricate game better than Hopkins This was why he held several long conferences with his friend Marshall the manager at the mill And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy mister Hopkins had picked her up from the path leading from the rear gate of the Elmhurst grounds and she had given him accurate information concerning the movements of the girl campaigners The description she gave of the coming reception to the Woman s Political League was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister Hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were He talked for an hour with the girl gave her explicit instructions thrust some money into her hand and then drove her back to the bend in the path whence she quickly made her way up to the great house Louise was making great preparations to entertain the Woman s Political League an organization she had herself founded the members of which were wives of farmers in the district These women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister Forbes Louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted Patsy and Beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations The Fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests Tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served The day of the entertainment was as sunny and mild as heart could desire By ten o clock the farm wagons began to drive up loaded with women and children for all were invited except the grown men This was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at Elmhurst and the only one within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been invited guests So all were eager to attend and enjoy the novel event The gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with Chinese and Japanese lanterns streamers and Forbes banners There were great tanks of lemonade and tables covered with candies and fruits for the children and maids and other servants distributed the things and looked after the comfort of the guests The band played briskly and before noon the scene was one of great animation A speakers stand profusely decorated had been erected on the lawn and hundreds of folding chairs provided for seats The attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted foreseeing great success for their fete We ought to have more attendants Beth said Louise approaching her cousin Won t you run into the house and see if Martha can t spare one or two more maids Beth went at once and found the housekeeper in her little room Martha was old and somewhat feeble in body but her mind was still active and her long years of experience in directing the household at Elmhurst made her a very useful and important personage She was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when Aunt Jane was the mistress here and Beth was her especial favorite So she greeted the girl cordially and said Maids My dear I haven t another one to give you and my legs are too tottering to be of any use I counted on Eliza Parsons the new girl I hired for the linen room and to do mending but Eliza said she had a headache this morning and couldn t stand the sun So I let her off But she didn t seem very sick to me Perhaps she is better and will help us until after the luncheon is served said Beth Where is she Martha I ll go and ask her I d better show you the way miss She s in her own room The housekeeper led the way and Beth followed When she rapped upon the door a sweet quiet voice said Come in The girl entered and gave an involuntary cry of surprise Standing before her was the young girl she had seen riding with mister Hopkins the girl she had declared to be the missing daughter of missus Rogers For a moment Beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face She was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at Elmhurst a plain black gown with white apron and cap I I beg your pardon said Beth with a slight gasp for the likeness to missus Rogers was something amazing Aren t you Lucy Rogers The maid raised her eyebrows with a gesture of genuine surprise Then she gave a little laugh and replied No Miss Beth I m Elizabeth Parsons But it can t be protested the girl How do you know my name and why haven t I seen you here before I m not a very important person at Elmhurst replied Eliza in a pleasant even tone I obtained the situation only a few days ago I attend to the household mending you know and care for the linen But one can t be here without knowing the names of the young ladies so I recognize you as Miss Beth one of mister Forbes s cousins You speak like an educated person said Beth wonderingly Where is your home For the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor Will you excuse my answering that question she asked It is very simple and natural persisted Beth Why cannot you answer it Excuse me please I I am not well today I have a headache She sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth I m sorry said Beth I hoped you would be able to assist me on the lawn There are so many people that we can t give them proper attention Eliza Parsons shook her head I am not able she declared I abhor crowds They they excite me in some way and I I can t bear them You must excuse me Beth looked at the strange girl without taking the hint to retire Somehow she could not rid herself of the impression that whether or not she was mistaken in supposing Eliza to be the missing Lucy she had stumbled upon a sphinx whose riddle was well worth solving But Eliza bore the scrutiny with quiet unconcern She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted Beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet Eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact Her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance Beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought to go yet some fascination held her to the spot Her eyes wandered to the maid s hands However her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story The thin fingers clasped and unclasped in little spasmodic jerks and belied the quiet smile upon the face above them I wish said Beth slowly I knew you A sudden wave of scarlet swept over Eliza s face She rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath I wish I knew myself she cried fiercely Why do you annoy me in this manner What am I to you Will you leave me alone in my own room or must I go away to escape you I will go said Beth a little frightened at the passionate appeal Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock The sound made Beth indignant and she hurried back to where her cousins were busy with the laughing chattering throng of visitors

none	none	 THE BOOMERANG 
6818_68772_000005_000000	train-clean-100	The lawn fete was a tremendous success and every farmer s wife was proud of her satin badge bearing the monogram W 
6818_68772_000005_000001	train-clean-100	P L and the words FORBES FOR REPRESENTATIVE 
6818_68772_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Certain edibles such as charlotte russe Spanish cream wine jellies and mousses to say nothing of the caviars and anchovies were wholly unknown to them but they ate the dainties with a wise disregard of their inexperience and enjoyed them immensely 
6818_68772_000007_000000	train-clean-100	The old butler was a general in his way and in view of the fact that the staff of servants at Elmhurst was insufficient to cope with such a throng he allowed Louise to impress several farmers daughters into service and was able to feed everyone without delay and in an abundant and satisfactory manner 
6818_68772_000008_000000	train-clean-100	After luncheon began the speech making interspersed with music by the band 
6818_68772_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Louise made the preliminary address and although her voice was not very strong the silent attention of her hearers permitted her to be generally understood 
6818_68772_000010_000000	train-clean-100	She called attention to the fact that this campaign was important because it promised more beautiful and attractive houses for the farmers and townsmen alike 
none	none	We had all grown so accustomed to advertising signs she said that we failed to notice how thick they were becoming or how bold and overpowering From a few scattered announcements on fence boards they had crowded themselves into more prominent places until the barns and sheds and the very rocks were daubed with glaring letters asking us to buy the medicines soaps tobaccos and other wares the manufacturers were anxious to sell Every country road became an advertising avenue Scarcely a country house was free from signs of some sort 
6818_68772_000011_000003	train-clean-100	Yet the people tamely submitted to this imposition because they knew no way to avoid it 
6818_68772_000011_000004	train-clean-100	When mister Forbes began his campaign to restore the homesteads to their former beauty and dignity a cry was raised against him 
6818_68772_000011_000005	train-clean-100	But this was because the farmers did not understand how much this reform meant to them 
6818_68772_000011_000006	train-clean-100	So we gave them an object lesson 
6818_68772_000011_000007	train-clean-100	We painted out all the signs in this section at our own expense that you might see how much more beautiful your homes are without them 
6818_68772_000011_000008	train-clean-100	We believe that none of you will ever care to allow advertising signs on your property again and that the quiet refinement of this part of the country will induce many other places to follow our example until advertisers are forced to confine themselves to newspapers magazines and circulars their only legitimate channels 
6818_68772_000011_000009	train-clean-100	This much mister Forbes has already done for you and he will now tell you what else if he is elected he proposes to do 
6818_68772_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Kenneth then took the platform and was welcomed with a hearty cheer 
6818_68772_000012_000001	train-clean-100	He modestly assured them that a Representative in the State Legislature could accomplish much good for his district if he honestly desired to do so 
6818_68772_000012_000002	train-clean-100	That was what a Representative was for to represent his people 
6818_68772_000012_000003	train-clean-100	It was folly to elect any man who would forget that duty and promote only his own interests through the position of power to which the people had appointed him 
none	none	mister Forbes admitted that he had undertaken this campaign because he was opposed to offensive advertising signs but now he had become interested in other issues and was anxious to be elected so that he could carry on the work of reform 
6818_68772_000012_000005	train-clean-100	They needed more school houses for their children and many other things which he hoped to provide as their Representative 
6818_68772_000013_000000	train-clean-100	During this oration Beth happened to glance up at the house and her sharp eyes detected the maid Eliza standing shielded behind the half closed blind of an upper window and listening to as well as watching the proceedings below 
none	none	Then she remembered how the girl had been laughing and talking with mister Hopkins when she first saw her and with sudden dismay realized that Eliza was a spy in the service of the enemy 
6818_68772_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Her first impulse was to denounce the maid at once and have her discharged but the time was not opportune so she waited until the festivities were ended 
6818_68772_000015_000000	train-clean-100	It had been a great day for the families of the neighboring farmers and they drove homeward in the late afternoon full of enthusiasm over the royal manner in which they had been entertained and admiration for the girls who had provided the fun and feasting 
6818_68772_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Indeed there were more kindly thoughts expressed for the inhabitants of Elmhurst than had ever before been heard in a single day in the history of the county and the great and the humble seemed more closely drawn together 
6818_68772_000016_000000	train-clean-100	When the last guest had departed Beth got her cousins and Kenneth together and told them of her discovery of the spy 
none	none	Kenneth was at first greatly annoyed and proposed to call Martha and have the false maid ejected from the premises but Patsy s wise little head counselled caution in handling the matter
6818_68772_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Now that we know her secret she said the girl cannot cause us more real harm and there may be a way to circumvent this unscrupulous Hopkins and turn the incident to our own advantage 
6818_68772_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Let s think it over carefully before we act 
none	none	There s another thing said Beth supporting her cousin I m interested in the mystery surrounding the girl I now think I was wrong in suspecting her to be the lost Lucy Rogers but there is surely some romance connected with her and she is not what she seems to be 
6818_68772_000019_000003	train-clean-100	I d like to study her a little 
6818_68772_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 It was absurd to connect her with Lucy Rogers observed Kenneth for there is nothing in her character to remind one of the unhappy girl 
6818_68772_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Except her looks added Beth 
none	none	She s the living image of missus Rogers That isn t important replied Louise
6818_68772_000022_000001	train-clean-100	 It is probably a mere coincidence 
none	none	None of us have ever seen the real Lucy and she may not resemble her mother at all missus Rogers claims she does said Beth But anyhow I have a wish to keep this girl at the house where I can study her character
6818_68772_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Then keep her my dear decided Kenneth 
none	none	I ll set a couple of men to watch the gates and if she goes out we ll know whom she meets 
6818_68772_000024_000002	train-clean-100	The most she can do is to report our movements to mister Hopkins and there s no great harm in that 
6818_68772_000025_000000	train-clean-100	So the matter was left for the time and as if to verify Beth s suspicions Eliza was seen to leave the grounds after dusk and meet mister Hopkins in the lane 
6818_68772_000025_000001	train-clean-100	They conversed together a few moments and then the maid calmly returned and went to her room 
6818_68772_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The next day mister Hopkins scattered flaring hand bills over the district which were worded in a way designed to offset any advantage his opponent had gained from the lawn fete of the previous day 
6818_68772_000026_000001	train-clean-100	They read Hopkins the Man of the Times is the Champion of the Signs of the Times 
6818_68772_000026_000002	train-clean-100	Forbes who never earned a dollar in his life but inherited his money is trying to take the dollars out of the pockets of the farmers by depriving them of the income derived by selling spaces for advertising signs 
none	none	He is robbing the farmers while claiming he wants to beautify their homes 
6818_68772_000026_000004	train-clean-100	The farmers can t eat beauty they want money 
6818_68772_000026_000005	train-clean-100	Therefore they are going to vote for the Honorable Erastus Hopkins for Representative Then followed an estimate of the money paid the farmers of the district by the advertisers during the past five years amounting to several thousands of dollars in the aggregate 
6818_68772_000026_000006	train-clean-100	The circular ended in this way Hopkins challenges Forbes to deny these facts 
6818_68772_000026_000007	train-clean-100	Hopkins is willing to meet Forbes before the public at any time and place he may select to settle this argument in joint debate 
6818_68772_000027_000000	train-clean-100	The girls accepted the challenge at once 
6818_68772_000027_000001	train-clean-100	Within two days every farmer had received a notice that mister Forbes would meet mister Hopkins at the Fairview Opera House on Saturday afternoon to debate the question as to whether advertising signs brought good or evil to the community 
6818_68772_000028_000000	train-clean-100	The campaign was now getting hot 
6818_68772_000028_000001	train-clean-100	Because of the activity of the opposing candidates every voter in the district had become more or less interested in the fight and people were taking one side or the other with unusual earnestness 
6818_68772_000029_000000	train-clean-100	mister Hopkins was not greatly pleased that his challenge had been accepted 
6818_68772_000029_000001	train-clean-100	He had imagined that the Forbes party would ignore it and leave him the prestige of crowing over his opponent s timidity 
6818_68772_000029_000002	train-clean-100	But he remembered how easily he had subdued Kenneth at the school house meeting before the nominations and had no doubt of his ability to repeat the operation 
6818_68772_000030_000000	train-clean-100	He was much incensed against the girls who were working for Kenneth Forbes for he realized that they were proving an important factor in the campaign 
6818_68772_000030_000001	train-clean-100	He even attributed to them more than they deserved for Uncle John s telling activities were so quietly conducted that he was personally lost sight of entirely by mister Hopkins 
6818_68772_000031_000000	train-clean-100	mister Hopkins had therefore become so enraged that against the advice of his friends he issued a circular sneering at Women in Politics The newspapers having been subsidized by the opposition so early in the game mister Hopkins had driven to employ the circular method of communicating with the voters 
6818_68772_000031_000001	train-clean-100	Scarcely a day passed now that his corps of distributors did not leave some of his literature at every dwelling in the district 
6818_68772_000032_000000	train-clean-100	His tirade against the girls was neither convincing nor in good taste He asked the voters if they were willing to submit to petticoat government and permit a lot of boarding school girls with more boldness than modesty to dictate the policies of the community 
6818_68772_000032_000001	train-clean-100	 These frizzle headed females continued the circular are trying to make your wives and daughters as rebellious and unreasonable as they are themselves but no man of sense will permit a woman to influence his vote 
6818_68772_000032_000002	train-clean-100	It is a disgrace to this district that mister Forbes allows his girlish campaign to be run by a lot of misses who should be at home darning stockings or if they were not able to do that practicing their music lessons 
6818_68772_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Good exclaimed shrewd Miss Patsy when she read this circular 
6818_68772_000033_000001	train-clean-100	 If I m not much mistaken mister Hopkins has thrown a boomerang 
6818_68772_000033_000002	train-clean-100	Every woman who attended the fete is now linked with us as an ally and every one of them will resent this foolish circular 
6818_68772_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 I m sorry said Kenneth that you girls should be forced to endure this 
6818_68772_000034_000001	train-clean-100	I feared something like it when you insisted on taking a hand in the game 
6818_68772_000035_000000	train-clean-100	But they laughed at him and at mister Hopkins and declared they were not at all offended 
none	none	One cannot touch pitch without being defiled said mister Watson gravely and politics as mister Hopkins knows it is little more than pitch I cannot see that there is anything my girls have done to forfeit respect and admiration asserted Uncle John stoutly To accuse them of boldness or immodesty is absurd 
6818_68772_000037_000002	train-clean-100	They have merely gone to work in a business like manner and used their wits and common sense in educating the voters 
none	none	Really my dears I m more proud of you today than I ve ever been before he concluded 
6818_68772_000038_000000	train-clean-100	And Uncle John was right 
6818_68772_000038_000001	train-clean-100	There had been no loss of dignity by any one of the three and their evident refinement as well as their gentleness and good humor had until now protected them from any reproach 
none	none	It had remained for mister Hopkins to accuse them and his circular had a wide influence in determining the issue of the campaign CHAPTER XIV LUCY S GHOST 
6696_68773_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Kenneth had sent word to Tom Gates asking the young man to come to Elmhurst but it was not until two days after the lawn party that Tom appeared and asked permission to see mister Forbes 
6696_68773_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Beth and Louise were with Kenneth at the time and were eager to remain during the interview so the young man was shown into the library 
none	none	Beth could scarcely recognize in him the calm and cheerful Tom Gates they had visited in the county jail for his face was drawn with care and anxiety eyes were bloodshot and his former neat appearance was changed to one careless and untidy 
6696_68773_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Kenneth scrutinized him closely 
6696_68773_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 What have you been up to Tom he asked 
none	none	I ve been searching for Lucy sir night and day I haven t slept a wink since I heard the awful news of her sickness and escape 
6696_68773_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Where do you think she can be sir 
none	none	His question was full of agonized entreaty and his manner pitifully appealing I don t know answered Kenneth
6696_68773_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 Where have you searched 
6696_68773_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Everywhere sir that she might be likely to go 
none	none	I ve inquired in every town and along every road leading out of the county She didn t take a train because poor Lucy hadn t any money and I ve asked at all the stations And and along the river they say no girl answering her description has been seen
6696_68773_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 It s strange remarked Kenneth thoughtfully while the girls regarded the youth with silent sympathy 
none	none	If you knew Lucy sir you d realize how strange it is went on young Gates earnestly
6696_68773_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 She was such a gentle shrinking girl as shy and retiring as a child 
none	none	And she never did a thing that would cause anyone the least worry or unhappiness 
6696_68773_000013_000003	train-clean-360	But she was out of her head sir and didn t know what she was about 
none	none	That was the reason she went away 
6696_68773_000013_000005	train-clean-360	And from the moment she left her home all trace of her was lost 
none	none	One would think observed Kenneth that a poor demented girl wandering about the country would be noticed by scores of people 
6696_68773_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Did she take any clothing with her 
none	none	Only the dress she had on sir and not even a hat or a shawl
6696_68773_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 What was her dress like asked Beth quickly 
none	none	It was a light grey in color and plainly made She wore a white collar but that is all we can be certain she had on You see her mother is blind and old Will doesn t observe very closely
6696_68773_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Does Lucy resemble her mother inquired Beth 
6696_68773_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Very much miss 
none	none	She was a beautiful girl everyone acknowledged And it s all my fault all my fault I thought to save her and drove her mad instead
6696_68773_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 You might have known that declared Kenneth 
none	none	A girl of her character sensitive to a fault would be greatly shocked to find the man she loved a criminal It was for her sake
6696_68773_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 That is a poor excuse 
6696_68773_000022_000001	train-clean-360	If you had waited Lucy would have proved her innocence 
none	none	They threatened to arrest her sir 
6696_68773_000023_000001	train-clean-360	It would have killed her 
6696_68773_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 They wouldn t dare arrest her on suspicion 
none	none	The Squierses would dare do anything You don t know old missus Squiers I know the law sir and in any event it was a foolish thing as well as criminal to forge a check to get the money they demanded You are right sir replied Tom Gates despondently It was foolish and criminal 
6696_68773_000027_000002	train-clean-360	I wouldn t mind my own punishment but it drove my Lucy mad 
none	none	See here said Kenneth sternly you are getting morbid young man and pretty soon you ll be mad yourself 
6696_68773_000028_000001	train-clean-360	If Lucy is found do you want her to see you in this condition 
6696_68773_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Can she be found sir do you think 
none	none	We are trying to find her replied Kenneth
6696_68773_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 You have failed it seems and Will Rogers had failed 
none	none	I ve had one of the cleverest detectives of Chicago trying to find her for the last three days
6696_68773_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Kenneth exclaimed Beth 
none	none	I didn t know that How good of you It must have been the detective that came to see missus Rogers said Tom musingly She told me a strange man had been there from mister Forbes to inquire all about Lucy Yes he makes a report to me every evening remarked Kenneth and mister Burke says this is the most mystifying case he has ever encountered So far there isn t a clew to follow 
6696_68773_000033_000002	train-clean-360	But you may rest assured that what any man can do Burke will do 
none	none	I m so grateful sir said Tom Then you must show it by being a man and not by giving way to your trouble in this foolish manner
6696_68773_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll try sir now that there s something to hope for 
6696_68773_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 There s a good deal to hope for 
6696_68773_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Despair won t help you 
6696_68773_000037_000002	train-clean-360	You must go to work 
none	none	I will It won t be very easy to get work for I ve disgraced myself in this neighborhood and I can t leave here till something is known of Lucy s fate But I ll do something any kind of work if I can get it
6696_68773_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I need someone to assist me in my correspondence said Kenneth 
none	none	Would you like to be my secretary Me mister Forbes me
6696_68773_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Tom 
6696_68773_000041_000001	train-clean-360	I ll pay you twenty dollars a week to start with and more if you serve me faithfully 
6696_68773_000041_000002	train-clean-360	And you ll board here of course 
6696_68773_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Then Tom Gates broke down and began to cry like a child although he tried hard to control himself 
none	none	You you must forgive me mister Forbes he said penitently I I ve been without sleep for so long that I haven t any nerves left
6696_68773_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Then you must go to sleep now and get a good rest He turned to Beth Will you see Martha he asked and have her give Tom Gates a room 
6696_68773_000045_000000	train-clean-360	She went on her errand at once and gradually the young man recovered his composure 
none	none	I can do typewriting and stenography mister Forbes he said and I can keep accounts I ll serve you faithfully sir We ll talk of all this by and by Tom replied Kenneth kindly
6696_68773_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 Just now you must have some sleep and get your strength back 
6696_68773_000047_000002	train-clean-360	And don t worry about Lucy 
none	none	Burke will do everything that can be done and I am confident he will be able to trace the girl in time Thank you sir Then he followed the butler away to his room and after the girls had discussed him and expressed their sympathy for the unfortunate fellow they all turned their attention to the important matter of the campaign The debate with Hopkins was the thing that occupied them just now and when Patsy joined the group of workers they began to discuss some means of scoring a decisive victory at the Fairview Opera House 
6696_68773_000049_000001	train-clean-360	The Honorable Erastus still insisted upon making the anti sign fight the prominent issue of the campaign and they must reply forcibly to the misleading statements made in his last hand bill 
none	none	Meantime Tom Gates was sunk in the deep sleep of physical exhaustion and the day wore away before he wakened When at last he regained consciousness he found the sun sinking in the west and feared he had been guilty of indiscretion 
6696_68773_000050_000002	train-clean-360	He remembered that he was mister Forbes s secretary now and that mister Forbes might want him 
none	none	He was not yet thoroughly rested but night was approaching and he reflected that he could obtain all the sleep that he needed then 
6696_68773_000051_000000	train-clean-360	So greatly refreshed and in a quieter mood than he had been for days the young man dressed and entered the hall to find his way downstairs 
6696_68773_000052_000000	train-clean-360	It happened that Beth whose room was near this rear corridor had just gone there to dress for dinner and as she was closing her door she heard a wild impassioned cry 
none	none	Lucy 
6696_68773_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Quickly she sprang out into the hall and turned the corner in time to see a strange tableau 
6696_68773_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Young Gates was standing with his arms outstretched toward Eliza Parsons who a few paces away had her back to the door of her own chamber from which she had evidently just stepped 
none	none	She stood motionless looking curiously at the youth who confronted her
6696_68773_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Lucy don t you know me he asked his voice trembling with emotion 
none	none	To begin with said the girl composedly my name happens to be Eliza 
6696_68773_000057_000001	train-clean-360	And as we ve not been properly introduced I really don t see why I should know you she added with a light laugh 
6696_68773_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Tom Gates shrank away from her as if he had been struck 
6696_68773_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 You can t be Lucy he murmured 
none	none	And yet and yet oh you must be Lucy 
6696_68773_000059_000002	train-clean-360	You must know me 
6696_68773_000059_000003	train-clean-360	Look at me dear I m Tom 
6696_68773_000059_000004	train-clean-360	I m your own Tom Lucy 
none	none	It s very gratifying I m sure young man said the girl a touch of scorn in her tones If you re my own Tom you ll perhaps stand out of my way and let me go to my work Without another word he backed up again the wall and permitted her to sweep by him which she did with a gesture of disdain When Eliza Parsons had disappeared down the back stairs Beth drew a long breath and approached Tom Gates who still stood by the wall staring at the place where the girl had disappeared I overheard said Beth
6696_68773_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 Tell me Tom is she really like Lucy 
6696_68773_000064_000000	train-clean-360	He looked at her with a dazed expression as if he scarcely comprehended her words 
6696_68773_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Could you have been mistaken persisted the questioner 
none	none	He passed his hand over his eyes and gave a shudder Either it was Lucy or her ghost he muttered
6696_68773_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Eliza Parsons is no ghost declared Beth 
none	none	She s one of the maids here at Elmhurst and you re quite likely to see her again Has she been here long he asked eagerly
6696_68773_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 No only a few days 
none	none	Oh When I first saw her I was struck by her resemblance to missus Rogers continued the girl But she s so different said Tom choking back a sob Lucy couldn t be so so airy so heartless She isn t at all that style of a girl miss
6696_68773_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 She may be acting suggested Beth 
6696_68773_000075_000000	train-clean-360	But he shook his head gloomily 
6696_68773_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 No Lucy couldn t act that way 
6696_68773_000076_000001	train-clean-360	She s quick and impulsive but she she couldn t act 
none	none	And she wouldn t treat me that way either Miss Beth Lucy and I have been sweethearts for years and I know every expression of her dear face But the look that this girl gave me was one that my Lucy never could assume I must have been mistaken 
6696_68773_000076_000005	train-clean-360	I I m sure I was mistaken 
6696_68773_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Beth sighed 
6696_68773_000077_000001	train-clean-360	She was disappointed 
none	none	I suppose continued Tom that I ve thought of Lucy so long and so much lately and worried so over her disappearance that I m not quite myself and imagined this girl was more like her than she really is What did you say her name was Eliza Parsons Thank you 
6696_68773_000080_000001	train-clean-360	Can you tell me where I ll find mister Forbes 
6696_68773_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 He s getting ready for dinner now and won t need you at present 
6696_68773_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I ll go back to my room 
6696_68773_000082_000001	train-clean-360	It it was a great shock to me that likeness Miss DeGraf 
none	none	I can well believe it said Beth and then she went to her own apartment greatly puzzled at a resemblance so strong that it had even deceived Lucy Rogers s own sweetheart CHAPTER XV SIGNS OF THE TIMES If she is really Lucy Rogers she ll be missing tomorrow morning said Beth when she had told her cousins of the encounter in the corridor But Eliza Parsons was still at Elmhurst the next day calmly pursuing her duties and evidently having forgotten or decided to ignore the young man who had so curiously mistaken her for another Beth took occasion to watch her movements so far as she could and came to the conclusion that the girl was not acting a part She laughed naturally and was too light hearted and gay to harbor a care of any sort in her frivolous mind But there was a mystery about her that could not be denied Even if she were but a paid spy of Erastus Hopkins there was a story in this girl s life brief as it had been Beth was full of curiosity to know this story As for Tom Gates he had been so horrified by his mistake that he tried to avoid meeting Eliza again This was not difficult because the girl kept pretty closely to the linen room and Tom was chiefly occupied in the library Kenneth had little chance to test his secretary s abilities just then because the girls pounced upon the new recruit and used his services in a variety of ways Tom Gates s anxiety to give satisfaction made him willing to do anything but they refrained from sending him often to town because he was sensitive to the averted looks and evident repulsion of those who knew he had recently been a jail bird But there was plenty for him to do at Elmhurst where they were all as busy as bees and whatever the young man undertook he accomplished in a satisfactory manner Saturday forenoon the three girls with Kenneth mister Watson and Uncle John rode over to Fairview to prepare for the debate that was to take place in the afternoon leaving only Tom Gates at home As mister Hopkins had thrust upon his opponent the task of naming the place and time the Republican candidate was obliged to make all the arrangements and pay all the costs But whatever the girl managers undertook they did well So the Opera House had been in the hands of a special committee for two days the orchestra had been hired and the news of the joint debate had spread far and wide The party from Elmhurst lunched at the Fairview Hotel and then the girls hurried to the Opera House while Kenneth remained to attend a conference of the Republican Committee These gentlemen were much worried over the discovery of a scheme to trade votes that had been sprung and that Forbes and Reynolds were being sacrificed for Hopkins and Cummings mister Cummings was called into the meeting and he denied that the trading was being done with his consent but defiantly refused to make a public announcement to that effect The matter was really serious because every vote lost in that way counted as two for the other side and Hopkins s rabid hand bills had influenced many of the more ignorant voters and created endless disputes that were not of benefit to the Republican party As nearly as we can figure from our recent canvass said mister Cunningham the chairman we are fast losing ground and our chances of success are smaller than if no interest in the election had been aroused Hopkins has cut our majority down to nothing and it will be a hard struggle to carry our ticket through to success This is the more discouraging because mister Forbes has spent so much money while Hopkins s expenses have been very little I do not mind that said Kenneth quietly It was my desire that the voters should fully understand the issues of the campaign Then if they vote against me it is because they are not worthy of honest representation in the Legislature and I shall in the future leave them to their own devices The committee adjourned a little before two o clock with rather grave faces and prepared to attend the debate at the Opera House mister Cunningham feared this debate would prove a mistake as it would give Hopkins a chance to ridicule and brow beat his opponent in public and his greatest talent as a speaker lay in that direction As Kenneth and his supporters approached the Opera House they heard loud cheering and from a band wagon covered with bunting and banners in which he had driven to the meeting descended the Honorable Erastus He met Kenneth face to face and the latter said pleasantly Good afternoon mister Hopkins Ah it s Forbes isn t it replied Hopkins slightingly I ve met you before somewheres haven t I You have sir Glad you re here Forbes glad you re here continued the Representative airily as he made his way through the crowd that blocked the entrance These meetings are educational to young men Girls all well I hope There was a boisterous laugh at this sally and mister Hopkins smiled and entered the Opera House while Kenneth followed with the feeling that he would take great delight in punching the Honorable Erastus s nose at the first opportunity The house was packed full of eager spectators who had come to see the fun Although the girls had taken charge of all the arrangements they had devoted the left side of the ample stage to the use of the Hopkins party where a speaker s table and chairs for important guests had been placed The right side was similarly arranged for the Forbes party and between the two the entire center of the stage was occupied by a group of fifty young girls Above this group a great banner was suspended reading The Signs of the Times a catchword mister Hopkins had employed throughout the campaign But the most astonishing thing was the appearance of the group of girls They all wore plain white slips upon which a variety of signs had been painted in prominent letters Some costumes advertised baking powders others patent medicines others soaps chewing tobacco breakfast foods et cetera From where they were seated in full view of the vast audience the girls appeared as a mass of advertising signs and the banner above them indicated quite plainly that these were the Signs of the Times mister Hopkins as he observed this scene smiled with satisfaction He believed some of his friends had prepared this display to assist him and to disconcert the opposition for nothing could have clinched his arguments better than the pretty young girls covered with advertisements of well known products Even the Eagle Eye Breakfast Food was well represented After the orchestra had finished a selection mister Hopkins rose to make the first argument and was greeted with cheers We are having a jolly campaign my dear friends he began but you musn t take it altogether as a joke because while mister Forbes s erratic views and actions have done little real harm we have been educated to an appreciation of certain benefits we enjoy which otherwise might have escaped our attention This is a progressive strenuous age and no section of the country has progressed more rapidly than this the Eighth District of our great and glorious State I may say without danger of contradiction that the people I have the honor to represent in the State Legislature and expect to have the honor of representing the next term are the most intelligent the most thoughtful and the most prosperous to be found in any like district in the United States Cheers Who then dares to denounce them as fools Who dares interfere with these liberties who dares intrude uninvited into their premises and paint out the signs they have permitted to occupy their fences and barns and sheds Who would do these things but an impertinent meddler who is so inexperienced in life that he sets his own flimsy judgment against that of the people The orator paused impressively to wait for more cheers but the audience was silent In the outskirts of the crowd a faint hissing began to be heard It reached the speaker s ear and he hurriedly resumed the oration I do not say mister Forbes is not a good citizen said he but that he is misguided and unreasonable A certain degree of deference is due the young man because he inherited considerable wealth from his uncle and Again the hisses began and mister Hopkins knew he must abandon personal attacks or he would himself be discredited before his hearers Kenneth and his supporters sat silent in their places the three girls who were now well known in the district forming part of the Republican group and none of them displayed the least annoyance at the vituperation mister Hopkins had employed I have already called your attention in my circulars resumed the speaker to the fact that advertising signs are the source of large income to the farmers of this district I find that three thousand seven hundred and eighty three dollars have been paid the farmers in the last five years without the least trouble or expense on their part and this handsome sum of money belongs to them and should not be taken away Stop and think for a moment Advertising is the life of every business and to fight successfully the great army of advertisers whose business is the life blood of our institutions is as impossible as it is absurd Suppose every farmer in this district refused to permit signs upon his property what would be the result Why the farmers of other sections would get that much more money for letting privileges and you would be that much out of pocket without suppressing the evil if evil can attach to an industry that pays you good money without requiring either investment or labor in return After continuing in this strain for some time mister Hopkins announced that he would now give way to his youthful and inexperienced opponent and asked the audience to be patient with mister Forbes and considerate of his extraordinary prejudices Hopkins s policy of discrediting his opponent in advance was not very effective for when Kenneth arose he was more enthusiastically cheered than Hopkins had been The meeting was disposed to be fair minded and quite willing to give mister Forbes a chance to explain his position The arguments of our distinguished Representative are well worthy of your consideration he began quietly It is only by understanding fully both sides of an argument that you can hope to arrive at a just and impartial decision mister Hopkins has advocated advertising signs on the ground that your financial gain warrants permitting them to be placed upon your premises I will not deny his statement that three thousand seven hundred and eighty three dollars have been paid the farmers of this district by advertisers in the last five years It is quite likely to be true I have here the report of the Department of Agriculture showing that the total amount paid to farmers of the eighth district in the last five years for produce of all kinds is eleven millions five hundred thousand dollars A murmur of amazement rose from the audience Kenneth waited until it had subsided This seems surprising at first he said and proves how startling aggregate figures are You must remember I have covered five years in this estimate as did mister Hopkins in his and if you will figure it out you will see that the yearly average of earnings is about six hundred dollars to each farmer That is a good showing for we have a wealthy district but it is not surprising when reduced to that basis mister Hopkins slates that the farmers of this district received three thousand seven hundred and eighty three dollars during the last five years for advertising signs Let us examine these figures One fifth of that sum is seven hundred and fifty six dollars and sixty cents as the income to you per year We have in this district twenty five hundred farmers according to the latest reports of the Bureau of Statistics and dividing seven hundred and fifty six dollars and sixty cents by twenty five hundred we find that each farmer receives an average of thirty and one quarter cents per year for allowing his fences and buildings to be smothered in lurid advertising signs So we find that the money received by the farmers from the advertising amounts to about one quarter of one per cent of their income a matter so insignificant that it cannot affect them materially one way or another But mister Hopkins states that you give nothing in return for this one quarter of one per cent while I claim you pay tremendously for it For you sacrifice the privacy of your homes and lands and lend yourselves to the selfish desire of advertisers to use your property to promote their sales You have been given an example of clean barns and fences and I cannot tell you how proud I am of this district when I ride through it and see neatly painted barns and fences replacing the flaring and obtrusive advertising signs that formerly disfigured the highways Why should you paint advertising signs upon your barns any more than upon your houses Carry the thing a step farther and you may as well paint signs upon your children s dresses in the manner you see illustrated before you At this Louise made a signal and the fifty children so grotesquely covered with signs rose and stepped forward upon the stage The orchestra struck up an air and the little girls sang the following ditty Teas and soaps Pills and dopes We all must advertise Copper cents Not common sense Are the things we prize We confess Such a dress Isn t quite becoming But we suppose Hopkins knows This keeps business humming As the girls ceased singing Kenneth said To the encroaching advertiser these signs of the times are considered legitimate There is no respect for personal privacy on the advertiser s part Once they used only the newspapers the legitimate channels for advertising Then they began painting their advertising on your fences When the farmers protested against this the advertisers gave them a few pennies as a sop to quiet them After this they gave you small sums to paint the broad sides of your barns your board fences and to place signs in your field If you allowed them to do so they would paint signs on the dresses of your children and wives so callous are they to all decency and so regardless of private rights Look on this picture my friends and tell me would you prefer to see this or this At the word each child pulled away the sign painted slip and stood arrayed in a pretty gown of spotless white The surprise was so complete that the audience cheered shouted and laughed for several minutes before silence was restored Then the children sang another verse as follows Now it is clear That we appear Just as we should be We are seen Sweet and clean From corruption free We re the signs Of the times Fair as heaven s orbs If we look good Then all men should Vote for Kenneth Forbes The cheering was renewed at this and mister Hopkins became angry He tried to make himself heard but the popular fancy had been caught by the object lesson so cleverly placed before them and they shouted Forbes Forbes Forbes until the Honorable Erastus became so furious that he left the meeting in disgust This was the most impolite thing he could have done but he vowed that the meeting had been packed with Forbes partisans and that he was wasting his time in addressing them After he was gone Kenneth resumed his speech and created more enthusiasm The victory was certainly with the Republican candidate and the Elmhurst people returned home thoroughly satisfied with the result of the joint debate CHAPTER XVI A CLEW AT LAST The servants at Elmhurst all ate in a pleasant dining room with windows facing a garden of geraniums Tom Gates had been at the house two days before he encountered Eliza Parsons at the table for the servants were not all able to take their meals at the same time It was at luncheon the day of the joint debate at Fairview that the young man first met Eliza who sat opposite him The only other person present was old Donald the coachman who was rather deaf and never paid any attention to the chatter around him As he took his seat Tom gave a half frightened glance into Eliza s face and then turned red as she smiled coquettishly and said Dear me It s the young man who called me his dear Lucy You you re very like her stammered Tom unable to take his eyes from her face Even now I I can t believe I m mistaken She laughed merrily in a sweet musical voice and then suddenly stopped with her hand on her heart and cast at him a startled look that was in such sharp contrast to her former demeanor that he rose from his chair Sit down please she said slowly And then she studied his face with sober earnestness with almost wistful longing But she shook her head presently and sighed and a moment later had regained her lightness of manner It s a relief to have a quiet house for a day isn t it she asked eating her soup calmly I ll be glad when the election s over Have you been here long he asked although Beth had told him of Eliza s coming to Elmhurst Only a short time And you Two days said he But where did you live before you came here She shook her head I wish you would answer me he begged I have a reason for asking What reason she demanded suddenly serious again Two people have never lived that were so near alike as you and Lucy Rogers Indeed Will you show me your left arm No She was again studying his face If you are Lucy Rogers you have a scar there a scar where you burned yourself years ago She seemed frightened for a moment Then she said I have no scar on my left arm Will you prove it No You are annoying me What did you say your name is Tom Gates She was thoughtful for a moment and then shook her head I have never heard of you she declared positively and resumed her eating Tom was nonplussed One moment he believed she was Lucy and the next told himself that it was impossible This girl possessed mannerisms that Lucy had never exhibited in all the years he had known her She was bold and unabashed where Lucy was shy and unassuming This girl s eyes laughed while Lucy s were grave and serious yet they were the same eyes Let me tell you about my lost Lucy he said with a glance at the unconscious Donald Go ahead if it will relieve you she answered demurely She lived on a farm five miles from here and she was my sweetheart Her mother is blind and her father old and feeble She worked for a dentist in the town and was accused of stealing a ring and it nearly broke her heart to be so unjustly suspected In order to make good the loss of the ring a valuable diamond I I got into trouble and Lucy was so shocked and distressed that she she lost her head became mad you know and left home during the night without a word to any one We haven t been able to find her since That s too bad remarked Eliza Parsons buttering her bread About the time that Lucy went away you appeared at Elmhurst continued Tom And in face and form you re the image of my Lucy That is why I asked you to tell me where you came from and how you came here Ah you think I m mad do you asked the girl with a quizzical smile Well I m not going to satisfy your curiosity even to prove my sanity and I m not anxious to pose as your lost Lucy So please pass the sugar and try to be sociable instead of staring at me as if I scared you Tom passed the sugar but he could not eat nor could he tear himself away from this strange girl s presence He tried again to draw her into conversation but she showed annoyance and resented his persistence Presently she went away giving him an amused smile as she left the room a smile that made him feel that this was indeed a case of mistaken identity In fact Tom Gates on sober reflection knew that the girl could not be Lucy yet he could not still the yearning in his heart whenever he saw her His heart declared that she was Lucy and his head realized that she could not be While he waited in the library for mister Forbes to return from Fairview a man was shown into the room and sat down quietly in a corner He was a small lean man of unassuming appearance with a thin face and gray eyes set close together When he looked at Tom Gates he scarcely seemed to see him and his manner conveyed the impression that he disliked to attract notice Waiting for mister Forbes sir asked Tom Yes was the quiet reply Suddenly it struck the young man that this might be the detective who called every evening to give his report and if so Tom was anxious to talk with him So he ventured to say It s mister Burke isn t it The man nodded and looked out of the window I m Tom Gates sir Yes I know You ve seen me before asked the youth astonished No I ve heard of you That s all Tom flushed remembering his recent crime But he was eager to question the detective Have you heard anything of Lucy Rogers mister Burke Not yet Is there no trace of her at all A slight trace nothing worth mentioning said mister Burke For a few moments Tom sat in silence Then he said I thought I d found her day before yesterday Yes There was little interest in the tone There s a girl in the house sir one of the maids who is the living image of Lucy Rogers You ought to be able to identify her suggested the detective his gaze still out of the window But they are not alike except in looks Her form and face are identical with Lucy s I was so sure that I begged her to let me see if there was a scar on her left arm but she refused Was there a scar on Lucy Rogers s left arm Yes sir Several years ago when we were children we were making candy in the kitchen and Lucy burned herself badly It left a broad scar on her left forearm which she will bear as long as she lives It is well to know that said mister Burke This girl continued Tom musingly says her name is Eliza Parsons and she says it in Lucy s voice But her manner is not the same at all Eliza laughs at me and quizzes me she is forward and scornful and and perfectly self possessed which Lucy could not be under the circumstances Have you seen her closely asked the detective Yes sir And are still unable to decide who she is That s it sir I m unable to decide It s Lucy and yet it isn t Lucy Who is Eliza Parsons She refuses to say where she came from But it seems she arrived at Elmhurst only a day or two after Lucy disappeared from home It s that coincidence that makes me doubt the evidence of my own senses Who hires the servants here I don t know sir mister Burke abandoned the conversation then and confined his gaze to the landscape as it showed through the window Tom busied himself addressing circulars of instruction to the Republicans who were to work at the polling places This was Saturday and the election was to be on the following Tuesday The meeting at Fairview was therefore the last important rally of the campaign At dusk the party arrived from Fairview in the automobiles the girls greatly delighted with the success of the meeting They all followed Kenneth into the library where the butler had just lighted the lamps The evenings were getting cool now and a grate fire was burning Kenneth greeted mister Burke and introduced him to the young ladies who begged to remain during the interview We are all alike interested in Lucy Rogers mister Burke said the boy so you may speak freely Is there any news Nothing of importance sir unless a clew has been found in your own house replied the detective Here at Elmhurst asked the astonished Kenneth Yes Tom Gates has seen a girl one of your maids who so strongly resembles Lucy Rogers that he at first believed she was the missing girl I know said Beth quickly It s Eliza Parsons But Tom was mistaken He saw her in the dim light of a corridor and the resemblance confused him I ve seen her since remarked Tom and the likeness is really bewildering It s only her manner that is different When I first saw her before Tom came I was astonished at her resemblance to missus Rogers announced Beth I have never seen Lucy but I know missus Rogers and it seemed to me that Eliza was exactly like her in features mister Forbes and I first saw her riding in a buggy with mister Hopkins That was before either of us knew she was employed at Elmhurst You see she isn t one of the servants who come much in contact with the family she does the mending and takes charge of the linen room Beth then related the manner in which they first noticed Eliza and how they had discovered her to be a spy in the service of mister Hopkins The detective was much interested in the recital and seemed surprised that he had not been informed of this before Of course said Kenneth the girl is not Lucy Rogers It is not possible they could be the same Why not asked mister Burke Well Lucy was a gentle sweet country girl of little experience in life Her nature was so susceptible so very sensitive that when she discovered Tom Gates whom she loved to be guilty of a forgery she worried herself into an attack of brain fever or at least she became insane reproaching herself for having driven the boy to this dreadful deed Under the influence of her mania she wandered away from her home and has not been seen since That s the story of Lucy Rogers Now look at Eliza Parsons She appeared the very day after Lucy s disappearance to be sure but that proves they are not the same person For Eliza is not demented She is a cold hard woman of the world in spite of her tender years She is doing the work of an experienced spy while any deceit was foreign to Lucy s nature Instead of being plunged in grief Eliza is happy and gay reckless of consequences and fully self possessed She is also well and healthy to all appearances Taking all these things into consideration it is impossible to connect the two girls in any way save the coincidence of personal resemblance mister Burke listened to this quietly and then shook his head Your arguments all tend to make me suspect that she is Lucy Rogers he said quietly For a moment there was an impressive silence while everyone eagerly inquiringly or doubtfully looked at the detective according to their diverse acceptance of his statement In pursuance of the task set me began mister Burke I had met with such absolute failure to trace the missing girl that I began to suspect no ordinary conditions were attached to this case In my experience which covers many years I have had occasion to study sudden dementia caused by shocks of grief or horror and I have come to comprehend the fact that the human mind once unbalanced is liable to accomplish many surprising feats Usually the victim is absolutely transformed and becomes the very opposite in many ways of the normal personality I imagine this is what happened to Lucy Rogers Do you imagine that Lucy would try to deceive me sir asked Tom reproachfully I am sure she doesn t know who you are answered the detective positively She doesn t even know herself I have known instances where every recollection of the past was wiped out of the patient s mind There was another thoughtful pause for the detective s assertions were so astonishing that they fairly overwhelmed his hearers Then Louise asked Is such a case of dementia hopeless mister Burke Not at all hopeless Often I admit it develops into permanent insanity but there are many examples of complete recovery Our first business must be to assure ourselves that we are right in this conjecture I may be entirely wrong for the unexpected is what I have been taught to look for in every case of mystery that has come under my observation But I believe I have the material at hand to prove the personality of this Eliza Parsons and after that I shall know what to do Who employs your servants mister Forbes Martha my housekeeper usually employs the maids Will you send for her please Kenneth at once obeyed the request and presently Martha entered the library She was a little withered old woman but with a pleasant face and shrewd but kindly eyes Martha said Kenneth did you employ the new linen maid Eliza Parsons Yes sir she replied apparently surprised at the question This is mister Burke Martha Please answer any questions he may ask you Yes Master Kenneth Did the girl bring any recommendations asked the detective Martha reflected I do not think she did sir Are you accustomed to hiring maids without recommendations asked mister Burke Oh Eliza had a letter from my cousin missus Hopkins who lives in Elmwood Is missus Hopkins your cousin asked Kenneth Yes sir She were a Phibbs before she married Erastus and my name is Phibbs What did the letter from missus Hopkins say It said she knew Eliza to be a clever and worthy girl and if I had a place for her I couldn t do better than take her on So I needed a linen maid and Eliza went right to work Isn t she satisfactory sir Has she been doing anything wrong No Please do not mention this interview to her at present Miss Phibbs said the detective That is all I believe Would you like to see Eliza asked Kenneth when the housekeeper had retired Not at present I want to interview missus Hopkins first Tonight asked Tom eagerly I will go at once with mister Forbes s permission Certainly sir said Kenneth Shall we see you tomorrow Just as soon as I have accomplished anything Would you like a horse or an automobile Your man may drive me to the town sir if it is convenient Kenneth gave the required order and then mister Burke asked How far are you prepared to go in this matter sir In what way In expending money Will any large expenditure be required I cannot say But we may require the services and advice of an expert physician a specialist in brain diseases Do you know of one asked Kenneth Yes but he must be brought from Buffalo It will be expensive sir That is why I ask if your interest in the girl warrants our going to the limit to save her Kenneth was thoughtful while the girls looked at him expectantly and Tom Gates with visible anxiety My original idea was merely to find the missing girl in order to relieve the anxiety of her blind mother said young Forbes To accomplish that I was willing to employ your services But as a matter of fact I have never seen the girl Lucy Rogers nor am I particularly interested in her I am declared Beth And I And I repeated Patsy and Louise I think said Uncle John who had been a quiet listener until now that Kenneth has assumed enough expense in this matter Oh Uncle The remonstrance was from all three of the girls Therefore continued mister Merrick I propose that I undertake any further expense that may be incurred so as to divide the burden That s better declared Patsy But I might have known Uncle John would do that You have my authority to wire the physician if necessary or to go to any expense you deem advisable continued mister Merrick turning to the detective We seem to have undertaken to unravel an interesting mystery and we ll see it through to the end Very good sir said mister Burke and left them with a brief nod of farewell Somehow said Beth I ve a lot of confidence in that little man Why he s a detective replied Uncle John with a smile and the chief business of detectives is to make mistakes CHAPTER XVII missus HOPKINS GOSSIPS The home of Representative Hopkins was not a very imposing edifice It was a modest frame building standing well back in a little yard at the outskirts of the village and missus Hopkins did the housework unaided to save the expense of a maid It never occurred to the politician who had risen from the position of a poor stable boy to one of affluence to save his wife from this drudgery To him poor Mary was merely one of his possessions and it would have astonished him to know that her sharp tongue and irritable temper were due to overwork and neglect The Honorable Erastus was not averse to champagne dinners and other costly excesses while at the state capital and his fellow legislators considered him a good fellow although rather lax in keeping his end up Moreover he employed a good tailor and was careful to keep up an appearance of sound financial standing But his home which he avoided as much as possible had little share in his personal prosperity Mary Hopkins s requests for new and decent gowns were more often refused than acceded to and he constantly cautioned her to keep down expenses or she would drive them both to the poor house The woman well knew that Erastus could afford to keep her in luxury if he would but some women are so constituted that they accept their fate rather than rebel and Mary Hopkins lived the life of a slave contenting herself with petty scoldings and bickerings that did nothing to relieve her hard lot She had little interest in politics and resented the intrusion of the many who came to the house to see and consult with her husband during the tiresome political campaigns On these occasions mister Hopkins used the sitting room as his office and committee headquarters but this did not materially interfere with his wife s comfort as she was usually busy in the kitchen On this Saturday evening however they had an early supper and she finished her dishes betimes and sat down to darn stockings in the sitting room Erastus had hurried away to a meeting of his henchmen in the town and would not be home until after his wife was in bed So she was rather surprised when a timid knock sounded upon the door She opened it to find a little lean man standing upon the porch missus Hopkins he asked quietly Yes What do you want Your husband asked me to come here and wait for him It s important or I wouldn t disturb you Well then come in she replied tartly Thank the Lord this thing is nearly over and we ll have a few weeks of peace It is rather imposing on you remarked the man following her to the sitting room where he sat down with his hat in his hands A political campaign is trying to everybody I m tired out and sick of the whole thing myself Then why don t you chuck it she retorted scornfully and go to work makin an honest living Oh this is honest enough he said mildly I don t believe it All them secret confabs an trickery to win votes can t be on the square Don t talk to me Politics is another name for rascality Perhaps you re right ma am perhaps you re right he said with a sigh She looked at him sharply You don t belong in Elmwood No ma am I m from beyond Fairview I ve come to see your husband on business She sniffed at that but picked up her darning and relapsed into silence The little man was patient He sat quietly in his chair and watched her work His mildness disarmed Mary Hopkins She was not especially averse to having him sit there It relieved the loneliness of her occupation On occasions she loved to talk as Erastus had long ago discovered and this visitor would not try to shut her up the way Erastus did You don t often get out ma am into society and such like ventured the caller presently What makes you think that she demanded A woman can t keep a house neat and trim like this and be a social gadder he observed You re right about that she returned somewhat mollified If I was like them girls up at Elmhurst fussin round over politics all the time this house would go to rack an ruin Oh them he said with mild scorn Them girls ll never be housekeepers Not for a minute she affirmed There was another pause then but the ice was broken A subtle sympathy seemed established between the two What do you think of Rast s chances she asked presently as she threaded new cotton into her needle I guess he ll win He s worked hard enough anyhow Has he Yes Rast s a good worker He don t leave any stone unturned He s up to all the tricks o the trade is Rast Hopkins Here he began shaking with silent laughter and missus Hopkins looked at him curiously What are you laughing at she inquired with a sniff of disdain At at the way he come it over the gals up at Elmhurst Rast s a pretty slick one he is What do you mean Why settin that Liza to watch em and tell all they does Who d a thought of it but Rast Hopkins I don t see anything mighty funny about that declared missus Hopkins contemptuously The girl s too pert and forward for anything I told Rast not to fool with her or she d make him trouble Did you now exclaimed the man wonderingly Yes indeed said missus Hopkins pleased to have made an impression I suspected there was something wrong about her the morning she came to the house here And she changed her name too as brassy as you please Well I declare said the visitor Did you know her before that missus Hopkins Why I didn t exactly know her but I seen her workin around Miss Squiers s place many a time and she didn t seem to mount to much even then One day she stole a di mond ring off n old Miss Squiers and dug out and I told Nancy then Nancy s young Miss Squiers that I d always had my suspicions of the hussy She hid the ring in a vase on the mantle and they found it after she was gone Well well I didn t know that about her said the man looking with admiration at missus Hopkins That s why I told Rast not to have any truck with her when she came here bright and early one morning and asked for work Oh she came here did she While I was gettin breakfast She said her name was Eliza Parsons an she was looking fer a job I told her I knew her record an to get out and while we was arguin Rast come out and took a hand in the talk She laughed and flirted with him outrageous and said she was a stranger in these parts when I d seen her many a time at Miss Squiers s What was her name then asked the man I think it was Rosie or Lucy or something Anyhow it wasn t Eliza and that I ll swear to But the girl laughed at me and made such silly smiles at Rast that he told me to shut up cause he had a use for her in politics Well well repeated the visitor Just see how stories get twisted I heard you gave the girl a letter to your cousin Martha Well I did Rast wanted to get her in at Elmhurst to watch what Forbes was doing to defeat him so he made me write the letter But how d you know so much about this girl she inquired with sudden suspicion Me I only know what mister Hopkins told me I m one of his confidential men But he never said how he happened to find the girl or what he knew about her He didn t know nothing He d never seen her till that morning when she came here But he said she was clever and she is if pertness and a ready tongue counts for cleverness I suppose he pays her for what she tells him about Forbes but he d better save his money and fight on the square I don t like this tricky politics an never did I don t either declared the man But I m in it and can t get out That s what Rast says But some day they ll put him out neck and crop if he ain t careful Is the girl Eliza much use to him I can t say He drove her over to Elmhurst that morning and he drives over two or three evenings a week to meet her on the sly and get her report That may be politics but it ain t very respectable to my notion Well the campaign is nearly over missus Hopkins Thank goodness for that she replied The visitor sat silent after this for he had learned all that the poor gossiping woman could tell him Finally he said I guess your husband s going to be late Yes if he ain t more prompt than usual you ll have a long spell of waiting Perhaps I d better go over to the hotel and look him up I have to get back to Fairview tonight you know Do as you please she answered carelessly So mister Burke for it was the detective bade her good night and took his leave and it was not until after he had gone that Mary Hopkins remembered she had forgotten to ask him his name But it don t matter she decided He s just one o Rast s politicians and I probably treated the fellow better than he deserved CHAPTER XVIII ELIZA PARSONS On Sunday morning mister Burke again appeared at Elmhurst and told Kenneth he wanted an interview with Eliza Parsons I don t want you to send for her or anything like that for it would make her suspicious he said I d like to meet her in some way that would seem accidental and not startle her That is rather a hard thing to arrange mister Burke said the boy with a smile Why I think not declared Louise It seems to me quite easy That s the woman of it sir laughed Kenneth if it s a question of wits her sex has the advantage of us What do you propose miss asked the detective turning to Louise I ll have Martha send the girl into the garden to gather flowers she replied and you can wander around there and engage her in conversation Excellent he exclaimed Can this be arranged now I ll see sir She found Martha and asked her to send Eliza Parsons for some roses and chrysanthemums which were in a retired place shut in by evergreen hedges One of the other maids will know the garden better suggested the housekeeper But I wish Eliza to go Very well Miss Louise From an upper window the girl watched until she saw Eliza Parsons leave the house with a basket and go into the retired garden she had chosen Then she returned to the library for mister Burke and led him toward the same place Eliza is just beyond that gap in the hedge she said and turned away Wait a moment please he said detaining her On second thought I would like you to come with me for your tact may be of great assistance Have you spoken much with Eliza Not at all I think Beth has talked with her but I have scarcely been near her since she came here You are willing to come I shall be glad to The poet Saxe said mister Burke walking through the gap beside Louise has never been properly appreciated by his countrymen although since his death his verses are in greater demand than while he lived Do you care for them I don t know Saxe very well she answered observing that they were approaching a place where Eliza was bending over a rose bush But one or two of his poems are so amusing that they linger in my memory Eliza turned at the sound of their voices and gave them a quick glance But the next moment she resumed her occupation of cutting roses The man s greatest fault was his habit of punning remarked the detective watching the girl s form as he drew nearer It is that which blinded his contemporaries to his real talents What exquisite roses Miss Merrick May I ask for one for my button hole Yes indeed she replied pausing with him just beside Eliza Will you cut that bud yonder for mister Burke my dear The maid silently obeyed and as the detective took the flower from her hand he said Why isn t this Eliza Parsons Yes sir she replied carelessly Don t you remember me Eliza She seemed a little surprised but answered promptly No sir I m William Burke your mother s cousin How did you leave your brother Harry and have you heard from Josephine lately The girl gave him a startled look and shrank back Why how nice cried Louise I did not know you knew Eliza s family mister Burke Yes she is one of my relatives and came from Roanoke Virginia Isn t that correct Eliza Yes sir no I I don t remember she said in a low tone Don t remember Eliza That is strange The girl stared at him half frightened and drew her hand over her eyes with a gesture of bewilderment I hope my dear you are not going to be like your mother said mister Burke gently My poor cousin Nora was subject to a strange lapse of memory at times he remarked to Louise She always recovered in time but for days she could remember nothing of her former life not even her own name Are you ever affected that way Eliza She looked up at him pleadingly and murmured in a low voice Let me go Please let me go In a moment Eliza Her hands were clasped together nervously and she had dropped her basket and scissors on the path before her The man looked intently into her eyes in a shrewd yet kindly way and she seemed as if fascinated by his gaze Tell me my dear have you forgotten your old life he asked Yes she whispered Poor girl And you are trying to keep this a secret and not let anyone know of your trouble Suddenly she started and sprang away uttering a cry of terror You re trying to trap me she panted You know my name is not Eliza Parsons You you want to ruin me From the position in which they stood in the corner of the garden with high hedges behind the maid and mister Burke and Louise blocking the path in front there was little chance of escape But she looked around wildly as if about to make the attempt when Louise stepped forward and gently took Eliza s hand in her own mister Burke is a good man my dear and means well by you she said in her sweet sympathetic tones He shall not bother you if you are afraid of him I I m not afraid said Eliza with a resumption of her old manner and a toss of her head The detective gave Louise a look which she thought she understood Will you finish cutting these roses mister Burke she asked with a smile Eliza and I are going to my room Come my dear and without waiting for a reply she led the girl whose hand was still clasped in her own along the path Eliza came willingly Her manner was a little defiant at first but when Louise drew her unobserved to the side entrance and up the staircase she grew gentle and permitted the other girl to take her arm Once in her room with the strange maid Louise locked the door quietly and said to her companion with a cheerful smile Now we are quite alone and can talk at our ease Take that low chair dear and I ll sit here Eliza obeyed looking wistfully into the fair face of her new friend You are very pretty Eliza and I m sure you are as good as you re pretty announced Louise So you must tell me about yourself and whether you are happy here or not From this time on I m going to be your friend you know and keep all your secrets and I ll help you all I can This rambling speech seemed to impress Eliza favorably She relaxed somewhat from the tense alertness that was habitual with her and looked at the other girl with a softened expression I m afraid you won t be much interested in me she replied but I need a friend indeed I need a friend Miss Louise I m sure you do At first I thought I could do without one I felt I must stand alone and let no one suspect But I m getting puzzled and bewildered and I don t know what to do next Of course not Tell me about it dear I can t for I don t know myself She leaned forward in her chair and added in a whisper I don t even know who I am But that man with a shudder tried to trap me He said he knew Eliza Parsons and there is no Eliza Parsons It s a name I I invented I think I understand said Louise with a little nod You had to have a name so you took that one Yes I don t know why I am telling you this I ve tried to hide it all so carefully And perhaps I m wrong in letting this thing worry me In the main I ve been very happy and content lately and I have a feeling I was not happy before before Before what dear The girl looked at her steadily and her face grew red Before I lost my memory For a few moments they sat silently regarding one another the expressive features of Louise showing a silent sympathy Have you really lost your memory she asked Absolutely Think of it I wakened one morning lying by the roadside and shivering with cold I had on a simple gray dress with no hat The sun was just rising and no one was near I examined myself with wonder for I had no idea who I was or how I came there There was no money in my pocket and I had no jewels To keep warm I began walking along the road The scenery was all new to me so far as I knew I had never been in the place before The birds were singing and the cows mooed in the meadow I tried to sing too for my heart was light and gay and I was happy By and bye I came to a town but no one seemed to be awakened because it was yet so early As I walked down the street I saw smoke coming from one of the chimneys and it suddenly occurred to me that I was hungry I entered the yard and went around to the back door A woman was working in the kitchen and I laughed joyfully and wished her a good morning She was not very pleasant but it did me good to talk with her I liked to hear my own voice and it pleased me to be able to talk easily and well She grudgingly gave me something to eat and then bade me begone calling me by some strange name and saying I was a thief It was then that I invented the name of Eliza Parsons I don t know why but it popped into my head and I claimed it for my name and have clung to it ever since Have you no idea what your real name is asked Louise greatly interested in this terse relation I have no idea of anything that dates beyond that morning replied Eliza The first time I looked in the mirror I saw a strange face reflected there I had to make my own acquaintance she added with one of her bright laughs I suppose I am between seventeen and twenty years of age but what my life was during past years is to me a sealed book I cannot remember a person I knew or associated with yet things outside of my personal life seem to have clung to me I remembered books I must have read I can write sing and sew I sew remarkably well and must have once been trained to it I know all about my country s history yet I cannot recollect where I lived and this part of the country is unknown to me When I came to Elmhurst I knew all about it and about mister Forbes but could not connect them with my former life How did you happen to come here asked Louise I forgot to tell you that While I was arguing with the woman who was a missus Hopkins her husband heard us and came out into the kitchen He began to question me about myself and I gave any answer that came into my head for I could not tell him the truth It pleased me to hear my voice I seemed to have a keen sense of the humorous and if I said anything at all clever I laughed as heartily as anyone My heart was light and free from all care I had no worries or responsibilities at all I was like the birds who see the sunshine and feel the breeze and are content to sing and be happy mister Hopkins saw I was wholly irresponsible and reckless and he decided to use me to spy upon the people here at Elmhurst and report to him what they said and did I agreed to this readily prompted by a spirit of mischief for I cared nothing for Hopkins and had nothing against mister Forbes Also Hopkins paid me money which I had sufficient knowledge to realize was necessary to me Oh how happy and gay I was in those first few days There was not a thought of the past not an ambition or desire of any sort to bother me Just to live seemed pleasure enough I enjoyed eating and sleeping I loved to talk and laugh I was glad to have work to occupy me and that was all Then things began to happen that puzzled me The man Hopkins declared he could not trust me because I had once been a thief and I wondered if he could speak truly I resented the thought that I may once have been a thief although I wouldn t mind stealing even now if I wanted anything and could take it Oh Eliza gasped Louise It sounds wicked doesn t it But it is true Nothing seems to influence me so strongly as my own whims I know what is good and what is bad I must have been taught these things once But I am as likely to do evil as good and this recklessness has begun in the last few days to worry me Then I met a young man here he says his name is Tom Gates who called me his dear Lucy and said I used to love him I laughed at him at first for it seemed very absurd and I do not want him to love me But then he proved to me there was some truth in his statement He said his Lucy had a scar on her left arm and that made me afraid because I had discovered a scar on my own arm I don t know how it got there I don t know anything about this old Lucy And I m afraid to find out I m afraid of Lucy Why dear I cannot tell I only know I have a horror of her a sudden shrinking whenever her name is mentioned Who was she do you suppose Shall I tell you asked Louise No no Don t I beg of you cried Eliza starting up I I can t bear it I don t want to know her The protest was passionate and sincere and Louise marvelled at the workings of this evidently unbalanced intellect What would you like to do dear she inquired I d like to remain Eliza Parsons always I d like to get away from her far away from anyone who ever heard of that dreadful Lucy who frightens me so Will you help me to get away to escape to some place where no one will ever be able to trace me Do you think you would be happy then I am sure of it The only thing that makes me unhappy now is the horror that this past life will be thrust upon me I must have had a past of course or I shouldn t be a grown woman now But I m afraid of it I don t want to know anything about it Will you help me to escape She looked eagerly at Louise as she asked this pitiful question and the other girl replied softly I will be your friend Eliza I ll think all this over and we will see what can be done Be patient a little while and as soon as I find a way to free you from all this trouble I ll send for you and we ll talk it over together Will you keep my secret demanded Eliza uneasily Louise glanced at the door that communicated with Beth s room It stood open but Eliza had not noticed that as it was behind her Just now a shadow cast from the other room wavered an instant over the rug and Louise s quick eyes caught it I promise to keep your secret dear she said earnestly The two girls rose and stood facing each other Louise kissed the beautiful Eliza and whispered Here is one thing for you to remember that we are always to be true friends from this time forward If anyone annoys you come to me and I will protect you Thank you Miss Louise said Eliza and then she went away to her own room in a quieter and more thoughtful mood than usual When she had gone Louise ran to the door communicating with Beth s room and to her satisfaction found both her cousins with Kenneth Uncle John and mister Burke seated in a group where they must have overheard all that had been said Well she cried eagerly did you hear And what do you think of it all It s Lucy Rogers sure enough said Kenneth Louise looked at mister Burke It is the most singular case that has ever come under my observation stated that gentleman The girl is perfectly sane but she has suffered a strange lapse of memory I have two alternatives to advise One is to telegraph at once for a specialist The other is to permit the girl to go away as she suggests She will be happier to do so I am sure Oh no cried the girls She owes a duty to her parents and friends as well as to herself said Kenneth and I see no reason why she should be unhappy in the future as Lucy Rogers mister Burke merely shrugged his shoulders Please wire for the specialist at once said Uncle John CHAPTER XIX PATSY INDULGES IN EAVESDROPPING Miss Patricia Doyle awakened at daybreak next morning with a throbbing toothache She wasn t accustomed to such pains and found it hard to bear She tried the application of a hot water bag and the tooth ached harder she tried a cold compress and it jumped with renewed activity So she dressed herself and walked the floor with the persistent ache as an intimate companion She tried to find a cavity in the tooth but it seemed perfectly sound Evidently she had caught cold and the wicked molar was signaling the fact To be patient under the torture of a toothache was a virtue Patsy did not possess Louise and Beth to whom she appealed were sorry for her but could not relieve the pain After breakfast Uncle John ordered her to drive to town and see a dentist Have it pulled or filled or something he said The dentist will know what to do So James drove Patsy to town where they arrived about nine o clock this Monday morning The only dentist at Elmwood was doctor Squiers so the girl ran up the flight of stairs to his office which was located over the hardware store The pain had eased on the journey and now the thought of having the offending tooth pulled was weighing heavily upon Patsy s mind The door of doctor Squiers s office stood ajar and she hesitated whether to enter or not The dentist s reception room was divided from his operating room by a thin wooden partition and as Patsy was deciding whether to employ doctor Squiers s services or not she heard high words coming from behind the partition and the voice was that of the Honorable Erastus Hopkins Softly she slid into the outer room and sank into a chair But you re the clerk of the election Squiers you can t deny that Hopkins was saying in a blustering imperious voice That s true enough answered the dentist more calmly Then you ve got the registration books in your possession I admit that was the reply But you re asking me to incriminate myself Rast If the thing was discovered it would mean prison for both of us Fiddlesticks cried the irascible Hopkins These things are done every day and no one s the wiser for it It s merely a part of the political game I m afraid Rast said doctor Squiers Honest Injun I m afraid What are you fraid of I ve got the other clerks all fixed and they ll stand by us All you need do is to add these sixty six names to the registration list and then we ll vote em without opposition and win out Patsy gave a gasp which she tried to stifle The toothache was all forgotten Where are these men inquired doctor Squiers thoughtfully They re over at the mill Marshall got em from all over the country and they ll be set to work today so everything will seem reg lar Where do they sleep and eat inquired the doctor Forty sleep in Hayes s barn and the other twenty six in the stock loft over the planing mill Marshall s got a commissary department and feeds em regular rations like so many soldiers Of course I m paying for all this expense acknowledged mister Hopkins somewhat regretfully And do you suppose these sixty six votes will turn the scale asked doctor Squiers They re sure to We finished the last canvass yesterday and according to our figures Forbes has about eighteen votes the best of us That s getting it down pretty close but we may as well make up our minds we re beaten if we don t vote the men over at the mill Marshall could have got me a hundred if necessary but sixty six is more than enough Say Forbes has twice eighteen for his plurality instead of eighteen these sixty six for me would wipe that out and let us win in a walk When Hopkins ceased there was a brief silence Perhaps doctor Squiers was thinking I simply must have those votes Doc resumed the Representative It s the only way I can win You ve made a bungle of the whole campaign said Squiers bitterly That s a lie I ve done a lot of clever work But these infernal city girls came down here and stirred up all the trouble You made a mistake pushing that sign issue The girls beat you on that If it hadn t been signs it might have been something worse But I ain t beaten yet Doc Squiers This deal is going to win It s a trick the boarding school misses won t understand until after they ve cut their eye teeth in politics There s a pretty heavy penalty against false registration observed the dentist gloomily There s no penalty unless we re found out and there ain t the ghost of a chance of that The books are in your hands I got all the clerks fixed Not a question will even be raised I know it Do you suppose I d risk state s prison myself if I wasn t sure Look here Rast said Squiers doggedly you re making a tool of me in this campaign Why should I be used and abused just to elect Erastus Hopkins I d like to know You sacrificed me when I might have been Sheriff You re well paid for that Doc And now you want me to put my neck in a noose for your advantage I won t do it Rast and that s a fact mister Hopkins coughed How much Doc he inquired The dentist was silent State the figure But for mercy s sake don t bleed me any more than you can help This fight has cost me a pretty penny already I don t want your money growled Squiers Yes you do Doc I know you better than you know yourself The trouble with you is you ll want too much Squiers laughed bitterly Is Marshall to be trusted he asked Of course If he said a word he d lose his job as manager Marshall s all right There s nothing to worry about Doc Patsy s tooth wasn t aching a bit But her heart was throbbing as madly as the tooth ever did and fortunately there was no pain connected with the throbbing only joy It ought to be worth two thousand dollars Rast said the dentist What In addition to all other expenses Why man it means the election It means your whole future If you re defeated now you re a back number in this district and you know it It s too much Doc On my word it is It s too little come to think of it I ll make it three thousand Doc If you don t close with me Rast by the jumping Jupiter I ll make it four thousand cried the dentist with exasperation Say twenty five hundred Doc Right on the nail Give me your check here this minute And you ll enter the names in the books Before you leave the office Have you got the list Yes in my pocket said mister Hopkins Then make out your check and I ll get the books There was a stir behind the partition and a sound of chairs scraping the floor Patsy slid out the door and flew down the stairs at the imminent danger of breaking her neck James was seated in the buggy outside engaged in rumination Patsy bounded in beside him and startled him Drive for your life she cried Drive for home He whipped up the spirited horse and they dashed away Presently the man asked with a grin Did it hurt much Miss Patsy Did what hurt James The tooth pullin Miss Patsy The tooth wasn t pulled answered the girl sweetly It didn t need it James The only thing that was pulled was the Honorable Erastus s leg CHAPTER XX PRICKING A BUBBLE When Patsy arrived home she called a council of war and related the conversation she had overheard in the dentist s office It isn t a very nice thing to do listening to a private conversation said the girl but when I discovered they were going to play such a trick on Kenneth I couldn t help eavesdropping I think you were justified declared mister Watson with a grave face for this matter is very serious indeed Tomorrow is election day and if a toothache hadn t carried you to the dentist s office Kenneth would surely have been defeated And we d never have known how it happened declared Uncle John But can the plot be foiled at this late date inquired Louise anxiously I think so said mister Watson doctor Squiers was correct in saying that such a crime was a state s prison offense Our discovery of it will send both Erastus Hopkins and doctor Squiers to prison Probably mister Marshall the manager of the mill will go with them Oh I don t like that exclaimed Patsy Nor do I added Kenneth It would be a sad beginning to my political career to send three such men to prison I d like to avoid it if I can Perhaps it may be quietly arranged said the lawyer If they knew you had discovered the false registration of these men they would never dare vote them How would it be to send mister Burke the detective over to the mill to talk with mister Marshall suggested Beth That is an excellent plan and would be very effective in determining the manager to abandon the plot I ll go and see Hopkins myself announced Uncle John I know how to manage men of his sort Very good approved the lawyer and I ll see Squiers If you do said Patsy just ask him to sign a paper saying that Lucy Rogers was falsely accused of stealing the ring and that his mother found it in a vase where she had forgotten she put it I ll do that replied mister Watson And I ll get the sixty dollars back that Tom Gates paid him I ll make it a condition of our agreeing not to prosecute the man It looks as if we were going to win the election said Uncle John in a pleased voice If Hopkins was driven to such methods as stuffing ballot boxes he must know very well he s defeated He acknowledged it to doctor Squiers said Patsy gaily We have eighteen sure majority and perhaps more It s likely to be more predicted Uncle John I suppose congratulations are in order Ken said Louise Not yet cousin he replied Wait until tomorrow night and then don t congratulate me but the campaign managers three of the nicest and cleverest girls in existence You re right my boy declared Uncle John If you pull through and take your seat in the Legislature you ll owe it all to these girls That is true smiled the lawyer Kenneth was badly beaten when you arrived Of course our girls were very happy at receiving this praise but more pleased to realize they had actually been of service to their boy friend They believed that Kenneth would prove a good Representative and carry out his promises to the voters and if he did that his political career was assured mister Burke appeared in the afternoon with a telegram from doctor Hoyt the specialist saying that he would be at Elmwood on the noon train Wednesday His engagements prevented him from coming any sooner and in the meantime mister Burke advised keeping a close watch on Eliza Parsons to see that she did not run away I ll attend to that said Louise quickly Eliza and I are friends and I ll take care of her Aren t you going to the polls asked Patsy No dear why should I go Our work is done now isn t it Well I m going to the polls and work for every vote declared Patsy I shan t be happy unless Kenneth gets more than eighteen majority When the Hopkins plot was explained to mister Burke the detective readily agreed to go to Fairview and see mister Marshall As no time was to be lost he was sent over in an automobile and arrived at the mill just before the hour for closing The next day being election day the mill was to be closed and the manager was very busy in his office when mister Burke requested to see him You will have to come around Wednesday said Marshall fussily I can t attend to you now I m sorry to disturb you sir replied the detective but my business won t wait until Wednesday What is it about sir About the election Then I won t be bothered The election doesn t interest me said mister Marshall turning away Very well I ll call Wednesday sir at the jail Marshall gave him a quick look Who are you sir he asked John Burke a detective The manager hesitated a moment Come in mister Burke he said I represent the Forbes interests said the detective seating himself in the private office and it has come to our notice that doctor Squiers has permitted sixty six fraudulent registrations to be entered on the books These sixty six men are supposed to have been imported by you and are now working at this mill This is all nonsense protested the manager growing pale Forty men are sleeping in a near by barn and twenty six in the stock room of the mill added mister Burke That isn t criminal sir No indeed The criminal act is their false registration so far said the detective blandly But mark you sir if an attempt is made to vote those men tomorrow I shall arrest you as well as mister Hopkins and doctor Squiers This is preposterous sir blustered the manager There will be no attempt made to vote them I am quite sure of it was the reply You may thank mister Forbes for warning you in time He wished to save you and so sent me here Oh he did mister Marshall was evidently surprised May I ask how you discovered all this he added I am not at liberty to give you the details But I may say the exposure of the plot occurred through mister Hopkins s own carelessness I ve seen lots of crooked politicians mister Marshall but this man is too reckless and foolish ever to be a success He deserves to be defeated and he will be The manager was thoughtful This is all news to me he declared I needed these extra men to help me fill a contract on time and so employed them I had no idea Hopkins and Squiers would try to vote them tomorrow This was a palpable falsehood but mister Burke accepted the lame excuse without question You are a valuable man in this community mister Marshall and mister Forbes seemed to think the Hopkins people were trying to get you into trouble Of course it would have caused trouble had these men voted Of course mister Burke I m much obliged to mister Forbes for warning me You ll find the next Representative a very agreeable man to get along with mister Marshall Good day sir Good day mister Burke When the detective had gone mister Marshall sat in a brown study for a few moments Then he summoned his superintendent and said Please ask the men to assemble in the yard before they go home I want to have a word with them The request came just in time for the men were already beginning to stream out of the mill They waited good naturedly however grouping themselves in the big yard Then Marshall mounted a lumber pile and addressed them briefly Boys he said I told you all a week or so ago I d like you to vote for Hopkins for Representative as I believed his election would result in more work for the mill and better wages for the employees But I ve been watching matters pretty closely and I ve changed my mind Forbes is a coming man and he ll do more for us all than Hopkins could So every man who is entitled to vote will please me best by voting for Kenneth Forbes There was a cheer at this and when it subsided the manager continued Of course none of the new men who were not properly registered have a right to vote at this election and I command them to keep away from the polls Anyone who attempts to vote illegally will be promptly arrested This caused more cheering for the workmen had suspected that the new hands would be voted illegally and they were relieved to find that it was a square deal all round as one of them remarked with satisfaction Meantime Uncle John was having a barrel of fun with mister Hopkins The little millionaire although a man of simple and unobtrusive ways was a shrewd judge of human nature Moreover he had acquired a fund of experience in dealing with all sorts of people and was delighted to meet mister Hopkins under the present circumstances So he drove over to Elmwood and was fortunate to find mister Hopkins in his office at home where he was busily engaged instructing his workers in their duties at the polls At sight of mister Merrick whom he knew by this time to be a friend of Kenneth Forbes staying at Elmhurst the politician scented some pending difficulty or at least an argument and was sufficiently interested to dismiss his men without delay Ah this is mister Merrick I believe began mister Hopkins suavely What can I do for you sir Considerable if you re disposed answered the other For one thing I d like to hire Eliza Parsons away from you Eliza Parsons gasped the Representative Yes your spy Election s about over and you won t need her any longer will you Sir do you mean to insult me asked the Honorable Erastus indignantly By no means I thought you were through with the girl said Uncle John with a chuckle mister Hopkins was distinctly relieved With a full recollection of his wicked schemes in his mind he had feared some more important attack than this so he assumed a virtuous look and replied Sir you wrong me Eliza Parsons was no spy of mine I was merely trying to encourage her to a higher spiritual life She is rather flighty and irresponsible sir and I was sorry for the poor girl That is all If she has been telling tales they are untrue I have found her I regret to say inclined at times to be ah inventive Perhaps that s so remarked Uncle John carelessly You re said to be a good man mister Hopkins a leetle too honest and straightforward for a politician but that s an excusable fault I hope I deserve my reputation mister Merrick said Erastus straightening up at this praise I do indeed try to live an upright life I guess so mister Hopkins I guess so You wouldn t try for instance to encourage false registration Sir Anything wrong mister Hopkins asked Uncle John innocently Erastus looked at his visitor tremblingly although he tried to control his nerves Of course mister Merrick couldn t mean anything by this chance shot so he must be thrown off the scent You have a disagreeable way of making remarks sir and I have no time to listen to foolish speeches Tomorrow is election day and I ve a good many details yet to arrange No chance of you re getting in jail is there What do you mean by that I only thought that if you d done anything liable to make trouble you d have to arrange your affairs for a long spell in jail Politicians sometimes make mistakes But you re such an honest man mister Hopkins you couldn t possibly go crooked mister Hopkins felt shaky again and looked at his tormentor earnestly trying to discern whether there was any real knowledge beneath this innuendo But Uncle John met his gaze with a cheerful smile and continued I guess you ve got a hard fight ahead of you My young friend Forbes is trying to get elected himself and you can t both win Oh yes Forbes said Erastus trying to regain his accustomed ease A worthy young man sir but I m afraid his chances are slim Are they now asked Uncle John pretending a mild interest Pretty thin mister Merrick Our majority is too great to overcome What do you think your majority will be About sixty six mister Hopkins gave a start and turned red About sixty six he repeated vacantly trying to decide if this was another chance shot Yes about sixty six mill hands The cat was out of the bag now Hopkins realized that Merrick had some knowledge or at least suspicion of this plot He tried to think what to do and it occurred to him that if his visitor positively knew anything he would not act in this absurd manner but come straight to the point So he ignored the speech merely saying Anything else sir No replied Uncle John I ll go home I guess Folks ll be expecting me Sorry Forbes hasn t got that sixty six mill hands but Doc Squiers probably registered em all right and they ll probably vote for Hopkins Wait a moment sir cried Erastus as Uncle John was turning away That speech demands an explanation and I mean to have it Oh you do Well I don t object You may not know it but Squiers has registered sixty six non voters and I want to know whether you re prepared to give half of them to Forbes or mean to keep them all for yourself If Squiers has made false registrations he must stand the consequences I want you to understand sir that I do not countenance any underhand dealing Then it s all off You won t vote the mill hands Not a man shall vote who is not properly registered I m glad to hear it mister Hopkins Perhaps you can get that twenty five hundred back I don t think Squiers has cashed the check yet The Honorable Erastus gave a roar like a wild bull but Uncle John had walked quietly out and climbed into his buggy He looked back and seeing mister Hopkins s scowling face at the window returned a pleasant smile as he drove away mister Watson had just finished his interview with the dentist when Uncle John picked him up at the corner The lawyer had accomplished more than the other two for he had secured a paper exonerating Lucy Rogers and another incriminating the Honorable Erastus Hopkins as well as the sixty dollars paid by Tom Gates The dentist was thoroughly frightened but determined now that the conspiracy was defeated that the man who had led him to the crime should not escape in case he was himself arrested So he made a plain statement of the whole matter and signed it and mister Watson assured Squiers immunity from arrest pending good behavior The man had already cashed Hopkins s check and he knew the Representative could not get the money away from him so after all the dentist lost nothing by the exposure It was a jolly party that assembled at the dinner table in Elmhurst that evening You see explained Uncle John the thing looked as big as a balloon to us at first but it was only a bubble after all and as soon as we pricked it it disappeared CHAPTER XXI THE RETURNS FROM FAIRVIEW Election day dawned sunny and bright but there was a chill in the air that betokened the approach of winter Uncle John had suggested serving coffee to the voters at the different polling places and Kenneth had therefore arranged for a booth at each place where excellent coffee was served free all day long These booths were decorated with Forbes banners and attracted a great deal of comment as the idea was a distinct innovation in this district You wouldn t catch Hopkins giving anything away remarked one farmer to another Rast is too close fisted Why as fer that was the reply the thing is done to catch votes You know that as well as I do S pose it is said the first speaker I d ruther my vote was caught by a cup of hot coffee on a cold day than by nothin at all If we ve got to bite anyhow why not take a hook that s baited Patsy and Beth made the rounds of the polling places in an automobile covered with flags and bunting and wherever they appeared they were greeted with cordial cheers mister Hopkins was noticeable by his absence and this was due not so much to his cowardice as to an unfortunate accident Neither Squiers nor Hopkins knew just how their secret had leaked out for Patsy s presence in the dentist s office had not been disclosed so each one suspected the other of culpable foolishness if not downright rascality After Uncle John s visit Erastus stormed over to Squiers s office and found his accomplice boiling with indignation at having been trapped in a criminal undertaking As the two men angrily faced each other they could not think of any gentle words to say and doctor Squiers became so excited by the other s reproaches that he indulged in careless gestures One of these gestures bumped against the Honorable Erastus s right eye with such force that the eye was badly injured The candidate for re election therefore wakened on election morning with the damaged optic swollen shut and sadly discolored Realizing that this unfortunate condition would not win votes mister Hopkins remained at home all day and nagged his long suffering spouse whose tongue was her only defence The Representative had promptly telephoned to Marshall at Fairview telling him not to vote the men as arranged He was not especially charmed with the manager s brief reply Don t be alarmed We re not all fools I guess Rast remarked Mary Hopkins looking at her damaged and irritable husband with a blending of curiosity and contempt that you re bout at the end of your rope You wait said Erastus grimly This thing ain t over yet The day passed very quietly and without any especial incident A full vote was polled and by sundown the fate of the candidates had been decided But the counting seemed to progress slowly and the group assembled around the telephone in Kenneth s library thought the returns would never arrive The Republican Committee had given mister Forbes a table showing what the vote of each precinct should be according to their canvass The first report was from Elmwood and showed a gain of seventeen over the estimate Patsy was delighted for she had worked hard in Elmwood and this proved that her efforts had been successful Then came a report from Longville in Jefferson County It showed a gain of forty three votes for Hopkins and a consequent loss for Forbes This was a startling surprise and the next advice from a country precinct in Washington County showed another gain of twelve for Hopkins The little group of workers looked at one another with inquiring eyes and Patsy could hardly refrain from crying The butler announced dinner but only Louise and mister Watson could eat anything The others were too intent on learning their fate and could not leave the telephone It seemed queer that the precincts furthest away should be first to respond but so it was Jefferson County returns began to come in rapidly and were received in dismal silence Hopkins gained four here seven there and twenty two in another precinct It looks said Kenneth quietly like a landslide for Hopkins and I wonder how our Committee was so badly informed You see said Uncle John voters won t usually tell the truth about how they ve decided to vote Lots of them tell both sides they re going to vote their way And people change their minds at the last minute too You can t do much more than average the thing by means of a canvass By nine o clock complete returns from the part of Jefferson County included in the Eighth District showed a net gain of one hundred and eight for Hopkins a lead that it seemed impossible to overcome Washington County was not so bad Incomplete returns indicated a slight gain for Hopkins but not more than a dozen votes altogether Everything now depends upon Dupree and Fairview announced Kenneth but I can t get any connection with them yet We won in Elmwood anyhow and Hopkins isn t ahead more than a hundred and sixty as the thing stands now Cheer up girls A defeat won t hurt us much for we ve all made a good fight Better get to bed and sleep for you re tired out We ll know all about everything in the morning But they would not move Disappointment unnerved them more than victory would have done They resolved to wait until the last returns were in Telephone sir said Tom Gates Kenneth picked up the receiver Here s Dupree he said Our majority over Hopkins is two hundred and eleven Let s see that s a gain of seventy four votes my dears Hooray cried Patsy delightedly I don t care a rap now what happens Old Hopkins won t have much to crow over if Wait a minute said Kenneth Here s Fairview at last They held their breaths and watched his face Kenneth flushed red as he held the receiver to his ear and then grew white He turned around to the expectant group and Beth knew from the sparkle in his eyes what had happened Fairview s six precincts give us six hundred and forty one majority announced the boy in an awed tone That s a gain of nearly four hundred They gazed at him in silent wonder Then Uncle John rose slowly and took the boy s hand That means we ve won and won in a walk said the little man Kenneth we congratulate you Patsy s face was buried in her handkerchief and Beth s great eyes were bright with unshed tears But Louise laughed her soft musical laugh and remarked Why I knew all the time we would win We had the better candidate you see And the best campaign managers added Uncle John with a proud smile That may be true admitted Beth But the thing that really won the fight was Patsy s sore tooth CHAPTER XXII THE AWAKENING James and mister Burke met the great specialist in brain diseases at the noon train on Wednesday and drove him to Elmhurst doctor Hoyt was a handsome gray haired man with kindly eyes and a distinguished manner When he was ushered into the library the young ladies were attracted by the physician at once and from the first glance were inspired by confidence in his powers Yet doctor Hoyt spoke rather doubtfully of the case in hand These cases are not so rare as you might suppose he said yet no two of them are exactly alike Usually the recovery is slow and tedious but recovery is not always assured In some instances however the memory is absolutely restored and from what mister Burke has explained to me of Lucy Rogers s history this is what we may expect now Or else we must trust to time or an accident to awaken her dormant mental faculties The case is so interesting that I should like with your permission to make an experiment which can result in no harm if it does not succeed We put the matter entirely in your hands sir said Uncle John Act as you think best I thank you replied doctor Hoyt bowing Then he turned to the girls Which of you young ladies has won the friendship of Lucy Rogers he asked Louise answered that she and Eliza Parsons had become good friends Will you assist me asked the physician Willingly sir I wish to send the girl into a deep sleep to render her unconscious without her suspecting my intention or realizing the fact Can you suggest a way to do this Louise tried to think What means will you employ sir she asked There are many ways to accomplish this I prefer to administer a powerful sleeping potion Have you any confectionery or bon bons at hand Yes indeed I have just received a fresh box of bon bons from New York But I m not sure I can induce Eliza to eat candy Then let us prepare the potion in various ways But you must be careful Miss Merrick not to make a mistake and take the dose yourself Louise laughed I ll be careful sir she promised The two then retired to perfect their plan and in an hour every arrangement was complete Louise went to her room donned a wrapper and bandaged her head Then she summoned Martha and asked the housekeeper to send Eliza Parsons to sit with her in the darkened room as she was suffering from a headache The maid came at once to all appearances as happy and careless as ever After expressing her sympathy she asked what she could do Just sit down and keep me company dear replied Louise I m not very bad but I m restless and can t sleep and I want you to talk to me and amuse me Eliza laughed That is easy as far as talking is concerned she said But to amuse you Miss Louise may be more difficult But the girls found a topic of conversation in the election in which Eliza was much interested and they chatted together for an hour or so before Louise made any move to consummate her plot I hope my foolish reports to mister Hopkins did no harm to mister Forbes Eliza was saying I really had little to tell him of your conversation or movements You did no harm at all for mister Forbes was elected replied Louise Then she said carelessly Martha has sent me this pitcher of lemonade and I don t care for it Won t you drink a glass Eliza No thank you she replied shaking her head I never drink lemonade Then have one of these sandwiches I m not hungry Miss Louise Louise sighed Both the lemonade and the sandwiches had been dosed by doctor Hoyt Then she picked up the box of bon bons that was beside her But you will eat some candy dear Every girl likes candy I don t seem to care for it said Eliza carelessly Just one piece to please me coaxed Louise and selected a piece from the box with dainty care Here my dear you ll find this sort very nice Eliza hesitated but finally reached out her hand and took the bon bon Louise lay back in her chair and closed her eyes fearing their eagerness might betray her When after a time she opened them again Eliza was slowly rocking back and forth and chewing the confection doctor Hoyt s first suggestion had been best The potion had been prepared in several ways to tempt Eliza but the candy had been the effectual bait Louise felt a glow of triumph but managed to continue the conversation relating in an amusing way the anxiety of the Elmhurst folks when the first returns seemed to indicate the election of Hopkins Eliza laughed once or twice her head resting upon the back of her chair Then the words of Louise began to sound dreamy and indistinct in her ears The chair rocked with less regularity soon it came to a stop and Eliza was peacefully sleeping in its ample depths Louise now rose softly and rang her bell Footsteps approached and a knock came upon the door She admitted doctor Hoyt mister Burke and two servants The physician approached the sleeping girl and gently lifted the lids of her eyes Then he nodded with satisfaction There was no suspicion on her part She made no struggle no attempt to evade unconsciousness he asked None at all sir replied Louise She ate the bon bon and was asleep before she realized it Excellent said the doctor We will now place her in her own room upon her bed while mister Burke and I drive over to her former home to complete our arrangements Won t she waken asked Louise Not until tomorrow morning and when she does I hope for a complete restoration of her memory Beth went with doctor Hoyt to the Rogers farm because she knew missus Rogers It was necessary to break the news to the poor blind woman gently but Beth s natural tact stood her in good stead She related the story of the search for Lucy the discovery that one of the maids at Elmhurst resembled the missing girl and the detective s conclusion that Eliza Parsons was none other than Lucy Rogers who was suffering from a peculiar mental aberration and had forgotten every detail of her former life missus Rogers followed the tale with intelligent understanding and her joy at the discovery of her wandering child was only tempered by the fear that Lucy would never know her mother again or be content to remain in her humble home Then doctor Hoyt took up the conversation and related the many instances of complete recovery that had come under his observation I am adopting heroic methods in this case said he but I have reasonable hopes of their success Your child doubtless became mentally confused while under this roof How many hours she wandered we do not know but it could not have been long before she lay down by the roadside and fell asleep When she awakened her mind was a blank as regards her identity and former history Now in order to effect a recovery I have reversed these experiences with her She is at present plunged into a deep sleep under the influence of narcotics that have rendered her brain absolutely inactive It is really a state of coma and I wish her to waken in this house amid the scenes with which she was formerly familiar By this means I hope to induce her mental faculties to resume their normal functions missus Rogers accepted this proposal with calmness and a confidence in the physician that was admirable Old Will trembled with nervous excitement and was so flustered by the importance of the experiment that doctor Hoyt decided to give him a quieting potion Lucy s room was prepared in the exact manner in which she had left it and presently the visitors drove back to Elmhurst In the evening the doctor made the journey a second time accompanying the unconscious form of Lucy which was attended by a maid Louise had sent with her The girl was undressed and put to bed in her own room and then everyone except doctor Hoyt returned to Elmhurst The physician sat late in conversation with the blind woman and old Will and when they retired for the night he lay down upon a lounge in the little living room The question of fees or of comfort was wholly ignored by the specialist at the moment His sole interest was in his remarkable case missus Rogers rose at daylight and with old Will s assistance prepared the breakfast The little table was set in the humble living room and the fragrant odor of coffee pervaded the house doctor Hoyt drank a cup and then stepped out upon the little porch taking a position of observation by the window All right Nell muttered old Will his knees knocking together in spite of himself missus Rogers rose quietly and walked to the foot of the stairs Lucy Lucy she called Yes came a faint reply Breakfast is ready Then the two old people sat in suppressed excitement for what seemed to them an age But the physician calmly stationed at the window knew it was not very long Presently a light step sounded upon the stairs and Lucy came into the room Good morning mother dear she said a new sweet tenderness in her voice And then she knelt and kissed the woman upon her brow The doctor looked at his watch I must be going he muttered turning away There s time for me to catch the early train THE END End of
