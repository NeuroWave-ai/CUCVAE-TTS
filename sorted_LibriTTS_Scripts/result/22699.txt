SAXTON WILLIAM ROSE BENET BECAUSE IF I MENTIONED ONLY ONE OF THEM I WOULD HAVE TO WRITE BOOKS TO INSCRIBE TO THE OTHER TWO PREFACE Sir Thomas Browne said that Eve was edified out of the rib of Adam This little book was edified for the most part out of the ribs of two friendly newspapers The New York Evening Post and The Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger To them and to The Bookman Everybody s and The Publishers Weekly I am grateful for permission to reprint Tristram Shandy said When a man is hemm d in by two indecorums and must commit one of em let him chuse which he will the world will blame him Now it is one indecorum to let this collection of small sketches go out as they do unrevised and just as they assaulted the defenceless reader of the daily prints and the other indecorum would be to take fragments of this kind too gravely and attempt by more careful disposition of their pallid members to arrange them into some appearance of painless decease As Gilbert Chesterton said I wish I could say on a similar occasion Their vices are too vital to be improved with a blue pencil or with anything I can think of except dynamite These sketches gave me pain to write they will give the judicious patron pain to read therefore we are quits I think as I look over their slattern paragraphs of that most tragic hour it falls about four P M in the office of an evening newspaper when the unhappy compiler tries to round up the broodings of the day and still get home in time for supper And yet perhaps the will to live is in them for are they not a naked exhibit of the antics a man will commit in order to earn a living In extenuation it may be pleaded that none of them are so long that they may not be mitigated by an accompanying pipe of tobacco THE AUTHOR Roslyn Long Island

5118-111610-0000	train-other-500	how is it that men find themselves equipped and fortified with just the friends they need We have heard of men who asserted that they would like to have more money or more books or more pairs of pyjamas
5118-111610-0001	train-other-500	but we have never heard of a man saying that he did not have enough friends
none	none	 For while one can never have too many friends 
5118-111610-0002	train-other-500	yet those one has are always enough They satisfy us completely One has never met a man who would say I wish I had a friend who would combine the good humour of A
5118-111610-0003	train-other-500	the mystical enthusiasm of B the love of doughnuts which is such an endearing quality in C and who would also have the habit of giving Sunday evening suppers like D and the well stocked cellar
5118-111610-0004	train-other-500	which is so deplorably lacking in E No the curious thing is that at any time and in any settled way of life
none	none	 a man is generally provided with friends far in excess of his desert 
5118-111610-0005	train-other-500	and also in excess of his capacity to absorb their wisdom and affectionate attentions There is some pleasant secret behind this a secret that none is wise enough to fathom The infinite fund
none	none	 of disinterested humane kindliness 
5118-111610-0006	train-other-500	that is adrift in the world is part of the riddle the insoluble riddle of life that is born in our blood and tissue It is agreeable to think that no man save by his own gross fault
none	none	 ever went through life unfriended without companions to whom he could stammer his momentary impulses of sagacity to whom he could turn in hours of loneliness It is not even necessary to know a man to be his friend 
5118-111610-0007	train-other-500	One can sit at a lunch counter observing the moods and whims of the white coated pie passer
none	none	 and by the time you have juggled a couple of fried eggs you will have caught some grasp of his philosophy of life 
5118-111610-0008	train-other-500	seen the quick edge and tang of his humour memorized the shrewdness of his worldly insight and been as truly stimulated
none	none	 as if you had spent an evening with your favourite parson If there were no such thing as friendship existing to day it would perhaps be difficult to understand what it is like from those who have written about it We have tried from time to time 
5118-111610-0009	train-other-500	to read Emerson s enigmatic and rather frigid essay It seems that Emerson must have put his cronies to a severe test before admitting them to the high vaulted and rather draughty halls of his intellect
5118-111610-0010	train-other-500	There are fine passages in his essay but it is intellectualized bloodless heedless of the trifling oddities of human intercourse that make friendship so satisfying
5118-111610-0011	train-other-500	He seems to insist upon a sterile ceremony of mutual self improvement a kind of religious ritual a profound interchange of doctrines between soul and soul
5118-111610-0012	train-other-500	His friends one gathers are to be antisepticated all the poisons and pestilence of their faulty humours
none	none	 are to be drained away before they may approach the white 
5118-111610-0013	train-other-500	and icy operating table of his heart Why insist he says on rash personal relations with your friend Why go to his house or know his wife and family
5118-111610-0014	train-other-500	And yet does not the botanist like to study the flower
none	none	 in the soil where it grows 
5118-111610-0015	train-other-500	Polonius too is another ancient supposed to be an authority on friendship The Polonius family must have been a thoroughly dreary one to live with we have often thought that poor Ophelia
none	none	 would have gone mad anyway 
5118-111610-0016	train-other-500	even if there had been no Hamlet
none	none	 Laertes preaches to Ophelia Polonius preaches to Laertes Laertes escaped by going abroad but the girl had to stay at home Hamlet saw that pithy old Polonius was a preposterous and orotund ass Polonius s doctrine of friendship The friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel was we trow 
5118-111610-0017	train-other-500	a necessary one in his case It would need a hoop of steel to keep them near such a dismal old sawmonger Friendships we think do not grow up in any
5118-111610-0018	train-other-500	such carefully tended and contemplated fashion as Messrs Emerson and Polonius suggest They begin haphazard As we look back on the first time we saw our friends
5118-111610-0019	train-other-500	we find that generally our original impression was curiously astray We have worked along beside them have consorted with them drunk or sober have grown to cherish their delicious absurdities
none	none	 have outrageously imposed on each other s patience and suddenly 
5118-111610-0020	train-other-500	we awoke to realize what had happened We had without knowing it gained a new friend In some curious way the unseen border line had been passed We had reached the final culmination
5118-111610-0021	train-other-500	of Anglo Saxon regard when two men rarely look each other straight in the eyes because they are ashamed to show each other how fond they are We had reached the fine flower and the ultimate test of comradeship
5118-111610-0022	train-other-500	that is when you get a letter from one of your best friends you know you don t need to answer it until you get ready to Emerson is right in saying that friendship can t be hurried
none	none	 It takes time to ripen It needs a background of humorous wearisome or even tragic events shared together a certain tract of memories shared in common so that you know that your own life 
5118-111610-0023	train-other-500	and your companion s have really moved for some time in the same channel It needs interchange of books meals together discussion of one another s whims with mutual friends to gain a proper perspective
5118-111610-0024	train-other-500	It is set in a rich haze of half remembered occasions sudden glimpses ludicrous pranks
none	none	 unsuspected observations midnight confidences when heart spoke to candid heart Illustration The soul preaches humility to itself when it realizes startled 
5118-111610-0025	train-other-500	that it has won a new friend Knowing what a posset
none	none	 of contradictions we all are it feels a symptom of shame at the thought that our friend knows all our frailties and yet thinks us worth affection We all have cause to be shamefast indeed for whereas we love ourselves in spite of our faults 
5118-111610-0026	train-other-500	our friends often love us even on account of our faults the highest level to which attachment can go And what an infinite appeal there is in their faces
5118-111610-0027	train-other-500	How we grow to cherish those curious little fleshy cages so oddly sculptured which inclose the spirit within To see those faces bent unconsciously over their tasks each different each unique
5118-111610-0028	train-other-500	each so richly and queerly expressive of the lively and perverse enigma of man is a full education in human tolerance Privately one studies his own ill modeled visnomy to see if by any chance
none	none	 it bespeaks the emotions he inwardly feels We know as Hamlet did the vicious mole of nature in us the o ergrowth of some complexion that mars the purity of our secret resolutions Yet our friends have passed it over 
5118-111610-0029	train-other-500	have shown their willingness to take us as we are Can we do less than hope to deserve their generous tenderness granted before it was earned
none	none	 The problem of education said R L S 
5118-111610-0030	train-other-500	is two fold first to know then to utter Every man knows what friendship means but few can utter
5118-111610-0031	train-other-500	that complete frankness of communion based upon full comprehension of mutual weakness enlivened by a happy understanding of honourable intentions generously shared When we first met our friends
5118-111610-0032	train-other-500	we met with bandaged eyes We did not know what journeys they had been on what winding roads their spirits had travelled what ingenious shifts they had devised to circumvent the walls and barriers of the world
none	none	 We know these now for some of them they have told us others we have guessed We have watched them when they little dreamed it just as they we suppose have done with us 
5118-111610-0033	train-other-500	Every gesture and method of their daily movement have become part of our enjoyment of life Not until a time comes for saying good bye will we ever know how much we would like to have said
5118-111610-0034	train-other-500	At those times one has to fall back on shrewder tongues You remember Hilaire Belloc From quiet homes and first beginning Out to the undiscovered ends
none	none	 There s nothing worth the wear of winning But laughter and the love of friends THOUGHTS ON CIDER Illustration Our friend Dove Dulcet the poet came into our kennel and found us arm in arm with a deep demijohn of Chester County cider We poured him out a beaker of the cloudy amber juice It was just in prime condition sharpened with a blithe tingle beaded with a pleasing bubble of froth Dove looked upon it with a kindled eye His arm raised the tumbler in a manner that showed this gesture to be one that he had compassed before The orchard nectar began to sluice down his throat Dove is one who has faced many and grievous woes His Celtic soul peers from behind cloudy curtains of alarm Old unhappy far off things and battles long ago fume in the smoke of his pipe His girded spirit sees agrarian unrest in the daffodil and industrial riot in a tin of preserved prunes He sees the world moving on the brink of horror and despair Sweet dalliance with a baked bloater on a restaurant platter moves him to grief over the hard lot of the Newfoundland fishing fleet Six cups of tea warm him to anguish over the peonage of Sir Thomas Lipton s coolies in Ceylon Souls in perplexity cluster round him like Canadian dimes in a cash register in Plattsburgh N Y He is a human sympathy trust When we are on our deathbed we shall send for him The perfection of his gentle sorrow will send us roaring out into the dark and will set a valuable example to the members of our family But it is the rack of clouds that makes the sunset lovely The bosomy vapours of Dove s soul are the palette upon which the decumbent sun of his spirit casts its vivid orange and scarlet colours His joy is the more perfect to behold because it bursts goldenly through the pangs of his tender heart His soul is like the infant Moses cradled among dark and prickly bullrushes but anon it floats out upon the river and drifts merrily downward on a sparkling spate It has nothing to do with Dove but we will here interject the remark that a pessimist overtaken by liquor is the cheeriest sight in the world Who is so extravagantly gloriously and irresponsibly gay Dove s eyes beaconed as the cider went its way The sweet lingering tang filled the arch of his palate with a soft mellow cheer His gaze fell upon us as his head tilted gently backward We wish there had been a painter there someone like F Walter Taylor to rush onto canvas the gorgeous benignity of his aspect It would have been a portrait of the rich Flemish school Dove s eyes were full of a tender emotion mingled with a charmed and wistful surprise It was as though the poet was saying he had not realized there was anything so good left on earth His bearing was devout religious mystical In one moment of revelation so it appeared to us as we watched Dove looked upon all the profiles and aspects of life and found them of noble outline Not since the grandest of Grand Old Parties went out of power has Dove looked less as though he felt the world were on the verge of an abyss For several moments revolution and anarchy receded profiteers were tamed capital and labour purred together on a mattress of catnip and the cosmos became a free verse poem He did not even utter the customary and ungracious remark of those to whom cider potations are given That ll be at its best in about a week We apologized for the cider being a little warmish from standing discreetly hidden under our desk Douce man he said I think cider like ale ought not to be drunk too cold I like it just this way He stood for a moment filled with theology and metaphysics By gracious he said it makes all the other stuff taste like poison Still he stood for a brief instant transfixed with complete bliss It was apparent to us that his mind was busy with apple orchards and autumn sunshine Perhaps he was wondering whether he could make a poem out of it Then he turned softly and went back to his job in a life insurance office As for ourself we then poured out another tumbler lit a corncob pipe and meditated Falstaff once said that he had forgotten what the inside of a church looked like There will come a time when many of us will perhaps have forgotten what the inside of a saloon looked like but there will still be the consolation of the cider jug Like the smell of roasting chestnuts and the comfortable equatorial warmth of an oyster stew it is a consolation hard to put into words It calls irresistibly for tobacco in fact the true cider toper always pulls a long puff at his pipe before each drink and blows some of the smoke into the glass so that he gulps down some of the blue reek with his draught Just why this should be we know not Also some enthusiasts insist on having small sugared cookies with their cider others cry loudly for Reading pretzels Some have ingenious theories about letting the jug stand either tightly stoppered or else unstoppered until it becomes hard In our experience hard cider is distressingly like drinking vinegar We prefer it soft with all its sweetness and the transfusing savour of the fruit animating it At the peak of its deliciousness it has a small airy sparkle against the roof of the mouth a delicate tactile sensation like the feet of dancing flies This we presume is the four one two to seven per cent of sin with which fermented cider is credited by works of reference There are pedants and bigots who insist that the jug must be stoppered with a corncob For our own part the stopper does not stay in the neck long enough after the demijohn reaches us to make it worth while worrying about this matter Yet a nice attention to detail may prove that the cob has some secret affinity with cider for a Missouri meerschaum never tastes so well as after three glasses of this rustic elixir That ingenious student of social niceties John Mistletoe in his famous Dictionary of Deplorable Facts a book which we heartily commend to the curious for he includes a long and most informing article on cider tracing its etymology from the old Hebrew word shaker meaning to quaff deeply maintains that cider should only be drunk beside an open fire of applewood logs And preferably on an evening of storm and wetness when the swish and sudden pattering of rain against the panes lend an added agreeable snugness to the cheerful scene within where master and dame sit by the rosy hearth frying sausages in a pan laid on the embers This reminds one of the anecdote related by ex Senator Beveridge in his Life of John Marshall Justice Story told his wife that the justices of the Supreme Court were of a self denying habit never taking wine except in wet weather But it does sometimes happen that the Chief Justice will say to me when the cloth is removed Brother Story step to the window and see if it does not look like rain And if I tell him that the sun is shining brightly Judge Marshall will sometimes reply All the better for our jurisdiction extends over so large a territory that the doctrine of chances makes it certain that it must be raining somewhere Our own theory about cider is that the time to drink it is when it reaches you and if it hails from Chester County so much the better We remember with gusto a little soliloquy on cider delivered by another friend of ours as we both stood in a decent ordinary on Fulton Street going through all the motions of jocularity and cheer Cider he said is our refuge and strength Cider he insisted drawing from his pocket a clipping much tarnished with age is a drink for men of reason and genteel nurture a drink for such as desire to drink pleasantly amiably healthily and with perseverance and yet retain the command and superintendence of their faculties I have here he continued a clipping sent me by an eminent architect in the great city of Philadelphia a city which it is a pleasure for me to contemplate by reason of the beauty and virtue of its women the infinite vivacity and good temper of its men the rectitudinal disposition of its highways I have here he exclaimed a clipping sent me by an architect of fame charming parts and infinite cellarage explaining the virtues of cider Cider this clipping asserts produces a clearness of the complexion It brightens the eye particularly in women conducing to the composition of generous compliment and all the social suavity that endears the intercourse of the sexes Longevity this extract maintains is the result of application to good cider The reverend Martin Johnson vicar of Dilwyn in Herefordshire from sixteen fifty one to sixteen ninety eight he read from his clipping wrote This parish wherein sider is plentiful hath many people that do enjoy this blessing of long life neither are the aged bedridden or decrepit as elsewhere next to God wee ascribe it to our flourishing orchards first that the bloomed trees in spring do not only sweeten but purify the ambient air next that they yield us plenty of rich and winy liquors which do conduce very much to the constant health of our inhabitants Their ordinary course is to breakfast and sup with toast and sider through the whole Lent which heightens their appetites and creates in them durable strength to labour There was a pause and our friend he is a man of girth and with a brow bearing all the candor of a life of intense thought leaned against the mahogany counter That is very fine we said draining our chalice and feeling brightness of eye length of years and durable strength to labour added to our person In the meantime we said why do you not drink the rich and winy liquor which your vessel contains He folded up his clipping and put it away with a sigh I always have to read that first he said to make the damned stuff palatable It will be ten years he said before the friend who sent me that clipping will have to drink any cider ONE NIGHT STANDS Illustration To those looking for an exhilarating vacation let us commend a week of trouping 
5118-111612-0000	train-other-500	on one night stands with a theatrical company which mirthful experience has just been ours We went along in the very lowly capacity of company author
5118-111612-0001	train-other-500	which placed us somewhat beneath the stage hands as far as dignity was concerned and we flatter ourself
none	none	 that we have learned our station and observe it with due humility The first task of the director who stages a play is to let the author know 
5118-111612-0002	train-other-500	where he gets off This was accomplished in our case by an argument concerning a speech in the play where one of the characters remarks I propose to send a mental message to Eliza This sounds we contend
none	none	 quite a harmless sentiment but the director insisted that the person speaking being an Englishman of studious disposition would not say anything so inaccurate He would use much more correct language 
5118-111612-0003	train-other-500	said the director He ought to say I purpose to send We balked mildly at this All right said our mentor The trouble with you is you don t know any English
5118-111612-0004	train-other-500	I ll send you a copy of the Century dictionary This gentleman carried purism to almost extravagant lengths He objected to the customary pronunciation of jew s harp insisting that the word should be juice harp
none	none	 and instructing the actor who mentioned this innocent instrument of melody to write it down so in his script When the dress rehearsal came round he was surveying the set for the first act with considerable complacence This scenery was intended to represent a very ancient English inn at Stratford on Avon and one of the authors was heard to remark softly that it looked more like a broker s office on Wall Street But the director was unshaken There s an old English inn up at Larchmont said he and this looks a good deal like it so I guess we re all right Let any one who imagines the actor s life is one of bevo and skittles sally along with a new play on its try out in the one night circuit When one sees the delightful humour 
5118-111612-0005	train-other-500	fortitude and high spirits with which the players face their task he gains a new respect for the profession It is with a sense of shame that the wincing author hears his lines repeated night after night
5118-111612-0006	train-other-500	lines that seem to him to have grown so stale and disreputably stupid and which the ingenuity of the players contrives to instill with life
5118-111612-0007	train-other-500	With a sense of shame indeed does he reflect that because one day long ago he was struck with a preposterous idea here are honest folk
none	none	 depending on it to earn daily bread and travelling on a rainy day on a local train 
5118-111612-0008	train-other-500	on the Central New England Railway here are eight hundred people in Saratoga Springs filing into a theatre with naive expectation on their faces Amusing things happen faster than he can stay to count them
5118-111612-0009	train-other-500	A fire breaks out in a cigar store a few minutes before theatre time It is extinguished immediately
none	none	 but half the town has rushed down to see the excitement 
5118-111612-0010	train-other-500	The cigar store is almost next door to the theatre and the crowd sees the lighted sign and drops in to give the show the once over thus giving one a capacity house
5118-111612-0011	train-other-500	Then there are the amusing accidents that happen on the stage due to the inevitable confusion of one night stands with long jumps each day when scenery and props arrive at the theatre
none	none	 barely in time to be set up In the third act 
5118-111612-0012	train-other-500	one of the characters has to take his trousers out of a handbag He opens the bag but by some error no garments are within Heavens has the stage manager mixed up the bags He has only one hope
5118-111612-0013	train-other-500	The girlish heroine s luggage is also on the stage and our comedian dashes over and finds his trousers in her bag This casts a most sinister imputation on the adorable heroine but our friend
5118-111612-0014	train-other-500	blessings on him contrives it so delicately that the audience doesn t get wise Then doors that are supposed to be locked have a habit of swinging open and the luckless heroine
5118-111612-0015	train-other-500	ready to say furiously to the hero Will you unlock the door finds herself facing an open doorway and has to invent a line to get herself off the stage
5118-111612-0016	train-other-500	Going on the road is a very humanizing experience and one gathers a considerable respect for the small towns one visits They are so brisk so proud in their local achievements so prosperous and so full of attractive shop windows When one finds
none	none	 in Johnstown N Y for instance a bookshop 
5118-111612-0017	train-other-500	with almost as well assorted a stock as one would see here in Philadelphia or in Gloversville and Newburgh public libraries
none	none	 that would be a credit to any large city 
5118-111612-0018	train-other-500	one realizes the great tide of public intelligence that has risen perceptibly in recent years At the hotel in Gloversville
none	none	 the proprietress assured us 
5118-111612-0019	train-other-500	that an English duke had just left who told her that he preferred her hotel to the Biltmore in New York We rather wondered about this English duke but we looked him up on the register
none	none	 and found that he was Sir H Urnick 
5118-111612-0020	train-other-500	of Fownes Brothers the glove manufacturers who have a factory in Gloversville But then being a glove manufacturer he may have been kidding her as the low comedian of our troupe observed
5118-111612-0021	train-other-500	But the local pride of the small town is a genial thing It may always be noted in the barber shops The small town barber knows his customers
5118-111612-0022	train-other-500	and when a strange face appears to be shaved on the afternoon when the bills are announcing a play he puts two and two together Are you with that show he asks and being answered in the affirmative
5118-111612-0023	train-other-500	one naturally would not admit that one is merely there in the frugal capacity of company author and hopes that he will imagine that such a face might conceivably belong
none	none	 to the low comedian he proceeds to expound 
5118-111612-0024	train-other-500	the favourite doctrine that this is a wise burg Yes he says folks here are pretty cagy If your show can get by here
5118-111612-0025	train-other-500	you needn t worry about New York Believe me if you get a hand here you can go right down to Broadway I always take in the shows
none	none	 and I ve heard lots of actors say this town is harder to please than any place they ever played One gets a new viewpoint on many matters 
5118-111612-0026	train-other-500	by a week of one night stands Theatrical billboards for instance We had always thought in a vague kind of way that they were a defacement to a town and cluttered up blank spaces
5118-111612-0027	train-other-500	in an unseemly way But when you are trouping the first thing you do after registering at the hotel is to go out and scout round the town yearning for billboards and complaining because there aren t enough of them
none	none	 You meet another member of the company on the same errand and say I don t see much paper out this being the technical phrase You both agree that the advance agent must be loafing 
5118-111612-0028	train-other-500	Then you set out to see what opposition you are playing against
none	none	 and emit groans on learning that 
5118-111612-0029	train-other-500	The Million Dollar Doll in Paris is also in town or Harry Bulger s Girly Show will be there the following evening or Mack Sennett s Bathing Beauties in Person That s the kind of stuff they fall for
5118-111612-0030	train-other-500	said the other author mournfully and you hustle around to the box office to see whether the ticket rack is still full of unsold pasteboard At this time of year when all the metropolitan theatres are crowded
5118-111612-0031	train-other-500	and there are some thirty plays cruising round in the offing waiting for a chance to get into New York and praying that some show now there will flop one crosses the trail of many other wandering troupes that are
none	none	 battering about from town to town In remote Johnstown N Y which can only be reached by trolley and where there is no hotel but a very fine large theatre one finds that Miss Grace George is to be the next attraction 
5118-111612-0032	train-other-500	On the train to Saratoga one rides on the same train with the Million Dollar Doll and those who have seen her paper

gentle drone neither fast nor slow There are several Owl trains with which we have been familiar One rather aristocratic of its kind is the caravan of sleeping cars that leaves New York at midnight and deposits hustling business men of the most aggressive type at the South Station Boston After a dissolute progress full of incredible jerks and jolts these pilgrims reach this dampest darkest and most Arctic of all terminals about the time the morning codfish begins to warm his bosom on the gridirons of the sacred city Another a terrible nocturnal prowler slips darkly away from Albany about one A M and rambles disconsolately and with shrill wailings along the West Shore line Below the grim Palisades of the Hudson it wakes painful echoes Its first six units as far as one can see in the dark are blind express cars containing milk cans and coffins We once boarded it at Kingston and after uneasy slumber across two facing seats found ourself impaled upon Weehawken three hours later There one treads dubiously upon a ferryboat in the fog and brume of dawn ungluing eyelids in the bleak dividing pressure of the river breeze But the Owl train we propose to celebrate is the vehicle that departs modestly from the crypt of the Pennsylvania Station in New York at half past midnight and emits blood shot wanderers at West Philadelphia at three sixteen in the morning The railroad company which thinks these problems out with nice care lulls the passengers into unconsciousness of their woes not only by a gentle and even gait a progress almost tender in its carefully modulated repression of speed but also by keeping the cars at such an amazing heat that the victims promptly fade into a swoon Nowhere will you see a more complete abandonment to the wild postures of fatigue and despair than in the pathetic sprawl of these human forms upon the simmering plush settees A hot eddy of some varnish tinctured vapour certainly not air rises from under the seats and wraps the traveller in a nightmarish trance Occasionally he starts wildly from his dream and glares frightfully through the misted pane It is the custom of the trainmen who tiptoe softly through the cars never to disturb their clients by calling out the names of stations When New Brunswick is reached many think that they have arrived at West Philadelphia or worse still have been carried on to Wilmington They rush desperately to the bracing chill of the platform to learn where they are There is a mood of mystery about this Owl of ours The trainmen take a quaint delight in keeping the actual whereabouts of the caravan a merciful secret Oddly assorted people appear on this train Occasional haughty revellers in evening dress and opera capes appear among the humbler voyagers For a time they stay on their dignity sit bravely upright and talk with apparent intelligence Then the drowsy poison of that stifled atmosphere overcomes them too and they fall into the weakness of their brethren They turn over the opposing seat elevate their nobler shins and droop languid heads over the ticklish plush chair back Strange aliens lie spread over the seats Nowhere will you see so many faces of curious foreign carving It seems as though many desperate exiles who never travel by day use the Owl for moving obscurely from city to city This particular train is bound south to Washington and at least half its tenants are citizens of colour Even the endless gayety of our dusky brother is not proof against the venomous exhaustion of that boxed in suffocation The ladies of his race are comfortably prepared for the hardships of the route They wrap themselves in huge fur coats and all have sofa cushions to recline on Even in an all night session of Congress you will hardly note so complete an abandonment of disillusion weariness and cynical despair as is written upon the blank faces all down the aisle Even the will power of a George Creel or a Will H Hays would droop before this three hour ordeal Professor Einstein who talks so delightfully of discarding Time and Space might here reconsider his theories if he brooded baking gradually upward on the hot green plush This genial Owl is not supposed to stop at North Philadelphia but it always does By this time Philadelphia passengers are awake and gathered in the cold vestibules panting for escape Some of them against the rules of the train manage to escape on the North Philadelphia platform The rest standing huddled over the swaying couplings find the leisurely transit to West Philadelphia as long as the other segments of the ride put together Stoically and beyond the power of words they lean on one another At last the train slides down a grade In the dark and picturesque tunnel of the West Philadelphia station through thick mists of steam where the glow of the fire box paints the fog a golden rose they grope and find the ancient stairs Then they stagger off to seek a lonely car or a night hawk taxi SAFETY PINS Illustration Ligature of infancy healing engine of emergency base and mainstay of our civilization we celebrate the safety pin What would we do without safety pins Is it not odd to think looking about us on our fellowmen bearded realtors ejaculating poets plump and ruddy policemen even the cheerful dusky creature who runs the elevator and whistles Oh What a Pal Was Mary as the clock draws near six P M all these were first housed and swaddled and made seemly with a paper of safety pins How is it that the inventor who first conferred this great gift on the world is not known by name for the admiration and applause of posterity Was it not the safety pin that made the world safe for infancy There will be some mayhap to set up the button as rival to the safety pin in service to humanity But our homage bends toward the former Not only was it our shield and buckler when we were too puny and impish to help ourselves but it is also now we are parent symbol of many a hard fought field where we have campaigned all over the white counterpane of a large bed to establish an urchin in his proper gear while he kicked and scrambled witless of our dismay It is fortunate pardee that human memory does not extend backward to the safety pin era happily the recording carbon sheet of the mind is not inserted on the roller of experience until after the singular humiliations of earliest childhood have passed Otherwise our first recollection would doubtless be of the grimly flushed large face of a resolute parent bending hotly downward in effort to make both ends meet while we wambled and waggled in innocent maddening sport In those days when life was as George Herbert puts it assorted sorrows anguish of all sizes the safety pin was the only thing that raised us above the bandar log No wonder the antique schoolmen used to enjoy computing the number of angels that might dance on the point of a pin But only archangels would be worthy to pirouette on a safety pin which is indeed mightier than the sword When Adam delved and Eve did spin what did they do for a safety pin Great is the stride when an infant passes from the safety pin period to the age of buttons There are three ages of human beings in this matter one Safety pins two Buttons three Studs or for females Hooks and Eyes Now there is an interim in the life of man when he passes away from safety pins and for a season knows them not save as mere convenience in case of breakdown He thinks of them in his antic bachelor years as merely the wrecking train of the sartorial system a casual conjunction for pyjamas or an impromptu hoist for small clothes Ah with humility and gratitude he greets them again later seeing them at their true worth the symbol of integration for the whole social fabric Women with their intuitive wisdom are more subtle in this subject They never wholly outgrow safety pins and though they love to ornament them with jewellery precious metal and enamels they are naught but safety pins after all Some ingenious philosopher could write a full tractate on woman in her relation to pins hairpins clothes pins rolling pins hatpins Only a bachelor as we have implied scoffs at pins Hamlet remarked after seeing the ghost and not having any Sir Oliver Lodge handy to reassure him that he did not value his life at a pin s fee Pope we believe coined the contemptuous phrase I care not a pin The pin has never been done justice in the world of poetry As one might say the pin has had no Pindar Of course there is the old saw about see a pin and pick it up all the day you ll have good luck This couplet barbarous as it is in its false rhyme points as Mother Goose generally does to a profound truth When you see a pin you must pick it up In other words it is on the floor where pins generally are Their instinctive affinity for terra firma makes one wonder why they rather than the apple did not suggest the law of gravitation to someone long before Newton Incidentally of course the reason why Adam and Eve were forbidden to pick the apple was that it was supposed to stay on the tree until it fell and Adam would then have had the credit of spotting the principle of gravitation Much more might be said about pins touching upon their curious capacity for disappearing superstitions concerning them usefulness of hatpins or hairpins as pipe cleaners usefulness of pins to schoolboys both when bent for fishing and when filed to an extra point for use on the boy in the seat in front honouring him in the breech as Hamlet would have said and their curious habits of turning up in unexpected places undoubtedly caught by pins in their long association with the lovelier sex But of these useful hyphens of raiment we will merely conclude by saying that those interested in the pin industry will probably emigrate to England for we learn from the Encyclopaedia Britannica that in that happy island pins are cleaned by being boiled in weak beer Let it not be forgotten however that of all kinds the safety is the King Pin CONFESSIONS OF A COLYUMIST Illustration

6415_111615_000019_000009	train-clean-100	I halted at a window farther down the street and studied him then returned to pass him again and watched him patiently

was a fortifying discipline Having just moved our household goods for the fourth time in four years we now find ourself in the singular state of trying to believe that the horrors of the event have added to our supply of spiritual resignation Well let us see The brutal task of taking one s home on trek is we can argue a stirring tonic a kind of private rehearsal of the Last Judgment when the sheep shall be divided from the shoats What could be a more convincing reminder of the instability of man s affairs than the harrowing upheaval of our cherished properties Those dark angels the moving men how heartless they seem in their brisk and resolute dispassion yet how exactly they prefigure the implacable sternness of the ultimate shepherds A strange life is theirs taking them day after day into the bosom of homes prostrated by the emigrating throe Does this matter of fact bearing conceal an infinite tenderness a pity that dare not show itself for fear of unmanly collapse Are they secretly broken by the sight of the desolate nursery the dismantled crib the forgotten clockwork monkey lying in a corner of the cupboard where the helpless Urchin laid it with care before he and his smaller sister were deported to be out of the way in the final storm Does the o ermastering pathos of a modest household turned inside out its tender vitals displayed to the passing world wring their breasts Stoic men if so they well conceal their pangs They have one hopelessly at a disadvantage In the interval that always elapses before the arrival of the second van there is a little social chat and utterance of reminiscences There is a lively snapping of matchheads on thumbnails and seated at ease in the debris of the dismantled living room our friends will tell of the splendour of some households they have moved before The thirty eight barrels of gilt porcelain the twenty cases of oil paintings the satin wood grand piano that their spines twinge to recall Once our furnitures were moved by a crew of lusty athletes who had previously done the same for mister Ivy Lee and while we sat in shamed silence we heard the tale of mister Lee s noble possessions Of what avail would it have been for us to protest that we love our stuff as much as mister Lee did his No we had a horrid impulse to cry apology and beg them to hurl the things into the van anyhow just to end the agony This interval of social chat being prolonged by the blizzard the talk is likely to take a more ominous turn We are told how only last week a sister van was hit by a train at a crossing and carried a hundred yards on the engine pilot Two of the men were killed though one of these lived from eleven o clock Saturday morning until eleven o clock Monday night How after hearing this can one ask what happened to the furniture even if one is indecent enough to think of it Then one learns of another of the fleet stalled in a drift on the way to Harrisburg and hasn t been heard from for forty eight hours Sitting in subdued silence one remembers something about moving accidents by flood and field and thanks fortune that these pitiful oddments are only going to a storage warehouse not to be transported thence until the kindly season of spring But packing for storage instead of for moving implies subtler and more painful anguishes Here indeed we have a tonic for the soul for election must be made among one s belongings which are to be stored and which to accompany Take the subject of books for instance Horrid hesitation can we subsist for four or five months on nothing but the Oxford Book of English Verse and Boswell s Johnson Suppose we want to look up a quotation in those late hours of the night when all really worthwhile reading is done Our memory is knitted with a wide mesh Suppose we want to be sure just what it was that Shakespeare said happened to him in his sessions of sweet silent thought what are we going to do We will have to fall back on the customary recourse of the minor poet if you can t remember one of Shakespeare s sonnets at least you can write one of your own instead Speaking of literature it is a curious thing that the essayists have so neglected this topic of moving It would be pleasant to know how the good and the great have faced this peculiarly terrible crisis of domestic affairs When the Bard himself moved back to Stratford after his years in London what did he think about it How did he get all his papers packed up and did he in mere weariness destroy the half done manuscripts of plays Charles Lamb moved round London a good deal did he never write of his experience We like to think of Emerson did he ever move and if so how did he behave when the fatal day came Did he sit on a packing case and utter sepulchral aphorisms Think of Lord Bacon and how he would have crystallized the matter in a phrase Of course in bachelor days moving may be a huge lark a humorous escapade We remember some high spirited young men three of them who were moving their chattels from rooms on Twenty first Street to a flat on Irving Place Frugality was their necessary watchword and they hired a pushcart in which to transport the dunnage It was necessary to do this on Sunday and one of the trio more sensitive than the others begged that they should rise and accomplish the public shame early in the morning before the streets were alive In particular he begged let the route be chosen to avoid a certain club on Gramercy Park where he had many friends and where he was loath to be seen pushing his humble intimacies The others scenting sport and brazenly hardy of spirit contrived to delay the start on one pretext or another until the middle of the forenoon Then by main force ignoring his bitter protest they impelled the staggering vehicle grossly overloaded past the very door of the club my friend had wished to avoid Here by malicious inspiration they tilted the wain to one side and strewed the paving with their property They skipped nimbly round the corner and with highly satisfactory laughter watched their blushing partner labouring dismally to collect the fragments Some of his friends issuing from the club lent a hand and the joy of the conspirators was complete But to the family man moving is no such airy picnic Sadly he goes through the last dismal rites and sees the modest fragments of his dominion hustled toward the cold sepulture of a motor van Before the toughened bearing of the hirelings he doubts what manner to assume Shall he stand at the front door and exhort them to particular care with each sentimental item crying Be careful with that little chair that s the one the Urchin uses when he eats his evening prunes Or shall he adopt a gruesome sarcasm hoping to awe them by conveying the impression that even if the whole van should be splintered in collision he can get more at the nearest department store Whatever policy he adopts they will not be much impressed For when we handed our gratuity not an ungenerous one to the driver asking him to divide it among the gang we were startled to hear them burst into loud screams of mirth We asked grimly the cause It appeared that during the work one of our friends apparently despairing of any pourboire appropriate to his own conceptions of reward had sold his share of the tip to the driver for fifteen cents We are not going to say how much he lost by so doing But this gamble put the driver in such a good humour that we believe he will keep away from railroad crossings SURF FISHING Illustration All day long you see them stand thigh deep in the surf fishing Up on the beach each one has a large basket containing clams for bait extra hooks and leaders a little can of oil for the reel and any particular doo dads dear to the heart of the individual fisherman And an old newspaper all ready to protect the anticipated catch from the rays of the sun Some of them wear bathing suits others rubber hip boots or simply old clothes that won t mind getting wet If they are very full of swank they will have a leather belt with a socket to hold the butt of the rod Every now and then you will see them pacing backward up the beach reeling in the line They will mutter something about a big strike that time and he got away with the bait With zealous care they spear some more clam on the hook twisting it over and over the barb so as to be firmly impaled Then with careful precision they fling the line with its heavy pyramid sinker far out beyond the line of breakers There they stand What do they think about one wonders But what does any one think about when fishing That is one of the happy pastimes that don t require much thinking The long ridges of surf crumble about their knees and the sun and keen vital air lull them into a cheerful drowse of the faculties Do they speculate on the never ending fascination of the leaning walls of water the rhythmical melody of the rasp and hiss of the water Do they watch that indescribable beauty of the breaking wave a sight as old as humankind and yet never so described that one who has not seen it could picture it The wave gathers height and speed as it moves toward the sand It seems to pull itself together for the last plunge The first wave that ever rolled up to a beach probably didn t break It just slid It was only the second wave that broke curled over in that curious way For our theory which may be entirely wrong is that the breaking is due to the undertow of previous waves After a wave sprawls up on the beach it runs swiftly back This receding undercurrent you can feel it very strongly if you are swimming just in front of a large wave about to break digs in beneath the advancing hill of water It cuts away the foundations of that hill which naturally topples over at the crest The wave of water leans and hangs for a delaying instant The actual cascade may begin at one end and run along the length of the ridge it may begin at both ends and twirl inward meeting in the middle it may but very rarely begin in the middle and work outward As the billow is at its height before it combs over the fisherman sees the sunlight gleaming through it an ecstasy of perfect lucid green with the glimmer of yellow sand behind Then for a brief moment so brief that the details can never be memorized he sees a clear crystal screen of water falling forward Another instant and it is all a boil of snowy suds seething about his legs He may watch it a thousand times a million times it will never be old never wholly familiar Colour varies from hour to hour from day to day Sometimes blue or violet sometimes green olive or gray The backwash tugs at his boots hollowing out little channels under his feet The sun wraps him round like a mantle the salt crusts and thickens in his hair And then when he has forgotten everything save the rhythm of the falling waves there comes a sudden tug He reels in and a few curious bathers stand still in the surf to see what he has got They are inclined to be scornful It is such a little fish One would think that such a vast body of water would be ashamed to yield only so small a prize Never mind He has compensations they wot not of Moreover although he would hardly admit it himself the fishing business is only a pretext How else could a grown man with grizzled hair have an excuse to stand all day paddling in the surf IDOLATRY Illustration Once in a while when the name of R L S is mentioned in conversation someone says to us 
7150-111618-0000	train-other-500	Ah well you re one of the Stevenson idolators aren t you And this is said with a curious air of cynical superiority
7150-111618-0001	train-other-500	as of one who has experienced all these things and is superbly tolerant of the shallow mind that can still admire Tusitala His work such people will generally tell you was brilliant but artificial

none	none	 When was there ever a happier or more wholesome worship for a boy than the Stevenson mania on which so many of this generation grew up We were the luckier in that our zeal was shared in all its gusto and particularity by a lean long legged sallow faced brown eyed eccentric

none	none	 It is not mere idolatry when the hearts of the young are haunted by such spells There was some real divinity behind the enchantment some marvellous essence that made all roads Tusitala trod

FIRST COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS Delivered to Cain and Abel the first graduating class of the Garden of Eden Normal School Illustration My young friends It is a privilege to be permitted to address you this morning for I am convinced that never in the world s history did the age beckon with so eager a gesture to the young men on the threshold of active life Never indeed in the past and certainly never in the future was there or will there be a time more deeply fraught with significance And as I gaze upon your keen faces it seems almost as though the world had amassed all the problems that now confront us merely in order to give you tasks worthy of your prowess The world I think I may safely say is smaller now than ever before The recent invention of young women something quite new in the way of a social problem has introduced a hitherto undreamed of complexity into human affairs The extreme rapidity with which ideas and thoughts now circulate due to the new invention of speech makes it probable that what is said in Eden to day will be known in the land of Nod within a year The greatest need is plainly for big visioned and purposeful men efficient men men with forward looking minds I hope you will pattern after your admirable father in this respect he truly was a forward looking man for he had nothing to look back on You are aware however that your father has had serious problems to deal with and it is well that you should consider those problems in the light of the experiences you are about to face One of his most perplexing difficulties would never have come upon him if he had not fallen into a deep sleep I counsel you therefore be wary not to overslumber The prizes of life always come to those who press resolutely on undaunted by fatigue and discouragement Another of your father s failings was probably due to the fact that he was never a small boy and thus had no chance to work the deviltry out of his system You yourselves have been abundantly blessed in this regard I think I may say that here in our Normal Academy you have had an almost ideal playground to work off those boyish high spirits to perpetrate those mischievous pranks that the world expects of its young Remember that you are now going out into the mature work of life where you will encounter serious problems As you wend your way from these accustomed shades into the full glare of public life you will do so I hope with the consciousness that the eyes of the world are upon you The sphere of activity in which you may find yourselves called upon to perform may be restricted but you will remember that not failure but low aim is base You will hold a just balance between the conflicting tendencies of radicalism and conservatism You will endeavour to secure for labour its due share in the profits of labour You will not be forgetful that all government depends in the last resort on the consent of the governed These catch words in the full flush of your youth you may be inclined to dismiss as truisms but I assure you that ten thousand years from now men will be uttering them with the same air of discovery It is my great pleasure to confer upon you both the degree of bachelor of arts and to pray that you may never bring discredit upon your alma mater THE DOWNFALL OF GEORGE SNIPE George Snipe was an ardent book lover and sat in the smoking car in a state of suspended ecstasy He had been invited out to Mandrake Park to visit the library of mister Genial Girth the well known collector of rare autographed books Devoted amateur of literature as he was George s humble career rarely brought him into contact with bookish treasures and a tremulous excitement swam through his brain as he thought of the glories he was about to see In his devout meditation the train carried him a station beyond his alighting place and he ran frantically back through the well groomed suburban countryside in order to reach mister Girth s home on time They went through the library together mister Girth displayed all his fascinating prizes with generous good nature and George grew excited The palms of his hands were clammy with agitation All round the room encased in scarlet slip covers of tooled morocco on fireproof shelves were the priceless booty of the collector Here was Charles Lamb s Essays of Elia inscribed by the author to the woman he loved Here was a copy of Paradise Lost signed by John Milton Here was a Hamlet given by Shakespeare to Bacon with the inscription Dear Frank don t you wish you could have written something like this Here was the unpublished manuscript of a story by Robert Louis Stevenson Here was a note written by Doctor Johnson to the landlord of the Cheshire Cheese refusing to pay a bill and accusing the tavern keeper of profiteering Here were volumes autographed by Goldsmith Keats Shelley Poe Byron DeFoe Swift Dickens Thackeray and all the other great figures of modern literature Poor George s agitation became painful His head buzzed as he surveyed the faded signatures of all these men who had become the living figures of his day dreams His eye rolled wildly in its orbit Just then mister Girth was called out of the room and left George alone among the treasures Just at what instant the mania seized him we shall never know There were a pen and an inkpot on the table and the frenzied lover of books dipped the quill deep in the dark blue fluid He ran eagerly to the shelves The first volume he saw was a copy of Lorna Doone In it he wrote Affectionately yours R D Blackmore Then came Longfellow s poems He scrawled With deep esteem Henry W Longfellow on the flyleaf Then three volumes of Macaulay s History of England In the first he jotted I have always wanted you to have these admirable books T B M In The Mill on the Floss he wrote This comes to you still warm from the press George Eliot The next book happened to be a copy of Edgar Guest s poems In this he inscribed You are the host I love the best This is my boast Yours Edgar Guest In a copy of Browning s Poems he wrote To my dear and only wife Elizabeth from her devoted Robert In a pamphlet reprint of the Gettysburg Speech he penned This is straight stuff A Lincoln But perhaps his most triumphant exploit was signing a copy of the Rubaiyat thus This book is given to the Anti Saloon League of Naishapur by that thorn in their side O Khayyam By the time the ambulance reached mister Girth s home George was completely beyond control He was taken away screaming because he had not had a chance to autograph a copy of the Songs of Solomon MEDITATIONS OF A BOOKSELLER Roger Mifflin loquitur Illustration I had a pleasant adventure to day A free verse poet came in to see me wanted me to buy some copies of The Pagan Anthology I looked over the book to which he himself had contributed some pieces I advised him to read Tennyson I wish you could have seen his face If you want to see a really good anthology I said have a look at Pearsall Smith s Treasury of English Prose just out The only thing that surprises me is that mister Smith didn t include some free verse in it The best thing about free verse is that it is often awfully good prose It s a superb clear night a milky pallor washed in the blue a white moon overhead stars rare but brilliant one in the south twinkles and flutters like a tiny flower stirred by faint air The wind is a cordial of incredible virtue Emerson sharp and chill but with a milder tincture To day though brisk and snell on the streets the sunshine had a lively vigour a generous quality a promissory note of the equinox I felt it from first rising this morning the old demiurge at work As I sat in the bathtub when a man is fifty he may be pardoned for taking a warm bath on winter mornings my mind fell upon the desire of wandering it occurred to me that a spread of legs in the vital air would be richly repaid The windows called me as soon as shirt and trousers were on I was at the sill peering out over Gissing Street Later even through closed panes the chink of milk bottles on the pavement below seemed to rise with a clearer merrier note Setting out for some tobacco about eight thirty I stopped to study the ice man s great blocks of silvery translucence lying along the curb by a big apartment house Artificial ice I suppose it was interesting to see in the meridian of each cake a kind of silvery fracture or membrane with the grain of air bubbles tending outward therefrom showing no doubt if one knew the mechanics of refrigeration just how the freezing proceeded Even in so humble a thing as a block of ice are these harmonic and lovely patterns the seal of Nature s craft inscrutable inimitable I might have made a point of this in talking to that free verse poet I m glad I didn t however he would have had some tedious reply convincing to himself That s the trouble with replies they are always convincing to the replier As a friend of mine used to say one good taciturn deserves another I was thinking as I took a parcel of laundry up to the Chinaman on McFee Street just now it would be interesting to write a book dealing solely candidly exactly and fully with the events emotions and thoughts of just one day in a man s life If one could do that in a way to carry conviction assent and reality to convey to the reader s senses a recognition of genuine actual human being one might claim to be a true artist I have found an admirable book for reading in bed this little anthology of prose collected by Pearsall Smith He knows what good prose is having written some of the daintiest bits of our time in his Trivia a book with which I occasionally delight a truly discerning customer What a fascination there is in good prose the cool element of prose as Milton calls it a sort of fluid happiness of the mind unshaken by the violent pangs of great poetry I am not subtle enough to describe it but in the steadily cumulating satisfaction of first class prose there seems to be something that speaks direct to the brain unmarred by the claims of the senses the emotions I meditate much ignorantly and fumblingly on the modes and purposes of writing It is so simple Fool said my Muse to me look in thy heart and write all that is needful is to tell what happens and yet how hard it is to summon up that necessary candor Every time I read great work I see the confirmation of what I grope for How vivid straight and cleanly it seems when done merely the outward utterance of what the mind at home in the spacious circuits of her musing hath liberty to propose to herself Let a man s mind depart from his audience let him have no concern whether to shock or to please Let him carry no consideration save to utter with unsparing fidelity what passes in his own spirit One can trust the brain to do its part All that is needed is honourable frankness not to be ashamed to open our hearts to speak our privy weakness our inward exulting Then the pain and perplexity or the childish satisfactions of our daily life are the true material of the writer s art and that which is sown in weakness may be raised in power Curious indeed that in this life brief and precariously enjoyed men should so set their hearts on building a permanence in words something to stand in the lovely stability of ink and leaden types as our speech out of silence to those who follow on Indefensible absurdity and yet the secret and impassioned dream of those who write I was about to say that for the writing of anything truly durable the first requisite is plenty of silence Then I recall doctor Johnson s preface to his Dictionary written not in the soft obscurities of retirement or under the shelter of academic bowers but amid inconvenience and distraction in sickness and in sorrow IF BUYING A MEAL WERE LIKE BUYING A HOUSE

surely arouse the suspicions of bankers as by trying to put some money in their hands We went round to a near by bank hoping to open an account As we had formerly dealt with an uptown branch of the same institution and as the cheque we wanted to deposit bore the name of a quite well known firm we thought all would be easy But no it seemed that there was no convincing way to identify ourself Hopefully we pulled out a stack of letters but these were waved aside We began to feel more and more as though we had come with some sinister intent We started to light our pipe and then it occurred to us that perhaps that would be regarded as the gesture of a hardened cracksman seeking to appear at his ease We wondered if in all our motions we were betraying the suspicious conduct of the professional embezzler Perhaps the courteous banker was putting us through some Freudian third degree in these days when the workings of the unconscious are so shrewdly canvassed was there anything abominable in the cellar of our soul which we were giving away without realizing had we not thought to ourself as we entered the door well this is a fairly decent cheque to start an account with but we won t keep our balance anywhere near that figure perhaps our Freudian banker had spotted that thought and was sending for a psychological patrol wagon well how could we identify ourself Did we know any one who had an account in that branch No We thought of a friend of ours who banked at another branch of this bank not far away The banker called him up and whispered strangely over the phone We were asked to take off our hat Apparently our friend was describing us We hoped that he was saying stout rather than fat But it seemed that the corroboration of our friend only increased our host s precaution Perhaps he thought it was a carefully worked out con game in which our friend was a confederate We signed our name several times on little cards with a desperate attempt to appear unconcerned In spite of our best efforts we could not help thinking that each time we wrote it we must be looking as though we were trying to remember how we had written it the last time Still the banker hesitated Then he called up our friend again He asked him if he would know our voice over the phone Our friend said he would We spoke to our friend with whom we had eaten lunch a few minutes before He asked to identify us what we had had for lunch Horrible instant For a moment we could not remember The eyes of the banker and his assistant were glittering upon us Then we spoke glibly enough An oyster patty we said two cups of tea and a rice pudding which we asked for cold but which was given us hot Our friend asserted to the banker that we were undeniably us and indeed the homely particularity of the luncheon items had already made incision in his hardened bosom He smiled radiantly at us and gave us a cheque book Then he told us we couldn t draw against our account until the original cheque had passed through the Clearing House and sent a youth back to the office with us so that we could be unmistakably identified As we left the banker s office someone else was ushered in Here s another gentleman to open an account said the assistant We hope he knows what he had for lunch we said to the banker ON VISITING BOOKSHOPS Illustration It Is a curious thing that so many people only go into a bookshop when they happen to need some particular book Do they never drop in for a little innocent carouse and refreshment There are some knightly souls who even go so far as to make their visits to bookshops a kind of chivalrous errantry at large They go in not because they need any certain volume but because they feel that there may be some book that needs them Some wistful little forgotten sheaf of loveliness long pining away on an upper shelf why not ride up fling her across your charger or your charge account and gallop away Be a little knightly you book lovers The lack of intelligence with which people use bookshops is one supposes no more flagrant than the lack of intelligence with which we use all the rest of the machinery of civilization In this age and particularly in this city we haven t time to be intelligent A queer thing about books if you open your heart to them is the instant and irresistible way they follow you with their appeal You know at once if you are clairvoyant in these matters libre voyant one might say when you have met your book You may dally and evade you may go on about your affairs but the paragraph of prose your eye fell upon or the snatch of verses or perhaps only the spirit and flavour of the volume more divined than reasonably noted will follow you A few lines glimpsed on a page may alter your whole trend of thought for the day reverse the currents of the mind change the profile of the city The other evening on a subway car we were reading Walter de la Mare s interesting little essay about Rupert Brooke His discussion of children their dreaming ways their exalted simplicity and absorption changed the whole tenor of our voyage by some magical chemistry of thought It was no longer a wild barbaric struggle with our fellowmen but a venture of faith and recompense taking us home to the bedtime of a child The moment when one meets a book and knows beyond shadow of doubt that that book must be his not necessarily now but some time is among the happiest excitements of the spirit An indescribable virtue effuses from some books One can feel the radiations of an honest book long before one sees it if one has a sensitive pulse for such affairs Its honour and truth will speak through the advertising Its mind and heart will cry out even underneath the extravagance of jacket blurbings Some shrewd soul who understands books remarked some time ago on the editorial page of the Sun s book review that no superlative on a jacket had ever done the book an atom of good He was right as far as the true bookster is concerned We choose our dinner not by the wrappers but by the veining and gristle of the meat within The other day prowling about a bookshop we came upon two paper bound copies of a little book of poems by Alice Meynell They had been there for at least two years We had seen them before a year or more ago but had not looked into them fearing to be tempted This time we ventured We came upon two poems To O Of Her Dark Eyes and A Wind of Clear Weather in England The book was ours or rather we were its though we did not yield at once We came back the next day and got it We are still wondering how a book like that could stay in the shop so long Once we had it the day was different The sky was sluiced with a clearer blue air and sunlight blended for a keener intake of the lungs faces seen along the street moved us with a livelier shock of interest and surprise The wind that moved over Sussex and blew missus Meynell s heart into her lines was still flowing across the ribs and ledges of our distant scene There is no mistaking a real book when one meets it It is like falling in love and like that colossal adventure it is an experience of great social import Even as the tranced swain the book lover yearns to tell others of his bliss He writes letters about it adds it to the postscript of all manner of communications intrudes it into telephone messages and insists on his friends writing down the title of the find Like the simple hearted betrothed once certain of his conquest I want you to love her too It is a jealous passion also He feels a little indignant if he finds that any one else has discovered the book too He sees an enthusiastic review very likely in The New Republic and says with great scorn I read the book three months ago There are even some perversions of passion by which a book lover loses much of his affection for his pet if he sees it too highly commended by some rival critic This sharp ecstasy of discovering books for one s self is not always widespread There are many who for one reason or another prefer to have their books found out for them But for the complete zealot nothing transcends the zest of pioneering for himself And therefore working for a publisher is to a certain type of mind a never failing fascination As H M Tomlinson says in Old Junk that fascinating collection of sensitive and beautifully poised sketches which came to us recently with a shock of thrilling delight To come upon a craft rigged so though at her moorings and with sails furled her slender poles upspringing from the bright plane of a brimming harbour is to me as rare and sensational a delight as the rediscovery when idling with a book of a favourite lyric To read just that passage and the phrase the bright plane of a brimming harbour is one of those rare and sensational delights that set the mind moving on lovely journeys of its own and mark off visits to a bookshop not as casual errands of reason but as necessary acts of devotion We visit bookshops not so often to buy any one special book but rather to rediscover in the happier and more expressive words of others our own encumbered soul A DISCOVERY Illustration We are going to tell the truth It has been on our mind for some time We are going to tell it exactly without any balancing or trimming or crimped edges We are weary of talking about trivialities and are going to come plump and plain to the adventures of our own mind These are real adventures just as real as the things we see The green frog that took refuge on our porch last night was no more real Perhaps frogs don t care so much for wet as they are supposed to for when that excellent thunderstorm came along and the ceiling of the night was sheeted with lilac brightness through which ran quivering threads of naked fire not just the soft tame flabby fire of the domestic hearth but the real core and marrow of flame its hungry terrible destroying self our friend the frog came hopping up on the porch where we stood apparently to take shelter How brilliant was his black and silver eye when we picked him up His direct and honourable regard somehow made us feel ashamed we know not why And yet we have plenty to be ashamed about but how did he know He was still on the porch this morning Equally real was the catbird on the hedge as we came down toward the station She we call her so for there was unmistakable ladyhood in her delicately tailored trimness she bickered at us in a cheerful way on top of those bushes which were so loaded with the night s rainfall that they shone a blurred cobweb gray in the lifting light Her eye was also dark and polished and lucid like a bead of ink It also had the same effect of tribulation on our spirit Neither the catbird nor the frog we said to ourself would have tormented their souls trying to invent something to write about They would have told what happened to them and let it go at that So as we walked along under an arcade of maple trees admiring the little green seed biplanes brought down by the thrash of the rain they look rather as though they would make good coathangers for fairies we asked ourself why we could not be as straightforward as the bird and the frog and talk about what was in our mind The most exciting thing that happened to us when we got to New York last February was finding a book in a yellow wrapper Its title was Old Junk which appealed to us The name of the author was H M Tomlinson which immediately became to us a name of honour and great meaning All day and every day intelligent men find themselves surrounded by oceans of what is quaintly called reading matter Most of it is turgid lumpy fuzzy in texture squalid in intellect The rewards of the literary world that is the tangible potable spendable rewards go mostly to the cheapjack and the mountebank And yet here was a man who in every paragraph spoke to the keenest intellectual sense who ten times a page enchanted the reader with the surprising and delicious pang given by the critically chosen word We sat up late at night reading that book marvelling at our good fortune We wanted to cry aloud to such as cared to understand Rejoice and be exceeding glad for here is born a man who knows how to write In our exuberance we seized a pen and wrote in the stern of our copy Here speaks the Lord God of prose here is the clear eye the ironic mind the compassionate heart the thrilling honesty and apparent simplicity of great work Then we set about making the book known to our friends We propelled them into bookshops and made them buy it We took our own copy down to William McFee on S S Turrialba and a glad heart was ours when he too said it was the real thing This is a small matter you say When the discovery of an honest pen becomes a small matter life will lose something of its savour Those who understand will understand let the others spend their time in the smoker playing pinochle Those who care about these things can get the book for themselves Of mister Tomlinson in person he is a London newspaperman we understand and now on the staff of the London Nation Trust mister Massingham the editor of that journal to know an honest writer when he sees him mister Tomlinson says of himself My life is like my portrait It won t bear investigation I am not conscious of having done anything that would interest either a policeman or the young lady of the kind who dotes on Daddy Long Legs worse luck It s about time I got down to business and did something interesting either to one or the other That is why it won t bear investigation this record of mine I am about as entertaining as one of the crowd coming out of the factory gates with his full dinner pail All my adventures have been no more than keeping that pail moderately full I ve been doing that since I was twelve in all sorts of ways I was an office boy and a clerk among London s ships in the last days of the clippers And I am forced to recall some of the things such as bookkeeping in a jam factory and stoking on a tramp steamer I can understand why I and my fellows without wanting to drifted about in indecision till we drifted into war and drifted into peace And of course I ve been a journalist I am still and so have seen much of Africa America and Europe without knowing exactly why I was in France in nineteen fourteen the August too of that year and woke up from that nightmare in nineteen seventeen after the Vimy Ridge attack when I returned to England to sit with my wife and children in a cellar whenever it was a fine night and listened to the guns and bombs God who knows all might make something of this sort of inconsequential drift of one day into the next but I give it up But now we pass to the phase of the matter that puzzles us How is it that there are some books which can never have abiding life until they perish and are born again We have noticed it so often There is a book of a certain sort to which this process seems inevitable One need only mention Leonard Merrick or Samuel Butler as examples The book we will suppose has some peculiar subtlety or flavour of appeal We are thinking at the moment of William McFee s Letters From an Ocean Tramp It is published and falls dead Later on usually about ten years later it is taken up with vigour by some other publisher the stone is rolled away from the sepulchre and it begins to move among its destined lovers This remark is caused by our delighted discovery of a previous book by the author of Old Junk The Sea and the Jungle is the title of it the tale of a voyage on the tramp steamer Capella from Swansea to Para in the Brazils and thence two thousand miles along the forests of the Amazon and Madeira rivers It is the kind of book whose readers will never forget it the kind of book that happens to some happy writers once in a lifetime and to many never at all when the moving hand seems gloriously in gear with the tremulous and busy mind and all the spinning earth stands hearkeningly still waiting for the perfect expression of the thought It is the work of a hand trained in laborious task work and then set magnificently free for a few blessed months under no burden save that of putting its captaining spirit truthfully on paper And this book in which there is a sea passage that not even mister Conrad has ever bettered this book which makes the utmost self satisfied heroics of the Prominent Writers of our market place shrivel uncomfortably in remembrance this book we repeat though published in this country in nineteen thirteen has been long out of print and the copy which we were lucky enough to lay hand on through the courtesy of the State Librarian of Pennsylvania had not previously been borrowed since November eighteen nineteen thirteen Someone asks us if this man can really write Let us choose a paragraph for example This deals with the first day at sea of the tramp steamer Capella It was December but by luck we found a halcyon morning which had got lost in the year s procession It was a Sunday morning and it had not been ashore It was still virgin bearing a vestal light It had not been soiled yet by any suspicion of this trampled planet this muddy star which its innocent and tenuous rays had discovered in the region of night I thought it still was regarding us as a lucky find there Its light was tremulous as if with joy and eagerness I met this discovering morning as your ambassador while you still slept and betrayed not I hope any grayness and bleared satiety of ours to its pure frail and lucid regard That was the last good service I did before leaving you quite I was glad to see how well your old earth did meet such a light as though it had no difficulty in looking day in the face The world was miraculously renewed It rose and received the newborn of Aurora in its arms There were clouds of pearl above hills of chrysoprase The sea ran in volatile flames The shadows on the bright deck shot to and fro as we rolled The breakfast bell rang not too soon This was a right beginning The above is a paragraph that we have chosen from mister Tomlinson s book almost at random We could spend the whole afternoon and a happy afternoon it would be for us copying out for you passages from The Sea and the Jungle that would give you the extremity of pleasure O high spirited reader It is an odd thing it is a quaint thing it is a thing that would seem inconceivable were we not tolerably acquainted with the vagaries of the reading public that a book of this sort should lie perdu on the shelves of a few libraries Yet one must not leap too heartily to the wrong conclusion The reading public is avid of good books but it does not hear about them Now we would venture to say that we know fifty people nay two hundred and fifty who would never have done thanking us if we could lay a copy of a book of this sort in their hand They would think it the greatest favour we could do them if we could tell them where they could go and lay down honest money and buy it And we have to retort that it is out of print not procurable one Is it the fault of publishers We do not think so or not very often For every publisher has experience of this sort of thing books that he knows to be of extraordinary quality and fascination which simply lie like lead in his stockroom and people will not listen to what he says about them Whose fault is it then Heaven knows one Since this was written a new edition has been published by E P Dutton company SILAS ORRIN HOWES There died in New York on February eleven nineteen eighteen one who perhaps as worthily as any man in any age represented the peculiar traits and charms of the book lover a man whose personal loveliness was only equalled by his unassuming modesty a man who was an honour to the fine old profession of bookselling There will be some who frequent Brentano s bookstore in New York who will long remember the quiet little gentleman who held the post nearest the front door whose face lit with such a gentle and gracious smile when he saw a friend approach who endured with patience and courtesy the thousand small annoyances that every salesman knows There were encounters with the bourgeois customer there were the exhausting fatigues of the rush season there were the day long calls on the slender and none too robust frame But through it all he kept the perfect and unassuming grace of the high born gentleman he was An old fashioned courtesy and gallantry moved in his blood It was an honour to know Silas Orrin Howes and some have been fortunate to have disclosed to them the richness and simple bravery of that lover of truth and beauty The present writer was one of the least and latest of these Twice during the last months of his life it was my very good fortune to spend an evening with him at his room on Lexington Avenue to drink the delicious coffee he brewed in his percolator given him by William Marion Reedy to mull with him over the remarkable scrap books he had compiled out of the richness of his varied reading and to hear him talk about books and life Silas Orrin Howes was born in Macon Georgia October fifteen eighteen sixty seven He attended school in Macon and Atlanta and then in Franklin Indiana He never went to college When he was born a passion for books was born with him His niece tells me that by the time he was twenty one he had collected a considerable library He began life as a newspaper man on the Macon Telegraph About the age of twenty four he went to Galveston where he was first a copy reader and then for seven years telegraph editor of the Galveston News I do not know all the details of his life in Galveston where he lived for about twenty years He told me that at the time of the disastrous storm and flood he was working in a drug store near the Gulf front He gave me a thrilling description of the night he spent standing on the prescription counter with the water swirling about his waist He slept in a little room at the back of the store where he had a shelf of books which were particularly dear to him Among them was a volume of Henley s poems When the flood subsided all the books were gone but the next day as he was looking over the wreckage of neighbouring houses he found his Henley washed up on a doorstep covered with slime and filth but still intact He sent it to Brentano s in New York to be rebound in vellum instructing them not to clean it in any way He wrote to Henley about the incident who sent him a very friendly autographed card which he pasted in the volume That was one of the books which he held most dear and rightly I do not know just when he came to New York about nineteen ten I believe He took a position as salesman at Brentano s After a couple of years there he became anxious to try the book business on his own account He and his nephew opened a shop in San Antonio Neither of them had much real business experience Certainly Howes himself was far too devoted a book lover to be a good business man After a few months the venture ended in failure and all the personal library which he had collected through patient years was swallowed up in the disaster After this he returned to Brentano s where he remained until his death About a year before his death he was run over by a taxicab which shook his nerves a great deal At some time during his career he came into intimate friendly contact with Ambrose Bierce and used to tell many entertaining anecdotes about that erratic venturer in letters He edited one of Bierce s volumes adding a pleasant and scholarly little introduction He was an occasional contributor to Reedy s Mirror where he enjoyed indulging in his original vein of satire and shrewd comment He was a great lover of quaint and exotic restaurants and was particularly fond of the Turkish cafe the Constantinople just off Madison Square It was a treat to go there with him see him summon the waiter by clapping his hands in the eastern fashion and enjoy the strangely compounded dishes of that queer menu He had sampled every Bulgar Turkish Balkan French and Scandinavian restaurant on Lexington Avenue His taste in unusual and savoury dishes was as characteristic as his love for the finer flavours of literature I remember last November I elicited from him that he had never tasted gooseberry jam and had a jolly time hunting for a jar which I found at last at Park and Tilford s although the sales girl protested there was no such thing I took it to him and made him promise to eat it at his breakfasts He had the true passions of the book lover which are not allotted to many He had read hungrily enjoying chiefly those magical draughts of prose which linger in the mind Bacon Sir Thomas Browne Pater Thoreau Conrad He was much of a recluse a little saddened and sharpened perhaps by some of his experiences and he loved above all those writers who can present truth with a faint tang of acid flavour the gooseberry jam of literature as it were One of my last satisfactions was to convert him in some measure to an enthusiasm for Pearsall Smith s Trivia As one looks back at that quiet honourable life one is aware of a high noble spirit shining through it a spirit that sought but little for itself welcomed love and comradeship that came its way and was content with a modest round of routine duty because it afforded inner contact with what was beautiful and true One remembers an innate gentleness and a loyalty to a high and chivalrous ideal Such a life might be a lesson if anything could to the bumptious and efficient and smug Time after time I have watched him serving some furred and jewelled customer who was not fit to exchange words with him I have seen him jostled in a crowded aisle by some parvenu ignoramus who knew not that this quiet little man was one of the immortal spirits of gentleness and breeding who associate in quiet hours with the unburied dead of English letters That corner of the store near the front door can never be the same Such a life could only fittingly be described by the gentle inseeing pen of an E V Lucas My greatest regret and disappointment when I heard of his sudden death was that he would never know of a little tribute I had paid him in a forthcoming book I had been saving it as a surprise for him for I knew it would please him And now he will never know February nineteen eighteen JOYCE KILMER Illustration I I wonder if there is any other country where the death of a young poet is double column front page news And if poets were able to proofread their own obits I wonder if any two lines would have given Joyce Kilmer more honest pride than these JOYCE KILMER POET IS KILLED IN ACTION which gave many hearts a pang when they picked up the newspaper last Sunday morning Joyce Kilmer died as he lived in action He found life intensely amusing unspeakably interesting his energy was unlimited his courage stout He attacked life at all points rapidly gathered its complexities about him and the more intricate it became the more zestful he found it Nothing bewildered him nothing terrified By the time he was thirty he had attained an almost unique position in literary circles He lectured on poetry he interviewed famous men of letters he was poet editor essayist critic anthologist He was endlessly active full of delightful mirth and a thousand schemes for outwitting the devil of necessity that hunts all brainworkers Nothing could quench him He was ready to turn out a poem an essay a critical article a lecture at a few minutes notice He had been along all the pavements of Grub Street perhaps the most exciting place of breadwinning known to the civilized man From his beginning as a sales clerk in a New York bookstore where so the tale goes by misreading the price cipher he sold a one hundred fifty dollars volume for one dollar fifty cents down to the time when he was run over by an Erie train and dictated his weekly article for the New York Times in hospital with three broken ribs no difficulties or perplexities daunted him But beneath this whirling activity which amused and amazed his friends there lay a deeper and quieter vein which was rich in its own passion It is not becoming to prate of what lies in other men s souls we all have our secrecies and sanctuaries rarely acknowledged even to ourselves But no one can read Joyce Kilmer s poems without grasping his vigorous idealism his keen sense of beauty his devout and simple religion his clutch on the preciousness of common things He loved the precarious bustle on Grub Street he was of that adventurous buoyant stuff that rejects hum drum security and a pelfed and padded life He always insisted that America is the very shrine and fountain of poetry and this country which is indeed pathetically eager to take poets to its bosom stirred his vivid imagination The romance of the commuter s train and the suburban street of the delicatessen shop and the circus and the snowman in the yard these were the familiar themes where he was rich and felicitous Many a commuter will remember his beautiful poem The twelve forty five bespeaking the thrill we have all felt in the shabby midnight train that takes us home yearning and weary to the well beloved hearth What love commands the train fulfills And beautiful upon the hills Are these our feet of burnished steel Subtly and certainly I feel That Glen Rock welcomes us to her And silent Ridgewood seems to stir And smile because she knows the train Has brought her children back again We carry people home and so God speeds us wheresoe er we go The midnight train is slow and old But of it let this thing be told To its high honour be it said It carries weary folk to bed To a man such as this whose whole fervent and busy adventure was lit within by the lamplight and firelight of domestic passion the war with its broken homes and defiled sanctities came as a personal affront Both to his craving for the glamour of such a colossal drama and to his sense of what was most worshipful in human life the call was irresistible Counsels of prudence and comfort were as nothing the heart shaking poetry of this nation s entry into an utterly unselfish war burned away all barriers His life had been a fury of writing but those who thought he had entered the war merely to make journalism about it were mistaken Only a few weeks before his death he wrote To tell the truth I am not interested in writing nowadays except in so far as writing is the expression of something beautiful And I see daily and nightly the expression of beauty in action instead of words and I find it more satisfactory I am a sergeant in the regimental intelligence section the most fascinating work possible more thrills in it than in any other branch except possibly aviation Wonderful life But I don t know what I ll be able to do in civilian life unless I become a fireman As journalist and lecturer Kilmer was copious and enthusiastic rather than deep He found a good deal to his own secret mirth women s clubs and poetry societies sitting earnestly at his feet expectant to hear ultimate truth on deep matters His humour prompted him to give them the ultimate truth they craved If his critical judgments were not always heavily documented or long pondered they were entertaining and pleasantly put The earnest world of literary societies and blue hosed salons lay about his feet he flashed in it merrily chuckling inwardly as he found hundreds of worthy people hanging breathless on his words A kind of Kilmer cult grew apace he had his followers and his devotees I mention these things because he would have been the first to chuckle over them I do not think he would want to be remembered as having taken all that sort of thing too seriously It was all a delicious game part of the grand joke of living Sometimes among his friends he would begin to pontificate in his platform manner Then he would recall himself and his characteristic grin would flood his face As a journalist I say he was copious but as a poet his song was always prompted by a genuine gush of emotion A poet is only a glorified reporter he used to say he took as his favourite assignment the happier precincts of the human heart As he said of Belloc a true poet will never write to order not even to his own order He sang because he heard life singing all about him His three little books of poems have always been dear to lovers of honest simplicity And now their words will be lit henceforward by an inner and tender brightness the memory of a gallant boy who flung himself finely against the walls of life Where they breached he broke through and waved his sword laughing Where they hurled him back he turned away laughing still II Kilmer wrote from France in answer to an inquiry as to his ideas about poetry All that poetry can be expected to do is to give pleasure of a noble sort to its readers He might have said pleasure or pain of a noble sort It is both pleasure and pain of a very noble sort that the reader will find in Robert Cortes Holliday s memoir which introduces the two volumes of Kilmer s poems essays and letters The ultimate and eloquent tribute to Kilmer s rich brave and jocund personality is that it has raised up so moving a testament of friendship mister Holliday s lively and tender essay is worthy to stand among the great memorials of brotherly affection that have enriched our speech To say that Kilmer was not a Keats is not to say that the friendship that irradiates mister Holliday s memoir was less lovely than that of Keats and Severn for instance The beauty of any human intercourse is not measured by the plane on which it moves Pleasure and pain of a noble sort are woven in every fibre of this sparkling casting up of the blithe years Pleasure indeed of the fullest for the chronicle abounds in the surcharged hilarity and affectionate humour that we have grown to expect in any matters connected with Joyce Kilmer The biographer dwells with loving and smiling particularity on the elvish phases of the young knight errant It is by the very likeness of his tender and glowing portrait that we find pleasure overflowing into pain into a wincing recognition of destiny s unriddled ways with men This memory was written out of a full heart with the poignance that lies in every backward human gaze It is only in the backward look that the landscape s contours lie revealed in their true form and perspective It is only when we have lost what was most dear that we know fully what it meant That is Fate s way with us it cannot be amended There will be no need for the most querulous appraiser to find fault with mister Holliday on the score of over eulogy He does not try to push sound carpentry or ready wit into genius Fortune and his own impetuous onslaught upon life cast Kilmer into the role of hack journalist he would have claimed no other title Yet he adorned Grub Street that most fascinating of all thorny ways with gestures and music of his own Out of his glowing and busy brain he drew matter that was never dull never bitter or petty or slovenly In the fervent attack and counter attack shock and counter shock of his strenuous days he never forgot his secret loyalty to fine craftsmanship He kept half a dozen brightly coloured balls spinning in air at all times verses essays reviews lectures introductions interviews anthologies and what not yet each of these was deftly done When he went to France and his days of hack work were over when the necessities of life no longer threatened him the journalistic habit fell away It was never more than a garment worn gracefully but still only what the tailors call a business suit In France Kilmer wrote but a handful of pieces intended for publication but at least one of them the prose sketch Holy Ireland showed his essential fibre The comparative silence of his pen when he found himself face to face with war was a true expression It bespoke the decent idealism that underlay the combats of a journalist wringing a living out of the tissues of a busy brain The tender humour and quaint austerity of his homeward letters exhibit the man at his inmost What could better the imaginative genius of the phrase in which he speaks of friendship developed by common dangers and hardships as a fine hearty roaring mirthful sort of thing like an open fire of whole pine trees in a giant s castle The memoir and Kilmer s own letters admit us to see something of the spiritual phases of this man s life whose soul found happiness and quiet kind in the Roman Catholic faith The most secret strengths and weaknesses that govern men s lives are strangely unknown to many of their intimates one wonders how many of Kilmer s associates on the Times staff knew of his habit of stopping daily at the Church of the Holy Innocents near the newspaper office to pray It was the sorrow of personal affliction that brought Kilmer to the Catholic Church Shortly after being received into that communion he wrote Just off Broadway on the way from the Hudson Tube Station to the Times Building there is a church called the Church of the Holy Innocents Since it is in the heart of the Tenderloin this name is strangely appropriate for there surely is need of youth and innocence Well every morning for months I stopped on my way to the office and prayed in this church for faith When faith did come it came I think by way of my little paralyzed daughter Her lifeless hands led me I think her tiny feet still know beautiful paths mister Holliday does well to point out that Kilmer was almost unique in this country as a representative of the Bellocian School of Catholic journalism in which piety and mirth dwell so comfortably together though he might have mentioned T A Daly as an older and subtler master of devout merriment dipping in his own inkwell rather than in any imported bottles It is to Belloc of course and to Gilbert Chesterton that one must go to learn the secret of Kilmer s literary manner Yet as Holliday affirms the similarity is due as much to an affinity of mind with these Englishmen as to any eagerness to imitate Kilmer was like them in being essentially a humorist One glance at his face with its glowing red brown eyes the colour of port wine and the twitching in drawn corners of the mouth gave the observer an impression of benignant drollery mister Holliday well says People have made very creditable reputations as humorists who never wrote anything like as humorous essays as those of Joyce Kilmer They fairly reek with the joy of life He that lives by the pen shall perish by the pen the biographer tells us quoting James Huneker For a sapling poet within a few short years and by the hard business of words to attain to a secretary and a butler and a family of at length four children is a modern Arabian Nights Tale Aye indeed But Joyce Kilmer will have as genuine a claim on remembrance by reason of his friends love as in anything his own hand penned And what an encircling almost paternal gentleness there is in the picture of the young poet as a salesman at Scribner s bookstore His smile never far away when it came was winning charming It broke like spring sunshine it was so fresh and warm and clear And there was noticeable then in his eyes a light a quiet glow which marked him as a spirit not to be forgotten So tenderly boyish was he in effect that his confreres among the book clerks accepted with difficulty the story that he was married When it was told that he had a son they gasped their incredulity And when one day this extraordinary elfin sprite remarked that at the time of his honeymoon he had had a beard they felt I remember that the world was without power to astonish them further And even more striking is what is implied in the narrative that when this elfin sprite this gently nurtured young man of bookish pursuits took up the art of war he gloried in his association with a rip roaring regiment recruited mainly from hard handed fellows of the type we may call with no atom of disrespect roughnecks Hardships and exertions familiar to them were new to him but he set himself to win their love and respect and did so He was not content until he had found his way into the most exhausting and hazardous branch of the whole job He said again and again that he would rather be a sergeant with the sixty ninth than a lieutenant with any other outfit There was a heart of heroism in the elfin sprite The same dashing insouciance that dictated the weekly article for his paper when in hospital with three broken ribs after being run down by a train was hardened and steeled in the sergeant who nightly tore his uniform into ribbons by crawling out through the barbed wire Laughter and comradeship and hearty meals clustered about Kilmer wherever he touched the grindstone of life there flew up a merry shower of sparks There is convincing testimony to the courage and beauty that lay quiet at the heart of this singer who said that the poet is only a glorified reporter and wished he had written Casey at the Bat Let us spare his memory the glib and customary dishonesty that says He died as he would have wished to No man wishes to die at least no poet does To part with the exhilarating bustle and tumult the blueness of the sky the sunlight that tingles on well known street corners the plumber s bills and the editor s checks the mirths of fellowship and the joys of homecoming when lamps are lit all this is too close a fibre to be stripped easily from the naked heart But the poet must go where the greatest songs are singing Perhaps he finds after all that life and death are part of the same rhyme TALES OF TWO CITIES I PHILADELPHIA AN EARLY TRAIN Illustration The course of events has compelled me for several months to catch an early train at Broad Street three times a week I call it an early train but of course these matters are merely relative seven forty five are the figures illuminated over the gateway not so very precocious perhaps but quite rathe enough for one of Haroun al Raschid temper who seldom seeks the oblivion of repose Boswell s phrase before one A M Nothing is more pathetic in human nature than its faculty of self deception Winding up the alarm clock the night before I meditate as to the exact time to elect for its disturbing buzz If I set it at six thirty that will give me plenty of time to shave and reach the station with leisure for a pleasurable cup of coffee But so frail is the human will when I wake at six thirty I will think to myself There is plenty of time and probably turn over for another five minutes This will mean a hideous spasm of awakening conscience about seven ten an unbathed and unshaven tumult of preparation malisons on the shoe manufacturers who invented boots with eyelets all the way up a frantic sprint to Sixteenth Street and one of those horrid intervals that shake the very citadel of human reason when I ponder whether it is safer to wait for a possible car or must start hotfoot for the station at once All this is generally decided by setting the clock for six fifty Then if I am spry I can be under way by seven twenty and have a little time to be philosophical at the corner of Sixteenth and Pine Of the vile seizures of passion that shake the bosom when a car comes along seems about to halt and then passes without stopping of the spiritual scars these crises leave

a car may still be coming while the legs make what speed they may on sliddery paving Sometimes the car does actually appear and one buffets aboard and is buried in a brawny human mass There is a stop

study for quietness of mind the familiar advertising card of the white bearded old man announcing It is really very remarkable that a cigar of this quality can be had for seven cents Suppose however that fortune is with me I descend at Market Street and the City Hall dial shining softly in the fast paling blue of morning marks seven thirty Now I begin to enjoy myself I reflect on the curious way in which time seems to stand still during the last minutes before the departure of a train The half hour between seven and seven thirty has vanished in a gruesome flash Now follow fifteen minutes of exquisite dalliance Every few moments I look suddenly and savagely at the clock to see if it can be playing some saturnine trick No even now it is only seven thirty two In the lively alertness of the morning mind a whole wealth of thought and accurate observation can be crammed into a few seconds I halt for a moment at the window of that little lunchroom on Market Street between Sixteenth and Fifteenth where the food comes swiftly speeding from the kitchen on a moving belt I wonder whether to have breakfast there It is such fun to see a platter of pale yellow scrambled eggs sliding demurely beside the porcelain counter and whipped dextrously off in front of you by the presiding waiter But the superlative coffee of the Broad Street Station lunch counter generally lures me on What mundane joy can surpass the pleasure of approaching the station lunch counter with full ten minutes to satisfy a morning appetite Morning colonel says the waiter recognizing a steady customer Wheatcakes and coffee you cry With one deft gesture it seems he has handed you a glass brimming with ice water and spread out a snowy napkin In another moment here is the coffee with the generous jug of cream You splash in a large lump of ice to make it cool enough to drink Perhaps the seat next you is empty and you put your books and papers on it thus not having to balance them gingerly on your knees All round you is a lusty savour of satisfaction the tinkle of cash registers napkins fluttering and flashing across the counters coloured waiters darting to and fro great clouds of steam rising where the big dish covers are raised on the cooking tables You see the dark brown coffee gently quivering in the glass gauge of the nickel boiler Then here come the wheatcakes Nowhere else on earth I firmly believe are they cooked to just that correct delicacy of golden brown colour nowhere else are they so soft and light of texture so hot so beautifully overlaid with a smooth almost intangible suggestion of crispness Two golden butter pats salute the eye and a jug of syrup It is now seven thirty eight As everyone knows the correct thing is to start immediately on the first cake using only syrup The method of dealing with the other two is classic One lifts the upper one and places a whole pat of butter on the lower cake Then one replaces the upper cake upon the lower leaving the butter to its fate In that hot and enviable embrace the butter liquefies and spreads itself gently anointing the field of coming action Upon the upper shield one smilingly distributes the second butter pat knifed off into small slices for greater speed of melting By the time the first cake has been eaten with the syrup the other two will be ready for manifest destiny The butter will be docile and submissive Now after again making sure of the time seven forty the syrup is brought into play and the palate has the congenial task of determining whether the added delight of melting butter outweighs the greater hotness and primal thrill of the first cake which was glossed with the syrup only You drain your coffee to the dregs gaze pityingly on those rushing in to snap up a breakfast before the eight o clock leaves for New York pay your check and saunter out to the train It is seven forty three This to be sure is only the curtain raiser to the pleasures to follow This has been a physical and carnal pleasure Now follow delights of the mind In the great gloomy shed wafts and twists of thick steam are jetting upward heavily coiled in the cold air In the train you smoke two pipes and read the morning paper Then you are set down at Haverford It is like a fairyland of unbelief Trees and shrubbery are crusted and sheathed in crystal lucid like chandeliers in the flat thin light Along the fence as you go up the hill you marvel at the scarlet berries in the hedge gleaming through the glassy ribs of the bushes The old willow tree by the Conklin gate is etched against the sky like a Japanese drawing it has a curious greenish colour beneath that gray sky There is some mystery in all this It seems more beautiful than a merely mortal earth vexed by sinful men has any right to be There is some ice palace in Hans Andersen which is something like it In a little grove the boughs bent down with their shining glaziery creak softly as they sway in the moving air The evergreens are clotted with lumps and bags of transparent icing their fronds sag to the ground A pale twinkling blueness sifts over distant vistas The sky whitens in the south and points of light leap up to the eye as the wind turns a loaded branch A certain seriousness of demeanour is noticeable on the generally unfurrowed brows of student friends Midyears are on and one sees them walking freighted with precious and perishable erudition toward the halls of trial They seem a little oppressed with care too preoccupied to relish the entrancing pallor of this crystallized Eden One carries gravely a cushion and an alarm clock Not such a bad theory of life perhaps to carry in the crises of existence a cushion of philosophy and an alarum of resolution RIDGE AVENUE One of the odd things about human beings is that wherever they happen to live they accept it as a matter of course In various foreign cities I have often been amused as every traveller has to see people going about their affairs just as though it were natural and unquestionable for them to be there It is just the same at home Everyone I see on the streets seems to be not at all amazed at living here instead of let us say Indianapolis or Nashville I envy my small Urchin his sense of the extreme improbability of everything When he gets on a trolley car he draws a long breath and looks around in ecstasy at the human scenery I am teaching him to say in a loud clear tone as he gets on the car Look at all the human beings in the same accent of amazement that he uses when he goes to the Zoo Perhaps in this way he will preserve the happy faculty of being surprised It is an agreeable thing to keep the same sense of surprise in one s home town that one would have in a strange city You will find much to startle you if you keep your eyes open Yesterday for instance I was lucky enough to meet a gentleman who had stood only a few feet away from Lincoln when he made the Gettysburg Speech Then I found that in a certain cafeteria which I frequent the price you pay for your lunch is always just one cent less than that punched on the check The cashier explained that this always gives a pleasant surprise to the customers and has proved such a good advertising dodge that the proprietor made it a habit And I saw in a clothing dealer s window on Ninth Street some fuzzy caps for men mottled purple and ochre that proved that the adventurous spirit has not died in the breast of the male sex There is much to exercise the eye in a voyage along Ridge Avenue Approaching by way of Ninth Street one sees in the window of a barber shop the new contract that the employing barbers have drawn up with their journeymen This agreement shows a sound sense of human equities proclaiming as it does that the owner must not do no act to injure the barber personal earnings It suddenly occurred to me what I had not thought of before how the barbers of Great Britain must have grieved when a London newspaper got up some years ago an agitation in favour of every man in England raising a beard in memory of King Edward The plan was that the money thus saved was to be devoted to building I had almost said growing a battleship to be named after the Merry Monarch Of course one should not speak of raising a beard but of lowering it However Ridge Avenue begins at Ninth and Vine in a mood of depression Perhaps the fact that it runs out toward the city s greatest collection of cemeteries has made it morbidly conscious of human perishability At any rate it starts among pawnshops old clothing and furniture and bottles of Old Virginia Bitters the Great Man Restorer The famous National Theatre at Callowhill Street has become a garage it is queer to see the old proscenium arch and gilded ceiling dustily vaulted over a fleet of motortrucks After a wilderness of railway yards one comes to a curious bit in the eleven hundred block a little brick tunnel that bends around into a huddle of backyards and small houses where a large green parrot was stooping and nodding on a pile of old boxes This little scene is overlooked by the tall brown spires of the Church of the Assumption on Spring Garden Street There is matter for tarrying at the Spring Garden Street crossing Here is an ambitious fountain built by the bequest of Mary Rebecca Darby Smith with the carving by J J Boyle picturing another Rebecca she of Genesis xxiv fourteen giving a drink to Abraham s servant and his camels It is carved in the bronze that the donor gave the fountain To refresh the weary and thirsty both man and beast so it is disconcerting to find it dry as dry as the inns along the way The horse trough is boarded over and thirsting equines go up to Broad Street for a draught The seat by the fountain was occupied by a man reading the New York Journal always a depressing sight Across from the fountain is one of the best magazine and stationery shops in the city Here I overheard a conversation which I reproduce textually What you doing reading said one to another Yes reading about the biggest four flusher in the Yew nited States said he looking over an afternoon paper which had just come in Who do you mean Penrose Say if it was a Republican in the White House theyda passed the treaty long ago The proprietor of this shop is a humorist Someone came in asking for a certain brand of cigarettes He does not sell tobacco Next door he said and added And you ll find some over on the fountain Ridge Avenue specializes in tobacco shops where you will find many brands that require a strong head Red Snapper Panhandle Scrap Pinch Hit Red Horse Brown s Mule Jolly Tar Penn Statue Cuttings Nickel Cross Cut Cotton Ball Twist In the shop windows you will see those photographs illustrating current events the two favourites just now being a picture of Mike Gilhooley the famous stowaway gazing plaintively at the profile of New York and Jack Dempsey Goes the Limit where Jack signs up for a one thousand dollars war savings certificate One wonders if Jack s kind of warfare is really so profitable after all There are a number of little side excursions from the avenue that repay scrutiny Lemon Street for instance where in a lane of old brown wooden houses some children were playing in an empty wagon with the rounded tower of the Rodef Shalom synagogue looming in the background Best of all is Melon Street and its modest tributary Park Avenue stretches of quiet little brick homes with green and yellow shutters and mottled gray marble steps These little houses have the serene and sunny air so typical of Philadelphia byways Through their narrow side entrances one sees glimpses of green in backyards In the front windows move the gently swaying faces of grandmothers lulled in the to and fro of a rocking chair There are shining brass knobs and bell pulls rubber plants on the sills or perhaps a small bowl of goldfish with a white china swan floating In one window was a sign Vacancies Over it hung a faded service flag with a golden star Who could phrase the pathos of these two things side by side At Broad Street Ridge Avenue leaps up with a spurt of high life In the window of a hotel dining room a gentleman sat eating his lunch stevedoring a buttered roll with such gusto that one felt tempted to applaud There are the white pillars of a bank and the battleship gray of the Salvation Army headquarters Beyond Broad the avenue spruces up a bit and enters upon a vivacious phase Dogs are frequent white bull terriers lie sunning in the shop windows Offers to lend money are enticing There is a fascinating slate yard at fifteen twenty five where great gray slabs lie in the sun a temptation to urchins with a bit of chalk In the warm bask of the afternoon there rises a pleasing aroma of fruits and vegetables piled up in baskets and crates on the pavement Grapes give off a delectable savour in the golden air Elderly ladies are out in force to do the marketing and their eyes are bright with the bargaining passion Round the windows of a ten cent store most fascinating of all human spectacles they congregate and compare notes A fruit dealer has an ingenious stunt to attract attention On his cash register lies a weird looking rotund little fish a butter fish he calls it which has a face not unlike that of Fatty Arbuckle Either this fish inflates itself or he has blown it full of air in some ingenious manner for it presents a grotesque appearance and many ladies stop to inquire Then he spoofs them gently Sure he says it s a jitney fish It lives on the cash register It can fly it can bite it can talk and it likes money At the corner of Wylie Street stands an old gray house with a mansard roof and gable windows Against it is a vivid store of fruit glowing in the sun red and purple and yellow Here or on Vineyard Street one turns off to enter the quaint triangular settlement of Francisville THE UNIVERSITY AND THE URCHIN Illustration Sunday afternoon is by old tradition dedicated to the taking of Urchins out to taste the air and indeed there is no more agreeable pastime And so as the Urchin sat in his high chair and thoughtfully shovelled his spoon through meat chopped remarkably small and potatoes mashed in that curious fashion that produces a mass of soft curly tendrils his curators discussed the question of where he should be taken It was the first Sunday in March mild and soft and tinctured with spring There s the botanic garden at the University I suggested The Urchin settled it by rattling his spoon on the plate and sliding several inches of potato into his lap Go see garden he cried With the generous tastes of twenty seven months he cares very little where he is taken he can find fascination in anything but something about the word garden seemed to allure him So a little later when he had been duly habited in brown leggings his minute brown overcoat and white hat with ribbons behind it he and his curators set out The Urchin was in excellent spirits for he had been promised a ride on a trolley car a glorious adventure In one pocket he carried his private collection of talismans including a horse chestnut and a picture of a mouse Also against emergencies a miniature handkerchief with a teddy bear embroidered in one corner and a safety pin The expedition may be deemed to have been a success as none of these properties were called upon or even remembered The car we boarded did not take us just where we expected to go but that made little difference to the Urchin who gazed steadfastly out of the window at a panorama of shabby streets and offered no comment except one of extreme exultation when we passed a large poster of a cow Admirably docile he felt confident that the unusual conjunction of both arbiters of destiny and an impressive trolley car would in the end produce something extremely worth while We sped across Gray s Ferry bridge it seems strange to think that region was once so quiet green and rustic transferred to another car on Woodland Avenue past the white medley of tombstones in Woodland Cemetery and got off at the entrance to the dormitory quadrangles at Thirty seventh Street We entered through the archway the Urchin s first introduction to an academic atmosphere This is the University I said to him severely and he was much impressed As is his way he conducted himself with extreme sobriety until he should get the hang of this new experience and see what it was all about I knew from the serene gold sparkle of his brown eyes that there was plenty of larking spirit in him waiting until he knew whether it was safe to give it play He held my hand punctiliously while waiting to see what manner of place this University was A college quadrangle on a Sunday afternoon has a feeling all its own Thin tinklings of mandolins eddy from open windows in which young men may be seen propped up against bright coloured cushions always smoking and sometimes reading with an apparent zeal which might deceive a few onlookers But the slightest sound of footfalls on the pavement outside their rooms causes these heads to turn and scan the passers There is always a vague hope in these youthful breasts that some damsel of notable fairness may have strayed within the bastions Groups of ladies of youth and beauty do often walk demurely through the courts and may be sure of hearing admiring whistles shrilled through the sunny air When a lady walks through a college quadrangle and hears no sibilation let her know sadly that first youth is past Even the sedate guardianship of Scribe and Urchin did not forfeit one Lady of Destiny her proper homage of tuneful testimonial So be it ever One who inhabited college quadrangles not so immeasurably long ago and remembers with secret pain how massively old experienced and worldly wise he then thought himself can never resist a throb of amazement at the entertaining youthfulness of these young monks How quaintly juvenile they are and how oddly that assumption of grave superiority sits upon their golden brows With what an inimitable air of wisdom cynicism ancientry learned aloofness and desire to be observed do they stroll to and fro across the quads so keenly aware in their inmost bosoms of the presence of visitors and determined to grant an appearance of mingled wisdom great age and sad doggishness What a devil may care swing to the stride what a nonchalance in the perpetual wreath of cigarette smoke what a carefully assumed bearing of one carrying great wisdom lightly and easily casting it aside for the moment in the pursuit of some waggish trifle Here those very self conscious young visages seem to betray is one who might tell you all about the Holy Roman Empire and yet is for the moment diverting himself with a mere mandolin And yet as the Lady of Destiny shrewdly observed it is a pity they should mar their beautiful quadrangles with orange peel and scraps of paper We walked for some time through those stately courts of Tudor brick and then passed down the little inclined path to the botanic garden where irises and fresh green spikes are already pushing up through the damp earth A pale mellow sunlight lay upon the gravel walks and the Urchin resumed his customary zeal He ran here and there along the byways examined the rock borders with an air of scientific questioning and watched the other children playing by the muddy pond We found shrubbery swelling with buds also flappers walking hatless and blanched with talcum accompanied by Urchins of a larger growth Both these phenomena we took to be a sign of the coming equinox Returning to the dormitory quadrangles we sat down on a wooden bench to rest while the Urchin now convinced that a university is nothing to be awed by scampered about on the turf His eye was a bright jewel of roguishness for he thought that in trotting about the grass he was doing something supremely wicked He has been carefully trained not to err on the grass of the city square to which he is best accustomed so this surprising and unchecked revelry quite went to his head Across and about those wide plots of sodden turf he trotted and chuckled a small quaint mortal with his hat ribbons fluttering Cheering whistles hailed him from open windows above and he smiled to himself with grave dignity Apparently like a distinguished statesman he regarded these tributes not as meant for himself but for the great body of childhood he innocently represents and indeed from which his applauders are not so inextricably severed With the placid and unconscious happiness of a puppy he careered and meandered without motive or method Perhaps his underlying thought of a university if he has any is that it is a place where no one says Keep Off the Grass and intellectually speaking that would not be such a bad motto for an institution of learning I don t know whether Doctor Tait McKenzie so intended it but his appealing and beautiful statue of Young Franklin in front of the University gymnasium is admirably devised for the delight of small Urchins While their curators take pleasure in the bronze itself the Urchin may clamber on the different levels of the base which is nicely adapted for the mountaineering capacity of twenty seven months The low brick walls before the gymnasium and the University museum are also just right for an Urchin who has recently learned the fascination of walking on something raised above the ground provided there is a curator near by to hold his hand And then as one walks away toward the South Street bridge an observant Urchin may spy the delightful spectacle of a freight train travelling apparently in midair Some day one hopes all that fine tract of open space leading from the museum down to the railroad tracks may perhaps be beautified as a park or an addition to the University s quadrangle system I don t know who owns it but its architectural possibilities must surely make the city planner s mouth water By this time the Urchin was beginning to feel a bit weary and was glad of a lift on a parental shoulder Then a Lombard Street car came along and took us up halfway across the bridge So ended the Urchin s first introduction to a university education PINE STREET Our neighbourhood is very genteel I doubt if any one who has not lived in Philadelphia can imagine how genteel it is Visitors from out of town are wont to sigh with rapture when they see our trim blocks of tall brick dwellings that even cornice running in a smooth line for several hundred yards really is quite a sight and exclaim Oh I wish we had something like this in New York But our gentility is a little self conscious for we live on the very frontier of a region darker in complexion which is far from scrupulous in deportment Uproarious and naive are the humours of South Street lying just behind us Stanleys have gone exploring thither and come back with merry tales South Street on a bright evening its myriad barber shops gleaming with lathered dusky cheeks wafting the essence of innumerable pomades and lotions that were a Travel indeed On South Street the veins of life run close to the surface We are no less human on our street but it takes a bit more study to get at the secret There is a certain reticence about us It would take an earthquake to cause much fraternization along Pine Street Perhaps it is because three houses out of every four bear the tablets of doctors The average layman fears to stop and speak to his neighbour for fear it will develop into a professional matter We board up our front windows at night with heavy wooden shutters We have no druggists only apothecaries These apothecaries are closed on Sundays They sell stamps in little isinglass capsules to be quite sanitary two twos in a capsule for five cents In their shops you can still get soda water with plain cream and shaved ice such as was customary twenty five years ago When our doctors go away for the summer someone comes twice a week from June to October to polish up the little silver name plate It is the custom in our neighbourhood so one observes through drawing room windows to have reading lamps with rosy pink shades and at least two beautiful daughters of debutante age I hope I am not unjust but our street looks to me like the kind of place where people take warm baths in a roomy old china tub on Sunday afternoons After that they go downstairs and play a hymn on the piano at twilight Illustration There are a number of very odd features about our neighbourhood There is a large schoolhouse at the next corner but as far as I can see it is not used as a school not for children at any rate Sometimes about eight o clock in the evening I see the building gloriously illuminated and a lonely lady stooped and assiduous at a table She seems quite solitary Perhaps her researches are so poignant that the school board has prescribed entire silence But midway down the block is a very jolly little private school to which very genteel children may be seen approaching early in the morning The little girls come with a bustle of starch on foot accompanied by governesses the small boys arrive in limousines They are small boys dressed very much in the English manner with heavy woollen stockings ending just below the knee They probably do not realize that their tailor has carefully planned them to look like dear little English boys Then there is a very mysterious small theatre near by If it were a movie theatre what a boon it would be But no it is devoted to a strange cult called the Religion of Business which meets there on Sundays Before that there was a Korean congress there There is a lovely green room in this theatre but not much long green in the box office Philadelphia prefers Al Jolson to Hank Ibsen We have our tincture of vie de Boheme though in our little French table d hote a thoroughly atmospheric place Delightful Madame B with her racy philosophy of life what delicious soups and salads she serves Happy indeed are those who have learned the way to her little tables and heard her cheerful cry A la cuisine when one of her small dogs prowls into the dining room Equally unique is the old curiosity shop near by one of the few genuine notion shops left in the city though there is a delightful one on Market Street near Seventeenth to enter which is to step into a country village This is just the kind of shop bought by the old gentleman in one of Frank Stockton s agreeable tales mister Tolman in the volume called The Magic Egg The proprietress charming and conversable lady will sell you anything in the notions line from a paper of pins to garter elastic Then there is the laundry whose patrons carry on a jovial game known as Looking for Your Own Every week by some cheery habit of confusion the lists are lost and one hunts through shelves of neatly piled and crisply laundered garments to pick out one s own collars pyjamas or whatever it may be The amusing humour of this pastime must be experienced to be understood The little cigar and magazine shop on the corner is the political and social focus of the neighbourhood I shall never forget the pallid and ghastly countenance of the newsdealer when the rumour first went the rounds that Hampy was elected Every evening a little gathering of local sages meets in the shop on tilted chairs in a haze of tobacco they while the hours away In tobacco the host adheres to the standard blends but in literature he is enterprising Until recently this was the only place I know in Philadelphia where one could get the Illustrated London News every week There are twinges of modernity going on along our street Some of the old houses have been remodeled into apartments There is an electric shoe repairer just round the corner But the antique dealers and plumbers for which the street is famous still hold sway the fine old brick pavement still collects rain water in its numerous dimpled hollows and the yellowish marble horse blocks adorn the curb The nice shabby stables in the little side streets have not yet been turned into studios by artists and the neighbourhood s youngest urchins set sail for Rittenhouse Square every morning on their fleet of kiddie cars Their small stout legs twinkling along the pavements in white gaiters on a wintry day are a pleasant sight Even our urchins are notably genteel Surrounded on all sides by the medical profession they are reared on registered milk and educator crackers If Philadelphia ever betrays its soul it does so on this delightful bland and genteel highway PERSHING IN PHILADELPHIA Illustration The pavement in front of Independence Hall was a gorgeous jumble of colours The great silken flags of the Allies carried by vividly costumed ladies burned and flapped in the wind On a pedestal stood the Goddess of Liberty in rich white draperies that seemed fortunately of sufficient texture to afford some warmth for the air was cool She graciously turned round for Walter Crail the photographer of our contemporary the Evening Public Ledger to take a shot at her Down Chestnut Street came a rising tide of cheers A squadron of mounted police galloped by Then the First City Troop with shining swords Fred Eckersburg the State House engineer was fidgeting excitedly inside the hall in a new uniform This was Fred s greatest day but we saw that he was worried about Martha Washington the Independence Hall cat He was apprehensive lest the excitement should give her a fit or a palsy Independence Hall is no longer the quiet old place Martha used to enjoy before the war The Police Band struck up Hail to the Chief Yells and cheers burst upward from the ground like an explosion Here he was standing in the car There was the famous chin the Sam Browne belt the high laced boots with spurs Even the tan gloves carried in the left hand There was the smile without which no famous man is properly equipped for public life There was Governor Sproul s placid smile too but the Mayor seemed too excited to smile Rattle rattle rattle went the shutters of the photographers Up the scarlet lane of carpet came the general His manner has a charming easy grace He saluted each one of the fair ladies garbed in costumes of our Allies but taking care not to linger too long in front of any one of them lest any embracing should get started A pattering of tiger lilies or some such things came dropping down from above He passed into the hall which was cool and smelt like a wedding with a musk of flowers While the Big Chief was having a medal presented to him inside the hall we managed to scuttle round underneath the grand stand and take up a pencil of vantage just below the little pulpit where the general was to speak Here the crowd groaned against a bulwark of stout policemen Philadelphia cops bless them are the best tempered in the world How Boston must envy us Genially two gigantic bluecoats made room against the straining hawser for young John Fisher aged eleven of three hundred thirty two Greenwich Street John is a small freckle faced urchin It was amusing to see him thrusting his eager little beezer between the vast soft plushy flanks of two patrolmen He had been there over two hours waiting for just this adventure Then to assert the equality of the sexes Mildred Dubivitch aged eleven and Eva Ciplet aged nine managed to insert themselves between the chinks in the line of cops An old lady more than eighty years old was sitting placidly in a small chair just inside the ropes She had been in the square more than five hours and the police had found her a seat Are you going to put Pershing s name in too asked John as we noted his address Independence Square never knew a more thrilling fifteen minutes The trees were tossing and bending in the thrilling blue air There was a bronzy tint in their foliage as though they were putting on olive drab in honour of the general Great balloons of silver clouds scoured across the cobalt sky At one minute to eleven Pershing appeared at the top of the stand The whole square massed with people shook with cheers Had it been any other man we would have said the general was frightened He came down the aisle of the stand with his delightful easy smiling swing but he looked shrewdly about with a narrow eyed puckered gaze He was plainly a little flabbergasted He seemed taken aback by the greatness of Philadelphia s voice He said something to himself On his lips it looked like What the deuce or something of similar purport He sat down on a chair beside Governor Sproul Not more than four feet away amazed at our own audacity we peered over the floor of the stand He was paler than we expected He looked a bit tired Speaking as a father we were pleased to note the absence of Warren who was we hope getting a good sleep somewhere We had a good look at the renowned chin which is well worth study It must be a hard chin to shave It juts upward reaching a line exactly below the brim of his cap Below his crescent moustache there is no lower lip visible it is tucked and folded in by the rising thrust of the jaw It is this which gives him the grim aspect which every reader of the papers hears about He is grim there s no doubt about it with the grimness of a man going through a tough ordeal I can see him all right squeaked little John Fisher but he doesn t see me The first two rows of seats at the right of the aisle were crammed with generals two star and three star From our lowly station we could see a grand panorama of mahogany leather boots and the flaring curves of riding breeches It was a great day for Sam Browne The thought came to us that has reached us before The higher you go in the A E F the more the officers are tailored after the English manner It is the finest proof of international cousinship When England and America wear the same kind of clothes alliance is knit solid Pershing sat with his palms on his knees He looked worried There was a wavering crease down his lean cheeks The plumply genial countenance of Governor Sproul next to him was an odd contrast to that dry hard face The bell in the tower tolled eleven times He stood up for the photographers Walter Crail appearing from somewhere sprang up on the parapet facing the general Look this way he shouted as the general turned toward some movie men That will be Walter s first cry when he gets to heaven or wherever Mayor Smith s face was pallid with excitement His nicely draped trouserings which were only six inches from our notebook quivered slightly as he said fifteen words of introduction As Pershing stood up to speak the crowd surged forward The general was worried Don t don t Somebody will get hurt he called sharply Then Mayor Smith surged forward also and said something to the police about watching the crowd The general took off his cap Holding it in his left hand with the gloves he patted his close cropped hair nervously He frowned He began to speak The speech has already been covered by our hated rivals We will not repeat it save to say that it was as crisp clean cut and pointed as his chin He was nervous as we could see by the clenching and unclenching of his hands His voice is rather high We liked him for not being a suave and polished speaker He gestured briskly with a pointing forefinger and pronounced the word patriotic with a short A pattriotic Later he stumbled over it again and got it out as patterotism We liked him again for that He doesn t have to pronounce it anyway We liked him best of all for the unconscious slip he made This reception he said I understand is for the splendid soldiery of America that played such an important part in the war with our Allies A respectful ripple of laughter passed over the stand at this but he did not notice it He was fighting too hard to think what to say next We liked him too for saying such an important part A man who had been further away from the fighting would have said that it was America alone and unaided that won the war He is just as we have hoped he would be a plain blunt man We have heard that he is going to enter the banking business We d like to have an account at that bank FALL FEVER Illustration About this time of year when the mellow air swoons as the poets say with golden languor and the landscape is tinged a soft brown like a piece of toast we feel the onset and soft impeachment of fall fever Fall fever is in our case at any rate more insidious than the familiar disease of spring Spring fever impels us to get out in the country to seize a knotted cudgel and a pouchful of tobacco and agitate our limbs over the landscape But the drowsiness of autumn is a lethargy in the true sense of that word a forgetfulness A forgetfulness of past discontents and future joys a forgetfulness of toil that is gone and leisure to come a mere breathing existence in which one stands vacantly eyeing the human scene living in a gentle simmer of the faculties like a boiling kettle when the gas is turned low Fall fever one supposes is our inheritance from the cave man who like the bear and the well some other animal whatever it is went into hibernation about the first of November Autumn with its soft inertia lulled him to sleep He ate a hearty meal raked together some dry leaves curled up and slid off until the alarm clock of April This agreeable disease does not last very long with the modern man He fights bravely against it then the frost comes along or the coal bill and stings him into activity But for a few days its genial torpor may be seen by the observant even in our bustling modern career When we read yesterday that Judge Audenried s court clerks had fallen asleep during ballot counting proceedings we knew that the microbe was among us again Keats in his lovely Ode describes the figure of Autumn as stretched out on a half reaped furrow sound asleep Unhappily the conventions forbid city dwellers from curling up on the pavements for a cheerful nap If one were brave enough to do so unquestionably many would follow his example But the urbanite has taught himself to doze upright You may see many of us standing dreamily before Chestnut Street show windows in the lunch hour to all intents and purposes in a state of slumber Yesterday in that lucid shimmer of warmth and light a group stood in front of a doughnut window near Ninth Street not one of them was more than half awake Similarly a gathering watched the three small birds who have become a traditional window ornament on Chestnut Street they have recently moved from an oculist to a correspondence course office and a faint whisper of snoring arose on the sultry air The customs of city life permit a man to stand still as long as he likes if he will only pretend to be watching something We saw a substantial burgher pivoted by the window of mister Albert the violin maker on Ninth Street Apparently he was studying the fine autographed photo of Patti there displayed but when we sidled near we saw that his eyes were closed this admirable person who seemed to be what is known as a busy executive and whose desk undoubtedly carries a plate glass sheet with the orisons of Swett Marden under it was in a blissful doze Modern life as we say struggles against this sweet enchantment of autumn but Nature is too strong for us Why is it that all these strikes occur just at this time of year The old hibernating instinct again perhaps The workman has a subconscious yearning to scratch together a nice soft heap of manila envelopes and lie down on that couch for a six months ear pounding There are all sorts of excuses that one can make to one s self for waving farewell to toil Only last Sunday we saw this ad in a paper HEIRS WANTED The war is over and has made many new heirs You may be one of them Investigate Many now living in poverty are rich but don t know it Now what could be simpler we said to ourself as we stood contemplating those doughnuts than to forsake our jolly old typewriter and spend a few months in investigating whether any one had made us his heir It might be Odd things have happened Down in Washington Square for instance we thought are a number of sun warmed benches very reposeful to the sedentary parts on which we might recline and think over the possibility of our being rich unawares We hastened thither but apparently many had had the same idea There was not a bench vacant The same was true in Independence Square and in Franklin Square We will never make a good loafer There is too much competition So we came back sadly to our rolltop and fell to musing We picked up a magazine and found some pictures showing how Mary Pickford washes her hair If I am sun drying my hair said Mary under a photo showing her reclining in a lovely garden doing just that I usually have the opportunity to read a scenario or do some other duty which requires concentration And it occurred to us that if a strain like that is put upon a weak woman we surely ought to be able to go on moiling for a while Indian summer or not And then we found some pictures by our favourite artist Coles Phillips with that lovely shimmer around the ankles and we resolved to be strong and brave and have pointed finger nails But still in the back of our mind the debilitating influence of fall fever was at work We said to ourself without the slightest thought of printing it for it seemed to put us in a false light that the one triumphant and unanswerable epigram of mankind the grandest and most resolute utterance in the face of implacable fate is the snore TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS Will the hand organ man please call Our wife has dug up our old overcoat and insists on giving it to him We intended to give it to the Honolulu Girls around at the Walnut Theatre they looked a bit goose fleshed last week but we always have hay fever when we get near those grass skirts Grass widows is what the profession calls the Hawaiian ladies Hope the temperature isn t going up again We love the old fashioned Christmas and all that sort of thing Nipping air makes cheeks pink we love to see them nestled in fur coats on Chestnut Street This is the time of year to do unexpected kindnesses We know one man who stands in line for hours in front of movie theatres just in order to shout Merry Christmas through the little hole in the glass Shaving seems less of a bore Newspapers are supposed to be heartless but they all take a hand in trying to help poor children Find ourselves humming hymn tunes Very odd haven t been to a church for years Great fun surprising people We ve been reading the new phone book noticed several ways in which people might surprise each other by calling up and wishing many happy returns of the day Why doesn t Beulah R Wine ring up missus Louis F Beer for instance Or A D Smoker and Burton J Puffer might go around to W C Matchett tobacconist at sixteen thirty five South Second Street and buy their Christmas cigars George Wharton Pepper might give Mayme Salt a ring on the phone that is What a pleasant voice that telephone operatrix has Here s to you child and many of them Grand time Christmas Fine old Anglo Saxon festival Christmas A time of jovial cheer and bracing mirth Must be so because Doctor Frank Crane and Ralph Waldo Trine have often said so Christmas hard on people like that however they are bursting with the Christmas spirit all the year round very trying when the real occasion comes That s the beauty of having a peevish and surly disposition when one softens up at Christmas everybody notices it and is pleased Chaucer fine old English poet first English humorist gave good picture of Christmas cheer more than five hundred years ago Never quoted on Christmas cards why not copy it here Chaucer s spelling very like Ring Lardner s but good sort just the same Says he And this was as thise bookes me remembre The colde frosty sesoun of Decembre The bittre frostes with the sleet and reyn Destroyed hath the grene in every yard Janus sit by the fyre with double beard And drynketh of his bugle horn the wyn Biforn hym stant brawn of the tusked swyn And Nowel crieth every lusty man Janus god of doors what we call nowadays a janitor Had two faces so he could watch the front and back door at once and get a double tip at Christmas time Also that was why he wore a beard too much trouble to shave We don t cry Nowel any more instead we petition the janitor to send up a little more steam But what a jolly picture Chaucer gives of Christmas Wine to drink fine ruddy wine as red as the holly berries crackling flitch of pig to eat and a merry cry of welcome sounding at the threshold as your friends come stamping in through the snow Grand time Christmas No one is really a Philadelphian until he has waited for a Pine Street car on a snowy night Please have my seat madam there s plenty of room on the strap Wonder why the pavement on Chestnut Street is the slipperiest in the world Always fall down just in front of our bank most embarrassing hope the paying teller doesn t see us Very annoying to lose our balance just there Awfully nice little girl in there who balances the books Has a kind heart The countless gold of a merry heart as William Blake said She looks awfully downcast when our balance gets the way it is now Hate to disappoint her Won t have our book balanced again for a devil of a while Even the most surly is full of smiles nowadays Most of us when we fall on the pavement did you ever try it on Chestnut between Sixth and Seventh on a slippery day curse the granolithic trust and wamble there groaning But not nowadays Make the best of things Fine panorama of spats Association of ideas Everybody wears silk stockings at Christmas time Excessive geniality of the ad writers Uproarious good cheer Makes one almost ashamed to notice the high price of everything Radicals being deported Why not deport Santa Claus too Very radical notion that love your neighbour better than yourself Easy to do very few of us such dam fools as to love ourselves but so often when you love your neighbour she doesn t return it Nice little boxes they have at the ten cent stores all covered with poinsettia flowers to put presents in Wonder when poinsettia began to be used as a Christmas decoration and why Everyone in ten cent store calls them poinsettias but named after J R Poinsett Encyclopedia very handy at times makes a good Christmas present one dollar down and a dollar a month for life Nobody can tell the difference between real pearls and imitation somebody ought to put the oysters wise Save them a lot of trouble and anxiety Don t know just what duvetyne is but there seems to be a lot of it drunk nowadays Hope that clockwork train for the Urchin will arrive soon we were hoping to have three happy evenings playing with it before he sees it Fine to have children lots of fun playing with their presents We are sure that life after death is really so because children always kick the blankets off at night Fine bit of symbolism that put it in a sermon unless Doctor Conwell gets there first Grand time Christmas We vowed to try to take down our weight this winter and then they put sugar back on the menu and doughnut shops spring up on every street and Charles F Jenkins sent us a big sack of Pocono buckwheat flour and we re eating a basketful of griddle cakes every morning for breakfast Terrible to be a coward we always turn on the hot water first in the shower bath except the first morning we used it The plumber got the indicator on the wrong way round and when you turn to the place marked HOT it comes down like ice Our idea of a really happy man is the fellow driving a wagonload of truck just in front of a trolley car holding it back all the way downtown when he hears the motorman clanging away he pretends he thinks it s the Christmas chimes and sings Hark the Herald Angels Speaking of Herald Angels reminds us of a good story about James Gordon Bennett we ll spring it one of these days when we re hard up for copy Jack Frost must be a married man did you see him try to cover up the show windows with his little traceries the other day when the shopping was at its height There was a pert little hat in a window on Walnut Street we were very much afraid someone might see the frost saved us Don t forget to put Red Cross seals on your letters Delightful to watch the faces on the streets at Christmas time Everybody trying hard to be pleasant sometimes rather a strain Curious things faces some of them seem almost human queer to think that each belongs to someone and no chance to get rid of it sorry we re not in the mirror industry never thought of it before but it ought to be profitable Happier most of us if mirrors never had been invented Hope all our nice natured clients will have the best kind of a time forgive us for not answering letters we are too disillusioned about ourself to make any resolutions to do better We re going home now on the way we ll think of a lot of nice things we might have said write them down and use them to morrow Hope Dorothy Gish will get something nice in her stocking Don t make the obvious retort Grand time Christmas IN WEST PHILADELPHIA Illustration Climbing aboard car No thirteen ominously labelled Mt Moriah I voyaged toward West Philadelphia It was a keen day the first snow of winter had fallen and sparkling gushes of chill swept inward every time the side doors opened The conductor who gets the full benefit of this ventilation was feeling cynical and seeing his blue hands I didn t blame him Long lines of ladies fumbling with their little bags and waiting for change stepped off one by one into the windy eddies of the street corners One came up to pay her fare ten blocks or so before her destination and then retired to her seat again This puzzled the conductor and he rebuked her The argument grew busy To the amazement of the passengers this richly dressed female brandished lusty epithets You Irish mick she said One would not have believed it possible if he had not heard it That s what I am and proud of it said he The shopping solstice is not all fur coats and pink cheeks If you watch the conductors in the blizzard season and see the slings and arrows they have to bear you will coin a new maxim The conductor is always right It is always entertaining to move for a little in a college atmosphere I stopped at College Hall at the University and seriously contemplated slipping in to a lecture The hallways were crowded with earnest youths of both sexes I was a bit surprised at the number of company eds particularly the number with red hair discussing the tribulations of their lot Think of it said one man I m a senior and carrying twenty three hours Got a thesis to do twenty thousand words On a bulletin board I observed the results of a General Intelligence Exam It appears that seventeen seventy students took part They were listed by numbers not by names It was not stated what the perfect mark would have been the highest grade attained was one hundred fifty nine by mister or Miss seven hundred thirty five The lowest mark was twenty three I saw that both four hundred forty and eleven twenty four got the mark of one hundred forty nine If these gentlemen or ladies are eager to play off the tie it would be a pleasure to arrange a deciding competition for them The elaborate care with which the boys and girls ignore one another as they pass in the halls was highly delightful and reminded me of exactly the same thing at Oxford But I saw the possible beginning of true romance in the following notice on one of the boards WANTED Names and addresses of ten nice American university students who must remain in Philadelphia over Christmas away from home to be invited to a Christmas Eve party to help entertain some Bryn Mawr College girls in one of the nicest homes in a suburb of Philadelphia Certainly there is the stage set for a short story Perhaps not such a short one either Naturally I could not resist a visit to the library where most of the readers seemed wholly absorbed though one student was gaping forlornly over a volume of Tennyson I found an intensely amusing book Who s Who in Japan a copy of which would be a valuable standby to a newspaper paragrapher in his bad moments For instance SASAKI TETSUTARO One of the highest taxpayers of Fukushima ken President of the Hongu Reeling Partnership Director of the Dai Nippon Radium Water company brewer reeler born Aug eighteen sixty SAKURAI ICHISAKU Member of the Niigata City Council Director of the Niigata Gas company Niigata Savings Bank Born June eighteen seventy two Studied Japanese and Chinese classics and arithmetic At present also he connects with the Niigata Orphanage and various other philanthropic bodies Was imprisoned by acting contrary to the act of explosive compound for seven years Recreations reading Western wine Relying on my apparent similarity to the average undergrad I plunged into the sancta of Houston Hall and bought a copy of the Punch Bowl What that sprightly journal calls A little group of Syria s thinkers was shooting pool The big fireplaces like most fireplaces in American colleges don t seem to be used They don t even show any traces of ever having been used a curious contrast to the always blazing hearths of English colleges The latter however are more necessary as in England there is usually no other source of warmth A bitter skirmish of winds carrying powdered snow dust nipped round the gateways of the dormitories and Tait McKenzie s fine statue of Whitefield stood sharply outlined against a cold blue sky I lunched at a varsity hash counter on Spruce Street and bought tobacco in a varsity drug store where a New York tailor over for the day was cajoling students into buying his snappy styles in time for Christmas There is no more interesting game than watching a lot of college men trying to pick out those who may be of some value to the community in future the scientists poets and teachers of the next generation The well dressed youths one sees in the varsity drug stores are not generally of this type The Evans School of Dentistry at Fortieth and Spruce is a surprising place Its grotesque gargoyles showing with true medieval humour the sufferings of tooth patients are the first thing one notices Then one finds the museum in which is housed Doctor Thomas W Evans s collection of paintings and curios brought back from France Unfortunately there seems to be no catalogue of the items so that there is no way of knowing what interesting associations belong to them But most surprising of all is to find the travelling carriage of the Empress Eugenie in which she fled from France in the fatal September days of eighteen seventy She spent her last night in France at the home of Doctor Evans and there is a spirited painting by Dupray showing her leaving his house the next morning ushered into the carriage by the courtly doctor The old black barouche or whatever one calls it seems in perfect condition still with the empress s monogram on the door panel Only the other day we read in the papers that the remarkable old lady now in her ninety fourth year has been walking about Paris revisiting well known scenes How it would surprise her to see her carriage again here in this University building in West Philadelphia The whole museum is delightfully French in flavour as soon as one enters one seems to step back into the curiously bizarre and tragic extravagance of the Second Empire One passes into the dignified and placid residence section of Spruce and Pine streets with its distinctly academic air Behind those quiet walls one suspects bookcases and studious professors and all the delightful passions of the mind On Baltimore Avenue the wintry sun shone white and cold in Clark Park Charles Dickens wore a little cap of snow and Little Nell looked more pathetic than ever There is a breath of mystery about Baltimore Avenue What does that large sign mean in front of a house near Clark Park THE EASTERN TRAVELLERS Then one comes to the famous shop of S F Hiram the Dodoneaean Shoemaker he calls himself This wise coloured man has learned the advertising advantages of the unusual His placard reads Originator of that famous Dobrupolyi System of repairing When one enters and asks to know more about this system he points to another placard which says It assumes the nature and character of an appellative noun and carries the article The System His shop contains odd curios as well as the usual traffic of a cobbler The public loves to be hood winked he adds sagely HORACE TRAUBEL We wait with particular interest to hear what Philadelphia will have to say about the passing of Horace Traubel Traubel was the official echo of the Great Voice of Camden and in his obituary one may discern the vivacity of the Whitman tradition This is a matter of no small concern to the curators of the Whitman cult The soul of Philadelphia cannot be kept alive by conventions and statistics alone Such men as Traubel have helped There are two kinds of rebels By their neckties you may know them Walt Whitman was of the kind that wears no necktie at all Then there is the lesser sort of which Traubel was one the rebel who wears a flowing black bow tie with long trailers Elbert Hubbard wore one of these It is a mild rebellion of which this is symbol It often goes with shell spectacles Illustration We never knew Horace Traubel though he was the man we most wanted to meet when we came to Philadelphia We have heard men of all conditions speak of him with affection and respect He was dedicated from boyhood to the Whitman cause From Walt himself he caught the habit of talking about Walt and he carried it on with as much gusto and happiness as Walt did Only recently he said in his little magazine The Conservator When I was quite small I used to want to be a great man But in my observations of the old man s better than great way of meeting the gifts as well as the reverses of fate I didn t want to be a great man I only wanted to stay unannexed to any institution as he was No college ever decorated him For the best of reasons No college could He could decorate them So Traubel remained unannexed He was fired from a bank because he happened to take issue in public with one of the bank s chief depositors He floated about happily surrounded by young Whitman disciples carrying on his guerrilla for what his leader called the peerless passionate good cause of human democracy His little magazine led a precarious life supported by good friends His protest against iniquities was an honest good humoured protest Horace Traubel will be remembered as he wished to be remembered as the biographer of Whitman Whitman also we may add wished Traubel to be so remembered In his careful record of the Camden sage s utterances and pulse beats he approached as nearly as any one the devoted dignity of Boswell We were about to say the self effacing devotion of Boswell but the beauty of biography is that the biographer cannot wholly delete himself from the book One is always curious about the recording instrument When we see a particularly fine photograph our first question is always What kind of camera was it taken with It seems to us speaking only by intuition for we never knew him that Traubel was a happy man He was untouched by many of the harassing ambitions that make the lives of prosperous men miserable He was touched in boyhood by one simple and overmastering motive to carry on the Whitman message and spread it out for the younger world Much of the dunnage of life he cast overboard He was too good a Whitman disciple to estimate success in the customary terms When he left his job in the bank he opened an account in the Walt Whitman philosophy and he kept a healthy balance there to the end TALES OF TWO CITIES II NEW YORK THE ANATOMY OF MANHATTAN She is the only city whose lovers live always in a mood of wonder and expectancy There are others where one may sink peacefully contentedly into the life of the town affectionate and understanding of its ways But she the woman city who is bold enough to say he understands her The secret of her thrilling and inscrutable appeal has never been told How could it be She has always been so much greater than any one who has lived with her Shall we mention Walt Whitman as the only possible exception O Henry came very near to her but did he not melodramatize her a little sometimes cheapen her by his epigrammatic appraisal fit her too neatly into his plot Kipling seemed to see her only as the brutal heedless wanton Truly the magic of her spell can never be exacted She changes too rapidly day by day Realism as they call it can never catch the boundaries of her pearly beauty She needs a mystic No city so challenges and debilitates the imagination Here where wonder is a daily companion desire to tell her our ecstasy becomes at last only a faint pain in the mind If you would mute a poet s lyre put him on a ferry from Jersey City some silver April morning or send him aboard at Liberty Street in an October dusk Poor soul his mind will buzz for years to come after adequate speech to tell those cliffs and scarps amethyst and lilac in the mingled light the clear topaz chequer of window panes the dull bluish olive of the river streaked and crinkled with the churn of the screw Many a poet has come to her in the wooing passion Give him six months he is merely her Platonist He lives content with placid companionship Where are his adjectives his verbs That inward knot of amazement what speech can unravel it Her air when it is typical is light dry cool It is pale it is faintly tinctured with pearl and opal Heaven is unbelievably remote the city itself daring so high heaven lifts in a cautious remove Light and shadow are fantastically banded striped and patchworked among her cavern streets a cool deep gloom is cut across with fierce jags and blinks of brightness She smiles upon man who takes his ease in her colossal companionship Her clean soaring perpendiculars call the eye upward One wanders as a botanist in a tropical forest That great smooth groinery of the Pennsylvania Station train shed is it not the arching fronds of iron palm trees Oh to be a botanist of this vivid jungle spread all about one anatomist of the ribs and veins that run from the great backbone of Broadway To love her one thinks is to love one s fellows each of them having some unknown share in her loveliness Any one of her streets would be the study and delight of a lifetime To speak at random we think of that little world of brightness and sound bourgeois cheer that spreads around the homely Verdi statue at Seventy third Street We have a faithful affection for that neighbourhood for reasons of our own Within a radius thereabouts of a quarter mile each way we could live a year and learn new matters every day They call us a hustling folk Observe the tranquil afternoon light in those brownstone byways Pass along leisurely Amsterdam Avenue the region of small and genial shops Amsterdam Avenue of the many laundries See the children trooping upstairs to their own room at the saint Agnes branch of the Public Library See the taxi drivers sitting in their cars alongside the Verdi grass plot a rural breath of new mown turf sweetening the warm crisp air and smoking pipes Every one of them is to us as fascinating as a detective story What a hand they have had in ten thousand romances At this very moment what quaint and many stranded destinies may hail them and drive off But there they sit placid enough with a pipe and the afternoon paper The light fluttering dresses of enigmatic fair ones pass gayly on the pavement Traffic flows divides and flows on a sparkling river Here is that mystery a human being buying a cigar Here is another mystery asking for a glass of frosted chocolate Why is it that we cannot accost that tempting riddle and ask him to give us an accurate precis of his life to date And that red haired burly sage he who used to bake the bran muffins in the little lunchroom near by and who lent us his Robby Burns one night what has become of him So she teases us so she allures Sometimes on the L as one passes along that winding channel where the walls and windows come so close there is a felicitous sense of being immersed surrounded drowned in a great generous ocean of humanity It is a fine feeling All life presses around one the throb and the problem are close are close Who could be weary who could be at odds with life in such an embrace of destiny The great tall sides of buildings fly open the human hive is there beautiful and arduous beyond belief Here is our worship and here our lasting joy here is our immortality of encouragement Yes perhaps O Henry did say the secret after all He saw no longer a rabble but his brothers seeking the ideal VESEY STREET Illustration The first duty of the conscientious explorer is to study his own neighbourhood

7997-111638-0009	train-other-500	it is hard not to fall into a clumsy imitation of his lively and frolic manner There is at least one essayist in this city who fell subject to the hilarious Hilaire years ago

7997-111638-0036	train-other-500	and now they bubble gayly in the windows of Philadelphia s most aristocratic thoroughfare It is really a startling sight to see Philadelphia lining up for its noonday quota of doughnuts and the merchants over there
7997-111638-0037	train-other-500	have devised an ingenious method of tempting the crowd A funnel erected over the frying sinkers carries the fragrant fumes out through a transom and gushes it into the open air so that the sniff of doughnuts

and mufflers with something of that air of ostentatious hardiness that men always assume on coming into a warm room from a cold street Thick chops were hissing on the rosy grill at the foot of the stairs In one of the little crowded stalls a man sat with a glass of milk It was the first time we had been in that chop house for several years it doesn t seem the same As mister Wordsworth said it is not now as it hath been of yore But still The homely Nurse doth all she can To make her foster child her Inn mate Man Forget the glories he hath known It s a queer thing that all these imitation beers taste to us exactly as real beer did the first time we tasted it we were seven years old and shuddered Two glasses of cider we said to the comely serving maid Alas That nature yet remembers What was so fugitive There is a nice point of etiquette involved in lunching in a crowded chop house Does the fact of having bought and eaten a moderate meal entitle one to sit with one s companion for a placid talk and smoke afterward Or is one compelled to relinquish the table as soon as one is finished to make place for later comers These last are standing menacingly near by gazing bitterly upon us as we look over the card and debate the desirability of having some tapioca pudding But our presiding Juno has already settled the matter and made courtesy a matter of necessity These gentlemen will be through in a moment she says to the new candidates Our companion the amiable G W was just then telling us of a brand of synthetic whiskey now being distilled by a famous tavern of the underworld The superlative charm of this beverage seems to be the extreme rigidity it imparts to the persevering communicant What does it taste like we asked Rather like gnawing furniture said G W It s like a long healthy draught of shellac It seems to me that it would be less trouble if you offered the barkeep fifty cents to hit you over the head with a hammer The general effect would be about the same and you wouldn t feel nearly so bad in the morning A windy day and perishing chill we thought as we strolled through the gloomy caverns and crypts underneath the Brooklyn Bridge Those twisted vistas seen through the archways give an impression of wrecked Louvain A great bonfire was burning in the middle of the street Under the Pearl Street elevated the sunlight drifted through the girders in a lively chequer patterning piles of gray black snow with a criss cross of brightness We had wanted to show our visitor Franklin Square which he as a man of letters had always thought of as a trimly gardened plot surrounded by quiet little old fashioned houses with brass knockers and famous authors tripping in and out As we stood examining the facade of Harper and Brothers our friend grew nervous He was carrying under his arm the dummy of an export catalogue for a big brass foundry that being his line of work They ll think we re free verse poets trying to get up courage enough to go in and submit a manuscript he said and dragged us away A windy day we had said in the grimy recesses of Cliff and Dover streets Approaching this sentiment for the third time perhaps we may be permitted to accomplish our thought and say what we had in mind But up on the airy decking of the Brooklyn Bridge where we repaired with G W for a brief stroll the afternoon seemed mild and tranquil It is a mistake to assume that the open spaces are the windier The subway is New York s home of AEolus and most of the gusts that buffet us on the streets are merely hastening round a corner in search of the nearest subway entrance so that they can get down there where they feel they belong Up on the bridge it was plain to perceive that the March sunshine had elements of strength The air was crisp but genial A few pedestrians were walking resolutely toward the transpontine borough the cop on duty stood outside his little cabin with the air of one ungrieved by care Behind us stood the high profiles of the lower city sharpened against the splendidly clear blue sky which is New York s special blessing On the water moved a large tug towing barges Smoke trailed behind it in the same easy and comfortable way that tobacco reek gushes over a man s shoulder when he walks across a room puffing his pipe The bridge is a curiously delightful place to watch the city from Walking toward the central towers seems like entering a vast spider s web The footway between the criss cross cables draws one inward with a queer fascination the perspective diminishing the network to the eye so that it seems to tighten round you as you advance Even when there is but little traffic the bridge is never still It is alive trembling vibrant the foot moves with a springy recoil One feels the lift and strain of gigantic forces and looks in amazement on the huge sagging hawsers that carry the load The bars and rods quiver the whole lively fabric is full of a tremor but one that conveys no sense of insecureness It trembles as a tree whispers in a light air And of the view from the bridge it is too sweeping to carry wholly in mind Best one thinks it is seen in a winter dusk when the panes of Manhattan s mountains are still blazing against a crystal blue green sky and the last flush of an orange sunset lingers in the west Such we saw it once coming over from Brooklyn very hungry after walking in most of the way from Jamaica and pledged in our own resolve not to break fast until reaching a certain inn on Pearl Street where they used to serve banana omelets Dusk simplifies the prospect washes away the lesser units fills in the foreground with obliterating shadow leaves only the monstrous sierras of Broadway jagged against the vault It deepens this incredible panorama into broad sweeps of gold and black and peacock blue which one may file away in memory tangled eyries of shining windows swimming in empty air As seen in the full brilliance of noonday the bristle of detail is too bewildering to carry in one clutch of the senses The eye is distracted by the abysses between buildings by the uneven elevation of the summits by the jumbled compression of the streets In the vastness of the scene one looks in vain for some guiding principle of arrangement by which vision can focus itself It is better not to study this strange and disturbing outlook too minutely lest one lose what knowledge of it one has Let one do as the veteran prowlers of the bridge stroll pensively to and fro in the sun taking man s miracles for granted exhilarated and content THREE HOURS FOR LUNCH Hudson Street has a pleasant savour of food It resounds with the dull rumble of cruising drays which bear the names of well known brands of groceries it is faintly salted by an aroma of the docks One sees great signs announcing cocoanut and whalebone or such unusual wares there is a fine tang of coffee in the air round about the corner of Beach Street Here is that vast massy brick edifice the New York Central freight station built eighteen sixty eight which gives an impression of being about to be torn down From a dilapidated upper window hangs a faded banner of the Irish Republic At noontime this region shows a mood of repose Truckmen loll in sunny corners puffing pipes with their curved freight hooks hung round their necks In a dark smithy half a dozen sit comfortably round a huge wheel which rests on an anvil using it as a lunch table Near Canal Street two men are loading ice into a yellow refrigerator car and their practiced motions are pleasant to watch One stands in the wagon and swings the big blocks upward with his tongs The other on the wagon roof seizes the piece deftly and drops it through a trap on top of the car The blocks of ice flash and shimmer as they pass through the sunshine In Jim O Dea s blacksmith shop near Broome Street fat white horses are waiting patiently to be shod while a pink glow wavers outward from the forge Illustration At the corner of Hudson and Broome streets we fell in with our friend Endymion it being our purpose to point out to him the house one of that block of old red dwellings between Hudson and Varick which Robert C Holliday has described in Broome Street Straws a book which we hope is known to all lovers of New York local colour Books which have a strong sense of place and are born out of particular streets and especially streets of an odd rich and well worn flavour are not any too frequent mister Holliday s Gissingesque appreciation of the humours of landladies and all the queer fish that shoal through the backwaters of New York lodging houses makes this Broome Street neighbourhood exceedingly pleasant for the pilgrim to examine It was in mister Holliday s honour that we sallied into a Hudson Street haberdashery just opposite the channel of Broome Street and adorned ourself with a new soft collar also having the pleasure of seeing Endymion regretfully wave away some gorgeous mauve and pink neckwear that the agreeable dealer laid before him with words of encouragement We also stood tranced by a marvellous lithograph advertising a roach powder in a neighbouring window and wondered whether mister Holliday himself could have drawn the original in the days when he and Walter Jack Duncan lived in garrets on Broome Street and were art students together Certainly this picture had the vigorous and spirited touch that one would expect from the draughting wrist of mister Holliday It showed a very terrible scene apparently a civil war among the roaches for one army of these agile insects was treasonously squirting a house with the commended specific and the horrified and stricken inmates were streaming forth and being carried away in roach ambulances attended by roach nurses to a neighbouring roach cemetery All done on a large and telling scale with every circumstance of dismay and reproach on the faces of the dying blattidae Not even our candour which is immense permits us to reprint the slogan the manufacturer has adopted for his poster those who go prowling on Hudson Street may see it for themselves In the old oyster and chop house just below Canal Street we enjoyed a very agreeable lunch To this place the Broome Street garreteers so mister Holliday has told us used to come on days of high prosperity when some cheque arrived from a publisher At that time the tavern kept an open fireplace with a bright nest of coals in the chilly season and there was a fine mahogany bar But we are no laudator of acted time the fireplace has been bricked up it is true but the sweet cider is admirable and as for the cheesecake we would back it against all the Times Square variety that Ben De Casseres rattles about It is delightful and surprising to find on Hudson Street an ordinary so droll and Dickensish in atmosphere and next door is a window bearing the sign WALTER PETER We feel sure that mister Holliday were he still living in those parts would have cajoled the owner into changing that E to an A Our stroll led us north as far as Charlton Street which the geographers of Greenwich Village claim as the lower outpost of their domain Certainly it is a pleasing byway running quietly through the afternoon and one lays an envious eye upon the demure brick houses with their old fashioned doorways pale blue shutters and the studio windows on the southern side At the corner of Varick Street is a large house showing the sign Christopher Columbus University of America Macdougal Street gives one a distant blink of the thin greenery of Washington Square An unexpected impulse led us eastward on Grand Street to revisit Max Maisel s interesting bookshop We had never forgotten the thrill of finding this place by chance one night when prowling toward Seward Park In bookshops of a liberal sort we always find it advisable to ask first of all for a copy of Frank Harris s The Man Shakespeare It is hardly ever to be found unfortunately so the inquiry is comparatively safe for one in a frugal mood and it is a tactful question for the mention of this book shows the bookseller that you are an intelligent and understanding kind of person and puts intercourse on good terms at once However we did find one book that we felt we simply had to have as it is our favourite book for giving away to right minded people The Invisible Playmate by William Canton We fear that there are still lovers of children who do not know this book but if so it is not our fault Grand Street is a child at heart and one may watch it making merry not only along the pavement but in the shop windows Endymion s gallant spirit was strongly uplifted by this lively thoroughfare and he strode like one whose heart was hitting on all six cylinders Max Maisel s bookshop alone is enough to put one in a seemly humour But then one sees the gorgeous pink and green allurements of the pastry cooks windows and who can resist those little lemon flavoured saffron coloured cakes which are so thirst compelling and send one hastily to the nearest bar for another beaker of cider And it seems natural to find here the oldest toyshop in New York where Endymion dashed to the upper floor in search of juvenile baubles and we both greatly admired the tall dark and beauteous damsel who waited on us with such patience and charity Endymion by this time was convinced that he was living in the very heart and climax of a poem he became more and more unreal as we walked along we could see his physical outline tenuous enough at best shimmer and blur as he became increasingly alcaic Along the warm crowded pavement there suddenly piped a liquid gurgling chirring whistle rising and dropping with just the musical trill that floats from clumps of creekside willows at this time of year We had passed several birdshops on our walk and supposed that another was near A song sparrow was our instant conclusion and we halted to see where the cage could be hung And then we saw our warbler He was little and plump and red faced with a greasy hat and a drooping beer gilded moustache and he wore on his coat a bright blue peddler s license badge He shuffled along stooping over a pouch of tin whistles and gurgling in one as he went There s your poem we said to Endymion The Song Sparrow on Grand Street We propose to compile a little handbook for truants which we shall call How to Spend Three Hours at Lunch Time This idea occurred to us on looking at our watch when we got back to our kennel PASSAGE FROM SOME MEMOIRS How long ago it seems that spring noonshine when two young men we will call them Dactyl and Spondee set off to plunder the golden bag of Time These creatures had an oppressive sense that first Youth was already fled For one of them in fact it was positively his thirtieth birthday poor soul how decrepitly he flitted in front of motor trucks As for the other he was far decumbent in years quite of a previous generation a perfect Rameses whose

lingering savour of clown white grease paint elephants sleek barking seals trained pigs superb white horses frolicking dogs exquisite ladies in tights and spangles the pallid Venuses of the living statuary a whole jumble of incongruous and fantastic glimpses moving in perfect order through its arranged cycles this is the blurred and ecstatic recollection of an amateur clown at the circus It was pay day that afternoon and all the performers were in cheerful humour Perhaps that was why the two outsiders who played a very inconspicuous part in the vast show were so gently treated Certainly they had approached the Garden in some secret trepidation They had had visions of dire jests and grievous humiliations of finding themselves suddenly astride the bare backs of berserk mules or hoisted by blazing petards or douched with mysterious cascades of icy water Pat Valdo had written I am glad to hear you are going to clown a bit I hope you both will enjoy the experience To our overwrought imaginations this sounded a little ominous What would Pat and his lively confreres do to us We need not have feared Not in the most genial club could we have been more kindly treated than in the dressing room where we found Pat Valdo opening his trunk and getting out the antic costumes he had provided The eye of a certain elephant to tell the truth was the only real embarrassment we suffered We happened to stand by him as he was waiting to go on and in his shrewd and critical orb we saw a complete disdain He spotted us at once He knew us for interlopers He knew that we were not a real clown and his eye showed a spark of scorn We felt shamed and slunk away A liberal coating of clown white well rubbed into the palms before applying a rich powdering of talcum and decorations applied by Pat Valdo with his red and black paint sticks these give an effect that startles the amateur when he considers himself in the mirror Topped with a skull cap of white flannel on which perches a supreme oddity in the way of a Hooligan hat and enveloped in a baggy Pierrot garment one is ready to look about and study the dressing room where our fellows in every kind of gorgeous grotesquerie are preparing for the Grand Introductory Pageant followed by the Strange People They don t call them Freaks any more Here is Johannes Joseffson the Icelandic Gladiator sitting on his trunk with his bare feet gingerly placed on his slippers to keep them off the dusty floor while he puts on his wrestling tights As he bends over with arched back and raises one leg to insert it into the long pink stocking one must admire the perfect muscular grace of his thighs and shoulders Here is the equally muscular dwarf being massaged by a friend before he dons his pink frills and dashing plumed hat and becomes Mlle Spangletti the marvel equestrienne darling of the Parisian boulevards Here is the inevitable Charley Chaplin and here the dean of all the clowns an old gentleman of seventy four in his frolicsome costume as lively as ever Here is a trunk inscribed Australian Woodchoppers and sitting on it one of the woodchoppers himself a quiet humorous cultivated gentleman with a great fund of philosophy A rumour goes the rounds as it does behind the scenes in every kind of show Do you know who we have with us to day I see one of the boxes is all decorated up It s missus Vincent Astor Who s she interjects the Australian woodchopper satirically It s General Wood Did you hear Wood and Pershing are here to day Charley Chaplin asserts that he has a good gag that he s going to try out to day and see how it goes One of the other clowns in the course of dressing comes up to Pat Valdo and Pat introduces his two pupils Newspaper men hey says the latter What did you tell me for I usually double cross the newspaper men when they come up to do some clowning he explains to us We are left wondering in what this double crossing consists Suddenly they all troop off down the dark narrow stairs for the triumphal entry The splendour of this parade may not be marred by any clown costumes so the two novices are left upstairs peering through holes in the dressing room wall The big arena is all an expanse of eager faces The band strikes up a stirring ditty A wave of excitement sweeps through the dingy quarters of the Garden The show is on and how delirious it all is Downstairs the space behind the arena is a fascinating jostle of odd sights The elephants come swaying up the runway from the basement and stand in line waiting their turn Here is a cage of trained bears In the background stands the dogcatcher s cart attached to the famous kicking mule From the ladies dressing quarters come the aerial human butterflies in their wings and gauzy draperies On the wall is a list of names Mail Uncalled For One of the names is Toby Hamilton That must mean old Toby and we fear the letter will never be called for now for Toby Hamilton the famous old Barnum and Bailey press agent who cleaned up more free space than any man who ever lived died in nineteen sixteen Suddenly appears a person clad in flesh tights and a barrel carrying a label announcing himself as The Common People Someone thrusts a large sign into the hands of one of the amateur clowns and he is thrust upon the arena to precede the barrelled Common People round the sawdust circuit He has hardly time to see what the sign says something about On Strike Against one hundred dollars Suits The amateur clown is somewhat aghast at the huge display of friendly faces Is he to try to be funny Here is the flag hung box and he tries to see who is in it He doesn t see either Wood Pershing or missus Astor who are not there but a lot of wounded soldiers who smile at him encouragingly He feels better and proceeds finding himself with a start just beneath some flying acrobats who are soaring in air hanging by their teeth Common People shouts to him to keep the sign facing toward the audience The tour is made without palpable dishonour Things are now moving so fast it is hard to keep up with them Pat Valdo is dressed as a prudish old lady with an enormous bustle Escorted by the clown policeman and the two amateurs Pat sets out fanning himself demurely Hullo the bustle has detached itself from the old lady but she proceeds unconscious The audience shouts with glee Finally the cop sees what has happened and screams The amateur clowns scream too and one of them in a burst of inspiration takes off his absurd hat to the bustle which is now left yards behind But Pat is undismayed turns and beckons with his hand The bustle immediately runs forward of its own accord and reattaches itself to the rear of the skirt You see there is a dwarf inside it The two amateur clowns are getting excited by this time and execute some impromptu tumbling One tackles the other and they roll over and over desperately In the scuffle one loses both his hat and skull cap and flees shamefast from the scene It is asserted by our partner that this went big He swears it got a laugh Pat Valdo hurries off to prepare for his boomerang throwing Pat is a busy man for he is not only a clown but he and missus Valdo also do wonderful stunts of their own on Ring Number One And there are moments of sheer poetry too Into the darkened arena crossed by dazzling shafts of light speeds a big white motor car Bird Millman descends tossing aside her cloak A fairy on a cobweb the press agents call her and as two humble clowns watch entranced through the peepholes in the big doors the phrase seems none too extravagant See her in a foam of short fluffy green skirts twirl and tiptoe on the glittering wire all grace and slenderness and agile enchantment She bows in the dazzle of light and kisses her hands to the crowd Then she hops into the big car and is borne back behind the scenes Once behind the doors her gay vivacity ceases She sits wearily several minutes before getting out of the car And then later comes Mlle Leitzel She like all the other stars is said to have amazed all Europe We don t know whether Europe is harder to amaze than America Certainly no one could be more admiringly astounded than the amateur clowns gazing entranced through the crack of the doorway To that nerve tightening roll of drums she spins deliriously high up in giddy air floating a tiny human pin wheel in a shining cone of light One can hear the crowd catch its breath She walks back all smiles while her maid trots ahead saying something unintelligible Her tall husband is waiting for her at the doorway He catches her up like a child and carries her off limp and exhausted One of the clowns irreverent creature makes a piteous squawk and begs us to carry him to his dressing room A trained pig trotting cheerfully round in search of tidbits is retrieved from under the hooves of missus Curtis s horse which is about to go out and dance The dogcatcher s wagon is drawn up ready to rush forth and the trained terrier which accompanies it is leaping with excitement He regards it as a huge lark and knows his cue perfectly When the right time comes he makes a dash for a clown dressed as an elderly lady and tears off her skirt One of the amateurs was allowed to ride behind the kicking mule but to his great chagrin the mule did not kick as well as usual Here are Charley Chaplin and some others throwing enormous dice from a barrel No matter how the dice are thrown they always turn up seven Into this animated gamble the amateur clown enters with enjoyment All round him the wildest capers are proceeding The double ended flivver is prancing about John Barleycorn s funeral procession is going its way Give me plenty of space says Charley Chaplin to us so the people can watch me We do so reverently for Charley s antics are worth watching We make a wild dash and plan to do a tumble in imitation of Charley s To our disappointment we find that instead of sliding our feet dig into the soft sawdust and the projected collapse does not arrive Intoxicated by the rich spice of circus odours the booming calliope the galloping horses we hardly know what we are doing half the time We hear Miss May Wirth the Wonder Rider of the World complaining bitterly that someone got in front of her when she was doing her particularly special stunt We wonder dubiously whether we were the guilty one Alas it is all over but the washing up Pat Valdo gentlest of hosts is taking off his trick hat with the water cistern concealed in it He has a clean towel ready for his grateful pupils The band is playing The Star Spangled Banner and all the clowns in various stages of undress stand at attention Our little peep into the gay good hearted courageous and extraordinary world of the circus is over Pat and his fellows will go on twice a day for the next six months It takes patience and endurance But it must be some consolation to know that nothing else in the world gives half as much pleasure to so many people HOUSE HUNTING Illustration A curious vertigo afflicts the mind of the house hunter In the first place it is sufficiently maddening to see the settled homes of other happier souls all apparently so firmly rooted in a warm soil of contentment while he floats an unhappy sea urchin in an ocean of indecision Furthermore how confusing to one who likes to feel himself somewhat securely established in a familiar spot the startling panorama of possible places in which he visualizes himself One day it is Great Neck the next it is Nutley one day Hollis the next Englewood one day Bronxville and then Garden City As the telephone rings or the suasive accents of friendly realtors expound the joys and glories of various regions his uneasy imagination flits hoppingly about the compass conceiving his now vanished household goods reassembled and implanted in these contrasting scenes Startling scenarios are filmed in his reeling mind while he listens over the tinkling wire to the enumeration of rooms baths pantries mortgages commuting schedules commodious closets open fireplaces and what not In the flash and coruscation of thought he has transported his helpless family to Yonkers or to Manhasset or to Forest Hills or wherever it may be and tries to focus and clarify his vision of what it would all be like He sees himself in a momentary close up commuting on the bland and persevering Erie or hastening hotly for a Liberty Street ferry or changing at Jamaica that mystic ritual of the Long Island brotherhood For an instant he is settled again with a modest hearth to return to at dusk and then the sorrowful compliment is paid him and he wonders how the impression got abroad that he is a millionaire There is one consoling aspect of his perplexity however and that is the friendly intercourse he has with high spirited envoys who represent real estate firms and take him voyaging to see properties in the country For these amiable souls he expresses his candid admiration Just as when one contemplates the existence of the doctors one knows one can never imagine them ill so one cannot conceive of the friendly realtor as in any wise distressed or grieved by the problems of the home There is something Olympian about them happy creatures They deal only in severely restricted tracts They have a stalwart and serene optimism Odd as it seems one of these friends told us that some people are so malign as to waste the time of real estate men by going out to look at houses in the country without the slightest intention of acting As a kind of amusement indeed A harmless way of passing an afternoon of getting perhaps a free motor ride and enjoying the novelty of seeing what other people s houses look like inside But our friend was convinced of one humble inquirer s passionate sincerity when he saw him gayly tread the ice floes of rustic Long Island in these days of slush and slither How do these friends of ours who see humanity in its most painful and distressing gesture i e when it is making up its mind to part with some money manage to retain their fine serenity and blitheness of spirit They have to contemplate all the pathetic struggles of mortality for what is more pathetic than the spectacle of a man trying to convince a real estate agent that he is not really a wealthy creature masking millions behind an eccentric pose of humility Our genial adviser Grenville Kleiser who has been showering his works upon us has classified all possible mental defects as follows a Too easy acquiescence b A mental attitude of contradiction c Undue skepticism d A dogmatic spirit e Lack of firmness of mind f A tendency to take extreme views g Love of novelty that is of what is foreign ancient unusual or mysterious All these serious weaknesses of judgment may be discerned in rapid rotation in the mind of the house hunter It would be only natural we think if the real estate man were to tell him to go away and study mister Kleiser s How to Build Mental Power In the meantime the vision of the home he had dreamed of becomes fainter and fainter in the seeker s mind like the air of a popular song he has heard whistled about the streets but does not know well enough to reproduce How he envies the light hearted robins whose house hunting consists merely in a gay flitting from twig to twig Yet even in his disturbance and nostalgia of spirit he comforts himself with the common consolation of his cronies Oh well one always finds something and thus in the words of good Sir Thomas Browne teaches his haggard and unreclaimed reason to stoop unto the lure of Faith LONG ISLAND REVISITED The anfractuosities of legal procedure having caused us to wonder whether there really were any such place as the home we have just bought we thought we would go out to Salamis L I and have a look at it Of course we knew it had been there a few weeks ago but the title companies do confuse one so We had been sitting for several days in the office of the most delightful lawyer in the world and if we did not fear that all the other harassed and beset creatures in these parts would instantly rush to lay their troubles in his shrewd and friendly bosom we would mention his name right here and do a little metrical pirouette in his honour we had been sitting there we say watching the proceedings without the slightest comprehension of what was happening It is really quite surprising let us add to find how many people are suddenly interested in some quiet innocent looking shebang nestling off in a quiet dingle in the country and how when it is to be sold they all bob up from their coverts in Flushing Brooklyn or Long Island City and have to be satisfied What floods of papers go crackling across the table drawn out from those mysterious brown cardboard wallets what quaint little jests pass between the emissaries of the title company and the legal counsel of the seller jests that seem to bear upon the infirmity of human affairs and cause the well wishing adventurer to wonder whether he had ever sufficiently pondered the strange tissue of mortal uncertainties that hides behind every earthly venture there was for instance occasional reference to a vanished gentleman who had once crossed the apparently innocent proscenium of our estate and had skipped leaving someone six thousand dollars to the bad this ingenious buccaneer was apparently the only one who did not have to be satisfied At any rate we thought that we who entered so modestly and obscurely into this whole affair being only the purchaser would finally satisfy ourself too by seeing if the property was still there Long Island and spring the conjunction gives us a particular thrill There are more beautiful places than the Long Island flats but it was there that we earned our first pay envelope and it was there that we first set up housekeeping and as long as we live the station platform of Jamaica will move us strangely not merely from one train to another but also inwardly There is no soil that receives a more brimming benison of sunshine than Long Island in late April As the train moves across the plain it seems to swim in a golden tide of light Billboards have been freshly painted and announce the glories of phonographs in screaming scarlets and purples or the number of miles that divide you from a Brooklyn department store Out at Hillside the stones that demarcate the territory of an old fashioned house are new and snowily whitewashed At Hollis the trees are a cloud of violent mustard yellow the colour of a safety matchbox label Magnolias if that is what they are are creamy pink Moving vans are bustling along the road Across the wide fields of Bellaire there is a view of the brown woods on the ridge turning a faint olive as the leaves gain strength Gus Wuest s roadhouse at Queens looks inviting as of old and the red brown of the copper beeches reminds one of the tall amber beakers Here is the little park by the station in Queens the flag on the staff the forsythia bushes the colour of scrambled eggs Is it the influence of the Belmont Park race track There seem to be in the smoking cars a number of men having the air of those accustomed to associate in a not unprofitable way with horses Here is one a handsome person who holds our eye as a bright flower might He wears a flowing overcoat of fleecy fawn colour and a derby of biscuit brown He has a gray suit and joyful socks of heavy wool yellow and black and green in patterned squares which are so vivid they seem cubes rather than squares He has a close cut dark moustache his shaven cheeks are a magnificent sirloin tint his chin splendidly blue by the ministration of the razor His shirt is blue with a stripe of sunrise pink and the collar to match He talks briskly and humorously to two others leaning over in the seat behind them As he argues we see his brown low shoe tapping on the floor One can almost see his foot think It pivots gently on the heel the toe wagging in air as he approaches the climax of each sentence Every time he drives home a point in his talk down comes the whole foot softly but firmly He relights his cigar in the professional manner not by inhaling as he applies the match but by holding the burned portion in the flame away from his mouth until it has caught His gold watch has a hunting case when he has examined it it shuts again with a fine rich snap which we can hear even above the noise of the car On this early morning train there are others voyaging for amusement Here are two golfing zealots puffing pipes and discussing with amazing persistence the minutiae of their sport Their remarks are addressed to a very fashionable looking curate whose manners are superb Whether he is going to play golf we know not at any rate he smiles mildly and politely to all they say Perhaps he is going round the course with them in the hope of springing some ecclesiastical strategy while they are softened and chastened by the glee of the game The name of their Maker it is only fair to suspect has more than once been mentioned on the putting green and if it should slip out the curate will seize the cue and develop it In the meantime one of the enthusiasts while his companion is silenced in the act of lighting his pipe is explaining to the cloth how his friend plays golf I ll tell you how he plays he says Imagine him sitting down in a low chair and swinging a club Then take the chair away and he still keeps the same position That s what he looks like when he drives The curate smiles at this and prepares his face to smile with equal gentleness when the other retorts After Floral Park the prospect becomes more plainly rural The Mineola trolley zooms along between wide fields of tilled brown earth There is an occasional cow here and there a really old barn and farmhouse standing incongruously among the settlements of modern kindling wood cottages and a mysterious agricultural engine at work with a spinning fly wheel Against the bright horizon stand the profiles of Garden City the thin cathedral spire the bulk of saint Paul s school the white cupola of the hotel The tree lined vistas of Mineola are placidly simmering in the morning sun A white dog with erect and curly tail trots very purposefully round the corner of the First National Bank We think that we see the spreading leaves of some rhubarb plants in a garden and there are some of those to us very enigmatic as we are no gardener little glass window frames set in the soil as though a whole house shamed by the rent the owner wanted to charge had sunk out of sight leaving only a skylight As we leave East Williston we approach more interesting country with a semblance of hills and wooded thickets still brownly tapestried with the dry funeral of last year s leaves On the trees the new foliage sways in little clusters catching the light like the wings of perching green butterflies Some of the buds are a coppery green some a burning red but the prevailing colour is the characteristic sulphur yellow of early spring And now we are set down at Salamis where the first and most surprising impression is of the unexpected abundance of competitive taxicabs Having reached the terminus of our space we can only add that we found our estate still there and there are a few stalks of rhubarb surviving from an earlier plantation ON BEING IN A HURRY New York is a perplexing city to loaf in Walt Whitman if he came back to Mannahatta would soon get brain fever During the middle hours of the day at any rate it is almost impossible to idle with the proper spirit and completeness There is a prevailing bustle and skirmish that exerts a compulsion as President Wilson would say The air is electric and nervous We have often tried to dawdle gently about the neighbourhood of the City Hall in the lunch hour to let the general form and spirit of that clearing among the cliffs sink into our mind so that we could get some picture of it We have sat under a big brown umbrella to have our shoes shined when we had nothing more important to do than go to the doughnut foundry on Park Row and try some of those delectable combinations of foods they have there such as sponge cake with whipped cream and chocolate fudge And in a few seconds we have found ourself getting all stirred up and crying loudly to the artist that we only wanted a once over as we had an important appointment You have to put a very heavy brake on your spirit in downtown New York or you find yourself dashing about in a prickle of excitement gloriously happy just to be in a hurry without particularly caring whither you are hastening or why Illustration One of the odd things about being in a hurry is that it seems so fiercely important when you yourself are the hurrier and so comically ludicrous when it is someone else We see our friend Artaxerxes scorching up Church Street and we scream with laughter at him because we know perfectly well that there is absolutely not one of his affairs important enough to cause him to buzz along like that We look after him with a sort of mild and affectionate pity for a deluded creature who thinks that his concerns are of such glorious magnitude And then a few hours later we find ourself on a subway car with only ten minutes to catch the train for Salamis at Atlantic Avenue And what is our state of mind We stand gritting our teeth we are too excited to sit even if there were a seat and holding our watch The whole train it seems to us is occupied by invalids tottering souls and lumbago cripples who creep off at the stations as though five seconds made not the slightest difference We glare and fume and could gladly see them all maced in sunder with battle axes Nothing it seems to us could soothe our bitter hunger for haste but to have a brilliant Lexington Avenue express draw up at the platform with not a soul in it Out would step a polite guard looking at his watch You want to catch a train at five twenty seven he asks Yes sir yes sir step aboard All the other competitors are beaten back with knotted thongs and we are ushered to a seat The bells go chiming in quick sequence up the length of the train and we are off at top speed flying wildly past massed platforms of indignant people We draw up at Atlantic Avenue and the solitary passenger somewhat appeased steps off Compliments of the Interborough sir says the guard The commuter urgently posting toward the five twenty seven misses the finest flavour of the city s life for it is in the two or three hours after office work is over that the town is at her best What a spry and smiling mood is shown along the pavements particularly on these clear warm evenings when the dropping sun pours a glowing tide of soft rosy light along the cross town streets There is a cool lightness in the air restaurants are not yet crowded it is let us say a little after six and beside snowy tablecloths the waiters stand indulgently with folded arms Everybody seems in a blithe and spirited humour Work is over for the day and now what shall we do for amusement This is the very peak of living it seems to us as we sally cheerily along the street It is like the beginning of an O Henry story The streets are fluttering with beautiful women light summer frocks are twinkling in the busy frolic air Oh to be turned loose at the corner of Broadway and Thirty second Street at six fifteen o clock of a June evening with nothing to do but follow the smile of adventure to the utmost Thirty second we might add is our favourite street in New York It saddens us to think that the old boarding house on the corner of Madison Avenue is vanished now and all those quaint and humorous persons dispersed We can still remember the creak of the long stairs and the clink of a broken slab in the tiled flooring of the hall as one walked down to the dining room Affection for any particular street largely depends on the associations it has accumulated in one s mind For several years most of our adventures in New York centred round Thirty second Street but its physique has changed so much lately that it has lost some of its appeal We remember an old stone yard that used to stand where the Pennsylvania Hotel is now a queer jumbled collection of odd carvings and relics At the front door there was a bust of Pan on a tall pedestal which used to face us with a queer crooked grin twice a day morning and evening We had a great affection for that effigy and even wrote a little piece about him in one of the papers for which we got about four dollars at a time when it was considerably needed We used to say to ourself that some day when we had a home in the country we would buy Pan and set him in a Long Island garden where he would feel more at home than in the dusty winds of Thirty second Street Time went on and we disappeared from our old haunts and when we came back Pan had vanished too You may imagine our pleasure when we found him again the other day standing in front of a chop house on Forty fourth Street But one great addition to the delights of the Thirty second Street region is the new and shining white tunnel that leads one from the Penn Station subway platform right into the heart of what used we think to be called Greeley Square It is so dazzling and candid in its new tiling that it seems rather like a vast hospital corridor One emerges through the Hudson Tube station and perhaps sets one s course for a little restaurant on Thirty fifth Street which always holds first place in our affection It is somewhat declined from its former estate for the upper floors where the violent orchestra was and the smiling little dandruffian used to sing solos when the evening grew glorious are now rented to a feather and ostrich plume factory But the old basement is still there much the same in essentials by which we mean the pickled beet appetizers the minestrone soup the delicious soft bread with its brittle crust and the thick slices of rather pale roast beef swimming in thin pinkish gravy And the three old French waiters hardened in long experience of the frailties of mortality smile to see a former friend One grinning upon us rather bashfully recalls the time when there was a hilarious Oriental wedding celebrating in a private room upstairs and two young men insisted on going in to dance with the bride He has forgiven various pranks we can see though he was wont to be outraged at the time Getting very stout he says beaming down at us You weigh a hundred pounds more than you used to This is not merely cruel it is untrue We refrain from retorting on the growth of his bald spot CONFESSIONS OF A HUMAN GLOBULE As a matter of fact we find the evening subway jam very restful Being neatly rounded in contour with just a gentle bulge around the equatorial transit we have devised a very satisfactory system We make for the most crowded car we can find and having buffeted our way in we are perfectly serene Once properly wedged and provided no one in the immediate neighbourhood is doing anything with any garlic it is well to avoid the vestibules if one is squeamish in that particular we lift our feet off the floor tuck them into the tail of our overcoat and remain blissfully suspended in midair from Chambers Street to Ninety sixth The pressure of our fellow passengers powerfully impinging upon the globular perimeter we spoke of keeps us safely elevated above the floor We have had some leather stirrups sewed into the bottom of our overcoat in which we slip our feet to keep them from dangling uncomfortably Another feature of our technique is that we always go into the car with our arms raised and crossed neatly on our chest so that they will not be caught and pinioned to our flanks In that position once we are gently nested among the elastic mass of genial humanity it is easy to draw out from our waistcoat pocket our copy of Boethius s Consolations of Philosophy and really get in a little mental improvement Or if we have forgotten the book we gently droop our head into our overcoat collar lay it softly against the shoulder of the tall man who is always handy and pass into a tranquil nescience The subway is a great consolation to the philosopher if he knows how to make the most of it Think how many people one encounters and never sees again NOTES ON A FIFTH AVENUE BUS Illustration Far down the valley of the Avenue the traffic lights wink in unison green yellow red changing their colours with well drilled promptness It is cold a great wind flaps and tangles the flags the tops of the buses are almost empty That brisk April air seems somehow in key with the mood of the Avenue hard plangent glittering intensely material It is a proud exultant exhilarating street it fills the mind with strange liveliness A magnificent pomp of humanity what a flux of lacquered motors what a twinkling of spats along the pavements On what other of the world s great highways would one find churches named for the material of which they are built the Brick Church the Marble Church It is not a street for loitering there is an eager ambitious humour in its blood one walks fast revolving schemes of worldly dominion Only on the terrace in front of the Public Library is there any temptation for tarrying and consideration There one may pause and study the inscription But Above All Things Truth Beareth Away the Victory of course the true eloquence of the words lies in the But Much reason for that But implying a previous contradiction on the Avenue s part Sometimes pacing vigorously in that river of lovely pride and fascination one might have suspected that other things bore away the victory spats diamond necklaces smoky blue furs nestling under lovely chins Hullo here is a sign Headquarters of the Save New York Committee Hum Save from what There was a time when the great charm of New York lay in the fact that it didn t want to be saved Who is it that the lions in front of the Public Library remind us of We have so often pondered Let s see the long slanting brow the head thrown back the haughty and yet genial abstraction to be sure it s Vachel Lindsay We defy the most resolute philosopher to pass along the giddy enticing brilliant vanity of that superb promenade and not be just a little moved by worldly temptation SUNDAY MORNING It was a soft calm morning of sunshine and placid air Clear and cool it was a Herbert Spencer of a day as H G Wells once remarked The vista of West Ninety eighth Street that engaging alcove in the city s enormous life was all freshness and kempt tranquillity from the gray roof of the old training ship at the river side up to the tall red spire near Columbus Avenue This pinnacle which ripens to a fine claret colour when suffused with sunset we had presumed to be a church tower but were surprised on exploration to find it a standpipe of some sort connected with the Croton water system Sunday morning in this neighbourhood has its own distinct character There is a certain air of luxurious ease in the picture One has a feeling that in those tall apartment houses there are a great many ladies taking breakfast in negligee They are wearing if one may trust the shop windows along Broadway boudoir caps and mules Mules like their namesakes in the animal world are hybrid things the offspring of a dancing pump and a bedroom slipper They are distinctly futile but no matter no matter Wearing mules however is not a mere vanity it is a form of physical culture for these skimpish little things are always disappearing under the bed and crawling after them keeps one slender Again we say no matter This is no concern of ours Illustration Near Broadway a prosperous and opulently tailored costume emerges from an apartment house cutaway coat striped trousers very long pointed patent leather shoes with lilac cloth tops Within this gear we presently see is a human being in the highest spirits All set he says joining a group of similars waiting by a shining limousine Among these one lady of magnificently millinered aspect and a smallish man in very new and shiny riding boots of which he is grandly conscious There are introductions mister Goldstone meet missus Silverware They are met There is a flashing of eyes Three or four silk hats simultaneously leap into the shining air are flourished and replaced The observer is aware of the prodigious gayety and excitement of life All climb into the car and roll away down Broadway All save the little man in riding boots He is left on the sidewalk gallantly waving his hand Come we think he is going riding A satiny charger waits somewhere round the corner We will follow and see He slaps his hunting crop against his glorious boots which are the hue of quebracho wood No to our chagrin he descends into the subway We sit on the shoeshining stand on Ninety sixth Street looking over the Sunday papers Very odd in the adjoining chairs men are busily engaged polishing shoes that have nobody in them not visibly at any rate Perhaps Sir Oliver is right after all While we are not watching the beaming Italian has inserted a new pair of laces for us Long afterward at bedtime we find that he has threaded them in that unique way known only to shoe merchants and polishers by which every time they are tied and untied one end of the lace gets longer and the other shorter Life is full of needless complexities We descend the hill Already it is nine forty five A M men are playing tennis on the courts at the corner of West End Avenue A great wagon crammed with scarlet sides of beef comes stumbling up the hill drawn with difficulty by five horses When we get down to the Ninety Sixth Street pier we see the barque Windrush lying near by with the airy triangles of her rigging pencilled against the sky and look amorously on the gentle curve of her strakes if that is what they are We feel that it would be a fine thing to be off soundings greeting the bounding billow not to say the bar room steward and yet being a cautious soul of reservations all compact we must admit that about the time we got abreast of New Dorp we would be homesick for our favourite subway station The pier despite its deposit of filth bales of old shoes reeking barrels scows of rubbish sodden papers boxes of broken bottles and a thick paste of dust and ash powder everywhere is a happy lounging ground for a few idlers on Sunday morning A large cargo steamer the Eclipse lay at the wharf standing very high out of the water Three small boys were watching a peevish old man tending his fishing lines fastened to wires with little bells on them What do you catch here we said Just then one of the little bells gave a cracked tinkle and the angler pulled up a small fish wriggling briskly about three inches long This seemed to anger him He seemed to consider himself in some way humiliated by the incident He grunted One of the small boys was tactful Oh gee he said Sometimes you catch fish that long indicating a length which began at about a yard and diminished to about eighteen inches as he meditated I don t know what kind they are he said They re not trouts but some other kind of fish This started the topic of relative sizes always fascinating to small boys That s a pretty big boat said one craning up at the tall stem of the Eclipse Oh gee that ain t big said another You ought to see some of the Cunard boats the Olympic or the Baltic On Riverside Drive horseback riders were cantering down the bridlepath returning from early outings The squirrels already grossly overfed were brooding languidly that another day of excessive peanuts was at hand Behind a rapidly spinning limousine pedalled a grotesquely humped bicyclist using the car as a pacemaker He throbbed fiercely just behind the spare tire with his face bent down into a rich travelling cloud of gasoline exhaust An odd way of enjoying one s self Children were coming out in troops with their nurses for the morning air Here was a little boy with a sailor hat and on the band a gilt legend that was new to us Instead of the usual naval slogan it simply said Democracy This interested us as later in the day we saw another near the goldfish pond in Central Park Behind the cashier s grill of a Broadway drug store the good tempered young lady was reading Zane Grey I love his books she said but they make me want to break loose and go out West VENISON PASTY Illustration The good old days are gone we have been frequently and authoritatively assured and yet sitting in an agreeable public on William Street where the bright eye of our friend Harold Phillips discerned venison pasty on the menu and listening to a seafaring man describe a recent blow off Hatteras during which he stood four hours up to his waist in the bilges and watching our five jocund companions dismiss no less than twenty one beakers of cider we felt no envy whatever for the ancients of the Mermaid Tavern After venison pasty and feeling somewhat in the mood of Robin Hood and Friar Tuck we set off with our friend Endymion for a stroll through the wilderness The first adventure of note that we encountered was the curb market on Broad Street where we stood entranced at the merry antics of the brokers This however is a spectacle that no layman can long contemplate and still deem himself sane That sea of flickering fingers the hubbub of hoarse cries and the enigmatic gestures of youths framed in the open windows gave an impression of something fierce and perilous happening Endymion still deeming himself in Sherwood Forest insisted that this was the abode of the Sheriff of Nottingham Stout deeds are toward he cried These villain wights have a damsel imprisoned in yonder keep With difficulty we restrained him from pressing to the rescue of the lady for indeed we could see her comely enough appearing now and then at one of the windows and anon disappearing abashed at the wild throng But gradually we realized that no such dire matter was being transacted for the knights despite occasional spasms of hot gesticulating fury were mild and meant her no ill One after a sudden flux of business concerning it seemed eighty five shares of Arizona Copper fell suddenly placid and was eating chocolate ice cream from a small paper plate Young gallants wearing hats trimmed with variegated brightly coloured stuffs the favours of their ladies we doubted not were conferring together but without passion or rancour We have a compact with our friend Endymion that as soon as either of us spends money for anything not strictly necessary he must straightway return to the office After leaving the curb market we found ourselves in a basement bookshop on Broadway and here Endymion fell afoul of a copy of Thomas Hardy s Wessex Poems illustrated by the author Piteously he tried to persuade us that it was a matter of professional advancement to him to have this book moreover he said he had just won five dollars at faro or some such hazard so that he was not really spending money at all but we countered all his sophisms with slogging rhetoric He bought the book and so had to return to the office in disgrace We fared further having a mind to revisit the old Eastern Hotel down by the South Ferry of whose cool and dusky bar room we had pleasant memories in times gone by but we found to our distress that this also like many more of our familiar landmarks is a prey to the house wrecker and is on its way to become an office building On our way back up Broadway it occurred to us to revisit what we have long considered one of the most impressive temples in our acquaintance the lobby of the Telephone and Telegraph Building on Dey Street Here passing by the enticing little terrace with brocaded chairs and soft lights where two gracious ladies sit to interview aspiring telephone debutantes one stands in a dim golden glow among great fluted pillars and bowls of softly burning radiance swung like censers by long chains Occasionally there is an airy flutter a bell clangs bronze doors slide apart and an elevator appears in charge of a chastely uniformed priestess Lights flash up over this dark little cave which stands invitingly open UP they say LOCAL one thirteen The door sill of the cave shines with a row of golden beads small lights to guide the foot it is irresistible There is an upward impulse about the whole place the light blossoms upward from the hanging translucent shells people step gently in the doors close they are not seen again It is the temple of the great American religion Going Up The shining gold stars in the ceiling draw the eye aloft The temptation is too great We step into the little bronze crypt say Thirteen at a venture and are borne softly and fluently up Then of course we have to come down again past the wagons of spring onions on Fulton Street and back to the office GRAND AVENUE BROOKLYN We have always been a strong partisan of Brooklyn and when we found ourself in company with Titania set down in the middle of a golden afternoon with the vista of Grand Avenue before us we felt highly elated Just how these two wayfarers chanced to be deposited in that quiet serenity so far from their customary concerns is not part of the narrative There are regions of Brooklyn we have always felt that are too good to be real Placid stretches of streets with baby carriages simmering in the sun solid and comfortable brownstone houses exhaling a prosperous condition of life tranquil old fashioned apothecaries shops without soda fountains where one peers in and sees only a solitary customer turning over the pages of a telephone book It is all rather like a chapter from a story and reminds us of a passage in The Dynamiter where some untroubled faubourgs of London are winningly described Titania was wearing a little black hat with green feathers She looked her best and was not unaware of it Our general plan when destiny suddenly plumps us into the heart of Brooklyn is to make our way toward Fulton Street which is a kind of life line Once on Fulton Street we know our way Moreover Fulton Street has admirable second hand bookshops Nor do we ever forget that it was at the corner of Fulton and Cranberry streets that Leaves of Grass was set up in the spring of eighteen fifty five Walt doing a good deal of the work himself The only difficulty about getting to Fulton Street is that people will give you such contradictory instruction One will tell you to go this way the next will point in the opposite direction It is as though Brooklynites suspect the presence of a stranger and do not wish their sacred secrets to be discovered There is a deep mysterious freemasonry among the residents of this genial borough At the corner of Grand and Greene avenues we thought it well to ask our way A lady was standing on the corner lost in pleasant drowse April sunshine shimmered all about trees were bustling into leaf a wagonload of bananas stood by the curb and the huckster sang a gay persuasive madrigal We approached the lady and Titania spoke gently Can you tell me The lady screamed and leaped round in horror her face stricken with fearful panic She gasped and tottered We felt guilty and cruel We were not meditating an attack we said but just wanted to ask you the way to Fulton Street Perhaps the poor soul s nerves were unstrung for she gave us instruction that we felt instinctively to be wrong Had we gone as she said we now see by studying the map we would have debouched into Wallabout Bay But undoubtedly it was the protective instinct of the Brooklynite on guard before strangers Is there some terrific secret in Brooklyn that all residents know about but which must never be revealed to outsiders Making a mental note not to speak too suddenly at the next encounter the two cheerful derelicts drifted along the sunny coast of Grand Avenue A shining and passionless peace presided over the streets A gentle clop clop of hooves came trotting down the way here was a man driving a white horse in a neat rubber tired buggy without a top He leaned back and smiled to himself as he drove along Life did not seem to be the same desperate venture it appears round about Broadway and Wall Street Who can describe the settled amiability of those rows of considerable brown houses with their heavy oak doors their pots of daisies on the stoop their clear window panes and now and then the face of a benignant grandmother peeping from behind lace curtains The secret of Brooklyn perhaps is contentment and its cautious residents do not want the rest of us to know too much about it lest we all flock over there in swarms We then came to the bustle of Fulton Street which deserves a book in itself Some day we want to revisit a certain section of Fulton Street where if we remember rightly a rotisserie and a certain bookstore conspire to make one of the pleasantest haunts in our experience We don t know exactly what the secret of Brooklyn may be but we are going to spend some time over there this spring and lie in wait for it ON WAITING FOR THE CURTAIN TO GO UP Illustration We often wonder whether people are really as human as they appear or is it only our imagination Everybody we suggest thinks of others as being excessively human with all the frailties and crotchets appertaining to that curious condition But each of us also we are not dogmatic on this matter seems to regard himself as existing on a detached plane of observation exempt save in moments of vivid crisis from the strange whims of humanity en masse For example consider the demeanour of people at a theatre while waiting for the curtain to go up To note the censoriousness with which they study each other one concludes that each deems himself herself singularly blessed as the repository of human correctness Incidentally why is it that one gets so thirsty at the theatre We never get thirsty at the movies or not nearly so thirsty The other evening we drank seven paper cups full of water in the intermissions of a four act play The presence of people sitting behind one is the reason we fancy for a great deal of the queer antics that take place while one is waiting for the curtain to rise particularly when it is twenty minutes late in going up as it was at a certain theatre the other evening People behind one have a horrible advantage One knows that they can hear everything you say unless you whisper it in a furtive manner which makes them suspect things far worse than any one would be likely to say in a Philadelphia theatre except of course on the stage The fact that you know they can overhear you and intend to do so leads one on to make the most outrageous cynical and scoffish remarks particularly to denounce with fury a play that you may be enjoying quite passably well All over the house you will hear after the first act men saying to their accompanying damsels How outrageously clumsy that act was I can t conceive how the director let it get by Now they only say this because they think it will make the people behind feel ashamed for having enjoyed such a botch But does it The people in the row behind immediately begin to praise the play vigorously for the benefit of the people behind them and in a minute you see the amusing spectacle of the theatre cheering and damning by alternate rows Here and there you will see a lady whispering something to her escort and will notice how ladies always look backward over a lily shoulder while whispering They want to see what effect this whispering will have on the people behind There is a deep rooted feud between every two rows in an audience The front row having nobody to hate except possibly the actors take it out in speculating why on earth anybody can want to sit in the boxes where they can see nothing What the boxes think about we are not sure We never sat in a box except at a burlicue And then a complete essay might be written on the ads in the theatre program what high spirited ads they are How full of the savour and luxurious tang of the beau monde How they insist on saying specialite instead of specialty Well all we meant to say when we began was the heroine was Only Fair by which we mean to say she was beautiful and nothing else MUSINGS OF JOHN MISTLETOE It was old John Mistletoe we think in his Book of Deplorable Facts discussing the congenial topic of Going to Bed or was it in his essay on The Concinnity of Washerwomen said something like this Life passes by with deplorable rapidity Post commutatorem sedet horologium terrificum behind the commuter rideth the alarm clock no sooner hath he attained to the office than it is time for lunch no sooner hath lunch been dispatched than it is time to sign those dictated letters no sooner this accomplished tis time to hasten trainward The essential thing then is not to let one s experiences flow irrevocably past like a river but to clutch and hold them thoughtfully long enough to examine and in a manner sieve them to halt them in the mind for meditation The relentless fluidity of life the ease with which it vanisheth down the channel of the days is the problem the thoughtful man must deal with The urgent necessity is to dam the stream here and there so we can go swimming in it Time is a breedy creature the minutes propagate hours the hours beget days the days raise huge families of months and before we know it we are crowded out of this sweet life by mere surplus of Time s offspring This is a brutish Malthusianism which must be adamantly countered Therefore it is my counsel that every man ere he retire for the night and commit his intellect to inscrutable nothingness do let it hop abroad for a little freedom Life must be taken with a grain of saltation let the spirit dance a measure or two ere it collapse For this purpose it is my pleasure about the hour of midnight to draw a jug of cider from the keg and a book from the shelf I choose some volume ill written and stupidly conceived to set me in conceit with myself I read a few pages and then apply myself to the composition of verses These done I burn them and go to bed with a cheerful spirit THE WORLD S MOST FAMOUS ORATION Address to An Employer Upon Demanding a Raise or The Battle of Manila Envelopes As

were too indolent to do so The sort of thing we had in mind to write would have been exceedingly persuasive We intended to discourse a little in favour of a greater appreciation of Indolence as a benign factor in human affairs It is our observation that every time we get into trouble it is due to not having been lazy enough Unhappily we were born with a certain fund of energy We have been hustling about for a number of years now and it doesn t seem to get us anything but tribulation Henceforward we are going to make a determined effort to be more languid and demure It is the bustling man who always gets put on committees who is asked to solve the problems of other people and neglect his own The man who is really thoroughly and philosophically slothful is the only thoroughly happy man It is the happy man who benefits the world The conclusion is inescapable We remember a saying about the meek inheriting the earth The truly meek man is the lazy man He is too modest to believe that any ferment and hubbub of his can ameliorate the earth or assuage the perplexities of humanity O Henry said once that one should be careful to distinguish laziness from dignified repose Alas that was a mere quibble Laziness is always dignified it is always reposeful Philosophical laziness we mean The kind of laziness that is based upon a carefully reasoned analysis of experience Acquired laziness We have no respect for those who were born lazy it is like being born a millionaire they cannot appreciate their bliss It is the man who has hammered his laziness out of the stubborn material of life for whom we chant praise and allelulia The laziest man we know we do not like to mention his name as the brutal world does not yet recognize sloth at its community value is one of the greatest poets in this country one of the keenest satirists one of the most rectilinear thinkers He began life in the customary hustling way He was always too busy to enjoy himself He became surrounded by eager people who came to him to solve their problems It s a queer thing he said sadly no one ever comes to me asking for help in solving my problems Finally the light broke upon him He stopped answering letters buying lunches for casual friends and visitors from out of town he stopped lending money to old college pals and frittering his time away on all the useless minor matters that pester the good natured He sat down in a secluded cafe with his cheek against a seidel of dark beer and began to caress the universe with his intellect The most damning argument against the Germans is that they were not lazy enough In the middle of Europe a thoroughly disillusioned indolent and delightful old continent the Germans were a dangerous mass of energy and bumptious push If the Germans had been as lazy as indifferent and as righteously laissez fairish as their neighbours the world would have been spared a great deal People respect laziness If you once get a reputation for complete immovable and reckless indolence the world will leave you to your own thoughts which are generally rather interesting Doctor Johnson who was one of the world s great philosophers was lazy Only yesterday our friend the Caliph showed us an extraordinarily interesting thing It was a little leather bound notebook in which Boswell jotted down memoranda of his talks with the old doctor These notes he afterward worked up into the immortal Biography And lo and behold what was the very first entry in this treasured little relic Doctor Johnson told me in going to Ilam from Ashbourne twenty two September seventeen seventy seven that the way the plan of his Dictionary came to be addressed to Lord Chesterfield was this He had neglected to write it by the time appointed Dodsley suggested a desire to have it addressed to Lord C mister J laid hold of this as an excuse for delay that it might be better done perhaps and let Dodsley have his desire mister Johnson said to his friend Doctor Bathurst Now if any good comes of my addressing to Lord Chesterfield it will be ascribed to deep policy and address when in fact it was only a casual excuse for laziness Thus we see that it was sheer laziness that led to the greatest triumph of Doctor Johnson s life the noble and memorable letter to Chesterfield in seventeen seventy five Mind your business is a good counsel but mind your idleness also It s a tragic thing to make a business of your mind Save your mind to amuse yourself with The lazy man does not stand in the way of progress When he sees progress roaring down upon him he steps nimbly out of the way The lazy man doesn t in the vulgar phrase pass the buck He lets the buck pass him We have always secretly envied our lazy friends Now we are going to join them We have burned our boats or our bridges or whatever it is that one burns on the eve of a momentous decision Writing on this congenial topic has roused us up to quite a pitch of enthusiasm and energy TEACHING THE PRINCE TO TAKE NOTES Illustration The Prince of Wales probably suffers severely during his tours abroad for he is a shy youth but he also makes many friends for he is a delightfully simple and agreeable person When we used to see him he looked a good deal like the traditional prince of the fairy tales for he was a slender boy with yellow hair and blue eyes and a quick pink blush And we feel toward him the friendly sense of superiority that the college alumnus always feels toward the man who was a freshman when he himself was a senior for the prince and ourself stood in that relation a few years ago at a certain haunt of letters There was a course of lectures on history that we were to attend It was a popular course and the attendance was large Arriving late at the first lecture the room was packed and we could see from the door that there was only one empty seat This happened to be in the very front row and wondering how it was that so desirable a place had not been seized we hastened to it The lecturer was a swift talker and we fell to taking notes busily Not for some minutes did we have a chance to scrutinize our surroundings We then saw that in the adjoining chair sat the prince and surmised that no one had wanted to take the chair for fear of being twitted by his companions for a supposed desire to hobnob with royalty If we remember correctly it was the prince s first term of college life The task of taking notes from a rapid fire lecturer was plainly one to which he was not accustomed and as he wrestled with his notebook we could see that he had not learned the art of considering the lecturer s remarks and putting down only the gist of them in some abbreviated system of his own as every experienced student learns Grant Robertson the well known historian was lecturing on English constitutional documents and his swift and informal utterance was perfectly easy to summarize if one knew how to get down the important points and neglect the rest But the unhappy prince desperately eager to do the right thing in this new experience was trying to write down every word If for instance mister Robertson said in a humorous aside Henry VIII was a sinful old man with a hobby of becoming a widower the experienced listener would jot down something like this H eight self made widower But we could see that the prince was laboriously copying out the sentence in full And naturally by the end of a few paragraphs he was hopelessly behind But he scribbled away industriously doing his best He realized however that he had not quite got the hang of the thing and at the end of the lecture he turned to us with most agreeable bashfulness and asked if we would lend him our notebook so that he could get down the points that he had missed We did so and briefly explained our own system of abbreviating We noticed that in succeeding sessions our royal neighbour did very much better learning in some measure to discriminate between what was advisable to note down and what was mere explanatory matter or persiflage on the part of the lecturer But if we must be candid we would not recommend him as a newspaper reporter And indeed the line of work to which he has been called does not require quite as intense concentration as that of a cub on what Philip Gibbs calls The Street of Adventure No one could come in contact with the prince without liking him for his bashful gentle and teachable nature is very winning We remember with a certain amusement the time that Grant Robertson got off one of his annual gags to the effect that according to the principle of strict legitimacy there were in Europe several hundred we forget the figure people with a greater right to the British throne than the family at present occupying it The roomful of students roared with genial mirth and the unhappy prince blushed in a way that young girls used to in the good old days of three piece bathing suits A CITY NOTEBOOK Philadelphia It would be hard to find a more lovely spot in the flush of a summer sunset than Wister Woods Old residents of the neighbourhood say that the trees are not what they were fifteen and twenty years ago the chestnuts have died off even some of the tall tulip poplars are a little bald at the top and one was recently felled by a gale But still that quiet plateau stands in a serene hush flooded with rich orange glow on a warm evening The hollyhocks in the back gardens of Rubicam Street are scarlet and Swiss cheese coloured and black and looking across the railroad ravine one sees crypts and aisles of green as though in the heart of some cathedral of the great woods Belfield Avenue which bends through the valley in a curve of warm thick yellow dust will some day be boulevarded into a spick and span highway for motors But now it lies little trafficked and one might prefer to have it so for in the stillness of the evening the birds are eloquent The thrushes of Wister Woods which have been immortalized by T A Daly in perhaps the loveliest poem ever written in Philadelphia flute and whistle their tantalizing note while the song sparrow echoes them with his confident challenging call Down behind the dusty sumac shrubbery lies the little blue green cottage said to have been used by Benjamin West as a studio In a meadow beside the road two cows were grazing in the blue shadow of overhanging woodland Illustration Over the road leans a flat outcrop of stone known locally as The Bum s Rock An antique philosopher of those parts assured the wayfarer that it is named for a romantic vagabond who perished there by the explosion of a can of Bohemian goulash which he was heating over a small fire of sticks but one doubts the tale Our own conjecture is that it is named for Jacob Boehm the oldtime brewer of Germantown who predicted in his chronicles that the world would come to an end in July nineteen nineteen From his point of view he was not so far wrong Above Boehm s Rock in a grassy level among the trees a merry little circle of young ladies was sitting round a picnic supper The twilight grew darker and fireflies began to twinkle In the steep curve of the Cinder and Bloodshot between Fisher s and Wister stations a cheerful train rumbled with its engine running backward just like a country local Its bright shaft of light wavered among the tall tree trunks One would not imagine that it was less than six miles to the City Hall A quarter to one A M and a hot silent night As one walks up Chestnut Street a distant roaring is heard which rapidly grows louder The sound has a note of terrifying menace Then careering down the almost deserted highway comes a huge water tank throbbing like an airplane A creamy sheet of water shot out at high pressure floods the street on each side dashing up on the pavements A knot of belated revellers in front of the Adelphia Hotel standing in mid street to discuss ways and means of getting home skip nimbly to one side the ladies lifting up their dresses with shrill squeaks of alarm as the water splashes round them Pedestrians plodding quietly up the street cower fearfully against the buildings while a fine mist envelops them After the tank comes more leisurely a squad of brooms The street is dripping every sewer opening clucks and gurgles with the falling water There is something unbelievably humorous in the way that roaring Niagara of water dashes madly down the silent street There is a note of irony in it too for the depressed enthusiasts who have been sitting all evening in a restaurant over lemonade and ginger ale Perhaps the chauffeur is a prohibitionist gone mad While eating half a dozen doughnuts in a Broad Street lunchroom at one o clock in the morning we mused happily about our friends all tucked away in bed sound asleep There is one in particular on whom we thought with serene pleasure It was charming to think of that delightful argumentative contradictory volatile person his active mind stilled in the admirable reticence of slumber He so endlessly speculatory so full of imaginative enthusiasms and riotous intuitions and troubled zeals concerning humanity lost in a beneficent swoon of unconsciousness We could not just say why but we broke into chuckles to think of him lying there not denying any of our statements absolutely and positively saying nothing To have one s friends asleep now and then is very refreshing Off Walnut Street below Fifth and just east of the window where that perfectly lovely damsel sits operating an adding machine why is it by the way that the girls who run adding machines are always so marvellously fair Is there some secret virtue in the process of adding that makes one lovely We feel sure that a subtracting engine would not have that subtle beautifying effect just below Fifth Street we started to say there runs a little alley called we believe De Silver Court It is a sombre little channel between high walls and barred windows but it is a retreat we recommend highly to hay fever sufferers For in one of the buildings adjoining there seems to be a warehouse of some company that makes an aromatic disinfector Wandering in there by chance we stood delighted at the sweet medicinal savour that was wafted on the air It had a most cheering effect upon our emunctory woes and we lingered so long in a meditative and healing ecstasy that young women immured in the basement of the aromatic warehouse began to peer upward from the barred windows of their basement and squeak with astonished and nervous mirth We blew a loud salute and moved away We entered a lunchroom on Broad Street for our favourite breakfast of coffee and a pair of crullers It was strangely early and only a few of the flat arm chairs were occupied After dispatching the rations we carefully filled our pipe With us we had a copy of an agreeable book The Calamities and Quarrels of Authors It occurred to us that here in the brisk serenity of the morning would be a charming opportunity for a five minute smoke and five pages of reading before attacking the ardours and endurances of the day Lovingly we applied the match to the fuel We began to read Of all the sorrows in which the female character may participate there are few more affecting than those of an authoress Illustration A stern white coated official came over to us and tapped us on the shoulder There s a sign behind you he said We looked guiltily and saw POSITIVELY NO SMOKING The cocoateria on Eighth Street closes at one A M Between twelve thirty and closing time it is full of busy eaters mostly the night shift from the Chestnut Street newspaper offices and printing and engraving firms in the neighbourhood Ham and eggs blossom merrily The white coated waiters move in swift stern circuit Griddle cakes bake with amazing swiftness toward the stroke of one Little dishes of baked beans stand hot and ready in the steam chest The waiter punches your check as he brings your frankfurters and coffee He adds another perforation when you get your ice cream Then he comes back and punches it again Here you cry let it alone and stop bullying it Sorry brother he says I forgot that peach cream was fifteen cents One o clock They lock the door and turn out the little gas jet where smokers light up As the tables empty the chairs are stacked up on top And if it is a clear warm evening the customers smoke a final weed along the Chestnut Street doorsteps talking together in a cheery undertone No man has ever started upon a new cheque book without a few sourly solemn thoughts In the humble waters of finance wherein we paddle we find that a book of fifty cheques lasts us about four months allowing for two or three duds when we start to make out a foil payable to bearer self and decide to renounce that worthy ambition and make it out to the gas company instead It occurs to us that if Bunyan had been writing Pilgrim s Progress nowadays instead of making Christian encounter lions in the path he would have substituted gas meters particularly the quarter in the slot kind that one finds in a seaside cottage However Four months is quite a long time It may be weak of us but we can never resist wondering as we survey that flock of empty cheques just what adventures our bank account is going to undergo during that period and whether our customary technique of being aloof with the receiving teller and genial and commentary with the paying ditto is the right one We always believe in keeping a paying teller in a cheerful frame of mind We would never admit to him that we think it is going to rain We say rather Well it may blow over and try not to surmise how many hundreds there are in the pile at his elbow Probably we think the explanation for the really bizarre architecture of our bank is to keep depositors attention from the money Unquestionably Walt Whitman s tomb over in Harleigh Walt s vault was copied from our bank The cheques in our book are blue We have always regretted this If we had known it beforehand perhaps we would have inflicted our problems upon another bank Because there are so many more interesting colours for cheques tints upon which the ink shows up in a more imposing manner A pale pink or cream coloured cheque for two dollars seventy four cents looks much more exciting than a blue cheque for twenty five dollars We have known gray pink white brown green and salmon coloured cheques A friend of ours once showed us one that was a bright orange but refused to let us handle it But yellow is the colour that appeals to us most strongly When we were very young and away from home our monthly allowance the amount of which we shall not state but it cost us less effort than any money we ever received since came to us by way of pale primrose coloured cheques For after all there are no cheques like those one used to get from one s father We hope the Urchin will think so some day We like to pay homage to the true artist in all lines At the corner of Market and Marshall streets between Sixth and Seventh the collar clasp orator has his rostrum and it seems to us that his method of harangue has the quality of genuine art He does not bawl or try to terrify or bully his audience into purchase as do the auctioneers of the pawnbrokers outlets How gently how winningly how sweetly he pleads the merits of his little collar clasp And there is shrewd imagination in his attention catching device which is a small boy dressed in black wearing a white hood of cheesecloth that hides his face This peculiar silent figure with a touch of mystery about it serves to keep the crowd wondering until the oration begins Illustration With a smile with infinite ingratiation and gentle persuasion our friend exhibits the merits of his device which does away with the traditional collar button His art is to make the collar button seem a piteous almost a tragic thing His eyes swim with unshed tears as he describes the discomfort of the man whose collar fastened by the customary button cannot be given greater freedom on a hot muggy day He shows by exhibition on his own person the exquisite relief afforded by the adjustable collar clasp When the day grows cool he says when you begin to enjoy yourself and want your collar tighter you just loosen the clasp slide the tabs closer together and there you are And no picking at your tie to get the knot undone Now how many of you men have spoiled an expensive tie by picking at it Your fingers come in contact with the fibres of the silk and the first thing you know the tie is soiled This little clasp and he casts a beam of affection upon it saves your tie it saves your collar and it saves your patience A note of yearning pathos comes into his agreeable voice and he holds out a handful of the old fashioned collar buttons You men are wearing the same buttons your great grandfathers wore Don t you want to get out of collar slavery Don t you want to quit working your face all out of shape struggling with a collar button Now as this is a manufacturing demonstration On a warm evening nothing is more pleasant than a ride on the front platform of the Market Street L with the front door open As the train leaves Sixty ninth Street it dips down the Millbourne bend and the cool damp smell of the Cobb s Creek meadows gushes through the car Then the track straightens out for a long run toward the City Hall Roaring over the tree tops with the lights of movies and shops glowing up from below a warm typhoon makes one lean against it to keep one s footing The airy stations are lined by girls in light summer dresses attended by their swains The groan of the wheels underfoot causes a curious tickling in the soles of the feet as one stands on the steel platform This groan rises to a shrill scream as the train gathers speed between stations gradually diminishing to a reluctant grumble as the cars come to a stop In the distance in a peacock blue sky the double gleam of the City Hall tower shines against the night Down on the left is the hiss and clang of West Philadelphia station with the long dim amber glow of the platform and belated commuters pacing about Then the smoky dive across the Schuylkill and the bellow of the subway From time to time humanity is forced to revise its customary notions in the interests of truth This is always painful It is an old fetich that the week end in summer is a time for riotous enjoyment of goodly cheer and mirthful solace A careful examination of human beings during this hebdomadal period of carnival leads us to question the doctrine Illustration When we watch the horrors of discomfort and vexation endured by simple hearted citizens in pursuit of a light hearted Saturday and Sunday we often wonder how it is that humanity will so gleefully inflict upon itself sufferings which if they were imposed by some taskmaster would be called atrocious We observe for instance women and children standing sweltering in the aisles of trains during a two hour run to the seashore We observe the number of drownings motor accidents murders and suicides that take place during the Saturday to Monday period We observe families loaded down with small children who might have been happy and reasonably cool at home struggling desperately to get away for a day in the country rising at five A M standing in line at the station fanning themselves with blasphemy and weary before they start We observe them chased home by thunderstorms or colic dazed and blistered with sunburn or groaning with a surfeit of ice cream cones It is a lamentable fact and the truth is almost always lamentable and hotly denied that for the hard working majority the week end is a curse rather than a blessing The saddest fact in human annals is that most people are never so happy as when they are hard at work The time may come when criminals will be condemned not to the chair but to twenty successive week ends spent standing in the aisles of crowded excursion trains Illustration Strolling downtown to a well known home of fish dinners it is appetizing to pass along the curve of Dock Street in the coolness of the evening The clean lively odours of vegetables and fruit are strong on the air Under the broad awnings of the commission merchants and produce dealers the stock is piled up in neat and engaging piles ready to be carted away at dawn Under the glow of pale arcs and gas lamps the colours of the scene are vivid Great baskets of eggplant shine like huge grapes a polished port wine colour green and scarlet peppers catch points of light a flat pinkish colour gleams on carrots Each species seems to have an ordered pattern of its own Potatoes are ranged in a pyramid watermelons in long rows white and yellow onions are heaped in sacks The sweet musk of cantaloupes is the scent that overbreathes all others Then down nearer to the waterfront comes the strong damp fishy whiff of oysters To stroll among these gleaming piles of victuals to watch the various colours where the lamps pour a pale silver and yellow on cairns and pyramids of vegetables is to gather a lusty appetite and attack the first oyster stew of the season with a stout heart It being a very humid day we stopped to compliment the curly headed sandwich man at Ninth and Market on his decollete corsage which he wears in the Walt Whitman manner Wish we could get away with it the way you do we said admiringly He looked at us with the patience of one inured to bourgeois comment It s got to be tried said he like everything else We stopped by the Weather Man s little illuminated booth at Ninth and Chestnut about ten o clock in the evening We were scrutinizing his pretty coloured pictures wondering how soon the rain would determine when a slender young man appeared out of the gloom said I m sorry to have to do this switched off the light and pulled down the rolling front of the booth It was the Weather Man himself We were greatly elated to meet this mythical sage and walked down the street a little way with him In order to cheer him up we complimented him on the artistic charm of his little booth with its glow of golden light shining on the coloured map and the bright loops and curves of crayon We told him how almost at any time in the evening groups of people can be seen admiring his stall but his sensitive heart was gloomy Most of them don t understand it he said morosely The women are the worst I ve gone there in the evening and found them studying the map eagerly Hopefully I would creep up behind to hear their comments One will say Yes that s where my husband came from or I spent last summer over there pointing to some place on the map They seem to think it s put there for them to study geography We tried to sympathize with the broken hearted scientist but his spirit had been crushed by a long series of woes The other evening said he I saw a couple of girls gazing at the map and they looked so intelligent I really was charmed Apparently they were discussing an area of low pressure that was moving down from the Great Lakes and I lent an ear Imagine my chagrin when one of them said You see the colour of that chalk line I m going to make my next knitted vestee just like that And the other one said I think the whole colour scheme is adorable I m going to use it as a pattern for my new camouflage bathing suit Thank goodness cried the miserable Weather Man I have another map like that down at the Bourse and the brokers really give it some intelligent attention We went on our way sadly thinking how many sorrows there are in the world It is grievous to think of the poor Weather Man lurking with beating pulses in the neighbourhood of Ninth and Chestnut in the hope of finding someone who understands his painstaking display The next time you are standing in front of his booth do say something about the Oceanic High in the South Atlantic or the dangerous Aleutian Low or the anticyclonic condition prevailing in the Alleghenies He might overhear you and it would do his mournful heart good Illustration It was eight o clock a cool drizzling night Chestnut Street was gray with a dull pearly opaque twilight In the little portico east of Independence Hall the gas lamp under the ceiling cast a soft pink glow on the brick columns Independence Square was a sea of tremulous dripping boughs The quaint heptahedral lamps threw splashed shimmers of topaz colour across the laky pavement Golden lamps in a green night as Marvell says twinkled through the stir and moisture of the evening ON GOING TO BED One of the characters in The Moon and Sixpence remarked that he had faithfully lived up to the old precept about doing every day two things you heartily dislike for said he every day he had got up and he had gone to bed It is a sad thing that as soon as the hands of the clock have turned ten the shadow of going to bed begins to creep over the evening We have never heard bedtime spoken of with any enthusiasm One after another we have seen a gathering disperse each person saying with an air of solemn resignation Well I guess I ll go to bed But there was no hilarity about it It is really rather touching how they cling to the departing skirts of the day that is vanishing under the spinning shadow of night This is odd we repeat for sleep is highly popular among human beings The reluctance to go to one s couch is not at all a reluctance to slumber for almost all of us will doze happily in an armchair or on a sofa or even festooned on the floor with a couple of cushions But the actual and formal yielding to sheets and blankets is to be postponed to the last possible moment The devil of drowsiness is at his most potent we find about ten thirty P M At this period the human carcass seems to consider that it has finished its cycle which began with so much courage nearly sixteen hours before It begins to slack and the mind halts on a dead centre every now and then refusing to complete the revolution Now there are those who hold that this is certainly the seemly and appointed time to go to bed and they do so as a matter of routine These are commonly the happier creatures for they take the tide of sleep at the flood and are borne calmly and with gracious gentleness out to great waters of nothingness They push off from the wharf on a tranquil current and nothing more is to be seen or heard of these voyagers until they reappear at the breakfast table digging lustily into their grapefruit These people are happy aye in a brutish and sedentary fashion but they miss the admirable adventures of those more embittered wrestlers who will not give in without a struggle These latter suffer severe pangs between ten thirty and about eleven fifteen while they grapple with their fading faculties and seek to reestablish the will on its tottering throne This requires courage stout valour unbending Once you yield be it ever so little to the tempter you are lost And here our poor barren clay plays us false undermining the intellect with many a trick and wile I will sit down for a season in that comfortable chair the creature says to himself and read this sprightly novel That will ease my mind and put me in humour for a continuance of lively thinking And the end of that man is a steady nasal buzz from the bottom of the chair where he has collapsed an unsightly object and a disgrace to humanity This also means a big bill from the electric light company at the end of the month In many such ways will his corpus bewray him leading him by plausible self deceptions into a pitfall of sleep whence he is aroused about three A M when the planet turns over on the other side Only by stiff perseverance and rigid avoidance of easy chairs may the critical hour between ten thirty and eleven thirty be safely passed Tobacco a self brewed pot of tea and a browsing along bookshelves remain standing and do not sit down with your book are helps in this time of struggle Even so there are some happily drowsy souls who can never cross these shallows alone without grounding on the Lotus Reefs Our friend J D K magnificent creature was when we lived with him so potently hypnoidal that even erect and determined as his bookcase and urgently bent upon Brann s Iconoclast or some other literary irritant sleep would seep through his pores and he would fall with a crash lying there in unconscious bliss until someone came in and prodded him up reeling and ashamed But as we started to say those who survive this drastic weeding out which Night imposes upon her wooers so as to cull and choose only the truly meritorious lovers experience supreme delights which are unknown to their snoring fellows When the struggle with somnolence has been fought out and won when the world is all covering darkness and close pressing silence when the tobacco suddenly takes on fresh vigour and fragrance and the books lie strewn about the table then it seems as though all the rubbish and floating matter of the day s thoughts have poured away and only the bright clear and swift current of the mind itself remains flowing happily and without impediment This perfection of existence is not to be reached very often but when properly approached it may be won It is a different mind that one uncovers then a spirit which is lucid and hopeful to which for a few serene hours time exists not The friable resolutions of the day are brought out again and recemented and chiselled anew Surprising schemes are started and carried through to happy conclusion lifetimes of amazement are lived in a few passing ticks There is one who at such moments resolves with complete sincerity to start at one end of the top shelf and read again all the books in his library intending this time really to extract their true marrow He takes a clean sheet of paper and sets down memoranda of all the people he intends to write to and all the plumbers and what not that he will call up the next day And the next time this happy seizure attacks him he will go through the same gestures again without surprise and without the slightest mortification And then having lived a generation of good works since midnight struck he summons all his resolution and goes to bed Illustration Illustration THE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS GARDEN CITY N Y END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PIPEFULS This file should be
