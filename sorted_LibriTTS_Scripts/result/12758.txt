nothing And she loved nothing but that she felt made for that She would so have liked to please to be envied to be charming to be sought after She had a friend a former schoolmate at the convent who was rich and whom she did not like to go and see any more because she suffered so much when she came back But one evening her husband returned home with a triumphant air and holding a large envelope in his hand There said he here is something for you She tore the paper sharply and drew out a printed card which bore these words The Minister of Public Instruction and Mme Georges Ramponneau request the honor of M and Mme Loisel s company at the palace of the Ministry on Monday evening January eighteenth Instead of being delighted as her husband hoped she threw the invitation on the table with disdain murmuring What do you want me to do with that But my dear I thought you would be glad You never go out and this is such a fine opportunity I had awful trouble to get it Everyone wants to go it is very select and they are not giving many invitations to clerks The whole official world will be there She looked at him with an irritated eye and she said impatiently And what do you want me to put on my back He had not thought of that he stammered Why the dress you go to the theater in It looks very well to me He stopped distracted seeing that his wife was crying Two great tears descended slowly from the corners of her eyes toward the corners of her mouth He stuttered What s the matter What s the matter But by a violent effort she had conquered her grief and she replied with a calm voice while she wiped her wet cheeks Nothing Only I have no dress and therefore I can t go to this ball Give your card to some colleague whose wife is better equipped than I He was in despair He resumed Come let us see Mathilde How much would it cost a suitable dress which you could use on other occasions something very simple She reflected several seconds making her calculations and wondering also what sum she could ask without drawing on herself an immediate refusal and a frightened exclamation from the economical clerk Finally she replied hesitatingly I don t know exactly but I think I could manage it with four hundred francs He had grown a little pale because he was laying aside just that amount to buy a gun and treat himself to a little shooting next summer on the plain of Nanterre with several friends who went to shoot larks down there of a Sunday But he said All right I will give you four hundred francs And try to have a pretty dress The day of the ball drew near and Mme Loisel seemed sad uneasy anxious Her dress was ready however Her husband said to her one evening What is the matter Come you ve been so queer these last three days And she answered It annoys me not to have a single jewel not a single stone nothing to put on I shall look like distress I should almost rather not go at all He resumed You might wear natural flowers It s very stylish at this time of the year For ten francs you can get two or three magnificent roses She was not convinced No there s nothing more humiliating than to look poor among other women who are rich But her husband cried How stupid you are Go look up your friend Mme Forestier and ask her to lend you some jewels You re quite thick enough with her to do that She uttered a cry of joy It s true I never thought of it The next day she went to her friend and told of her distress Mme Forestier went to a wardrobe with a glass door took out a large jewel box brought it back opened it and said to Mme Loisel Choose my dear She saw first of all some bracelets then a pearl necklace then a Venetian cross gold and precious stones of admirable workmanship She tried on the ornaments before the glass hesitated could not make up her mind to part with them to give them back She kept asking Haven t you any more Why yes Look I don t know what you like All of a sudden she discovered in a black satin box a superb necklace of diamonds and her heart began to beat with an immoderate desire Her hands trembled as she took it She fastened it around her throat outside her high necked dress and remained lost in ecstasy at the sight of herself Then she asked hesitating filled with anguish Can you lend me that only that Why yes certainly She sprang upon the neck of her friend kissed her passionately then fled with her treasure The day of the ball arrived Mme Loisel made a great success She was prettier than them all elegant gracious smiling and crazy with joy All the men looked at her asked her name endeavored to be introduced All the attaches of the Cabinet wanted to waltz with her She was remarked by the minister himself She danced with intoxication with passion made drunk by pleasure forgetting all in the triumph of her beauty in the glory of her success in a sort of cloud of happiness composed of all this homage of all this admiration of all these awakened desires and of that sense of complete victory which is so sweet to woman s heart She went away about four o clock in the morning Her husband had been sleeping since midnight in a little deserted anteroom with three other gentlemen whose wives were having a very good time He threw over her shoulders the wraps which he had brought modest wraps of common life whose poverty contrasted with the elegance of the ball dress She felt this and wanted to escape so as not to be remarked by the other women who were enveloping themselves in costly furs Loisel held her back Wait a bit You will catch cold outside I will go and call a cab But she did not listen to him and rapidly descended the stairs When they were in the street they did not find a carriage and they began to look for one shouting after the cabmen whom they saw passing by at a distance They went down toward the Seine in despair shivering with cold At last they found on the quay one of those ancient noctambulent coupes which exactly as if they were ashamed to show their misery during the day are never seen round Paris until after nightfall It took them to their door in the Rue des Martyrs and once more sadly they climbed up homeward All was ended for her And as to him he reflected that he must be at the Ministry at ten o clock She removed the wraps which covered her shoulders before the glass so as once more to see herself in all her glory But suddenly she uttered a cry She had no longer the necklace around her neck Her husband already half undressed demanded What is the matter with you She turned madly toward him I have I have I ve lost Mme Forestier s necklace He stood up distracted What how Impossible And they looked in the folds of her dress in the folds of her cloak in her pockets everywhere They did not find it He asked You re sure you had it on when you left the ball Yes I felt it in the vestibule of the palace But if you had lost it in the street we should have heard it fall It must be in the cab Yes Probably Did you take his number No And you didn t you notice it No They looked thunderstruck at one another At last Loisel put on his clothes I shall go back on foot said he over the whole route which we have taken to see if I can t find it

none	none	out She sat waiting on a chair in her ball dress without strength to go to bed overwhelmed without fire without a thought Her husband came back about seven o clock He had found nothing He went to Police Headquarters to the newspaper offices to offer a reward he went to the cab companies everywhere in fact whither he was urged by the least suspicion of hope She waited all day in the same condition of mad fear before this terrible calamity Loisel returned at night with a hollow pale face he had discovered nothing You must write to your friend said he that you have broken the clasp of her necklace and that you are having it mended That will give us time to turn round She wrote at his dictation At the end of a week they had lost all hope And Loisel who had aged five years declared We must consider how to replace that ornament The next day they took the box which had contained it and they went to the jeweler whose name was found within He consulted his books It was not I madame who sold that necklace I must simply have furnished the case Then they went from jeweler to jeweler searching for a necklace like the other consulting their memories sick both of them with chagrin and with anguish They found in a shop at the Palais Royal a string of diamonds which seemed to them exactly like the one they looked for It was worth forty thousand francs They could have it for thirty six So they begged the jeweler not to sell it for three days yet And they made a bargain that he should buy it back for thirty four thousand francs in case they found the other one before the end of February Loisel possessed eighteen thousand francs which his father had left him He would borrow the rest He did borrow asking a thousand francs of one five hundred of another five louis here three louis there He gave notes took up ruinous obligations dealt with usurers and all the race of lenders He compromised all the rest of his life risked his signature without even knowing if he could meet it and frightened by the pains yet to come by the black misery which was about to fall upon him by the prospect of all the physical privations and of all the moral tortures which he was to suffer he went to get the new necklace putting down upon the merchant s counter thirty six thousand francs When Mme Loisel took back the necklace Mme Forestier said to her with a chilly manner You should have returned it sooner I might have needed it She did not open the case as her friend had so much feared If she had detected the substitution what would she have thought what would she have said Would she not have taken Mme Loisel for a thief Mme Loisel now knew the horrible existence of the needy She took her part moreover all on a sudden with heroism That dreadful debt must be paid She would pay it They dismissed their servant they changed their lodgings they rented a garret under the roof She came to know what heavy housework meant and the odious cares of the kitchen She washed the dishes using her rosy nails on the greasy pots and pans She washed the dirty linen the shirts and the dish cloths which she dried upon a line she carried the slops down to the street every morning and carried up the water stopping for breath at every landing And dressed like a woman of the people she went to the fruiterer the grocer the butcher her basket on her arm bargaining insulted defending her miserable money sou by sou Each month they had to meet some notes renew others obtain more time Her husband worked in the evening making a fair copy of some tradesman s accounts and late at night he often copied manuscript for five sous a page And this life lasted ten years At the end of ten years they had paid everything everything with the rates of usury and the accumulations of the compound interest Mme Loisel looked old now She had become the woman of impoverished households strong and hard and rough With frowsy hair skirts askew and red hands she talked loud while washing the floor with great swishes of water But sometimes when her husband was at the office she sat down near the window and she thought of that gay evening of long ago of that ball where she had been so beautiful and so feted What would have happened if she had not lost that necklace Who knows who knows How life is strange and changeful How little a thing is needed for us to be lost or to be saved But one Sunday having gone to take a walk in the Champs Elysees to refresh herself from the labors of the week she suddenly perceived a woman who was leading a child It was Mme Forestier still young still beautiful still charming Mme Loisel felt moved Was she going to speak to her Yes certainly And now that she had paid she was going to tell her all about it Why not She went up Good day Jeanne The other astonished to be familiarly addressed by this plain good wife did not recognize her at all and stammered But madame I do not know You must have mistaken No I am Mathilde Loisel Her friend uttered a cry Oh my poor Mathilde How you are changed Yes I have had days hard enough since I have seen you days wretched enough and that because of you Of me How so Do you remember that diamond necklace which you lent me to wear at the ministerial ball Yes Well Well I lost it What do you mean You brought it back I brought you back another just like it And for this we have been ten years paying You can understand that it was not easy for us us who had nothing At last it is ended and I am very glad Mme Forestier had stopped You say that you bought a necklace of diamonds to replace mine Yes You never noticed it then They were very like And she smiled with a joy which was proud and naive at once Mme Forestier strongly moved took her two hands Oh my poor Mathilde Why my necklace was paste It was worth at most five hundred francs The Man with the Pale Eyes Monsieur Pierre Agenor De Vargnes the Examining Magistrate was the exact opposite of a practical joker He was dignity staidness correctness personified As a sedate man he was quite incapable of being guilty even in his dreams of anything resembling a practical joke however remotely I know nobody to whom he could be compared unless it be the present president of the French Republic I think it is useless to carry the analogy any further and having said thus much it will be easily understood that a cold shiver passed through me when Monsieur Pierre Agenor de Vargnes did me the honor of sending a lady to await on me At about eight o clock one morning last winter as he was leaving the house to go to the Palais de Justice his footman handed him a card on which was printed DOCTOR JAMES FERDINAND Member of the Academy of Medicine Port au Prince Chevalier of the Legion of Honor At the bottom of the card there was written in pencil From Lady Frogere Monsieur de Vargnes knew the lady very well who was a very agreeable Creole from Hayti and whom he had met in many drawing rooms and on the other hand though the doctor s name did not awaken any recollections in him his quality and titles alone required that he should grant him an interview however short it might be Therefore although he was in a hurry to get out Monsieur de Vargnes told the footman to show in his early visitor but to tell him beforehand that his master was much pressed for time as he had to go to the Law Courts When the doctor came in in spite of his usual imperturbability he could not restrain a movement of surprise for the doctor presented that strange anomaly of being a negro of the purest blackest type with the eyes of a white man of a man from the North pale cold clear blue eyes and his surprise increased when after a few words of excuse for his untimely visit he added with an enigmatical smile My eyes surprise you do they not I was sure that they would and to tell you the truth I came here in order that you might look at them well and never forget them His smile and his words even more than his smile seemed to be those of a madman He spoke very softly with that childish lisping voice which is peculiar to negroes and his mysterious almost menacing words consequently sounded all the more as if they were uttered at random by a man bereft of his reason But his looks the looks of those pale cold clear blue eyes were certainly not those of a madman They clearly expressed menace yes menace as well as irony and above all implacable ferocity and their glance was like a flash of lightning which one could never forget I have seen Monsieur de Vargnes used to say when speaking about it the looks of many murderers but in none of them have I ever observed such a depth of crime and of impudent security in crime And this impression was so strong that Monsieur de Vargnes thought that he was the sport of some hallucination especially as when he spoke about his eyes the doctor continued with a smile and in his most childish accents Of course Monsieur you cannot understand what I am saying to you and I must beg your pardon for it To morrow you will receive a letter which will explain it all to you but first of all it was necessary that I should let you have a good a careful look at my eyes my eyes which are myself my only and true self as you will see With these words and with a polite bow the doctor went out leaving Monsieur de Vargnes extremely surprised and a prey to this doubt as he said to himself Is he merely a madman The fierce expression and the criminal depths of his looks are perhaps caused merely by the extraordinary contrast between his fierce looks and his pale eyes And absorbed in these thoughts Monsieur de Vargnes unfortunately allowed several minutes to elapse and then he thought to himself suddenly No I am not the sport of any hallucination and this is no case of an optical phenomenon This man is evidently some terrible criminal and I have altogether failed in my duty in not arresting him myself at once illegally even at the risk of my life The judge ran downstairs in pursuit of the doctor but it was too late he had disappeared In the afternoon he called on Madame Frogere to ask her whether she could tell him anything about the matter She however did not know the negro doctor in the least and was even able to assure him that he was a fictitious personage for as she was well acquainted with the upper classes in Hayti she knew that the Academy of Medicine at Port au Prince had no doctor of that name among its members As Monsieur de Vargnes persisted and gave descriptions of the doctor especially mentioning his extraordinary eyes Madame Frogere began to laugh and said You have certainly had to do with a hoaxer my dear monsieur The eyes which you have described are certainly those of a white man and the individual must have been painted On thinking it over Monsieur de Vargnes remembered that the doctor had nothing of the negro about him but his black skin his woolly hair and beard and his way of speaking which was easily imitated but nothing of the negro not even the characteristic undulating walk Perhaps after all he was only a practical joker and during the whole day Monsieur de Vargnes took refuge in that view which rather wounded his dignity as a man of consequence but which appeased his scruples as a magistrate The next day he received the promised letter which was written as well as addressed in letters cut out of the newspapers It was as follows MONSIEUR Doctor James Ferdinand does not exist but the man whose eyes you saw does and you will certainly recognize his eyes This man has committed two crimes for which he does not feel any remorse but as he is a psychologist he is afraid of some day yielding to the irresistible temptation of confessing his crimes You know better than anyone and that is your most powerful aid with what imperious force criminals especially intellectual ones feel this temptation That great Poet Edgar Poe has written masterpieces on this subject which express the truth exactly but he has omitted to mention the last phenomenon which I will tell you Yes I a criminal feel a terrible wish for somebody to know of my crimes and when this requirement is satisfied my secret has been revealed to a confidant I shall be tranquil for the future and be freed from this demon of perversity which only tempts us once Well Now that is accomplished You shall have my secret from the day that you recognize me by my eyes you will try and find out what I am guilty of and how I was guilty and you will discover it being a master of your profession which by the by has procured you the honor of having been chosen by me to bear the weight of this secret which now is shared by us and by us two alone I say advisedly by us two alone You could not as a matter of fact prove the reality of this secret to anyone unless I were to confess it and I defy you to obtain my public confession as I have confessed it to you and without danger to myself Three months later Monsieur de Vargnes met Monsieur X at an evening party and at first sight and without the slightest hesitation he recognized in him those very pale very cold and very clear blue eyes eyes which it was impossible to forget The man himself remained perfectly impassive so that Monsieur de Vargnes was forced to say to himself Probably I am the sport of an hallucination at this moment or else there are two pairs of eyes that are perfectly similar in the world And what eyes Can it be possible The magistrate instituted inquiries into his life and he discovered this which removed all his doubts Five years previously Monsieur X had been a very poor but very brilliant medical student who although he never took his doctor s degree had already made himself remarkable by his microbiological researches A young and very rich widow had fallen in love with him and married him She had one child by her first marriage and in the space of six months first the child and then the mother died of typhoid fever and thus Monsieur X had inherited a large fortune in due form and without any possible dispute Everybody said that he had attended to the two patients with the utmost devotion Now were these two deaths the two crimes mentioned in his letter But then Monsieur X must have poisoned his two victims with the microbes of typhoid fever which he had skillfully cultivated in them so as to make the disease incurable even by the most devoted care and attention Why not Do you believe it I asked Monsieur de Vargnes Absolutely he replied And the most terrible thing about it is that the villain is right when he defies me to force him to confess his crime publicly for I see no means of obtaining a confession none whatever For a moment I thought of magnetism but who could magnetize that man with those pale cold bright eyes With such eyes he would force the magnetizer to denounce himself as the culprit And then he said with a deep sigh Ah Formerly there was something good about justice And when he saw my inquiring looks he added in a firm and perfectly convinced voice Formerly justice had torture at its command Upon my word I replied with all an author s unconscious and simple egotism it is quite certain that without the torture this strange tale will have no conclusion and that is very unfortunate as far as regards the story I intended to make out of it An Uncomfortable Bed One autumn I went to stay for the hunting season with some friends in a chateau in Picardy My friends were fond of practical joking as all my friends are I do not care to know any other sort of people When I arrived they gave me a princely reception which at once aroused distrust in my breast We had some capital shooting They embraced me they cajoled me as if they expected to have great fun at my expense I said to myself Look out old ferret They have something in preparation for you During the dinner the mirth was excessive far too great in fact I thought Here are people who take a double share of amusement and apparently without reason They must be looking out in their own minds for some good bit of fun Assuredly I am to be the victim of the joke Attention During the entire evening everyone laughed in an exaggerated fashion I smelled a practical joke in the air as a dog smells game But what was it I was watchful restless I did not let a word or a meaning or a gesture escape me Everyone seemed to me an object of suspicion and I even looked distrustfully at the faces of the servants The hour rang for going to bed and the whole household came to escort me to my room Why They called to me Good night I entered the apartment shut the door and remained standing without moving a single step holding the wax candle in my hand I heard laughter and whispering in the corridor Without doubt they were spying on me I cast a glance around the walls the furniture the ceiling the hangings the floor I saw nothing to justify suspicion I heard persons moving about outside my door I had no doubt they were looking through the keyhole An idea came into my head My candle may suddenly go out and leave me in darkness Then I went across to the mantelpiece and lighted all the wax candles that were on it After that I cast another glance around me without discovering anything I advanced with short steps carefully examining the apartment Nothing I inspected every article one after the other Still nothing I went over to the window The shutters large wooden shutters were open I shut them with great care and then drew the curtains enormous velvet curtains and I placed a chair in front of them so as to have nothing to fear from without Then I cautiously sat down The armchair was solid I did not venture to get into the bed However time was flying and I ended by coming to the conclusion that I was ridiculous If they were spying on me as I supposed they must while waiting for the success of the joke they had been preparing for me have been laughing enormously at my terror So I made up my mind to go to bed But the bed was particularly suspicious looking I pulled at the curtains They seemed to be secure All the same there was danger I was going perhaps to receive a cold shower bath from overhead or perhaps the moment I stretched myself out to find myself sinking under the floor with my mattress I searched in my memory for all the practical jokes of which I ever had experience And I did not want to be caught Ah certainly not certainly not Then I suddenly bethought myself of a precaution which I consider one of extreme efficacy I caught hold of the side of the mattress gingerly and very slowly drew it toward me It came away followed by the sheet and the rest of the bedclothes I dragged all these objects into the very middle of the room facing the entrance door I made my bed over again as best I could at some distance from the suspected bedstead and the corner which had filled me with such anxiety Then I extinguished all the candles and groping my way I slipped under the bedclothes For at least another hour I remained awake starting at the slightest sound Everything seemed quiet in the chateau I fell asleep I must have been in a deep sleep for a long time but all of a sudden I was awakened with a start by the fall of a heavy body tumbling right on top of my own body and at the same time I received on my face on my neck and on my chest a burning liquid which made me utter a howl of pain And a dreadful noise as if a sideboard laden with plates and dishes had fallen down penetrated my ears I felt myself suffocating under the weight that was crushing me and preventing me from moving I stretched out my hand to find out what was the nature of this object I felt a face a nose and whiskers Then with all my strength I launched out a blow over this face But I immediately received a hail of cuffings which made me jump straight out of the soaked sheets and rush in my nightshirt into the corridor the door of which I found open O stupor it was broad daylight The noise brought my friends hurrying into the apartment and we found sprawling over my improvised bed the dismayed valet who while bringing me my morning cup of tea had tripped over this obstacle in the middle of the floor and fallen on his stomach spilling in spite of himself my breakfast over my face The precautions I had taken in closing the shutters and going to sleep in the middle of the room had only brought about the interlude I had been striving to avoid Ah how they all laughed that day Ghosts Just at the time when the Concordat was in its most flourishing condition a young man belonging to a wealthy and highly respected middle class family went to the office of the head of the police at P and begged for his help and advice which was immediately promised him My father threatens to disinherit me the young man then began although I have never offended against the laws of the State of morality or of his paternal authority merely because I do not share his blind reverence for the Catholic Church and her Ministers On that account he looks upon me not merely as Latitudinarian but as a perfect Atheist and a faithful old manservant of ours who is much attached to me and who accidentally saw my father s will told me in confidence that he had left all his property to the Jesuits I think this is highly suspicious and I fear that the priests have been maligning me to my father Until less than a year ago we used to live very quietly and happily together but ever since he has had so much to do with the clergy our domestic peace and happiness are at an end What you have told me the official replied is as likely as it is regrettable but I fail to see how I can interfere in the matter Your father is in full possession of all his mental faculties and can dispose of all his property exactly as he pleases I also think that your protest is premature you must wait until his will can legally take effect and then you can invoke the aid of justice I am sorry to say that I can do nothing for you I think you will be able to the young man replied for I believe that a very clever piece of deceit is being carried on here How Please explain yourself more clearly When I remonstrated with him yesterday evening he referred to my dead mother and at last assured me in a voice of the deepest conviction that she had frequently appeared to him and had threatened him with all the torments of the damned if he did not disinherit his son who had fallen away from God and leave all his property to the Church Now I do not believe in ghosts Neither do I the police director replied but I cannot well do anything on this dangerous ground if I had nothing but superstitions to go upon You know how the Church rules all our affairs since the Concordat with Rome and if I investigate this matter and obtain no results I am risking my post It would be very different if you could adduce any proofs for your suspicions I do not deny that I should like to see the clerical party which will I fear be the ruin of Austria receive a staggering blow try therefore to get to the bottom of this business and then we will talk it over again About a month passed without the young Latitudinarian being heard of but then he suddenly came one evening evidently in a great state of excitement and told him that he was in a position to expose the priestly deceit which he had mentioned if the authorities would assist him The police director asked for further information I have obtained a number of important clews the young man said In the first place my father confessed to me that my mother did not appear to him in our house but in the churchyard where she is buried My mother was consumptive for many years and a few weeks before her death she went to the village of S where she died and was buried In addition to this I found out from our footman that my father has already left the house twice late at night in company of X the Jesuit priest and that on both occasions he did not return till morning Each time he was remarkably uneasy and low spirited after his return and had three masses said for my dead mother He also told me just now that he has to leave home this evening on business but immediately he told me that our footman saw the Jesuit go out of the house We may therefore assume that he intends this evening to consult the spirit of my dead mother again and this would be an excellent opportunity for getting on the track of the matter if you do not object to opposing the most powerful force in the Empire for the sake of such an insignificant individual as myself Every citizen has an equal right to the protection of the State the police director replied and I think that I have shown often enough that I am not wanting in courage to perform my duty no matter how serious the consequences may be but only very young men act without any prospects of success as they are carried away by their feelings When you came to me the first time I was obliged to refuse your request for assistance but to day your shares have risen in value It is now eight o clock and I shall expect you in two hours time here in my office At present all you have to do is to hold your tongue everything else is my affair As soon as it was dark four men got into a

none	none	carriage in the yard of the police office and were driven in the direction of the village of S their carriage however did not enter the village but stopped at the edge of a small wood in the immediate neighborhood Here they all four alighted they were the police director accompanied by the young Latitudinarian a police sergeant and an ordinary policeman who was however dressed in plain clothes The first thing for us to do is to examine the locality carefully the police director said it is eleven o clock and the exercisers of ghosts will not arrive before midnight so we have time to look round us and to take our measure The four men went to the churchyard which lay at the end of the village near the little wood Everything was as still as death and not a soul was to be seen The sexton was evidently sitting in the public house for they found the door of his cottage locked as well as the door of the little chapel that stood in the middle of the churchyard Where is your mother s grave the police director asked but as there were only a few stars visible it was not easy to find it but at last they managed it and the police director looked about in the neighborhood of it The position is not a very favorable one for us he said at last there is nothing here not even a shrub behind which we could hide But just then the policeman said that he had tried to get into the sexton s hut through the door or the window and that at last he had succeeded in doing so by breaking open a square in a window which had been mended with paper and that he had opened it and obtained posesssion of the key which he brought to the police director His plans were very quickly settled He had the chapel opened and went in with the young Latitudinarian then he told the police sergeant to lock the door behind him and to put the key back where he had found it and to shut the window of the sexton s cottage carefully Lastly he made arrangements as to what they were to do in case anything unforeseen should occur whereupon the sergeant and the constable left the churchyard and lay down in a ditch at some distance from the gate but opposite to it Almost as soon as the clock struck half past eleven they heard steps near the chapel whereupon the police director and the young Latitudinarian went to the window in order to watch the beginning of the exorcism and as the chapel was in total darkness they thought that they should be able to see without being seen but matters turned out differently from what they expected Suddenly the key turned in the lock and they barely had time to conceal themselves behind the altar before two men came in one of whom was carrying a dark lantern One was the young man s father an elderly man of the middle class who seemed very unhappy and depressed the other the Jesuit father K a tall thin big boned man with a thin bilious face in which two large gray eyes shone restlessly under their bushy black eyebrows He lit the tapers which were standing on the altar and then began to say a Requiem Mass while the old man knelt on the altar steps and served him When it was over the Jesuit took the book of the Gospels and the holy water sprinkler and went slowly out of the chapel while the old man followed him with a holy water basin in one hand and a taper in the other Then the police director left his hiding place and stooping down so as not to be seen he crept to the chapel window where he cowered down carefully and the young man followed his example They were now looking straight on his mother s grave The Jesuit followed by the superstitious old man walked three times round the grave then he remained standing before it and by the light of the taper he read a few passages from the Gospel then he dipped the holy water sprinkler three times into the holy water basin and sprinkled the grave three times then both returned to the chapel knelt down outside it with their faces toward the grave and began to pray aloud until at last the Jesuit sprang up in a species of wild ecstasy and cried out three times in a shrill voice Exsurge Exsurge Exsurge one one Arise Scarcely had the last word of the exorcism died away when thick blue smoke rose out of the grave which rapidly grew into a cloud and began to assume the outlines of a human body until at last a tall white figure stood behind the grave and beckoned with its hand Who art thou the Jesuit asked solemnly while the old man began to cry When I was alive I was called Anna Maria B the ghost replied in a hollow voice Will you answer all my questions the priest continued As far as I can Have you not yet been delivered from purgatory by our prayers and all the Masses for your soul which we have said for you Not yet but soon soon I shall be When As soon as that blasphemer my son has been punished Has that not already happened Has not your husband disinherited his lost son and made the Church his heir in his place That is not enough What must he do besides He must deposit his will with the Judicial Authorities as his last will and testament and drive the reprobate out of his house Consider well what you are saying must this really be It must or otherwise I shall have to languish in purgatory much longer the sepulchral voice replied with a deep sigh but the next moment it yelled out in terror Oh Good Lord and the ghost began to run away as fast as it could A shrill whistle was heard and then another and the police director laid his hand on the shoulder of the exorciser accompanied with the remark You are in custody Meanwhile the police sergeant and the policeman who had come into the churchyard had caught the ghost and dragged it

none	none	It was the sexton who had put on a flowing white dress and who wore a wax mask which bore striking resemblance to his mother as the son declared When the case was heard it was proved that the mask had been very skillfully made from a portrait of the deceased woman The Government gave orders that the matter should be investigated as secretly as possible and left the punishment of Father K to the spiritual authorities which was a matter of course at a time when priests were outside the jurisdiction of the Civil Authorities and it is needless to say that he was very comfortable during his imprisonment in a monastery in a part of the country which abounded with game and trout The only valuable result of the amusing ghost story was that it brought about a reconciliation between father and son and the former as a matter of fact felt such deep respect for priests and their ghosts in consequence of the apparition that a short time after his wife had left purgatory for the last time in order to talk with him he turned Protestant Fear We went up on deck after dinner Before us the Mediterranean lay without a ripple and shimmering in the moonlight The great ship glided on casting upward to the star studded sky a long serpent of black smoke Behind us the dazzling white water stirred by the rapid progress of the heavy bark and beaten by the propeller foamed seemed to writhe gave off so much brilliancy that one could have called it boiling moonlight There were six or eight of us silent with admiration and gazing toward far away Africa whither we were going The commandant who was smoking a cigar with us brusquely resumed the conversation begun at dinner Yes I was afraid then My ship remained for six hours on that rock beaten by the wind and with a great hole in the side Luckily we were picked up toward evening by an English coaler which sighted us Then a tall man of sunburned face and grave demeanor one of those men who have evidently traveled unknown and far away lands whose calm eye seems to preserve in its depths something of the foreign scenes it has observed a man that you are sure is impregnated with courage spoke for the first time You say commandant that you were afraid I beg to disagree with you You are in error as to the meaning of the word and the nature of the sensation that you experienced An energetic man is never afraid in the presence of urgent danger He is excited aroused full of anxiety but fear is something quite different The commandant laughed and answered Bah I assure you that I was afraid Then the man of the tanned countenance addressed us deliberately as follows Permit me to explain Fear and the boldest men may feel fear is something horrible an atrocious sensation a sort of decomposition of the soul a terrible spasm of brain and heart the very memory of which brings a shudder of anguish but when one is brave he feels it neither under fire nor in the presence of sure death nor in the face of any well known danger It springs up under certain abnormal conditions under certain mysterious influences in the presence of vague peril Real fear is a sort of reminiscence of fantastic terror of the past A man who believes in ghosts and imagines he sees a specter in the darkness must feel fear in all its

none	none	As for me I was overwhelmed with fear in broad daylight about ten years ago and again one December night last winter Nevertheless I have gone through many dangers many adventures which seemed to promise death I have often been in battle I have been left for dead by thieves In America I was condemned as an insurgent to be hanged and off the coast of China have been thrown into the sea from the deck of a ship Each time I thought I was lost I at once decided upon my course of action without regret or weakness That is not fear I have felt it in Africa and yet it is a child of the north The sunlight banishes it like the mist Consider this fact gentlemen Among the Orientals life has no value resignation is natural The nights are clear and empty of the somber spirit of unrest which haunts the brain in cooler lands In the Orient panic is known but not fear Well then Here is the incident that befell me in Africa I was crossing the great sands to the south of Onargla It is one of the most curious districts in the world You have seen the solid continuous sand of the endless ocean strands Well imagine the ocean itself turned to sand in the midst of a storm Imagine a silent tempest with motionless billows of yellow dust They are high as mountains these uneven varied surges rising exactly like unchained billows but still larger and stratified like watered silk On this wild silent and motionless sea the consuming rays of the tropical sun are poured pitilessly and directly You have to climb these streaks of red hot ash descend again on the other side climb again climb climb without halt without repose without shade The horses cough sink to their knees and slide down the sides of these remarkable hills We were a couple of friends followed by eight spahis and four camels with their drivers We were no longer talking overcome by heat fatigue and a thirst such as had produced this burning desert Suddenly one of our men uttered a cry We all halted surprised by an unsolved phenomenon known only to travelers in these trackless wastes Somewhere near us in an indeterminable direction a drum was rolling the mysterious drum of the sands It was beating distinctly now with greater resonance and again feebler ceasing then resuming its uncanny roll The Arabs terrified stared at one another and one said in his language Death is upon us As he spoke my companion my friend almost a brother dropped from his horse falling face downward on the sand overcome by a sunstroke And for two hours while I tried in vain to save him this weird drum filled my ears with its monotonous intermittent and incomprehensible tone and I felt lay hold of my bones fear real fear hideous fear in the presence of this beloved corpse in this hole scorched by the sun surrounded by four mountains of sand and two hundred leagues from any French settlement while echo assailed our ears with this furious drum beat On that day I realized what fear was but since then I have had another and still more vivid experience The commandant interrupted the speaker I beg your pardon but what was the drum The traveler replied I cannot say No one knows Our officers are often surprised by this singular noise and attribute it generally to the echo produced by a hail of grains of sand blown by the wind against the dry and brittle leaves of weeds for it has always been noticed that the phenomenon occurs in proximity to little plants burned by the sun and hard as parchment This sound seems to have been magnified multiplied and swelled beyond measure in its progress through the valleys of sand and the drum therefore might be considered a sort of sound mirage Nothing more But I did not know that until later I shall proceed to my second instance It was last winter in a forest of the Northeast of France The sky was so overcast that night came two hours earlier than usual My guide was a peasant who walked beside me along the narrow road under the vault of fir trees through which the wind in its fury howled Between the tree tops I saw the fleeting clouds which seemed to hasten as if to escape some object of terror Sometimes in a fierce gust of wind the whole forest bowed in the same direction with a groan of pain and a chill laid hold of me despite my rapid pace and heavy clothing We were to sup and sleep at an old gamekeeper s house not much farther on I had come out for hunting My guide sometimes raised his eyes and murmured Ugly weather Then he told me about the people among whom we were to spend the night The father had killed a poacher two years before and since then had been gloomy and behaved as though haunted by a memory His two sons were married and lived with him The darkness was profound I could see nothing before me nor around me and the mass of overhanging interlacing trees rubbed together filling the night with an incessant whispering Finally I saw a light and soon my companion was knocking upon a door Sharp women s voices answered us then a man s voice a choking voice asked Who goes there My guide gave his name We entered and beheld a memorable picture An old man with white hair wild eyes and a loaded gun in his hands stood waiting for us in the middle of the kitchen while two stalwart youths armed with axes guarded the door In the somber corners I distinguished two women kneeling with faces to the wall Matters were explained and the old man stood his gun against the wall at the same time ordering that a room be prepared for me Then as the women did not stir Look you monsieur said he two years ago this night I killed a man and last year he came back to haunt me I expect him again to night Then he added in a tone that made me smile And so we are somewhat excited I reassured him as best I could happy to have arrived on that particular evening and to witness this superstitious terror I told stories and almost succeeded in calming the whole household Near the fireplace slept an old dog mustached and almost blind with his head between his paws such a dog as reminds you of people you have known Outside the raging storm was beating against the little house and suddenly through a small pane of glass a sort of peep window placed near the door I saw in a brilliant flash of lightning a whole mass of trees thrashed by the wind In spite of my efforts I realized that terror was laying hold of these people and each time that I ceased to speak all ears listened for distant sounds Annoyed at these foolish fears I was about to retire to my bed when the old gamekeeper suddenly leaped from his chair seized his gun and stammered wildly There he is there he is I hear him The two women again sank upon their knees in the corner and hid their faces while the sons took up the axes I was going to try to pacify them once more when the sleeping dog awakened suddenly and raising his head and stretching his neck looked at the fire with his dim eyes and uttered one of those mournful howls which make travelers shudder in the darkness and solitude of the country All eyes were focused upon him now as he rose on his front feet as though haunted by a vision and began to howl at something invisible unknown and doubtless horrible for he was bristling all over The gamekeeper with livid face cried He scents him He scents him He was there when I killed him The two women terrified began to wail in concert with the dog In spite of myself cold chills ran down my spine This vision of the animal at such a time and place in the midst of these startled people was something frightful to witness Then for an hour the dog howled without stirring he howled as though in the anguish of a nightmare and fear horrible fear came over me Fear of what How can I say It was fear and that is all I know We remained motionless and pale expecting something awful to happen Our ears were strained and our hearts beat loudly while the slightest noise startled us Then the beast began to walk around the room sniffing at the walls and growling constantly His maneuvers were driving us mad Then the countryman who had brought me thither in a paroxysm of rage seized the dog and carrying him to a door which opened into a small court thrust him forth The noise was suppressed and we were left plunged in a silence still more terrible Then suddenly we all started Some one was gliding along the outside wall toward the forest then he seemed to be feeling of the door with a trembling hand then for two minutes nothing was heard and we almost lost our minds Then he returned still feeling along the wall and scratched lightly upon the door as a child might do with his finger nails Suddenly a face appeared behind the glass of the peep window a white face with eyes shining like those of the cat tribe A sound was heard an indistinct plaintive murmur Then there was a formidable burst of noise in the kitchen The old gamekeeper had fired and the two sons at once rushed forward and barricaded the window with the great table reinforcing it with the buffet I swear to you that at the shock of the gun s discharge which I did not expect such an anguish laid hold of my heart my soul and my very body that I felt myself about to fall about to die from fear We remained there until dawn unable to move in short seized by an indescribable numbness of the brain No one dared to remove the barricade until a thin ray of sunlight appeared through a crack in the back room At the base of the wall and under the window we found the old dog lying dead his skull shattered by a ball He had escaped from the little court by digging a hole under a fence The dark visaged man became silent then he added And yet on that night I incurred no danger but I should rather again pass through all the hours in which I have confronted the most terrible perils than the one minute when that gun was discharged at the bearded head in the window The Confession Marguerite de Therelles was dying Although but fifty six she seemed like seventy five at least She panted paler than the sheets shaken by dreadful shiverings her face convulsed her eyes haggard as if she had seen some horrible thing Her eldest sister Suzanne six years older sobbed on her knees beside the bed A little table drawn close to the couch of the dying woman and covered with a napkin bore two lighted candles the priest being momentarily expected to give extreme unction and the communion which should be the last The apartment had that sinister aspect that air of hopeless farewells which belongs to the chambers of the dying Medicine bottles stood about on the furniture linen lay in the corners pushed aside by foot or broom The disordered chairs themselves seemed affrighted as if they had run in all the senses of the word Death the formidable was there hidden waiting The story of the two sisters was very touching It was quoted far and wide it had made many eyes to weep Suzanne the elder had once been madly in love with a young man who had also been in love with her They were engaged and were only waiting the day fixed for the contract when Henry de Lampierre suddenly died The despair of the young girl was dreadful and she vowed that she would never marry She kept her word She put on widow s weeds which she never took off Then her sister her little sister Marguerite who was only twelve years old came one morning to throw herself into the arms of the elder and said Big Sister I do not want thee to be unhappy I do not want thee to cry all thy life I will never leave thee never never I I too shall never marry I shall stay with thee always always always Suzanne touched by the devotion of the child kissed her but did not believe Yet the little one also kept her word and despite the entreaties of her parents despite the supplications of the elder she never married She was pretty very pretty she refused many a young man who seemed to love her truly and she never left her sister more They lived together all the days of their life without ever being separated a single time They went side by side inseparably united But Marguerite seemed always sad oppressed more melancholy than the elder as though perhaps her sublime sacrifice had broken her spirit She aged more quickly had white hair from the age of thirty and often suffering seemed afflicted by some secret gnawing trouble Now she was to be the first to die Since yesterday she was no longer able to speak She had only said at the first glimmers of day dawn Go fetch Monsieur le Cure the moment has come And she had remained since then upon her back shaken with spasms her lips agitated as though dreadful words were mounting from her heart without power of issue her look mad with fear terrible to see Her sister torn by sorrow wept wildly her forehead resting on the edge of the bed and kept repeating Margot my poor Margot my little one She had always called her Little One just as the younger had always called her Big Sister Steps were heard on the stairs The door opened A choir boy appeared followed by an old priest in a surplice As soon as she perceived him the dying woman with one shudder sat up opened her lips stammered two or three words and began to scratch the sheets with her nails as if she had wished to make a hole The Abbe Simon approached took her hand kissed her brow and with a soft voice God pardon thee my child have courage the moment is now come speak Then Marguerite shivering from head to foot shaking her whole couch with nervous movements stammered Sit down Big Sister listen The priest bent down toward Suzanne who was still flung upon the bed s foot He raised her placed her in an armchair and taking a hand of each of the sisters in one of his own he pronounced Lord my God Endue them with strength cast Thy mercy upon them And Marguerite began to speak The words issued from her throat one by one raucous with sharp pauses as though very feeble Pardon pardon Big Sister oh forgive If thou knewest how I have had fear of this moment all my life Suzanne stammered through her tears Forgive thee what Little One Thou hast given all to me sacrificed everything thou art an angel But Marguerite interrupted her Hush hush Let me speak do not stop me It is dreadful let me tell all to the very end without flinching Listen Thou rememberest thou rememberest Henry Suzanne trembled and looked at her sister The younger continued Thou must hear all to understand I was twelve years old only twelve years old thou rememberest well is it not so And I was spoiled I did everything that I liked Thou rememberest surely how they spoiled me Listen The first time that he came he had varnished boots He got down from his horse at the great steps and he begged pardon for his costume but he came to bring some news to papa Thou rememberest is it not so Don t speak listen When I saw him I was completely carried away I found him so very beautiful and I remained standing in a corner of the salon all the time that he was talking Children are strange and terrible Oh yes I have dreamed of all that He came back again several times I looked at him with all my eyes with all my soul I was large of my age and very much more knowing than anyone thought He came back often I thought only of him I said very low Henry Henry de Lampierre Then they said that he was going to marry thee It was a sorrow oh Big Sister a sorrow a sorrow I cried for three nights without sleeping He came back every day in the afternoon after his lunch thou rememberest is it not so Say nothing listen Thou madest him cakes which he liked with meal with butter and milk Oh I know well how I could make them yet if it were needed He ate them at one mouthful and and then he drank a glass of wine and then he said It is delicious Thou rememberest how he would say that I was jealous jealous The moment of thy marriage approached There were only two weeks more I became crazy I said to myself He shall not marry Suzanne no I will not have it It is I whom he will marry when I am grown up I shall never find anyone whom I love so much But one night ten days before the contract thou tookest a walk with him in front of the chateau by moonlight and there under the fir under the great fir he kissed thee kissed holding thee in his two arms so long Thou rememberest is it not so It was probably the first time yes Thou wast so pale when thou earnest back to the salon I had seen you two I was there in the shrubbery I was angry If I could I should have killed you both I said to myself He shall not marry Suzanne never He shall marry no one I should be too unhappy And all of a sudden I began to hate him dreadfully Then dost thou know what I did Listen I had seen the gardener making little balls to kill strange dogs He pounded up a bottle with a stone and put the powdered glass in a little ball of meat I took a little medicine bottle that mamma had I broke it small with a hammer and I hid the glass in my pocket It was a shining powder The next day as soon as you had made the little cakes I split them with a knife and I put in the glass He ate three of them I too I ate one I threw the other six into the pond The two swans died three days after Dost thou remember Oh say nothing listen listen I I alone did not die but I have always been sick Listen He died thou knowest well listen that that is nothing It is afterwards later always the worst listen My life all my life what torture I said to myself I will never leave my sister And at the hour of death I will tell her all There And ever since I have always thought of that moment when I should tell thee all Now it is come It is terrible Oh Big Sister I have always thought morning and evening by night and by day Some time I must tell her that I waited What agony It is done Say nothing Now I am afraid am afraid oh I am afraid If I am going to see him again soon when I am dead See him again think of it The first Before thou I shall not dare I must I am going to die I want you to forgive me I want it I cannot go off to meet him without that Oh tell her to forgive me Monsieur le Cure tell her I implore you to do it I cannot die without that She was silent and remained panting always scratching the sheet with her withered nails Suzanne had hidden her face in her hands and did not move She was thinking of him whom she might have loved so long What a good life they should have lived together She saw him once again in that vanished bygone time in that old past which was put out forever The beloved dead how they tear your hearts Oh that kiss his only kiss She had hidden it in her soul And after it nothing nothing more her whole life long All of a sudden the priest stood straight and with a strong vibrant voice he cried Mademoiselle Suzanne your sister is dying Then Suzanne opening her hands showed her face soaked with tears and throwing herself upon her sister she kissed her with all her might stammering I forgive thee I forgive thee Little One The Horla or Modern Ghosts May eighth What a lovely day I have spent all the morning lying in the grass in front of my house under the enormous plantain tree which covers it and shades and shelters the whole of it I like this part of the country and I am fond of living here because I am attached to it by deep roots profound and delicate roots which attach a man to the soil on which his ancestors were born and died which attach him to what people think and what they eat to the usages as well as to the food local expressions the peculiar language of the peasants to the smell of the soil of the villages and of the atmosphere itself I love my house in which I grew up From my windows I can see the Seine which flows by the side of my garden on the other side of the road almost through my grounds the great and wide Seine which goes to Rouen and Havre and which is covered with boats passing to and fro On the left down yonder lies Rouen that large town with its blue roofs under its pointed Gothic towers They are innumerable delicate or broad dominated by the spire of the cathedral and full of bells which sound through the blue air on fine mornings sending their sweet and distant iron clang to me their metallic sound which the breeze wafts in my direction now stronger and now weaker according as the wind is stronger or lighter What a delicious morning it was About eleven o clock a long line of boats drawn by a steam tug as big as a fly and which scarcely puffed while emitting its thick smoke passed my gate After two English schooners whose red flag fluttered toward the sky there came a magnificent Brazilian three master it was perfectly white and wonderfully clean and shining I saluted it I hardly know why except that the sight of the vessel gave me great pleasure May twelfth I have had a slight feverish attack for the last few days and I feel ill or rather I feel low spirited Whence do these mysterious influences come which change our happiness into discouragement and our self confidence into diffidence One might almost say that the air the invisible air is full of unknowable Forces whose mysterious presence we have to endure I wake up in the best spirits with an inclination to sing in my throat Why I go down by the side of the water and suddenly after walking a short distance I return home wretched as if some misfortune were awaiting me there Why Is it a cold shiver which passing over my skin has upset my nerves and given me low spirits Is it the form of the clouds or the color of the sky or the color of the surrounding objects which is so changeable which have troubled my thoughts as they passed before my eyes Who can tell Everything that surrounds us everything that we see without looking at it everything that we touch without knowing it everything that we handle without feeling it all that we meet without clearly distinguishing it has a rapid surprising and inexplicable effect upon us and upon our organs and through them on our ideas and on our heart itself How profound that mystery of the Invisible is We cannot fathom it with our miserable senses with our eyes which are unable to perceive what is either too small or too great too near to or too far from us neither the inhabitants of a star nor of a drop of water with our ears that deceive us for they transmit to us the vibrations of the air in sonorous notes They are fairies who work the miracle of changing that movement into noise and by that metamorphosis give birth to music which makes the mute agitation of nature musical with our sense of smell which is smaller than that of a dog with our sense of taste which can scarcely distinguish the age of a wine Oh If we only had other organs which would work other miracles in our favor what a number of fresh things we might discover around us May sixteenth I am ill decidedly I was so well last month I am feverish horribly feverish or rather I am in a state of feverish enervation which makes my mind suffer as much as my body I have without ceasing that horrible sensation of some danger threatening me that apprehension of some coming misfortune or of approaching death that presentiment which is no doubt an attack of some illness which is still unknown which germinates in the flesh and in the blood May eighteenth I have just come from consulting my medical man for I could no longer get any sleep He found that my pulse was high my eyes dilated my nerves highly strung but no alarming symptoms I must have a course of shower baths and of bromide of potassium May twenty fifth No change My state is really very peculiar As the evening comes on an incomprehensible feeling of disquietude seizes me just as if night concealed some terrible menace toward me I dine quickly and then try to read but I do not understand the words and can scarcely distinguish the letters Then I walk up and down my drawing room oppressed by a feeling of confused and irresistible fear the fear of sleep and fear of my bed About ten o clock I go up to my room As soon as I have got in I double lock and bolt it I am frightened of what Up till the present time I have been frightened of nothing I open my cupboards and look under my bed I listen I listen to what How strange it is that a simple feeling of discomfort impeded or heightened circulation perhaps the irritation of a nervous thread a slight congestion a small disturbance in the imperfect and delicate functions of our living machinery can turn the most lighthearted of men into a melancholy one and make a coward of the bravest Then I go to bed and I wait for sleep as a man might wait for the executioner I wait for its coming with dread and my heart beats and my legs tremble while my whole body shivers beneath the warmth of the bedclothes until the moment when I suddenly fall asleep as one would throw oneself into a pool of stagnant water in order to drown oneself I do not feel coming over me as I used to do formerly this perfidious sleep which is close to me and watching me which is going to seize me by the head to close my eyes and annihilate me I sleep a long time two or three hours perhaps then a dream no a nightmare lays hold on me I feel that I am in bed and asleep I feel it and I know it and I feel also that somebody is coming close to me is looking at me touching me is getting on to my bed is kneeling on my chest is taking my neck between his hands and squeezing it squeezing it with all his might in order to strangle me I struggle bound by that terrible powerlessness which paralyzes us in our dreams I try to cry out but I cannot I want to move I cannot I try with the most violent efforts and out of breath to turn over and throw off this being which is crushing and suffocating me I cannot And then suddenly I wake up shaken and bathed in perspiration I light a candle and find that I am alone and after that crisis which occurs every night I at length fall asleep and slumber tranquilly till morning June twod My state has grown worse What is the matter with me The bromide does me no good and the shower baths have no effect whatever Sometimes in order to tire myself out though I am fatigued enough already I go for a walk in the forest of Roumare I used to think at first that the fresh light and soft air impregnated with the odor of herbs and leaves would instill new blood into my veins and impart fresh energy to my heart I turned into a broad ride in the wood and then I turned toward La Bouille through a narrow path between two rows of exceedingly tall trees which placed a thick green almost black roof between the sky and me A sudden shiver ran through me not a cold shiver but a shiver of agony and so I hastened my steps uneasy at being alone in the wood frightened stupidly and without reason at the profound solitude Suddenly it seemed to me as if I were being followed that somebody was walking at my heels close quite close to me near enough to touch me I turned round suddenly but I was alone I saw nothing behind me except the straight broad ride empty and bordered by high trees horribly empty on the other side it also extended until it was lost in the distance and looked just the same terrible I closed my eyes Why And then I began to turn round on one heel very quickly just like a top I nearly fell down and opened my eyes the trees were dancing round me and the earth heaved I was obliged to sit down Then ah I no longer remembered how I had come What a strange idea What a strange strange idea I did not the least know I started off to the right and got back into the avenue which had led me into the middle of the forest June threed I have had a terrible night I shall go away for a few weeks for no doubt a journey will set me up again July twod I have come back quite cured and have had a most delightful trip into the bargain I have been to Mont Saint Michel which I had not seen before What a sight when one arrives as I did at Avranches toward the end of the day The town stands on a hill and I was taken into the public garden at the extremity of the town I uttered a cry of astonishment An extraordinarily large bay lay extended before me as far as my eyes could reach between two hills which were lost to sight in the mist and in the middle of this immense yellow bay under a clear golden sky a peculiar hill rose up somber and pointed in the midst of the sand The sun had just disappeared and under the still flaming sky the outline of that fantastic rock stood out which bears on its summit a fantastic monument At daybreak I went to it The tide was low as it had been the night before and I saw that wonderful abbey rise up before me as I approached it After several hours walking I reached the enormous mass of rocks which supports the little town dominated by the great church Having climbed the steep and narrow street I entered the most wonderful Gothic building that has ever been built to God on earth as large as a town full of low rooms which seem buried beneath vaulted roofs and lofty galleries supported by delicate columns I entered this gigantic granite jewel which is as light as a bit of lace covered with towers with slender belfries to which spiral staircases ascend and which raise their strange heads that bristle with chimeras with devils with fantastic animals with monstrous flowers and which are joined together by finely carved arches to the blue sky by day and to the black sky by night When I had reached the summit I said to the monk who accompanied me Father how happy you must be here And he replied It is very windy Monsieur and so we began to talk while watching the rising tide which ran over the sand and covered it with a steel cuirass And then the monk told me stories all the old stories belonging to the place legends nothing but legends One of them struck me forcibly The country people those belonging to the Mornet declare that at night one can hear talking going on in the sand and then that one hears two goats bleat one with a strong the other with a weak voice Incredulous people declare that it is nothing but the cry of the sea birds which occasionally resembles bleatings and occasionally human lamentations but belated fishermen swear that they have met an old shepherd whose head which is covered by his cloak they can never see wandering on the downs between two tides round the little town placed so far out of the world and who is guiding and walking before them a he goat with a man s face and a she goat with a woman s face and both of them with white hair and talking incessantly quarreling in a strange language and then suddenly ceasing to talk in order to bleat with all their might Do you believe it I asked the monk I scarcely know he replied and I continued If there are other beings besides ourselves on this earth how comes it that we have not known it for so long a time or why have you not seen them How is it that I have not seen them He replied Do we see the hundred thousandth part of what exists Look here there is the wind which is the strongest force in nature which knocks down men and blows down buildings uproots trees raises the sea into mountains of water destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the breakers the wind which kills which whistles which sighs which roars have you ever seen it and can you see it It exists for all that however I was silent before this simple reasoning That man was a philosopher or perhaps a fool I could not say which exactly so I held my tongue What he had said had often been in my own thoughts July threed I have slept badly certainly there is some feverish influence here for my coachman is suffering in the same way as I am When I went back home yesterday I noticed his singular paleness and I asked him What is the matter with you Jean The matter is that I never get any rest and my nights devour my days Since your departure monsieur there has been a spell over me However the other servants are all well but I am very frightened of having another attack myself July fourth I am decidedly taken again for my old nightmares have returned Last night I felt somebody leaning on me who was sucking my life from between my lips with his mouth Yes he was sucking it out of my neck like a leech would have done Then he got up satiated and I woke up so beaten crushed and annihilated that I could not move If this continues for a few days I shall certainly go away again July fifth Have I lost my reason What has happened what I saw last night is so strange that my head wanders when I think of it As I do now every evening I had locked my door and then being thirsty I drank half a glass of water and I accidentally noticed that the water bottle was full up to the cut glass stopper Then I went to bed and fell into one of my terrible sleeps from which I was aroused in about two hours by a still more terrible shock Picture to yourself a sleeping man who is being murdered and who wakes up with a knife in his chest and who is rattling in his throat covered with blood and who can no longer breathe and is going to die and does not understand anything at all about it there it is Having recovered my senses I was thirsty again so I lit a candle and went to the table on which my water bottle was I lifted it up and tilted it over my glass but nothing came out It was empty It was completely empty At first I could not understand it at all and then suddenly I was seized by such a terrible feeling that I had to sit down or rather I fell into a chair Then I sprang up with a bound to look about me and then I sat down again overcome by astonishment and fear in front of the transparent crystal bottle I looked at it with fixed eyes trying to conjecture and my hands trembled Somebody had drunk the water but who I I without any doubt It could surely only be I In that case I was a somnambulist I lived without knowing it that double mysterious life which makes us doubt whether there are not two beings in us or whether a strange unknowable and invisible being does not at such moments when our soul is in a state of torpor animate our captive body which obeys this other being as it does us ourselves and more than it does ourselves Oh Who will understand my horrible agony Who will understand the emotion of a man who is sound in mind wide awake full of sound sense and who looks in horror at the remains of a little water that has disappeared while he was asleep through the glass of a water bottle And I remained there until it was daylight without venturing to go to bed again July sixth I am going mad Again all the contents of my water bottle have been drunk during the night or rather I have drunk it But is it I Is it I Who could it be Who Oh God Am I going mad Who will save me July tenth I have just been through some surprising ordeals Decidedly I am mad And yet On July sixth before going to bed I put some wine milk water bread and strawberries on my table Somebody drank I drank all the water and a little of the milk but neither the wine bread nor the strawberries were touched On the seventh of July I renewed the same experiment with the same results and on July eighth I left out the water and the milk and nothing was touched Lastly on July ninth I put only water and milk on my table taking care to wrap up the bottles in white muslin and to tie down the stoppers Then I rubbed my lips my beard and my hands with pencil lead and went to bed Irresistible sleep seized me which was soon followed by a terrible awakening I had not moved and my sheets were not marked I rushed to the table The muslin round the bottles remained intact I undid the string trembling with fear All the water had been drunk and so had the milk Ah Great God I must start for Paris immediately July twelfth Paris I must have lost my head during the last few days I must be the plaything of my enervated imagination unless I am really a somnambulist or that I have been brought under the power of one of those influences which have been proved to exist but which have hitherto been inexplicable which are called suggestions In any case my mental state bordered on madness and twenty four hours of Paris sufficed to restore me to my equilibrium Yesterday after doing some business and paying some visits which instilled fresh and invigorating mental air into me I wound up my evening at the Theatre Francais A play by Alexandre Dumas the Younger was being acted and his active and powerful mind completed my cure Certainly solitude is dangerous for active minds We require men who can think and can talk around us When we are alone for a long time we people space with phantoms I returned along the boulevards to my hotel in excellent spirits Amid the jostling of the crowd I thought not without irony of my terrors and surmises of the previous week because I believed yes I believed that an invisible being lived beneath my roof How weak our head is and how quickly it is terrified and goes astray as soon as we are struck by a small incomprehensible fact Instead of concluding with these simple words I do not understand because the cause escapes me we immediately imagine terrible mysteries and supernatural powers July fourteenth Fete of the Republic I walked through the streets and the crackers and flags amused me like a child Still it is very foolish to be merry on a fixed date by a Government decree The populace is an imbecile flock of sheep now steadily patient and now in ferocious revolt Say to it Amuse yourself and it amuses itself Say to it Go and fight with your neighbor and it goes and fights Say to it Vote for the Emperor and it votes for the Emperor and then say to it Vote for the Republic and it votes for the Republic Those who direct it are also stupid but instead of obeying men they obey principles which can only be stupid sterile and false for the very reason that they are principles that is to say ideas which are considered as certain and unchangeable in this world where one is certain of nothing since light is an illusion and noise is an illusion July sixteenth I saw some things yesterday that troubled me very much I was dining at my cousin s Madame Sable whose husband is colonel of the seventy sixth Chasseurs at Limoges There were two young women there one of whom had married a medical man doctor Parent who devotes himself a great deal to nervous diseases and the extraordinary manifestations to which at this moment experiments in hypnotism and suggestion give rise He related to us at some length the enormous results obtained by English scientists and the doctors of the medical school at Nancy and the facts which he adduced appeared to me so strange that I declared that I was altogether incredulous We are he declared on the point of discovering one of the most important secrets of nature I mean to say one of its most important secrets on this earth for there are certainly some which are of a different kind of importance up in the stars yonder Ever since man has thought since he has been able to express and write down his thoughts he has felt himself close to a mystery which is impenetrable to his coarse and imperfect senses and he endeavors to supplement the want of power of his organs by the efforts of his intellect As long as that intellect still remained in its elementary stage this intercourse with invisible spirits assumed forms which were commonplace though terrifying Thence sprang the popular belief in the supernatural the legends of wandering spirits of fairies of gnomes ghosts I might even say the legend of God for our conceptions of the workman creator from whatever religion they may have come down to us are certainly the most mediocre the stupidest and the most unacceptable inventions that ever sprang from the frightened brain of any human creatures Nothing is truer than what Voltaire says God made man in His own image but man has certainly paid Him back again But for rather more than a century men seem to have had a presentiment of something new Mesmer and some others have put us on an unexpected track and especially within the last two or three years we have arrived at really surprising results My cousin who is also very incredulous smiled and doctor Parent said to her Would you like me to try and send you to sleep Madame Yes certainly She sat down in an easy chair and he began to look at her fixedly so as to fascinate her I suddenly felt myself somewhat uncomfortable with a beating heart and a choking feeling in my throat I saw that Madame Sable s eyes were growing heavy her mouth twitched and her bosom heaved and at the end of ten minutes she was asleep Stand behind her the doctor said to me and so I took a seat behind her He put a visiting card into her hands and said to her This is a looking glass what do you see in it And she replied I see my cousin What is he doing He is twisting his mustache And now He is taking a photograph out of his pocket Whose photograph is it His own That was true and that photograph had been given me that same evening at the hotel What is his attitude in this portrait He is standing up with his hat in his hand So she saw on that card on that piece of white pasteboard as if she had seen it in a looking glass The young women were frightened and exclaimed That is quite enough Quite quite enough But the doctor said to her authoritatively You will get up at eight o clock to morrow morning then you will go and call on your cousin at his hotel and ask him to lend you five thousand francs which your husband demands of you and which he will ask for when he sets out on his coming journey Then he woke her up On returning to my hotel I thought over this curious seance and I was assailed by doubts not as to my cousin s absolute and undoubted good faith for I had known her as well as if she had been my own sister ever since she was a child but as to a possible trick on the doctor s part Had not he perhaps kept a glass hidden in his hand which he showed to the young woman in her sleep at the same time as he did the card Professional conjurers do things which are just as singular So I went home and to bed and this morning at about half past eight I was awakened by my footman who said to me Madame Sable has asked to see you immediately Monsieur so I dressed hastily and went to her She sat down in some agitation with her eyes on the floor and without raising her veil she said to me My dear cousin I am going to ask a great favor of you What is it cousin I do not like to tell you and yet I must I am in absolute want of five thousand francs What you Yes I or rather my husband who has asked me to procure them for him I was so stupefied that I stammered out my answers I asked myself whether she had not really been making fun of me with Doctor Parent if it were not merely a very well acted farce which had been got up beforehand On looking at her attentively however my doubts disappeared She was trembling with grief so painful was this step to her and I was sure that her throat was full of sobs I knew that she was very rich and so I continued What Has not your husband five thousand francs at his disposal Come think Are you sure that he commissioned you to ask me for them She hesitated for a few seconds as if she were making a great effort to search her memory and then she replied Yes yes I am quite sure of it He has written to you She hesitated again and reflected and I guessed the torture of her thoughts She did not know She only knew that she was to borrow five thousand francs of me for her husband So she told a lie Yes he has written to me When pray You did not mention it to me yesterday I received his letter this morning Can you show it me No no no it contained private matters things too personal to ourselves I burnt it So your husband runs into debt She hesitated again and then murmured I do not know Thereupon I said bluntly I have not five thousand francs at my disposal at this moment my dear cousin She uttered a kind of cry as if she were in pain and said Oh oh I beseech you I beseech you to get them for me She got excited and clasped her hands as if she were praying to me I heard her voice change its tone she wept and stammered harassed and dominated by the irresistible order that she had received Oh oh I beg you to if you knew what I am suffering I want them to day I had pity on her You shall have them by and by I swear to you Oh thank you thank you How kind you are I continued Do you remember what took place at your house last night Yes Do you remember that Doctor Parent sent you to sleep Yes Oh Very well then he ordered you to come to me this morning to borrow five thousand francs and at this moment you are obeying that suggestion She considered for a few moments and then replied But as it is my husband who wants them For a whole hour I tried to convince her but could not succeed and when she had gone I went to the doctor He was just going out and he listened to me with a smile and said Do you believe now Yes I cannot help it Let us go to your cousin s She was already dozing on a couch overcome with fatigue The doctor felt her pulse looked at her for some time with one hand raised toward her eyes which she closed by degrees under the irresistible power of this magnetic influence and when she was asleep he said Your husband does not require the five thousand francs any longer You must therefore forget that you asked your cousin to lend them to you and if he speaks to you about it you will not understand him Then he woke her up and I took out a pocketbook and said Here is what you asked me for this morning my dear cousin But she was so surprised that I did not venture to persist nevertheless I tried to recall the circumstance to her but she denied it vigorously thought that I was making fun of her and in the end very nearly lost her temper There I have just come back and I have not been able to eat any lunch for this experiment has altogether upset me July nineteenth Many people to whom I have told the adventure have laughed at me I no longer know what to think The wise man says Perhaps July twenty first I dined at Bougival and then I spent the evening at a boatmen s ball Decidedly everything depends on place and surroundings It would be the height of folly to believe in the supernatural on the ile de la Grenouilliere one but on the top of Mont Saint Michel and in India We are terribly under the influence of our surroundings I shall return home next week one Frog island July thirtieth I came back to my own house yesterday Everything is going on well August twod Nothing fresh it is splendid weather and I spend my days in watching the Seine flow past August fourth Quarrels among my servants They declare that the glasses are broken in the cupboards at night The footman accuses the cook who accuses the needlewoman who accuses the other two Who is the culprit A clever person to be able to tell August sixth This time I am not mad I have seen I have seen I have seen I can doubt no longer I have seen it I was walking at two o clock among my rose trees in the full sunlight in the walk bordered by autumn roses which are beginning to fall As I stopped to look at a Geant de Bataille which had three splendid blooms I distinctly saw the stalk of one of the roses bend close to me as if an invisible hand had bent it and then break as if that hand had picked it Then the flower raised itself following the curve which a hand would have described in carrying it toward a mouth and it remained suspended in the transparent air all alone and motionless a terrible red spot three yards from my eyes In desperation I rushed at it to take it I found nothing it had disappeared Then I was seized with furious rage against myself for it is not allowable for a reasonable and serious man to have such hallucinations But was it a hallucination I turned round to look for the stalk and I found it immediately under the bush freshly broken between two other roses which remained on the branch and I returned home then with a much disturbed mind for I am certain now as certain as I am of the alternation of day and night that there exists close to me an invisible being that lives on milk and on water which can touch objects take them and change their places which is consequently endowed with a material nature although it is imperceptible to our senses and which lives as I do under my roof August seventh I slept tranquilly He drank the water out of my decanter but did not disturb my sleep I ask myself whether I am mad As I was walking just now in the sun by the riverside doubts as to my own sanity arose in me not vague doubts such as I have had hitherto but precise and absolute doubts I have seen mad people and I have known some who have been quite intelligent lucid even clear sighted in every concern of life except on one point They spoke clearly readily profoundly on everything when suddenly their thoughts struck upon the breakers of their madness and broke to pieces there and were dispersed and foundered in that furious and terrible sea full of bounding waves fogs and squalls which is called madness I certainly should think that I was mad absolutely mad if I were not conscious did not perfectly know my state if I did fathom it by analyzing it with the most complete lucidity I should in fact be a reasonable man who was laboring under a hallucination Some unknown disturbance must have been excited in my brain one of those disturbances which physiologists of the present day try to note and to fix precisely and that disturbance must have caused a profound gulf in my mind and in the order and logic of my ideas Similar phenomena occur in the dreams which lead us through the most unlikely phantasmagoria without causing us any surprise because our verifying apparatus and our sense of control has gone to sleep while our imaginative faculty wakes and works Is it not possible that one of the imperceptible keys of the cerebral finger board has been paralyzed in me Some men lose the recollection of proper names or of verbs or of numbers or merely of dates in consequence of an accident The localization of all the particles of thought has been proved nowadays what then would there be surprising in the fact that my faculty of controlling the unreality of certain hallucinations should be destroyed for the time being I thought of all this as I walked by the side of the water The sun was shining brightly on the river and made earth delightful while it filled my looks with love for life for the swallows whose agility is always delightful in my eyes for the plants by the riverside whose rustling is a pleasure to my ears By degrees however an inexplicable feeling of discomfort seized me It seemed to me as if some unknown force were numbing and stopping me were preventing me from going farther and were calling me back I felt that painful wish to return which oppresses you when you have left a beloved invalid at home and when you are seized by a presentiment that he is worse I therefore returned in spite of myself feeling certain that I should find some bad news awaiting me a letter or a telegram There was nothing however and I was more surprised and uneasy than if I had had another fantastic vision August eighth I spent a terrible evening yesterday He does not show himself any more but I feel that he is near me watching me looking at me penetrating me dominating me and more redoubtable when he hides himself thus than if he were to manifest his constant and invisible presence by supernatural phenomena However I slept August ninth Nothing but I am afraid August tenth Nothing what will happen to morrow August eleventh Still nothing I cannot stop at home with this fear hanging over me and these thoughts in my mind I shall go away August twelfth Ten o clock at night All day long I have been trying to get away and have not been able I wished to accomplish this simple and easy act of liberty go out get into my carriage in order to go to Rouen and I have not been able to do it What is the reason August thirteenth When one is attacked by certain maladies all the springs of our physical being appear to be broken all our energies destroyed all our muscles relaxed our bones to have become as soft as our flesh and our blood as liquid as water I am experiencing that in my moral being in a strange and distressing manner I have no longer any strength any courage any self control nor even any power to set my own will in motion I have no power left to will anything but some one does it for me and I obey August fourteenth I am lost Somebody possesses my soul and governs it Somebody orders all my acts all my movements all my thoughts I am no longer anything in myself nothing except an enslaved and terrified spectator of all the things which I do I wish to go out I cannot He does not wish to and so I remain trembling and distracted in the armchair in which he keeps me sitting I merely wish to get up and to rouse myself so as to think that I am still master of myself I cannot I am riveted to my chair and my chair adheres to the ground in such a manner that no force could move us Then suddenly I must I must go to the bottom of my garden to pick some strawberries and eat them and I go there I pick the strawberries and I eat them Oh my God my God Is there a God If there be one deliver me save me succor me Pardon Pity Mercy Save me Oh what sufferings what torture what horror August fifteenth Certainly this is the way in which my poor cousin was possessed and swayed when she came to borrow five thousand francs of me She was under the power of a strange will which had entered into her like another soul like another parasitic and ruling soul Is the world coming to an end But who is he this invisible being that rules me This unknowable being this rover of a supernatural race Invisible beings exist then How is it then that since the beginning of the world they have never manifested themselves in such a manner precisely as they do to me I have never read anything which resembles what goes on in my house Oh If I could only leave it if I could only go away and flee so as never to return I should be saved but I cannot August sixteenth I managed to escape to day for two hours like a prisoner who finds the door of his dungeon accidentally open I suddenly felt that I was free and that he was far away and so I gave orders to put the horses in as quickly as possible and I drove to Rouen Oh How delightful to be able to say to a man who obeyed you Go to Rouen I made him pull up before the library and I begged them to lend me doctor Herrmann Herestauss s treatise on the unknown inhabitants of the ancient and modern world Then as I was getting into my carriage I intended to say To the railway station but instead of this I shouted I did not say but I shouted in such a loud voice that all the passers by turned round Home and I fell back onto the cushion of my carriage overcome by mental agony He had found me out and regained possession of me August seventeenth Oh What a night what a night And yet it seems to me that I ought to rejoice I read until one o clock in the morning Herestauss Doctor of Philosophy and Theogony wrote the history and the manifestation of all those invisible beings which hover around man or of whom he dreams He describes their origin their domains their power but none of them resembles the one which haunts me One might say that man ever since he has thought has had a foreboding of and feared a new being stronger than himself his successor in this world and that feeling him near and not being able to foretell the nature of that master he has in his terror created the whole race of hidden beings of vague phantoms born of fear Having therefore read until one o clock in the morning I went and sat down at the open window in order to cool my forehead and my thoughts in the calm night air It was very pleasant and warm How I should have enjoyed such a night formerly There was no moon but the stars darted out their rays in the dark heavens Who inhabits those worlds What forms what living beings what animals are there yonder What do those who are thinkers in those distant worlds know more than we do What can they do more than we can What do they see which we do not know Will not one of them some day or other traversing space appear on our earth to conquer it just as the Norsemen formerly crossed the sea in order to subjugate nations more feeble than themselves We are so weak so unarmed so ignorant so small we who live on this particle of mud which turns round in a drop of water I fell asleep dreaming thus in the cool night air and then having slept for about three quarters of an hour I opened my eyes without moving awakened by I know not what confused and strange sensation At first I saw nothing and then suddenly it appeared to me as if a page of a book which had remained open on my table turned over of its own accord Not a breath of air had come in at my window and I was surprised and waited In about four minutes I saw I saw yes I saw with my own eyes another page lift itself up and fall down on the others as if a finger had turned it over My armchair was empty appeared empty but I knew that he was there he and sitting in my place and that he was reading With a furious bound the bound of an enraged wild beast that wishes to disembowel its tamer I crossed my room to seize him to strangle him to kill him But before I could reach it my chair fell over as if somebody had run away from me my table rocked my lamp fell and went out and my window closed as if some thief had been surprised and had fled out into the night shutting it behind him So he had run away he had been afraid he afraid of me So so to morrow or later some day or other I should be able to hold him in my clutches and crush him against the ground Do not dogs occasionally bite and strangle their masters August eighteenth I have been thinking the whole day long Oh yes I will obey him follow his impulses fulfill all his wishes show myself humble submissive a coward He is the stronger but an hour will come August nineteenth I know I know I know all I have just read the following in the Revue du Monde Scientifique A curious piece of news comes to us from Rio de Janeiro Madness an epidemic of madness which may be compared to that contagious madness which attacked the people of Europe in the Middle Ages is at this moment raging in the Province of San Paulo The frightened inhabitants are leaving their houses deserting their villages abandoning their land saying that they are pursued possessed governed like human cattle by invisible though tangible beings a species of vampire which feed on their life while they are asleep and who besides drink water and milk without appearing to touch any other nourishment Professor Dom Pedro Henriques accompanied by several medical savants has gone to the Province of San Paulo in order to study the origin and the manifestations of this surprising madness on the spot and to propose such measures to the Emperor as may appear to him to be most fitted to restore the mad population to reason Ah Ah I remember now that fine Brazilian three master which passed in front of my windows as it was going up the Seine on the eighth of last May I thought it looked so pretty so white and bright That Being was on board of her coming from there where its race sprang from And it saw me It saw my house which was also white and it sprang from the ship onto the land Oh Good heavens Now I know I can divine The reign of man is over and he has come He whom disquieted priests exorcised whom sorcerers evoked on dark nights without yet seeing him appear to whom the presentiments of the transient masters of the world lent all the monstrous or graceful forms of gnomes spirits genii fairies and familiar spirits After the coarse conceptions of primitive fear more clear sighted men foresaw it more clearly Mesmer divined him and ten years ago physicians accurately discovered the nature of his power even before he exercised it himself They played with that weapon of their new Lord the sway of a mysterious will over the human soul which had become enslaved They called it magnetism hypnotism suggestion what do I know I have seen them amusing themselves like impudent children with this horrible power Woe to us Woe to man He has come the the what does he call himself the I fancy that he is shouting out his name to me and I do not hear him the yes he is shouting it out I am listening I cannot repeat it Horla I have heard the Horla it is he the Horla he has come Ah the vulture has eaten the pigeon the wolf has eaten the lamb the lion has devoured the buffalo with sharp horns man has killed the lion with an arrow with a sword with gunpowder but the Horla will make of man what we have made of the horse and of the ox his chattel his slave and his food by the mere power of his will Woe to us But nevertheless the animal sometimes revolts and kills the man who has subjugated it I should also like I shall be able to but I must know him touch him see him Learned men say that beasts eyes as they differ from ours do not distinguish like ours do And my eye cannot distinguish this newcomer who is oppressing me Why Oh Now I remember the words of the monk at Mont Saint Michel Can we see the hundred thousandth part of what exists Look here there is the wind which is the strongest force in nature which knocks men and blows down buildings uproots trees raises the sea into mountains of water destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the breakers the wind which kills which whistles which sighs which roars have you ever seen it and can you see it It exists for all that however And I went on thinking my eyes are so weak so imperfect that they do not even distinguish hard bodies if they are as transparent as glass If a glass without tinfoil behind it were to bar my way I should run into it just as a bird which has flown into a room breaks its head against the window panes A thousand things moreover deceive him and lead him astray How should it then be surprising that he cannot perceive a fresh body which is traversed by the light A new being Why not It was assuredly bound to come Why should we be the last We do not distinguish it like all the others created before us The reason is that its nature is more perfect its body finer and more finished than ours that ours is so weak so awkwardly conceived encumbered with organs that are always tired always on the strain like locks that are too complicated which lives like a plant and like a beast nourishing itself with difficulty on air herbs and flesh an animal machine which is a prey to maladies to malformations to decay broken winded badly regulated simple and eccentric ingeniously badly made a coarse and a delicate work the outline of a being which might become intelligent and grand We are only a few so few in this world from the oyster up to man Why should there not be one more when once that period is accomplished which separates the successive apparitions from all the different species Why not one more Why not also other trees with immense splendid flowers perfuming whole regions Why not other elements besides fire air earth and water There are four only four those nursing fathers of various beings What a pity Why are they not forty four hundred four thousand How poor everything is how mean and wretched grudgingly given dryly invented clumsily made Ah the elephant and the hippopotamus what grace And the camel what elegance But the butterfly you will say a flying flower I dream of one that should be as large as a hundred worlds with wings whose shape beauty colors and motion I cannot even express But I see it it flutters from star to star refreshing them and perfuming them with the light and harmonious breath of its flight And the people up there look at it as it passes in an ecstasy of delight What is the matter with me It is he the Horla who haunts me and who makes me think of these foolish things He is within me he is becoming my soul I shall kill him August nineteenth I shall kill him I have seen him Yesterday I sat down at my table and pretended to write very assiduously I knew quite well that he would come prowling round me quite close to me so close that I might perhaps be able to touch him to seize him And then then I should have the strength of desperation I should have my hands my knees my chest my forehead my teeth to strangle him to crush him to bite him to tear him to pieces And I watched for him with all my overexcited organs I had lighted my two lamps and the eight wax candles on my mantelpiece as if by this light I could have discovered him My bed my old oak bed with its columns was opposite to me on my right was the fireplace on my left the door which was carefully closed after I had left it open for some time in order to attract him behind me was a very high wardrobe with a looking glass in it which served me to make my toilet every day and in which I was in the habit of looking at myself from head to foot every time I passed it So I pretended to be writing in order to deceive him for he also was watching me and suddenly I felt I was certain that he was reading over my shoulder that he was there almost touching my ear I got up so quickly with my hands extended that I almost fell Eh well It was as bright as at midday but I did not see myself in the glass It was empty clear profound full of light But my figure was not reflected in it and I I was opposite to it I saw the large clear glass from top to bottom and I looked at it with unsteady eyes and I did not dare to advance I did not venture to make a movement nevertheless feeling perfectly that he was there but that he would escape me again he whose imperceptible body had absorbed my reflection How frightened I was And then suddenly I began to see myself through a mist in the depths of the looking glass in a mist as it were through a sheet of water and it seemed to me as if this water were flowing slowly from left to right and making my figure clearer every moment It was like the end of an eclipse Whatever it was that hid me did not appear to possess any clearly defined outlines but a sort of opaque transparency which gradually grew clearer At last I was able to distinguish myself completely as I do every day when I look at myself I had seen it And the horror of it remained with me and makes me shudder even now August twentieth How could I kill it as I could not get hold of it Poison But it would see me mix it with the water and then would our poisons have any effect on its impalpable body No no no doubt about the matter Then then August twenty first I sent for a blacksmith from Rouen and ordered iron shutters of him for my room such as some private hotels in Paris have on the ground floor for fear of thieves and he is going to make me a similar door as well I have made myself out as a coward but I do not care about that September tenth Rouen Hotel Continental It is done it is done but is he dead My mind is thoroughly upset by what I have seen Well then yesterday the locksmith having put on the iron shutters and door I left everything open until midnight although it was getting cold Suddenly I felt that he was there and joy mad joy took possession of me I got up softly and I walked to the right and left for some time so that he might not guess anything then I took off my boots and put on my slippers carelessly then I fastened the iron shutters and going back to the door quickly I double locked it with a padlock putting the key into my pocket Suddenly I noticed that he was moving restlessly round me that in his turn he was frightened and was ordering me to let him out I nearly yielded though I did not yet but putting my back to the door I half opened it just enough to allow me to go out backward and as I am very tall my head touched the lintel I was sure that he had not been able to escape and I shut him up quite alone quite alone What happiness I had him fast Then I ran downstairs in the drawing room which was under my bedroom I took the two lamps and I poured all the oil onto the carpet the furniture everywhere then I set fire to it and made my escape after having carefully double locked the door I went and hid myself at the bottom of the garden in a clump of laurel bushes How long it was how long it was Everything was dark silent motionless not a breath of air and not a star but heavy banks of clouds which one could not see but which weighed oh so heavily on my soul I looked at my house and waited How long it was I already began to think that the fire had gone out of its own accord or that he had extinguished it when one of the lower windows gave way under the violence of the flames and a long soft caressing sheet of red flame mounted up the white wall and kissed it as high as the roof The light fell onto the trees the branches and the leaves and a shiver of fear pervaded them also The birds awoke a dog began to howl and it seemed to me as if the day were breaking Almost immediately two other windows flew into fragments and I saw that the whole of the lower part of my house was nothing but a terrible furnace But a cry a horrible shrill heartrending cry a woman s cry sounded through the night and two garret windows were opened I had forgotten the servants I saw the terrorstruck faces and their frantically waving arms Then overwhelmed with horror I set off to run to the village shouting Help help fire fire I met some people who were already coming onto the scene and I went back with them to see By this time the house was nothing but a horrible and magnificent funeral pile a monstrous funeral pile which lit up the whole country a funeral pile where men were burning and where he was burning also He He my prisoner that new Being the new master the Horla Suddenly the whole roof fell in between the walls and a volcano of flames darted up to the sky Through all the windows which opened onto that furnace I saw the flames darting and I thought that he was there in that kiln dead Dead perhaps His body Was not his body which was transparent indestructible by such means as would kill ours If he was not dead Perhaps time alone has power over that Invisible and Redoubtable Being Why this transparent unrecognizable body this body belonging to a spirit if it also had to fear ills infirmities and premature destruction Premature destruction All human terror springs from that After man the Horla After him who can die every day at any hour at any moment by any accident he came who was only to die at his own proper hour and minute because he had touched the limits of his existence No no without any doubt he is not dead Then then I suppose I must kill myself FOOTNOTE This story is a tragic experience and prophecy It was insanity that robbed the world of its most finished short story writer the author of this tale and even before his madness became overpowering de Maupassant complained that he was haunted by his double by a vision of another Self confronting and threatening him He had run life at its top speed this hallucination was the result Medical science defines in such cases an image of memory which differs in intensity from the normal that is to say a fixed idea so persistent and growing that to the thinker it seems utterly real EDITOR PIERRE MILLE The Miracle of Zobeide Always wise and prudent Zobeide cautiously put aside the myrtle branches and peeped through to see who were the persons talking by the fountain in the cool shadow of the pink sandstone wall And when she saw that it was only the reverend John Feathercock her lord and master discoursing as usual with Mohammed si Koualdia she went toward them frankly but slowly When she was quite near she stopped and from the light that played in her deep black eyes you would have thought that surely she was listening with the deepest attention But the truth is that with all her little brain with all her mouth and with all her stomach she was craving the yellow and odorous pulp of a melon which had been cut open and put on the table near two tall glasses half filled with snowy sherbet For Zobeide was a turtle of the ordinary kind found in the grass of all the meadows around the city of Damascus As she waited Mohammed continued his story And as I tell you O reverend one abounding in virtues this lion which still lives near Tabariat was formerly a strong lion a wonderful lion a lion among lions To day even he can strike a camel dead with one blow of his paw and then plunging his fangs into the spine of the dead animal toss it upon his shoulders with a single movement of his neck But unfortunately having one day brought down a goat in the chase by simply blowing upon it the breath of his nostrils the lion was inflated with pride and cried There is no god but God but I am as strong as God Let him acknowledge it Allah who heard him Allah the All powerful said in a loud voice O lion of Tabariat try now to carry off thy prey Then the lion planted his great teeth firmly in the spine of the animal right under the ears and attempted to throw it on his back Onallahi It was as though he had tried to lift Mount Libanus and his right leg fell lamed to the ground And the voice of Allah still held him declaring Lion nevermore shalt thou kill a goat And it has remained thus to this day the lion of Tabariat has still all his old time power to carry off camels but he can never do the slightest harm to even a new born kid The goats of the flocks dance in front of him at night deriding him to his face and always from that moment his right leg has been stiff and lame Mohammed said the reverend mister Feathercock contemptuously these are stories fit only for babies How then replied Mohammed si Koualdia Do you refuse to believe that God is able to do whatever he may wish that the world itself is but a perpetual dream of God s and that in consequence God may change this dream at will Are you a Christian if you deny the power of the All powerful I am a Christian replied the clergyman with a trace of embarrassment but for a long time we have been obliged to admit we pastors of the civilized Church of the Occident that God would not be able without belying himself to change the order of things which he established when he created the universe We consider that faith in miracles is a superstition which we must leave to the monks of the Churches of Rome and of Russia and also to your Mussulmans who live in ignorance of the truth And it is in order to teach you this truth that I have come here to your country and at the same time to fight against the pernicious political influence exerted by these same Romish and Greek monks of whom I have just been speaking By invoking the name of Allah responded Mohammed with intense solemnity and by virtue of the collar bone of the mighty Solomon I can perform great miracles You see this turtle before us I shall cause it to grow each day the breadth of a finger In saying these words he made a sudden movement of his foot toward Zobeide and Zobeide promptly drew her head into her shell You claim to be able to work a miracle like that said the clergyman scornfully You Mohammed a man immersed in sin a Mussulman whom I have seen drunk I was drunk replied Mohammed calmly but not as drunk as others So you think yourself able to force the power of Allah pursued mister Feathercock disdaining the interruption I could do it without a moment s difficulty said Mohammed Taking Zobeide in his hand he lifted her to the table The frightened turtle had again drawn in her head Nothing could be seen but the black encircled golden squares of her shell against a background of juicy melon pulp Mohammed chanted Thou thyself art a miracle O turtle For thy head is the head of a serpent thy tail the tail of a water rat thy bones are bird s bones and thy covering is of stone and yet thou knowest love as it is known by men And from thy eggs O turtle of stone other turtles come forth Thou thyself art a miracle O turtle For one would say that thou wert a shell naught but a shell and behold thou art a beast that eats Eat of this melon O turtle and grow this night the length of my nail if Allah permit And when thou hast grown by the breadth of a finger O turtle eat further of this melon or of its sister another melon and grow further by the breadth of a finger until thou hast reached the size of a mosque Thou thyself art a miracle O shell endowed with life Perform still another miracle if Allah permit if Allah permit Zobeide reassured by the monotony of his voice decided at last to come out of her shell First she showed the point of her little horny nose then her black eyes her flat pointed tail and finally her strong little claw tipped feet Seeing the melon she made a gesture of assent and began to eat Nothing in the world will happen remarked the reverend John Feathercock rather doubtfully Wait and see answered Mohammed gravely I shall come back to morrow The next morning he returned measured Zobeide with his fingers and declared She has grown Do you imagine you can make me believe such a thing cried mister Feathercock anxiously It is written in the Koran answered Mohammed I swear by the rosy glow which fills the air when the sun is setting by the shades of the night and by the light of the moon that ye shall all change in substance and in size Allah has manifested himself the size of this turtle has changed It will continue to change Measure it yourself and you will see mister Feathercock did measure Zobeide and was forced to admit that she had indeed grown the breadth of a finger He became thoughtful Thus day by day Zobeide grew in size in vigor and in appetite At first she had only been as big as a saucer and took each day but a few ounces of nourishment Then she reached the size of a dessert plate then of a soup plate With her strong beak she could split the rind of a melon at a blow distinctly could be heard the sound of her heavy jaws as she crunched the sweet pulp of the fruits which she loved and which she devoured in great quantities In one week she had grown so tremendously that she was as big as a meat platter The reverend mister Feathercock no longer dared to go near this monster from whose eyes seemed to glisten a look of deviltry And always and forever apparently devoured by a perpetual hunger the monster ate The members of mister Feathercock s flock came to hear that he was keeping in his house a turtle that had been enchanted in the name of Allah and not by the power of the Occidental Divinity this proved to be anything but helpful to the evangelical labors of the clergyman But he himself refused steadily and obstinately to believe in the miracle although Mohammed si Koualdia had never set foot in the house since the day when he had invoked the charm He remained outside the grounds seated at the door of a little cafe plunged in meditation or in dreams and consuming hashish in large quantities At the end of some time mister Feathercock succeeded in persuading himself that what he was witnessing was nothing more nor less than a perfectly simple and natural phenomenon perhaps not well understood hitherto and due entirely to the extraordinarily favorable action of melon pulp on the physical development of turtles He decided to cut off Zobeide s supply of melons Finally there came a day when Mohammed drunk with hashish saw Hakem mister Feathercock s valet returning from market with a large bunch of fresh greens He rose majestically though with features distorted by the drug and followed the boy with hasty steps Miserable one cried he to mister Feathercock Wretched worm you have tried to break the charm Rejoice then for you have succeeded and it is broken But let despair follow upon the heels of your rapture for it is broken in a way that you do not dream Henceforth your turtle shall dwindle away day by day The reverend mister Feathercock tried to laugh but he did not feel entirely happy On Sundays at the services the few faithful souls who remained in his flock looked upon him with suspicion At the English consulate they spoke very plainly telling him unsympathetically that anyone who would make a friend of such a man as Mohammed si Koualdia and who would mingle promiscuously with such rabble need look for nothing but harm from it Zobeide when she was first confronted with the fresh damp greens showed the most profound contempt for them Unquestionably she preferred melons mister Feathercock applauded his own acumen She was eating too much that was the whole trouble he said to himself And that was what made her grow so remarkably If she eats less she will probably not grow so much And if she should happen to die I shall be rid of her Whatever comes it will be for the best But the next day Zobeide gave up pouting and began very docilely to eat the greens and when the boy Hakem carried her next bunch to her he said slyly Effendi she is growing smaller The clergyman attempted to shrug his shoulders but it was impossible to disguise the fact from himself Zobeide had certainly shrunk And within an hour all Damascus knew that Zobeide had shrunk When mister Feathercock went to the barber shop the Greek barber said to him Sir your turtle is no ordinary turtle When he went to call on missus Hollingshead a lady who was always intensely interested in all subjects that she failed to understand and who discussed them with a beautiful freedom she said to him Dear sir your turtle How exciting it must be to watch it shrink I am certainly coming to see it myself When he went to the Anglican Orphanage all the little Syrians all the little Arabs all the little Armenians all the little Jews drew turtles in their copy books turtles of every size and every description the big ones walking behind the little ones the tail of each in the mouth of another making an interminable line And in the street the donkey drivers the water carriers the fishmongers the venders of broiled meats of baked breads of beans of cream all cried Mister Turtle Mister Turtle Try our wares Buy something for your poor stubborn beast that is pining away And in truth the turtle continued to shrink She became again the size of a soup plate then of a dessert plate then of a saucer till finally one morning there was nothing there but a little round thing tiny frail translucent a spot about as big as a lady s watch almost invisible at the base of the fountain And the next day ah the next day there was nothing there nothing whatever neither turtle nor the shadow of turtle or more trace of a turtle than of an elephant in all the grounds Mohammed si Koualdia had stopped taking hashish because he was saturated with it But he remained all day long huddled in a heap at the door of the little cafe immediately opposite the clergyman s house his eyes enlarged out of all proportion set in a face the color of death gave him the look of a veritable sorcerer At this moment the reverend mister Feathercock was returning from a visit to the English consul who had said to him coldly All that I can tell you is that you have made an ass of yourself or as a Frenchman would say played the donkey to hear yourself bray The best thing you can do is to go and hunt up a congregation somewhere else The reverend John Feathercock accepted the advice with deference and took the train for Bayreuth That same evening Mohammed si Koualdia betook himself to the house of one Antonio interpreter and public scribe and ordered him to translate into French the following letter which he dictated in Arabic Afterwards he carried this letter to Father Stephen prior to the monastery of the Greek Hicrosolymites May heaven paint your cheeks with the colors of health most venerable father and may happiness reign in your heart I have the honor to inform you that the reverend John Feathercock has just left for Bayreuth but that he has had put upon his trunks the address of a city called Liverpool which I am informed is in the kingdom of England and also everything points to the belief that he will never return Therefore I dare to hope that you will send me the second part of the reward you agreed upon as well as a generous present for Hakem mister Feathercock s valet who carried every day a new turtle to the house of the clergyman and carried away the old one under his cloak I also pray you to tell your friends that I have for sale at prices exceptionally low fifty five turtles all of different sizes the last and smallest of which is no larger than the watch of a European houri I have been at infinite pains to find them and they have served to prove to me with what exquisite care Allah fashions the members of the least of His creatures and ornaments their bodies with the most delicate designs VILLIERS DE L ISLE ADAM The Torture by Hope Many years ago as evening was closing in the venerable Pedro Arbuez d Espila sixth prior of the Dominicans of Segovia and third Grand Inquisitor of Spain followed by a fra redemptor and preceded by two familiars of the Holy Office the latter carrying lanterns made their way to a subterranean dungeon The bolt of a massive door creaked and they entered a mephitic in pace where the dim light revealed between rings fastened to the wall a bloodstained rack a brazier and a jug On a pile of straw loaded with fetters and his neck encircled by an iron carcan sat a haggard man of uncertain age clothed in rags 
3549_9203_000003_000000	train-clean-360	This prisoner was no other than Rabbi Aser Abarbanel a Jew of Arragon who accused of usury and pitiless scorn for the poor had been daily subjected to torture for more than a year 
3549_9203_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Yet his blindness was as dense as his hide and he had refused to abjure his faith 
3549_9203_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Proud of a filiation dating back thousands of years proud of his ancestors for all Jews worthy of the name are vain of their blood he descended Talmudically from Othoniel and consequently from Ipsiboa the wife of the last judge of Israel a circumstance which had sustained his courage amid incessant torture 
3549_9203_000004_000001	train-clean-360	With tears in his eyes at the thought of this resolute soul rejecting salvation the venerable Pedro Arbuez d Espila approaching the shuddering rabbi addressed him as follows 
3549_9203_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 My son rejoice your trials here below are about to end 
3549_9203_000005_000001	train-clean-360	If in the presence of such obstinacy I was forced to permit with deep regret the use of great severity my task of fraternal correction has its limits 
3549_9203_000005_000002	train-clean-360	You are the fig tree which having failed so many times to bear fruit at last withered but God alone can judge your soul 
3549_9203_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Perhaps Infinite Mercy will shine upon you at the last moment 
3549_9203_000005_000004	train-clean-360	We must hope so There are examples 
3549_9203_000005_000005	train-clean-360	So sleep in peace to night 
none	none	Tomorrow you will be included in the auto da fe that is you will be exposed to the quemadero the symbolical flames of the Everlasting Fire it burns as you know only at a distance my son and Death is at least two hours often three in coming on account of the wet iced bandages with which we protect the heads and hearts of the condemned There will be forty three of you 
3549_9203_000005_000008	train-clean-360	Placed in the last row you will have time to invoke God and offer to Him this baptism of fire which is of the Holy Spirit 
3549_9203_000005_000009	train-clean-360	Hope in the Light and rest 
3549_9203_000006_000000	train-clean-360	With these words having signed to his companions to unchain the prisoner the prior tenderly embraced him 
none	none	Then came the turn of the fra redemptor who in a low tone entreated the Jew s forgiveness for what he had made him suffer for the purpose of redeeming him then the two familiars silently kissed him 
3549_9203_000006_000002	train-clean-360	This ceremony over the captive was left solitary and bewildered in the darkness 
none	none	Rabbi Aser Abarbanel with parched lips and visage worn by suffering at first gazed at the closed door with vacant eyes Closed The word unconsciously roused a vague fancy in his mind the fancy that he had seen for an instant the light of the lanterns through a chink between the door and the wall A morbid idea of hope due to the weakness of his brain stirred his whole being He dragged himself toward the strange appearance 
3549_9203_000007_000005	train-clean-360	Then very gently and cautiously slipping one finger into the crevice he drew the door toward him 
none	none	Marvelous 
3549_9203_000007_000007	train-clean-360	By an extraordinary accident the familiar who closed it had turned the huge key an instant before it struck the stone casing so that the rusty bolt not having entered the hole the door again rolled on its hinges 
3549_9203_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The rabbi ventured to glance outside 
3549_9203_000008_000001	train-clean-360	By the aid of a sort of luminous dusk he distinguished at first a semicircle of walls indented by winding stairs and opposite to him at the top of five or six stone steps a sort of black portal opening into an immense corridor whose first arches only were visible from below 
3549_9203_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Stretching himself flat he crept to the threshold 
3549_9203_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Yes it was really a corridor but endless in length 
none	none	A wan light illumined it lamps suspended from the vaulted ceiling lightened at intervals the dull hue of the atmosphere the distance was veiled in shadow Not a single door appeared in the whole extent Only on one side the left heavily grated loopholes sunk in the walls admitted a light which must be that of evening for crimson bars at intervals rested on the flags of the pavement 
3549_9203_000009_000005	train-clean-360	What a terrible silence 
3549_9203_000009_000006	train-clean-360	Yet yonder at the far end of that passage there might be a doorway of escape 
none	none	The Jew s vacillating hope was tenacious for it was the last 
3549_9203_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Without hesitating he ventured on the flags keeping close under the loopholes trying to make himself part of the blackness of the long walls 
3549_9203_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He advanced slowly dragging himself along on his breast forcing back the cry of pain when some raw wound sent a keen pang through his whole body 
none	none	Suddenly the sound of a sandaled foot approaching reached his ears He trembled violently fear stifled him his sight grew dim 
3549_9203_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Well it was over no doubt 
3549_9203_000011_000003	train-clean-360	He pressed himself into a niche and half lifeless with terror waited 
none	none	It was a familiar hurrying along 
3549_9203_000012_000001	train-clean-360	He passed swiftly by holding in his clenched hand an instrument of torture a frightful figure and vanished 
3549_9203_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The suspense which the rabbi had endured seemed to have suspended the functions of life and he lay nearly an hour unable to move 
3549_9203_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Fearing an increase of tortures if he were captured he thought of returning to his dungeon 
none	none	But the old hope whispered in his soul that divine perhaps which comforts us in our sorest trials 
3549_9203_000012_000005	train-clean-360	A miracle had happened 
3549_9203_000012_000006	train-clean-360	He could doubt no longer 
3549_9203_000012_000007	train-clean-360	He began to crawl toward the chance of escape 
3549_9203_000012_000008	train-clean-360	Exhausted by suffering and hunger trembling with pain he pressed onward 
none	none	The sepulchral corridor seemed to lengthen mysteriously while he still advancing gazed into the gloom where there must be some avenue of escape Oh oh 
3549_9203_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He again heard footsteps but this time they were slower more heavy 
3549_9203_000013_000002	train-clean-360	The white and black forms of two inquisitors appeared emerging from the obscurity beyond 
3549_9203_000013_000003	train-clean-360	They were conversing in low tones and seemed to be discussing some important subject for they were gesticulating vehemently 
none	none	At this spectacle Rabbi Aser Abarbanel closed his eyes his heart beat so violently that it almost suffocated him his rags were damp with the cold sweat of agony he lay motionless by the wall his mouth wide open under the rays of a lamp praying to the God of David 
3549_9203_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Just opposite to him the two inquisitors paused under the light of the lamp doubtless owing to some accident due to the course of their argument 
3549_9203_000015_000001	train-clean-360	One while listening to his companion gazed at the rabbi And beneath the look whose absence of expression the hapless man did not at first notice he fancied he again felt the burning pincers scorch his flesh he was to be once more a living wound 
3549_9203_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Fainting breathless with fluttering eyelids he shivered at the touch of the monk s floating robe 
none	none	But strange yet natural fact the inquisitor s gaze was evidently that of a man deeply absorbed in his intended reply engrossed by what he was hearing his eyes were fixed and seemed to look at the Jew without seeing him In fact after the lapse of a few minutes the two gloomy figures slowly pursued their way still conversing in low tones toward the place whence the prisoner had come HE HAD NOT BEEN SEEN 
3549_9203_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Amid the horrible confusion of the rabbi s thoughts the idea darted through his brain Can I be already dead that they did not see me A hideous impression roused him from his lethargy in looking at the wall against which his face was pressed he imagined he beheld two fierce eyes watching him 
none	none	He flung his head back in a sudden frenzy of fright his hair fairly bristling 
3549_9203_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Yet no No 
none	none	His hand groped over the stones it was the reflection of the inquisitor s eyes still retained in his own which had been refracted from two spots on the wall Forward 
3549_9203_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He must hasten toward that goal which he fancied absurdly no doubt to be deliverance toward the darkness from which he was now barely thirty paces distant 
3549_9203_000017_000002	train-clean-360	He pressed forward faster on his knees his hands at full length dragging himself painfully along and soon entered the dark portion of this terrible corridor 
3549_9203_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly the poor wretch felt a gust of cold air on the hands resting upon the flags it came from under the little door to which the two walls led 
none	none	Oh Heaven if that door should open outward 
3549_9203_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Every nerve in the miserable fugitive s body thrilled with hope 
3549_9203_000019_000002	train-clean-360	He examined it from top to bottom though scarcely able to distinguish its outlines in the surrounding darkness 
3549_9203_000019_000003	train-clean-360	He passed his hand over it no bolt no lock 
3549_9203_000019_000004	train-clean-360	A latch 
3549_9203_000019_000005	train-clean-360	He started up the latch yielded to the pressure of his thumb the door silently swung open before him 
3549_9203_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 HALLELUIA murmured the rabbi in a transport of gratitude as standing on the threshold he beheld the scene before him 
3549_9203_000021_000000	train-clean-360	The door had opened into the gardens above which arched a starlit sky into spring liberty life 
3549_9203_000021_000001	train-clean-360	It revealed the neighboring fields stretching toward the sierras whose sinuous blue lines were relieved against the horizon 
3549_9203_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Yonder lay freedom 
3549_9203_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Oh to escape 
3549_9203_000021_000004	train-clean-360	He would journey all night through the lemon groves whose fragrance reached him 
3549_9203_000021_000005	train-clean-360	Once in the mountains and he was safe 
3549_9203_000021_000006	train-clean-360	He inhaled the delicious air the breeze revived him his lungs expanded 
none	none	He felt in his swelling heart the Veni foras of Lazarus 
3549_9203_000021_000008	train-clean-360	And to thank once more the God who had bestowed this mercy upon him he extended his arms raising his eyes toward Heaven 
3549_9203_000021_000009	train-clean-360	It was an ecstasy of joy 
3549_9203_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Then he fancied he saw the shadow of his arms approach him fancied that he felt these shadowy arms inclose embrace him and that he was pressed tenderly to some one s breast 
none	none	A tall figure actually did stand directly before him 
3549_9203_000022_000002	train-clean-360	He lowered his eyes and remained motionless gasping for breath dazed with fixed eyes fairly driveling with terror 
none	none	Horror 
3549_9203_000023_000001	train-clean-360	He was in the clasp of the Grand Inquisitor himself the venerable Pedro Arbuez d Espila who gazed at him with tearful eyes like a good shepherd who had found his stray lamb 
3549_9203_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The dark robed priest pressed the hapless Jew to his heart with so fervent an outburst of love that the edges of the monochal haircloth rubbed the Dominican s breast 
none	none	And while Aser Abarbanel with protruding eyes gasped in agony in the ascetic s embrace vaguely comprehending that all the phases of this fatal evening were only a prearranged torture that of HOPE the Grand Inquisitor with an accent of touching reproach and a look of consternation murmured in his ear his breath parched and burning from long fasting What my son On the eve perchance of salvation you wished to leave us ERCKMANN CHATRIAN The Owl s Ear On the twenty ninth of July eighteen thirty five Kasper Boeck a shepherd of the little village of Hirschwiller with his large felt hat tipped back his wallet of stringy sackcloth hanging at his hip and his great tawny dog at his heels presented himself at about nine o clock in the evening at the house of the burgomaster Petrus Mauerer who had just finished supper and was taking a little glass of kirchwasser to facilitate digestion This burgomaster was a tall thin man and wore a bushy gray mustache He had seen service in the armies of the Archduke Charles He had a jovial disposition and ruled the village it is said with his finger and with the rod mister Burgomaster cried the shepherd in evident excitement But Petrus Mauerer without awaiting the end of his speech frowned and said Kasper Boeck begin by taking off your hat put your dog out of the room and then speak distinctly intelligibly without stammering so that I may understand you Hereupon the burgomaster standing near the table tranquilly emptied his little glass and wiped his great gray mustachios indifferently Kasper put his dog out and came back with his hat off Well said Petrus seeing that he was silent what has happened It happens that the spirit has appeared again in the ruins of Geierstein Ha I doubt it You ve seen it yourself Very clearly mister Burgomaster Without closing your eyes Yes mister Burgomaster my eyes were wide open There was plenty of moonlight What form did it have The form of a small man Good And turning toward a glass door at the left Katel cried the burgomaster An old serving woman opened the door Sir I am going out for a walk on the hillside sit up for me until ten o clock Here s the key Yes sir Then the old soldier took down his gun from the hook over the door examined the priming and slung it over his shoulder then he addressed Kasper Boeck Go and tell the rural guard to meet me in the holly path and tell him behind the mill Your spirit must be some marauder But if it s a fox I ll make a fine hood of it with long earlaps Master Petrus Mauerer and humble Kasper then went out The weather was superb the stars innumerable While the shepherd went to knock at the rural guard s door the burgomaster plunged among the elder bushes in a little lane that wound around behind the old church Two minutes later Kasper and Hans Goerner whinger at his side by running overtook Master Petrus in the holly path All three made their way together toward the ruins of Geierstein These ruins which are twenty minutes walk from the village seem to be insignificant enough they consist of the ridges of a few decrepit walls from four to six feet high which extend among the brier bushes Archaeologists call them the aqueducts of Seranus the Roman camp of Holderlock or vestiges of Theodoric according to their fantasy The only thing about these ruins which could be considered remarkable is a stairway to a cistern cut in the rock Inside of this spiral staircase instead of concentric circles which twist around with each complete turn the involutions become wider as they proceed in such a way that the bottom of the pit is three times as large as the opening Is it an architectural freak or did some reasonable cause determine such an odd construction It matters little to us The result was to cause in the cistern that vague reverberation which anyone may hear upon placing a shell at his ear and to make you aware of steps on the gravel path murmurs of the air rustling of the leaves and even distant words spoken by people passing the foot of the hill Our three personages then followed the pathway between the vineyards and gardens of Hirschwiller I see nothing the burgomaster would say turning up his nose derisively Nor I either the rural guard would repeat imitating the other s tone It s down in the hole muttered the shepherd We shall see we shall see returned the burgomaster It was in this fashion after a quarter of an hour that they came upon the opening of the cistern As I have said the night was clear limpid and perfectly still The moon portrayed as far as the eye could reach one of those nocturnal landscapes in bluish lines studded with slim trees the shadows of which seemed to have been drawn with a black crayon The blooming brier and broom perfumed the air with a rather sharp odor and the frogs of a neighboring swamp sang their oily anthem interspersed with silences But all these details escaped the notice of our good rustics they thought of nothing but laying hands on the spirit When they had reached the stairway all three stopped and listened then gazed into the dark shadows Nothing appeared nothing stirred The devil said the burgomaster we forgot to bring a bit of candle Descend Kasper you know the way better than I I ll follow you At this proposition the shepherd recoiled promptly If he had consulted his inclinations the poor man would have taken to flight his pitiful expression made the burgomaster burst out laughing Well Hans since he doesn t want to go down show me the way he said to the game warden But mister Burgomaster said the latter you know very well that steps are missing we should risk breaking our necks Then what s to be done Yes what s to be done Send your dog replied Petrus The shepherd whistled to his dog showed him the stairway urged him but he did not wish to take the chances any more than the others At this moment a bright idea struck the rural guardsman Ha mister Burgomaster said he if you should fire your gun inside Faith cried the other you re right we shall catch a glimpse at least And without hesitating the worthy man approached the stairway and leveled his gun But by the acoustic effect which I have already pointed out the spirit the marauder the individual who chanced to be actually in the cistern had heard everything The idea of stopping a gunshot did not strike him as amusing for in a shrill piercing voice he cried Stop Don t fire I m coming Then the three functionaries looked at each other and laughed softly and the burgomaster leaning over the opening again cried rudely Be quick about it you varlet or I ll shoot Be quick about it He cocked his gun and the click seemed to hasten the ascent of the mysterious person they heard him rolling down some stones Nevertheless it still took him another minute before he appeared the cistern being at a depth of sixty feet What was this man doing in such deep darkness He must be some great criminal So at least thought Petrus Mauerer and his acolytes At last a vague form could be discerned in the dark then slowly by degrees a little man four and a half feet high at the most frail ragged his face withered and yellow his eye gleaming like a magpie s and his hair tangled came out shouting By what right do you come to disturb my studies wretched creatures This grandiose apostrophe was scarcely in accord with his costume and physiognomy Accordingly the burgomaster indignantly replied Try to show that you re honest you knave or I ll begin by administering a correction A correction said the little man leaping with anger and drawing himself up under the nose of the burgomaster Yes replied the other who nevertheless did not fail to admire the pygmy s courage if you do not answer the questions satisfactorily I am going to put to you I am the burgomaster of Hirschwiller here are the rural guard the shepherd and his dog We are stronger than you be wise and tell me peaceably who you are what you are doing here and why you do not dare to appear in broad daylight Then we shall see what s to be done with you All that s none of your business replied the little man in his cracked voice I shall not answer In that case forward march ordered the burgomaster who grasped him firmly by the nape of the neck you are going to sleep in prison The little man writhed like a weasel he even tried to bite and the dog was sniffing at the calves of his legs when quite exhausted he said not without a certain dignity Let go sir I surrender to superior force I m yours The burgomaster who was not entirely lacking in good breeding became calmer Do you promise said he I promise Very well walk in front And that is how on the night of the twenty ninth of July eighteen thirty five the burgomaster took captive a little red haired man issuing from the cavern of Geierstein Upon arriving at Hirschwiller the rural guard ran to find the key of the prison and the vagabond was locked in and double locked not to forget the outside bolt and padlock Everyone then could repose after his fatigues and Petrus Mauerer went to bed and dreamed till midnight of this singular adventure On the morrow toward nine o clock Hans Goerner the rural guard having been ordered to bring the prisoner to the town house for another examination repaired to the cooler with four husky daredevils They opened the door all of them curious to look upon the Will o the wisp But imagine their astonishment upon seeing him hanging from the bars of the window by his necktie Some said that he was still writhing others that he was already stiff However that may be they ran to Petrus Mauerer s house to inform him of the fact and what is certain is that upon the latter s arrival the little man had breathed his last The justice of the peace and the doctor of Hirschwiller drew up a formal statement of the catastrophe then they buried the unknown in a field of meadow grass and it was all over Now about three weeks after these occurrences I went to see my cousin Petrus Mauerer whose nearest relative I was and consequently his heir This circumstance sustained an intimate acquaintance between us We were at dinner talking on indifferent matters when the burgomaster recounted the foregoing little story as I have just reported it Tis strange cousin said I truly strange And you have no other information concerning the unknown None And you have found nothing which could give you a clew as to his purpose Absolutely nothing Christian But as a matter of fact what could he have been doing in the cistern On what did he live The burgomaster shrugged his shoulders refilled our glasses and replied with To your health cousin To yours We remained silent a few minutes It was impossible for me to accept the abrupt conclusion of the adventure and in spite of myself I mused with some melancholy on the sad fate of certain men who appear and disappear in this world like the grass of the field without leaving the least memory or the least regret Cousin I resumed how far may it be from here to the ruins of Geierstein Twenty minutes walk at the most Why Because I should like to see them You know that we have a meeting of the municipal council and that I can t accompany you Oh I can find them by myself No the rural guard will show you the way he has nothing better to do And my worthy cousin having rapped on his glass called his servant Katel go and find Hans Goerner let him hurry and get here by two o clock I must be going The servant went out and the rural guard was not tardy in coming He was directed to take me to the ruins While the burgomaster proceeded gravely toward the hall of the municipal council we were already climbing the hill Hans Goerner with a wave of the hand indicated the remains of the aqueduct At the same moment the rocky ribs of the plateau the blue distances of Hundsrueck the sad crumbling walls covered with somber ivy the tolling of the Hirschwiller bell summoning the notables to the council the rural guardsman panting and catching at the brambles assumed in my eyes a sad and severe tinge for which I could not account it was the story of the hanged man which took the color out of the prospect The cistern staircase struck me as being exceedingly curious with its elegant spiral The bushes bristling in the fissures at every step the deserted aspect of its surroundings all harmonized with my sadness We descended and soon the luminous point of the opening which seemed to contract more and more and to take the shape of a star with curved rays alone sent us its pale light When we attained the very bottom of the cistern we found a superb sight was to be had of all those steps lighted from above and cutting off their shadows with marvelous precision I then heard the hum of which I have already spoken the immense granite conch had as many echoes as stones Has nobody been down here since the little man I asked the rural guardsman No sir The peasants are afraid They imagine that the hanged man will return And you I oh I m not curious But the justice of the peace His duty was to Ha What could he have come to the Owl s Ear for They call this the Owl s Ear Yes That s pretty near it said I raising my eyes This reversed vault forms the pavilion well enough the under side of the steps makes the covering of the tympanum and the winding of the staircase the cochlea the labyrinth and vestibule of the ear That is the cause of the murmur which we hear we are at the back of a colossal ear It s very likely said Hans Goerner who did not seem to have understood my observations We started up again and I had ascended the first steps when I felt something crush under my foot I stopped to see what it could be and at that moment perceived a white object before me It was a torn sheet of paper As for the hard object which I had felt grinding up I recognized it as a sort of glazed earthenware jug Aha I said to myself this may clear up the burgomaster s story I rejoined Hans Goerner who was now waiting for me at the edge of the pit Now sir cried he where would you like to go First let s sit down for a while We shall see presently I sat down on a large stone while the rural guard cast his falcon eyes over the village to see if there chanced to be any trespassers in the gardens I carefully examined the glazed vase of which nothing but splinters remained These fragments presented the appearance of a funnel lined with wool It was impossible for me to perceive its purpose I then read the piece of a letter written in an easy running and firm hand I transcribe it here below word for word It seems to follow the other half of the sheet for which I looked vainly all about the ruins My micracoustic ear trumpet thus has the double advantage of infinitely multiplying the intensity of sounds and of introducing them into the ear without causing the observer the least discomfort You would never have imagined dear master the charm which one feels in perceiving these thousands of imperceptible sounds which are confounded on a fine summer day in an immense murmuring The bumble bee has his song as well as the nightingale the honey bee is the warbler of the mosses the cricket is the lark of the tall grass the maggot is the wren it has only a sigh but the sigh is melodious This discovery from the point of view of sentiment which makes us live in the universal life surpasses in its importance all that I could say on the matter After so much suffering privations and weariness how happy it makes one to reap the rewards of all his labors How the soul soars toward the divine Author of all these microscopic worlds the magnificence of which is revealed to us Where now are the long hours of anguish hunger contempt which overwhelmed us before Gone sir gone Tears of gratitude moisten our eyes One is proud to have achieved through suffering new joys for humanity and to have contributed to its mental development But howsoever vast howsoever admirable may be the first fruits of my micracoustic ear trumpet these do not delimit its advantages There are more positive ones more material and ones which may be expressed in figures Just as the telescope brought the discovery of myriads of worlds performing their harmonious revolutions in infinite space so also will my micracoustic ear trumpet extend the sense of the unbearable beyond all possible bounds Thus sir the circulation of the blood and the fluids of the body will not give me pause you shall hear them flow with the impetuosity of cataracts you shall perceive them so distinctly as to startle you the slightest irregularity of the pulse the least obstacle is striking and produces the same effect as a rock against which the waves of a torrent are dashing It is doubtless an immense conquest in the development of our knowledge of physiology and pathology but this is not the point on which I would emphasize Upon applying your ear to the ground sir you may hear the mineral waters springing up at immeasurable depths you may judge of their volume their currents and the obstacles which they meet Do you wish to go further Enter a subterranean vault which is so constructed as to gather a quantity of loud sounds then at night when the world sleeps when nothing will be confused with the interior noises of our globe listen Sir all that it is possible for me to tell you at the present moment for in the midst of my profound misery of my privations and often of my despair I am left only a few lucid instants to pursue my geological observations all that I can affirm is that the seething of glow worms the explosions of boiling fluids is something terrifying and sublime which can only be compared to the impression of the astronomer whose glass fathoms depths of limitless extent Nevertheless I must avow that these impressions should be studied further and classified in a methodical manner in order that definite conclusions may be derived therefrom Likewise as soon as you shall have deigned dear and noble master to transmit the little sum for use at Neustadt as I asked to supply my first needs we shall see our way to an understanding in regard to the establishment of three great subterranean observatories one in the valley of Catania another in Iceland then a third in Capac Uren Songay or Cayembe Uren the deepest of the Cordilleras and consequently Here the letter stopped I let my hands fall in stupefaction Had I read the conceptions of an idiot or the inspirations of a genius which had been realized What am I to say to think So this man this miserable creature living at the bottom of a burrow like a fox dying of hunger had had perhaps one of those inspirations which the Supreme Being sends on earth to enlighten future generations And this man had hanged himself in disgust despair No one had answered his prayer though he asked only for a crust of bread in exchange for his discovery It was horrible Long long I sat there dreaming thanking Heaven for having limited my intelligence to the needs of ordinary life for not having desired to make me a superior man in the community of martyrs At length the rural guardsman seeing me with fixed gaze and mouth agape made so bold as to touch me on the shoulder mister Christian said he see it s getting late the burgomaster must have come back from the council Ha That s a fact cried I crumpling up the paper come on We descended the hill My worthy cousin met me with a smiling face at the threshold of his house Well well Christian so you ve found no trace of the imbecile who hanged himself No I thought as much He was some lunatic who escaped from Stefansfeld or somewhere Faith he did well to hang himself When one is good for nothing that s the simplest way for it The following day I left Hirschwiller I shall never return The Invisible Eye About this time said Christian poor as a church mouse I took refuge in the roof of an old house in Minnesaenger Street Nuremberg and made my nest in the corner of the garret I was compelled to work over my straw bed to reach the window but this window was in the gable end and the view from it was magnificent both town and country being spread out before me I could see the cats walking gravely in the gutters the storks their beaks filled with frogs carrying nourishment to their ravenous brood the pigeons springing from their cotes their tails spread like fans hovering over the streets In the evening when the bells called the world to the Angelus with my elbows upon the edge of the roof I listened to their melancholy chimes I watched the windows as one by one they were lighted up the good burghers smoking their pipes on the sidewalks the young girls in their red skirts with their pitchers under their arms laughing and chatting around the fountain Saint Sebalt Insensibly all this faded away the bats commenced their rapid course and I retired to my mattress in sweet peace and tranquillity The old curiosity seller Toubac knew the way to my little lodging as well as I did and was not afraid to climb the ladder Every week his ugly head adorned with a reddish cap raised the trapdoor his fingers grasped the ledge and he cried out in a nasal tone Well well Master Christian have you anything To which I replied Come in Why in the devil don t you come in I am just finishing a little landscape and you must tell me what you think of it Then his great back seeming to elongate grew up even to the roof and the good man laughed silently I must do justice to Toubac he never haggled with me about prices he bought all my paintings at fifteen florins one with the other and sold them again for forty each This was an honest Jew I began to grow fond of this mode of existence and to find new charms in it day by day Just at this time the city of Nuremberg was agitated by a strange and mysterious event Not far from my dormer window a little to the left stood the Inn Boeuf Gras an old auberge much patronized throughout the country Three or four wagons filled with sacks or casks were always drawn up before the door where the rustic drivers were in the habit of stopping on their way to the market to take their morning draught of wine The gable end of the inn was distinguished by its peculiar form It was very narrow pointed and on two sides cut in teeth like a saw The carvings were strangely grotesque interwoven and ornamenting the cornices and surrounding the windows but the most remarkable fact was that the house opposite reproduced exactly the same sculptures the same ornaments even the signboard with its post and spiral of iron was exactly copied One might have thought that these two ancient houses reflected each other Behind the inn however was a grand old oak whose somber leaves darkened the stones of the roof while the other house stood out in bold relief against the sky To complete the description this old building was as silent and dreary as the Inn Boeuf Gras was noisy and animated On one side a crowd of merry drinkers were continually entering in and going out singing tripping cracking their whips on the other profound silence reigned Perhaps once or twice during the day the heavy door seemed to open of itself to allow a little old woman to go out with her back almost in a semicircle her dress fitting tight about her hips an enormous basket on her arm and her hand contracted against her breast It seemed to me that I saw at a glance as I looked upon her a whole existence of good works and pious meditations The physiognomy of this old woman had struck me more than once her little green eyes long thin nose the immense bouquets of flowers on her shawl which must have been at least a hundred years old the withered smile which puckered her cheeks into a cockade the lace of her bonnet falling down to her eyebrows all this was fantastic and interested me much Why did this old woman live in this great deserted house I wished to explore the mystery One day as I paused in the street and followed her with my eyes she turned suddenly and gave me a look the horrible expression of which I know not how to paint made three or four hideous grimaces and then letting her palsied head fall upon her breast drew her great shawl closely around her and advanced slowly to the heavy door behind which I saw her disappear She s an old fool I said to myself in a sort of stupor My faith it was the height of folly in me to be interested in her However I would like to see her grimace again old Toubac would willingly give me fifteen florins if I could paint it for him I must confess that these pleasantries of mine did not entirely reassure me The hideous glance which the old shrew had given me pursued me everywhere More than once while climbing the almost perpendicular ladder to my loft feeling my clothing caught on some point I trembled from head to foot imagining that the old wretch was hanging to the tails of my coat in order to destroy me Toubac to whom I related this adventure was far from laughing at it indeed he assumed a grave and solemn air Master Christian said he if the old woman wants you take care Her teeth are small pointed and of marvelous whiteness and that is not natural at her age She has an evil eye Children flee from her and the people of Nuremberg call her Fledermausse I admired the clear sagacious intellect of the Jew and his words gave me cause for reflection Several weeks passed away during which I often encountered Fledermausse without any alarming consequences My fears were dissipated and I thought of her no more But an evening came during which while sleeping very soundly I was awakened by a strange harmony It was a kind of vibration so sweet so melodious that the whispering of the breeze among the leaves can give but a faint idea of its charm For a long time I listened intently with my eyes wide open and holding my breath so as not to lose a note At last I looked toward the window and saw two wings fluttering against the glass I thought at first that it was a bat caught in my room but the moon rising at that instant I saw the wings of a magnificent butterfly of the night delineated upon her shining disk Their vibrations were often so rapid that they could not be distinguished then they reposed extended upon the glass and their frail fibers were again brought to view This misty apparition coming in the midst of the universal silence opened my heart to all sweet emotions It seemed to me that an airy sylph touched with a sense of my solitude had come to visit me and this idea melted me almost to tears Be tranquil sweet captive be tranquil said I your confidence shall not be abused I will not keep you against your will Return to heaven and to liberty I then opened my little window The night was calm and millions of stars were glittering in the sky For a moment I contemplated this sublime spectacle and words of prayer and praise came naturally to my lips but judge of my amazement when lowering my eyes I saw a man hanging from the crossbeam of the sign of the Boeuf Gras the hair disheveled the arms stiff the legs elongated to a point and casting their gigantic shadows down to the street The immobility of this figure under the moon s rays was terrible I felt my tongue freezing my teeth clinched I was about to cry out in terror when by some incomprehensible mysterious attraction my glance fell below and I distinguished confusedly the old woman crouched at her window in the midst of dark shadows and contemplating the dead man with an air of diabolic satisfaction Then I had a vertigo of terror All my strength abandoned me and retreating to the wall of my loft I sank down and became insensible I do not know how long this sleep of death continued When restored to consciousness I saw that it was broad day The mists of the night had penetrated to my garret and deposited their fresh dew upon my hair and the confused murmurs of the street ascended to my little lodging I looked without The burgomaster and his secretary were stationed at the door of the inn and remained there a long time crowds of people came and went and paused to look in then recommenced their course The good women of the neighborhood who were sweeping before their doors looked on from afar and talked gravely with each other At last a litter and upon this litter a body covered with a linen cloth issued from the inn carried by two men They descended to the street and the children on their way to school ran behind them All the people drew back as they advanced The window opposite was still open the end of a rope floated from the crossbeam I had not dreamed I had indeed seen the butterfly of the night I had seen the man hanging and I had seen Fledermausse That day Toubac made me a visit and as his great nose appeared on a level with the floor he exclaimed Master Christian have you nothing to sell I did not hear him I was seated upon my one chair my hands clasped upon my knees and my eyes fixed before me Toubac surprised at my inattention repeated in a louder voice Master Christian Master Christian Then striding over the sill he advanced and struck me on the shoulder Well well what is the matter now Ah is that you Toubac Eh parbleu I rather think so are you ill No I am only thinking What in the devil are you thinking about Of the man who was hanged Oh oh cried the curiosity vender You have seen him then The poor boy What a singular history The third in the same place How the third Ah yes I ought to have warned you but it is not too late There will certainly be a fourth who will follow the example of the others Il n y a que le premier pas qui coute Saying this Toubac took a seat on the corner of my trunk struck his match box lighted his pipe and blew three or four powerful whiffs of smoke with a meditative air My faith said he I am not fearful but if I had full permission to pass the night in that chamber I should much prefer to sleep elsewhere Listen Master Christian Nine or ten months ago a good man of Tuebingen wholesale dealer in furs dismounted at the Inn Boeuf Gras He called for supper he ate well he drank well and was finally conducted to that room in the third story it is called the Green Room Well the next morning he was found hanging to the crossbeam of the signboard Well that might do for once nothing could be said Every proper investigation was made and the stranger was buried at the bottom of the garden But look you about six months afterwards a brave soldier from Neustadt arrived he had received his final discharge and was rejoicing in the thought of returning to his native village During the whole evening while emptying his wine cups he spoke fondly of his little cousin who was waiting to marry him At last this big monsieur was conducted to his room the Green Room and the same night the watchman passing down the street Minnesaenger perceived something hanging to the crossbeam he raised his lantern and lo it was the soldier with his final discharge in a bow on his left hip and his hands gathered up to the seam of his pantaloons as if on parade Truth to say this is extraordinary cried the burgomaster the devil s to pay Well the chamber was much visited the walls were replastered and the dead man was sent to Neustadt The registrar wrote this marginal note Died of apoplexy All Nuremberg was enraged against the innkeeper There were many indeed who wished to force him to take down his iron crossbeam under the pretext that it inspired people with dangerous ideas but you may well believe that old Michael Schmidt would not lend his ear to this proposition This crossbeam said he was placed here by my grandfather it has borne the sign of Boeuf Gras for one hundred and fifty years from father to son it harms no one not even the hay wagons which pass beneath for it is thirty feet above them Those who don t like it can turn their heads aside and not see it Well gradually the town calmed down and during several months no new event agitated it Unhappily a student of Heidelberg returning to the university stopped day before yesterday at the Inn Boeuf Gras and asked for lodging He was the son of a minister of the gospel How could anyone suppose that the son of a pastor could conceive the idea of hanging himself on the crossbeam of a signboard because a big monsieur and an old soldier had done so We must admit Master Christian that the thing was not probable these reasons would not have seemed sufficient to myself or to you Enough enough I exclaimed this is too horrible I see a frightful mystery involved in all this It is not the crossbeam it is not the room What Do you suspect the innkeeper the most honest man in the world and belonging to one of the oldest families in Nuremberg No no may God preserve me from indulging in unjust suspicions but there is an abyss before me into which I scarcely dare glance You are right said Toubac astonished at the violence of my excitement We will speak of other things Apropos Master Christian where is our landscape of Saint Odille This question brought me back to the world of realities I showed the old man the painting I had just completed The affair was soon concluded and Toubac well satisfied descended the ladder entreating me to think no more of the student of Heidelberg I would gladly have followed my good friend s counsel but when the devil once mixes himself up in our concerns it is not easy to disembarrass ourselves of him In my solitary hours all these events were reproduced with frightful distinctness in my mind This old wretch I said to myself is the cause of it all she alone has conceived these crimes and has consummated them But by what means Has she had recourse to cunning alone or has she obtained the intervention of invisible powers I walked to and fro in my retreat An inward voice cried out It is not in vain that Providence permitted you to see Fledermausse contemplating the agonies of her victim It is not in vain that the soul of the poor young man came in the form of a butterfly of the night to awake you No no all this was not accidental Christian The heavens impose upon you a terrible mission If you do not accomplish it tremble lest you fall yourself into the hands of the old murderess Perhaps at this moment she is preparing her snares in the darkness During several days these hideous images followed me without intermission I lost my sleep it was impossible for me to do anything my brush fell from my hand and horrible to confess I found myself sometimes gazing at the crossbeam with a sort of complacency At last I could endure it no longer and one evening I descended the ladder and hid myself behind the door of Fledermausse hoping to surprise her fatal secret From that time no day passed in which I was not en route following the old wretch watching spying never losing sight of her but she was so cunning had a scent so subtile that without even turning her head she knew I was behind her However she feigned not to perceive this she went to the market to the butcher s like any good simple woman only hastening her steps and murmuring confused words At the close of the month I saw that it was impossible for me to attain my object in this way and this conviction made me inexpressibly sad What can I do I said to myself The old woman divines my plans she is on her guard every hope abandons me Ah old hag you think you already see me at the end of your rope I was continually asking myself this question What can I do what can I do At last a luminous idea struck me My chamber overlooked the house of Fledermausse but there was no window on this side I adroitly raised a slate and no pen could paint my joy when the whole ancient building was thus exposed to me At last I have you I exclaimed you cannot escape me now from here I can see all that passes your goings your comings your arts and snares You will not suspect this invisible eye this watchful eye which will surprise crime at the moment it blooms Oh Justice Justice She marches slowly but she arrives Nothing could be more sinister than the den now spread out before me a great courtyard the large slabs of which were covered with moss in one corner a well whose stagnant waters you shuddered to look upon a stairway covered with old shells at the farther end a gallery with wooden balustrade and hanging upon it some old linen and the tick of an old straw mattress on the first floor to the left the stone covering of a common sewer indicated the kitchen to the right the lofty windows of the building looked out upon the street then a few pots of dried withered flowers all was cracked somber moist Only one or two hours during the day could the sun penetrate this loathsome spot after that the shadows took possession then the sunshine fell upon the crazy walls the worm eaten balcony the dull and tarnished glass and upon the whirlwind of atoms floating in its golden rays disturbed by no breath of air I had scarcely finished these observations and reflections when the old woman entered having just returned from market I heard the grating of her heavy door Then she appeared with her basket She seemed fatigued almost out of breath The lace of her bonnet fell to her nose With one hand she grasped the banister and ascended the stairs The heat was intolerable suffocating it was precisely one of those days in which all insects crickets spiders mosquitoes et cetera make old ruins resound with their strange sounds Fledermausse crossed the gallery slowly like an old ferret who feels at home She remained more than a quarter of an hour in the kitchen then returned spread out her linen took the broom and brushed away some blades of straw on the floor At last she raised her head and turned her little green eyes in every direction searching investigating carefully Could she by some strange intuition suspect anything I do not know but I gently lowered the slate and gave up my watch for the day In the morning Fledermausse appeared reassured One angle of light fell upon the gallery In passing she caught a fly on the wing and presented it delicately to a spider established in a corner of the roof This spider was so bloated that notwithstanding the distance I saw it descend from round to round then glide along a fine web like a drop of venom seize its prey from the hands of the old shrew and remount rapidly Fledermausse looked at it very attentively with her eyes half closed then sneezed and said to herself in a jeering tone God bless you beautiful one God bless you I watched during six weeks and could discover nothing concerning the power of Fledermausse Sometimes seated upon a stool she peeled her potatoes then hung out her linen upon the balustrade Sometimes I saw her spinning but she never sang as good kind old women are accustomed to do their trembling voices mingling well with the humming of the wheel Profound silence always reigned around her she had no cat that cherished society of old women not even a sparrow came to rest under her roof It seemed as if all animated nature shrank from her glance The bloated spider alone took delight in her society I cannot now conceive how my patience could endure those long hours of observation nothing escaped me nothing was matter of indifference At the slightest sound I raised my slate my curiosity was without limit insatiable Toubac complained greatly Master Christian said he how in the devil do you pass your time Formerly you painted something for me every week now you do not finish a piece once a month Oh you painters Lazy as a painter is a good wise proverb As soon as you have a few kreutzers in possession you put your hands in your pockets and go to sleep I confess that I began to lose courage I had watched spied and discovered nothing I said to myself that the old woman could not be so dangerous as I had supposed that I had perhaps done her injustice by my suspicions in short I began to make excuses for her One lovely afternoon with my eye fixed at my post of observation I abandoned myself to these benevolent reflections when suddenly the scene changed Fledermausse passed through the gallery with the rapidity of lightning She was no longer the same person she was erect her jaws were clinched her glance fixed her neck extended she walked with grand strides her gray locks floating behind her Oh at last I said to myself something is coming attention But alas the shadows of evening descended upon the old building the noises of the city expired and silence prevailed Fatigued and disappointed I lay down upon my bed when casting my eyes toward my dormer window I saw the room opposite illuminated So a traveler occupied the Green Room fatal to strangers Now all my fears were reawakened the agitation of Fledermausse was explained she scented a new victim No sleep for me that night the rustling of the straw the nibbling of the mice under the floor gave me nervous chills I rose and leaned out of my window I listened The light in the room opposite was extinguished In one of those moments of poignant anxiety I cannot say if it was illusion or reality I thought I saw the old wretch also watching and listening The night passed and the gray dawn came to my windows by degrees the noise and movements in the street ascended to my loft Harassed by fatigue and emotion I fell asleep but my slumber was short and by eight o clock I had resumed my post of observation It seemed as if the night had been as disturbed and tempestuous to Fledermausse as to myself When she opened the door of the gallery I saw that a livid pallor covered her cheeks and thin throat she had on only her chemise and a woolen skirt a few locks of reddish gray hair fell on her shoulders She looked toward my hiding place with a dreamy abstracted air but she saw nothing she was thinking of other things Suddenly she descended leaving her old shoes at the bottom of the steps Without doubt thought I she is going to see if the door below is well fastened I saw her remount hastily springing up three or four steps at a time it was terrible She rushed into the neighboring chamber and I heard something like the falling of the top of a great chest then Fledermausse appeared in the gallery dragging a manikin after her and this manikin was clothed like the Heidelberg student With surprising dexterity the old woman suspended this hideous object to a beam of the shed then descended rapidly to the courtyard to contemplate it A burst of sardonic laughter escaped from her lips she remounted then descended again like a maniac and each time uttered new cries and new bursts of laughter A noise was heard near the door and the old woman bounded forward unhooked the manikin and carried it off then leaning over the balustrade with her throat elongated her eyes flashing she listened earnestly The noise was lost in the distance the muscles of her face relaxed and she drew long breaths It was only a carriage which had passed The old wretch had been frightened She now returned to the room and I heard the chest close This strange scene confounded all my ideas What did this manikin signify I became more than ever attentive Fledermausse now left the house with her basket on her arm I followed her with my eyes till she turned the corner of the street She had reassumed the air of a trembling old woman took short steps and from time to time turned her head partly around to peer behind from the corner of her eye Fledermausse was absent fully five hours For myself I went I came I meditated The time seemed insupportable The sun heated the slate of the roof and scorched my brain Now I saw at the window the good man who occupied the fatal Green Chamber he was a brave peasant of Nassau with a large three cornered hat a scarlet vest and a laughing face he smoked his pipe of Ulm tranquillity and seemed to fear no evil I felt a strong desire to cry out to him Good man be on your guard Do not allow yourself to be entrapped by the old wretch distrust yourself but he would not have comprehended me Toward two o clock Fledermausse returned The noise of her door resounded through the vestibule Then alone all alone she entered the yard and seated herself on the interior step of the stairway she put down her basket before her and drew out first some packets of herbs then vegetables then a red vest then a three cornered hat a coat of brown velvet pants of plush and coarse woolen hose the complete costume of the peasant from Nassau For a moment I felt stunned then flames passed before my eyes I recollected those precipices which entice with an irresistible power those wells or pits which the police have been compelled to close because men threw themselves into them those trees which had been cut down because they inspired men with the idea of hanging themselves that contagion of suicides of robberies of murders at certain epochs by desperate means that strange and subtile enticement of example which makes you yawn because another yawns suffer because you see another suffer kill yourself because you see others kill themselves and my hair stood up with horror How could this Fledermausse this base sordid creature have derived so profound a law of human nature how had she found the means to use this law to the profit or indulgence of her sanguinary instincts This I could not comprehend it surpassed my wildest imaginations But reflecting longer upon this inexplicable mystery I resolved to turn the fatal law against her and to draw the old murderess into her own net So many innocent victims called out for vengeance I felt myself to be on the right path I went to all the old clothes sellers in Nuremberg and returned in the afternoon to the Inn Boeuf Gras with an enormous packet under my arm Nichel Schmidt had known me for a long time his wife was fat and good looking I had painted her portrait Ah Master Christian said he squeezing my hand what happy circumstance brings you here What procures me the pleasure of seeing you My dear Monsieur Schmidt I feel a vehement insatiable desire to sleep in the Green Room We were standing on the threshold of the inn and I pointed to the room The good man looked at me distrustfully Fear nothing I said I have no desire to hang myself A la bonne heure a la bonne heure For frankly that would give me pain an artist of such merit When do you wish the room Master Christian This evening Impossible it is occupied Monsieur can enter immediately said a voice just behind me I will not be in the way We turned around in great surprise the peasant of Nassau stood before us with his three cornered hat and his packet at the end of his walking stick He had just learned the history of his three predecessors in the Green Room and was trembling with rage Rooms like yours cried he stuttering but it is murderous to put people there it is assassination You deserve to be sent to the galleys immediately Go go calm yourself said the innkeeper that did not prevent you from sleeping well Happily I said my prayers at night said the peasant without that where would I be and he withdrew with his hands raised to heaven Well said Nichel Schmidt stupefied the room is vacant but I entreat you do not serve me a bad trick It would be a worse trick for myself than for you monsieur I gave my packet to the servants and installed myself for the time with the drinkers For a long time I had not felt so calm and happy After so many doubts and disquietudes I touched the goal The horizon seemed to clear up and it appeared that some invisible power gave me the hand I lighted my pipe placed my elbow on the table my wine before me and listened to the chorus in Freischuetz played by a troupe of gypsies from the Black Forest The trumpets the hue and cry of the chase the hautboys plunged me into a vague reverie and at times rousing up to look at the hour I asked myself gravely if all which had happened to me was not a dream But the watchman came to ask us to leave the salle and soon other and more solemn thoughts were surging in my soul and in deep meditation I followed little Charlotte who preceded me with a candle to my room We mounted the stairs to the third story Charlotte gave me the candle and pointed to the door There said she and descended rapidly I opened the door The Green Room was like any other inn room The ceiling was very low the bed very high With one glance I explored the interior and then glided to the window Nothing was to be seen in the house of Fledermausse only in some distant room an obscure light was burning Some one was on the watch That is well said I closing the curtain I have all necessary time I opened my packet I put on a woman s bonnet with hanging lace then placing myself before a mirror I took a brush and painted wrinkles in my face This took me nearly an hour Then I put on the dress and a large shawl and I was actually afraid of myself Fledermausse seemed to me to look at me from the mirror At this moment the watchman cried out Eleven o clock I seized the manikin which I had brought in my packet and muffled it in a costume precisely similar to that worn by the old wretch I then opened the curtain Certainly after all that I had seen of the Fledermausse of her infernal cunning her prudence her adroitness she could not in any way surprise me and yet I was afraid The light which I had remarked in the chamber was still immovable and now cast its yellow rays on the manikin of the peasant of Nassau which was crouched on the corner of the bed with the head hanging on the breast the three cornered hat pulled down over the face the arms suspended and the whole aspect that of absolute despair The shadows managed with diabolical art allowed nothing to be seen but the general effect of the face The red vest and six round buttons alone seemed top shine out in the darkness But the silence of the night the complete immobility of the figure the exhausted mournful air were well calculated to take possession of a spectator with a strange power For myself although forewarned I was chilled even to my bones How would it then have fared with the poor simple peasant if he had been surprised unawares He would have been utterly cast down Despairing he would have lost all power of self control and the spirit of imitation would have done the rest Scarcely had I moved the curtain when I saw Fledermausse on the watch behind her window She could not see me I opened my window softly the window opposite was opened Then her manikin appeared to rise slowly and advance before me I also advanced my manikin and seizing my torch with one hand with the other I quickly opened the shutters And now the old woman and myself were face to face Struck with sudden terror she had let her manikin fall We gazed at each other with almost equal horror She extended her finger I advanced mine She moved her lips I agitated mine She breathed a profound sigh and leaned upon her elbow I imitated her To describe all the terrors of this scene would be impossible It bordered upon confusion madness delirium It was a death struggle between two wills between two intelligences between two souls each one wishing to destroy the other and in this struggle I had the advantage her victims struggled with me After having imitated for some seconds every movement of Fledermausse I pulled a rope from under my skirt and attached it to the crossbeam The old woman gazed at me with gaping mouth I passed the rope around my neck her pupils expanded lightened her face was convulsed No no said she in a whistling voice I pursued her with the impassability of an executioner Then rage seemed to take possession of her Old fool she exclaimed straightening herself up and her hands contracted on the crossbeam Old fool I gave her no time to go on blowing out my lamp I stooped like a man going to make a vigorous spring and seizing my manikin I passed the rope around its neck and precipitated it below A terrible cry resounded through the street and then silence which I seemed to feel Perspiration bathed my forehead I listened a long time At the end of a quarter of an hour I heard far away very far away the voice of the watchman crying Inhabitants of Nuremberg midnight midnight sounds Now justice is satisfied I cried and three victims are avenged Pardon me O Lord About five minutes after the cry of the watchman I saw Fledermausse attracted allured by my manikin her exact image spring from the window with a rope around her neck and rest suspended from the crossbeam I saw the shadow of death undulating through her body while the moon calm silent majestic inundated the summit of the roof and her cold pale rays reposed upon the old disheveled hideous head Just as I had seen the poor young student of Heidelberg just so did I now see Fledermausse In the morning all Nuremberg learned that the old wretch had hanged herself and this was the last event of that kind in the Street Minnesaenger The Waters of Death The warm mineral waters of Spinbronn situated in the Hundsrueck several leagues from Pirmesens 
1341-9206-0000	train-other-500	formerly enjoyed a magnificent reputation All who were afflicted with gout or gravel in Germany repaired thither the savage aspect of the country did not deter them
none	none	 They lodged in pretty cottages at the head of the defile 
1341-9206-0001	train-other-500	they bathed in the cascade which fell in large sheets of foam from the summit of the rocks they drank one or two decanters of mineral water daily
1341-9206-0002	train-other-500	and the doctor of the place Daniel Haselnoss who distributed his prescriptions clad in a great wig and chestnut coat
none	none	 had an excellent practice To day the waters of Spinbronn figure no longer in the Codex one in this poor village one no longer sees anyone but a few miserable woodcutters and sad to say doctor Haselnoss has left one A collection of prescriptions indorsed by the Faculty of Paris Trans All this resulted from a series of very strange catastrophes which lawyer Bremer of Pirmesens told me about the other day You should know Master Frantz said he 
1341-9206-0003	train-other-500	that the spring of Spinbronn issues from a sort of cavern about five feet high and twelve or fifteen feet wide the water has a warmth of sixty seven degrees Centigrade it is salt As for the cavern entirely covered without with moss
1341-9206-0004	train-other-500	ivy and brushwood its depth is unknown because the hot exhalations prevent all entrance Nevertheless strangely enough it was noticed early in the last century that birds of the neighborhood thrushes doves hawks
none	none	 were engulfed in it in full flight and it was never known to what mysterious influence to attribute this particular In eighteen oh one at the height of the season owing to some circumstance which is still unexplained 
1341-9206-0006	train-other-500	the spring became more abundant and the bathers walking below on the greensward saw a human skeleton as white as snow fall from the cascade You may judge Master Frantz of the general fright
1341-9206-0007	train-other-500	it was thought naturally that a murder had been committed at Spinbronn in a recent year and that the body of the victim had been thrown in the spring
none	none	 But the skeleton weighed no more than a dozen francs and Haselnoss concluded that it must have sojourned more than three centuries in the sand 
1341-9206-0008	train-other-500	to have become reduced to such a state of desiccation This very plausible reasoning did not prevent a crowd of patrons wild at the idea of having drunk the saline water from leaving before the end of the day
1341-9206-0009	train-other-500	those worst afflicted with gout and gravel consoled themselves But the overflow continuing all the rubbish slime and detritus which the cavern contained was disgorged on the following days
1341-9206-0010	train-other-500	a veritable bone yard came down from the mountain skeletons of animals of every kind of quadrupeds birds and reptiles in short all that one could conceive as most horrible
1341-9206-0011	train-other-500	Haselnoss issued a pamphlet demonstrating that all these bones were derived from an antediluvian world that they were fossil bones
1341-9206-0012	train-other-500	accumulated there in a sort of funnel during the universal flood that is to say four thousand years before Christ and that consequently one might consider them as nothing but stones and that it was needless to be disgusted
1341-9206-0013	train-other-500	But his work had scarcely reassured the gouty when one fine morning the corpse of a fox then that of a hawk with all its feathers
1341-9206-0014	train-other-500	fell from the cascade It was impossible to establish that these remains antedated the Flood Anyway the disgust was so great that everybody tied up his bundle and went to take the waters elsewhere
1341-9206-0015	train-other-500	How infamous cried the beautiful ladies how horrible So that s what the virtue of these mineral waters came from Oh twere better to die of gravel than continue such a remedy
1341-9206-0016	train-other-500	At the end of a week there remained at Spinbronn only a big Englishman who had gout in his hands as well as in his feet who had himself addressed as Sir Thomas Hawerburch Commodore and he brought a large retinue
1341-9206-0017	train-other-500	according to the usage of a British subject in a foreign land This personage big and fat with a florid complexion but with hands simply knotted with gout would have drunk skeleton soup if it would have cured his infirmity
1341-9206-0018	train-other-500	He laughed heartily over the desertion of the other sufferers and installed himself in the prettiest chalet at half price announcing his design to pass the winter at Spinbronn
1341-9206-0019	train-other-500	Here lawyer Bremer slowly absorbed an ample pinch of snuff as if to quicken his reminiscences he shook his laced ruff with his finger tips and continued
none	none	 Five or six years before the Revolution of seventeen eighty nine 
1341-9206-0020	train-other-500	a young doctor of Pirmesens named Christian Weber had gone out to San Domingo in the hope of making his fortune He had actually amassed some hundred thousand francs m the exercise of his profession when the negro revolt broke out
1341-9206-0021	train-other-500	I need not recall to you the barbarous treatment to which our unfortunate fellow countrymen were subjected at Haiti
none	none	 doctor Weber had the good luck to escape the massacre 
1341-9206-0022	train-other-500	and to save part of his fortune
none	none	 Then he traveled in South America and especially in French Guiana In eighteen oh one he returned to Pirmesens and established himself at Spinbronn where doctor Haselnoss made over his house and defunct practice Christian Weber brought with him an old negress called Agatha 
1341-9206-0024	train-other-500	a frightful creature with a flat nose and lips as large as your fist and her head tied up in three bandanas of razor edged colors This poor old woman adored red she had earrings which hung down to her shoulders
1341-9206-0025	train-other-500	and the mountaineers of Hundsrueck came from six leagues around to stare at her As for doctor Weber he was a tall lean man invariably dressed in a sky blue coat with codfish tails and deerskin breeches
1341-9206-0026	train-other-500	He wore a hat of flexible straw and boots with bright yellow tops on the front of which hung two silver tassels He talked little his laugh was like a nervous attack
1341-9206-0027	train-other-500	and his gray eyes usually calm and meditative shone with singular brilliance at the least sign of contradiction Every morning he fetched a turn round about the mountain letting his horse ramble at a venture
1341-9206-0028	train-other-500	whistling forever the same tune some negro melody or other Lastly this rum chap had brought from Haiti a lot of bandboxes filled with queer insects some black and reddish brown big as eggs
1341-9206-0029	train-other-500	others little and shimmering like sparks He seemed to set greater store by them than by his patients and from time to time on coming back from his rides he brought a quantity of butterflies pinned to his hat brim
1341-9206-0030	train-other-500	Scarcely was he settled in Haselnoss s vast house when he peopled the back yard with outlandish birds Barbary geese with scarlet cheeks Guinea hens and a white peacock which perched habitually on the garden wall
1341-9206-0031	train-other-500	and which divided with the negress the admiration of the mountaineers If I enter into these details Master Frantz it s because they recall my early youth
1341-9206-0032	train-other-500	doctor Christian found himself to be at the same time my cousin and my tutor and as early as on his return to Germany he had come to take me and install me in his house at Spinbronn
1341-9206-0033	train-other-500	The black Agatha at first sight inspired me with some fright and I only got seasoned to that fantastic visage with considerable difficulty but she was such a good woman
1341-9206-0034	train-other-500	she knew so well how to make spiced patties she hummed such strange songs in a guttural voice snapping her fingers and keeping time with a heavy shuffle that I ended by taking her in fast friendship
none	none	 doctor Weber was naturally thick with Sir Thomas Hawerburch 
1341-9206-0035	train-other-500	as representing the only one of his clientele then in evidence and I was not slow in perceiving that these two eccentrics held long conventicles together They conversed on mysterious matters on the transmission of fluids
1341-9206-0036	train-other-500	and indulged in certain odd signs which one or the other had picked up in his voyages Sir Thomas in the Orient and my tutor in America This puzzled me greatly
1341-9206-0037	train-other-500	As children will I was always lying in wait for what they seemed to want to conceal from me but despairing in the end of discovering anything I took the course of questioning Agatha and the poor old woman
1341-9206-0038	train-other-500	after making me promise to say nothing about it admitted that my tutor was a sorcerer For the rest
none	none	 doctor Weber exercised a singular influence over the mind of this negress 
1341-9206-0039	train-other-500	and this woman habitually so gay and forever ready to be amused by nothing trembled like a leaf when her master s gray eyes chanced to alight on her All this Master Frantz
1341-9206-0040	train-other-500	seems to have no bearing on the springs of Spinbronn But wait wait you shall see by what a singular concourse of circumstances my story is connected with it I told you that birds darted into the cavern
1341-9206-0041	train-other-500	and even other and larger creatures After the final departure of the patrons some of the old inhabitants of the village recalled that a young girl named Louise Mueller who lived with her infirm old grandmother in a cottage on the pitch of the slope
1341-9206-0042	train-other-500	had suddenly disappeared half a hundred years before She had gone out to look for herbs in the forest and there had never been any more news of her afterwards except that three or four days later
1341-9206-0043	train-other-500	some woodcutters who were descending the mountain had found her sickle and her apron a few steps from the cavern From that moment it was evident to everyone that the skeleton which had fallen from the cascade
1341-9206-0044	train-other-500	on the subject of which Haselnoss had turned such fine phrases was no other than that of Louise Mueller The poor girl had doubtless been drawn into the gulf by the mysterious influence which almost daily overcame weaker beings
none	none	 What could this influence be None knew But the inhabitants of Spinbronn superstitious like all mountaineers maintained that the devil lived in the cavern and terror spread in the whole region Now one afternoon in the middle of the month of July eighteen oh two 
1341-9206-0046	train-other-500	my cousin undertook a new classification of the insects in his bandboxes He had secured several rather curious ones the preceding afternoon I was with him holding the lighted candle with one hand and with the other a needle which I heated red hot
1341-9206-0047	train-other-500	Sir Thomas seated his chair tipped back against the sill of a window his feet on a stool watched us work and smoked his cigar with a dreamy air I stood in with Sir Thomas Hawerburch
1341-9206-0048	train-other-500	and I accompanied him every day to the woods in his carriage He enjoyed hearing me chatter in English and wished to make of me as he said a thorough gentleman The butterflies labeled
none	none	 doctor Weber at last opened the box of the largest insects and said 
1341-9206-0049	train-other-500	Yesterday I secured a magnificent horn beetle the great Lucanus cervus of the oaks of the Hartz It has this peculiarity the right claw divides in five branches
1341-9206-0050	train-other-500	It s a rare specimen At the same time I offered him the needle and as he pierced the insect before fixing it on the cork Sir Thomas until then impassive got up and
1341-9206-0051	train-other-500	drawing near a bandbox he began to examine the spider crab of Guiana with a feeling of horror which was strikingly portrayed on his fat vermilion face That is certainly he cried the most frightful work of the creation
1341-9206-0052	train-other-500	The mere sight of it it makes me shudder In truth a sudden pallor overspread his face Bah said my tutor
none	none	 all that is only a prejudice from childhood 
1341-9206-0053	train-other-500	one hears his nurse cry out one is afraid and the impression sticks But if you should consider the spider with a strong microscope you would be astonished at the finish of his members
1341-9206-0054	train-other-500	at their admirable arrangement and even at their elegance It disgusts me interrupted the commodore brusquely Pouah It had turned over in his fingers Oh I don t know why he declared
1341-9206-0055	train-other-500	spiders have always frozen my blood doctor Weber began to laugh and I who shared the feelings of Sir Thomas exclaimed Yes cousin
none	none	 you ought to take this villainous beast out of the box 
1341-9206-0056	train-other-500	it is disgusting it spoils all the rest Little chump he said his eyes sparkling what makes you look at it If you don t like it go take yourself off somewhere Evidently he had taken offense
1341-9206-0057	train-other-500	and Sir Thomas who was then before the window contemplating the mountain turned suddenly took me by the hand and said to me in a manner full of good will Your tutor Frantz sets great store by his spider we like the trees better
1341-9206-0058	train-other-500	the verdure Come let s go for a walk Yes go cried the doctor and come back for supper at six o clock Then raising his voice No hard feelings Sir Hawerburch
1341-9206-0059	train-other-500	The commodore replied laughingly and we got into the carriage which was always waiting in front of the door of the house Sir Thomas wanted to drive himself and dismissed his servant He made me sit beside him on the same seat and we started off for Rothalps
1341-9206-0060	train-other-500	While the carriage was slowly ascending the sandy path an invincible sadness possessed itself of my spirit Sir Thomas on his part was grave He perceived my sadness and said
1341-9206-0061	train-other-500	You don t like spiders Frantz nor do I either But thank Heaven there aren t any dangerous ones in this country The spider crab which your tutor has in his box comes from French Guiana
1341-9206-0062	train-other-500	It inhabits the great swampy forests filled with warm vapors with scalding exhalations this temperature is necessary to its life Its web or rather its vast snare envelops an entire thicket
1341-9206-0063	train-other-500	In it it takes birds as our spiders take flies But drive these disgusting images from your mind and drink a swallow of my old Burgundy Then turning he raised the cover of the rear seat
1341-9206-0064	train-other-500	and drew from the straw a sort of gourd from which he poured me a full bumper in a leather goblet When I had drunk all my good humor returned and I began to laugh at my fright
none	none	 The carriage was drawn by a little Ardennes horse 
1341-9206-0065	train-other-500	thin and nervous as a goat which clambered up the nearly perpendicular path Thousands of insects hummed in the bushes At our right at a hundred paces or more the somber outskirts of the Rothalp forests extended below us
1341-9206-0066	train-other-500	the profound shades of which choked with briers and foul brush showed here and there an opening filled with light On our left tumbled the stream of Spinbronn
1341-9206-0067	train-other-500	and the more we climbed the more did its silvered sheets floating in the abyss
none	none	 grow tinged with azure 
1341-9206-0068	train-other-500	and redouble their sound of cymbals I was captivated by this spectacle Sir Thomas leaning back in the seat his knees as high as his chin abandoned himself to his habitual reveries
1341-9206-0069	train-other-500	while the horse laboring with his feet and hanging his head on his chest as a counter weight to the carriage held on as if suspended on the flank of the rock
none	none	 Soon however we reached a pitch less steep 
1341-9206-0070	train-other-500	the haunt of the roebuck surrounded by tremulous shadows I always lost my head and my eyes too in an immense perspective At the apparition of the shadows I
1341-9206-0071	train-other-500	turned my head and saw the cavern of Spinbronn close at hand The encompassing mists were a magnificent green and the stream which before falling extends over a bed of black sand and pebbles was so clear
1341-9206-0072	train-other-500	that one would have thought it frozen if pale vapors did not follow its surface The horse had just stopped of his own accord to breathe Sir Thomas rising cast his eye over the countryside
1341-9206-0073	train-other-500	How calm everything is said he Then after an instant of silence If you weren t here Frantz I should certainly bathe in the basin But Commodore said I why not bathe
1341-9206-0074	train-other-500	I would do well to stroll around in the neighborhood On the next hill is a great glade filled with wild strawberries I ll go and pick some I ll be back in an hour Ha I should like to Frantz it s a good idea
none	none	 doctor Weber contends that I drink too much Burgundy 
1341-9206-0075	train-other-500	It s necessary to offset wine with mineral water This little bed of sand pleases me Then having set both feet on the ground he hitched the horse to the trunk of a little birch and waved his hand as if to say
1341-9206-0076	train-other-500	You may go I saw him sit down on the moss and draw off his boots As I moved away he turned and called out In an hour Frantz They were his last words
1341-9206-0077	train-other-500	An hour later I returned to the spring The horse the carriage and the clothes of Sir Thomas alone met my eyes The sun was setting The shadows were getting long Not a bird s song under the foliage
1341-9206-0078	train-other-500	not the hum of an insect in the tall grass A silence like death looked down on this solitude The silence frightened me I climbed up on the rock which overlooks the cavern
1341-9206-0079	train-other-500	I looked to the right and to the left Nobody I called No answer The sound of my voice repeated by the echoes filled me with fear
1341-9206-0080	train-other-500	Night settled down slowly A vague sense of horror oppressed me Suddenly the story of the young girl who had disappeared occurred to me and I began to descend on the run
1341-9206-0081	train-other-500	but arriving before the cavern I stopped seized with unaccountable terror in casting a glance in the deep shadows of the spring I had caught sight of two motionless red points
1341-9206-0082	train-other-500	Then I saw long lines wavering in a strange manner in the midst of the darkness and that at a depth where no human eye had ever penetrated
1341-9206-0083	train-other-500	Fear lent my sight and all my senses an unheard of subtlety of perception For several seconds I heard very distinctly the evening plaint of a cricket down at the edge of the wood a dog barking far away
1341-9206-0084	train-other-500	very far in the valley Then my heart compressed for an instant by emotion began to beat furiously and I no longer heard anything Then uttering a horrible cry I fled abandoning the horse the carriage
1341-9206-0085	train-other-500	In less than twenty minutes bounding over the rocks and brush I reached the threshold of our house and cried in a stifled voice Run Run Sir Hawerburch is dead Sir Hawerburch is in the cavern
none	none	 After these words spoken in the presence of my tutor 
1341-9206-0086	train-other-500	of the old woman Agatha and of two or three people invited in that evening by the doctor I fainted I have learned since that during a whole hour I raved deliriously The whole village had gone in search of the commodore
none	none	 Christian Weber hurried them off 
1341-9206-0087	train-other-500	At ten o clock in the evening all the crowd came back bringing the carriage and in the carriage the clothes of Sir Hawerburch They had discovered nothing It was
1341-9206-0088	train-other-500	impossible to take ten steps in the cavern without being suffocated During their absence Agatha and I waited sitting in the chimney corner I howling incoherent words of terror
1341-9206-0089	train-other-500	she with hands crossed on her knees eyes wide open going from time to time to the window to see what was taking place for from the foot of the mountain one could see torches flitting in the woods One could hear hoarse voices in the distance
1341-9206-0090	train-other-500	calling to each other in the night At the approach of her master Agatha began to tremble The doctor entered brusquely pale his lips compressed despair written on his face
1341-9206-0091	train-other-500	A score of woodcutters followed him tumultuously in great felt hats with wide brims swarthy visaged shaking the ash from their torches Scarcely was he in the hall when my tutor s glittering eyes seemed to look for something
1341-9206-0092	train-other-500	He caught sight of the negress and without a word having passed between them the poor woman began to cry No no I don t want to And I wish it
1341-9206-0093	train-other-500	replied the doctor in a hard tone One would have said that the negress had been seized by an invincible power She shuddered from head to foot
none	none	 and Christian Weber showing her a bench 
1341-9206-0094	train-other-500	she sat down with a corpse like stiffness All the bystanders witnesses of this shocking spectacle good folk with primitive and crude manners but full of pious sentiments made the sign of the cross
1341-9206-0095	train-other-500	and I who knew not then even by name of the terrible magnetic power of the will began to tremble believing that Agatha was dead Christian Weber approached the negress

none	none	 Are you there 
1341-9206-0097	train-other-500	said he Yes master Sir Thomas Hawerburch At these words she shuddered again
none	none	 Do you see him 
1341-9206-0098	train-other-500	Yes yes she gasped in a strangling voice I see him Where is he Up there in the back of the cavern dead
1341-9206-0099	train-other-500	Dead said the doctor how The spider
none	none	 Oh the spider crab 
1341-9206-0100	train-other-500	Oh Control your agitation said the doctor who was quite pale tell us plainly The spider crab holds him by the throat he is there at the back under the rock wound round by webs
none	none	 Ah Christian Weber cast a cold glance toward his assistants who 
1341-9206-0101	train-other-500	crowding around with their eyes sticking out of their heads were listening intently
none	none	 and I heard him murmur It s horrible 
1341-9206-0102	train-other-500	horrible Then he resumed You see him I see him And the spider is it big Oh master
none	none	 never never have I seen such a large one 
1341-9206-0103	train-other-500	not even on the banks of the Mocaris nor in the lowlands of Konanama It is as large as my head There was a long silence
1341-9206-0104	train-other-500	All the assistants looked at each other their faces livid their hair standing up
none	none	 Christian Weber alone seemed calm 
1341-9206-0105	train-other-500	having passed his hand several times over the negress s forehead he continued Agatha tell us how death befell Sir Hawerburch He was bathing in the basin of the spring
none	none	 the spider saw him from behind 
1341-9206-0106	train-other-500	with his bare back It was hungry it had fasted for a long time it saw him with his arms on the water
none	none	 Suddenly it came out like a flash and placed its fangs around the commodore s neck and he cried out Oh oh my God It stung and fled 
1341-9206-0107	train-other-500	Sir Hawerburch sank down in the water and died Then the spider returned and surrounded him with its web and he floated
none	none	 gently gently to the back of the cavern 
1341-9206-0108	train-other-500	It drew in on the web Now he is all black The doctor turning to me who no longer felt the shock asked
1341-9206-0109	train-other-500	Is it true Frantz that the commodore went in bathing Yes Cousin Christian At what time At four o clock At four o clock it was very warm wasn t it
1341-9206-0110	train-other-500	Oh yes It s certainly so said he striking his forehead The monster could come out without fear He pronounced a few unintelligible words and then
1341-9206-0111	train-other-500	looking toward the mountaineers My friends he cried that is where this mass of debris came from of skeletons which spread terror among the bathers That is what has ruined you all
1341-9206-0112	train-other-500	it is the spider crab It is there hidden in its web awaiting its prey in the back of the cavern Who can tell the number of its victims And full of fury he led the way shouting Fagots
1341-9206-0113	train-other-500	Fagots The woodcutters followed him vociferating Ten minutes later two large wagons laden with fagots were slowly mounting the slope A long file of woodcutters their backs bent double followed
1341-9206-0114	train-other-500	enveloped in the somber night My tutor and I walked ahead leading the horses by their bridles and the melancholy moon vaguely lighted this funereal march From time to time the wheels grated
1341-9206-0115	train-other-500	Then the carts raised by the irregularities of the rocky road fell again in the track with a heavy jolt As we drew near the cavern on the playground of the roebucks our cortege halted
1341-9206-0116	train-other-500	The torches were lit and the crowd advanced toward the gulf The limpid water running over the sand reflected the bluish flame of the resinous torches the rays of which revealed the tops of the black firs leaning over the rock
1341-9206-0117	train-other-500	This is the place to unload the doctor then said It s necessary to block up the mouth of the cavern And it was not without a feeling of terror that each undertook the duty of executing his orders
1341-9206-0118	train-other-500	The fagots fell from the top of the loads A few stakes driven down before the opening of the spring prevented the water from carrying them away Toward midnight the mouth of the cavern was completely closed
1341-9206-0119	train-other-500	The water running over spread to both sides on the moss The top fagots were perfectly dry then doctor Weber supplying himself with a torch himself lit the fire The flames ran from twig to twig with an angry crackling
1341-9206-0120	train-other-500	and soon leaped toward the sky chasing clouds of smoke before them It was a strange and savage spectacle
none	none	 the great pile with trembling shadows lit up in this way This cavern poured forth black smoke 
1341-9206-0121	train-other-500	unceasingly renewed and disgorged All around stood the woodcutters somber motionless expectant their eyes fixed on the opening and I although trembling from head to foot in fear could not tear away my gaze
none	none	 It was a good quarter of an hour that we waited and doctor Weber was beginning to grow impatient 
1341-9206-0122	train-other-500	when a black object with long hooked claws appeared suddenly in the shadow and precipitated itself toward the opening A cry resounded about the pyre The spider driven back by the live coals reentered its cave
1341-9206-0123	train-other-500	Then smothered doubtless by the smoke it returned to the charge and leaped out into the midst of the flames Its long legs curled up It was as large as my head and of a violet red
1341-9206-0124	train-other-500	One of the woodcutters fearing lest it leap clear of the fire threw his hatchet at it and with such good aim that on the instant the fire around it was covered with blood
1341-9206-0125	train-other-500	But soon the flames burst out more vigorously over it and consumed the horrible destroyer Such Master Frantz was the strange event which destroyed the fine reputation
1341-9206-0126	train-other-500	which the waters of Spinbronn formerly enjoyed I can certify the scrupulous precision of my account But as for giving you an explanation that would be impossible for me to do
1341-9206-0127	train-other-500	At the same time allow me to tell you that it does not seem to me absurd to admit that a spider under the influence of a temperature raised by thermal waters
1341-9206-0128	train-other-500	which affords the same conditions of life and development as the scorching climates of Africa and South America should attain a fabulous size
none	none	 It was this same extreme heat 
1341-9206-0129	train-other-500	which explains the prodigious exuberance of the antediluvian creation However that may be my tutor

Pommereul a token of the friendship between our fathers which survives in their sons DE BALZAC There is a special variety of human nature obtained in the Social Kingdom by a process analogous to that of the gardener s craft in the Vegetable Kingdom to wit by the forcing house a species of hybrid which can be raised neither from seed nor from slips This product is known as the Cashier an anthropomorphous growth watered by religious doctrine trained up in fear of the guillotine pruned by vice to flourish on a third floor with an estimable wife by his side and an uninteresting family The number of cashiers in Paris must always be a problem for the physiologist Has anyone as yet been able to state correctly the terms of the proportion sum wherein the cashier figures as the unknown x Where will you find the man who shall live with wealth like a cat with a caged mouse This man for further qualification shall be capable of sitting boxed in behind an iron grating for seven or eight hours a day during seven eighths of the year perched upon a cane seated chair in a space as narrow as a lieutenant s cabin on board a man of war Such a man must be able to defy anchylosis of the knee

or institution you please and select Paris that city of fiery ordeals and branch establishment of hell as the soil in which to plant the said cashier So be it Creeds schools institutions and moral systems all human rules and regulations great and small will one after another present much the same face that an intimate friend turns upon you when you ask him to lend you a thousand francs With a dolorous dropping of the jaw they indicate the guillotine much as your friend aforesaid will furnish you with the address of the money lender pointing you to one of the hundred gates by which a man comes to the last refuge of the destitute one For the narrative Melmoth the Wanderer and a description of Balzac s debt to its author see Volume III page one hundred sixty one EDITOR Yet Nature has her freaks in the making of a man s mind she indulges herself and makes a few honest folk now and again and now and then a cashier Wherefore that race of corsairs whom we dignify with the title of bankers the gentry who take out a license for which they pay a thousand crowns as the privateer takes out his letters of marque hold these rare products of the incubations of virtue in such esteem that they confine them in cages in their counting houses much as governments procure and maintain specimens of strange beasts at their own charges If the cashier is possessed of an imagination or of a fervid temperament if as will sometimes happen to the most complete cashier he loves his wife and that wife grows tired of her lot has ambitions or merely some vanity in her composition the cashier is undone Search the chronicles of the counting house You will not find a single instance of a cashier attaining a position as it is called They are sent to the hulks they go to foreign parts they vegetate on a second floor in the Rue Saint Louis among the market gardens of the Marais Some day when the cashiers of Paris come to a sense of their real value a cashier will be hardly obtainable for money Still certain it is that there are people who are fit for nothing but to be cashiers just as the bent of a certain order of mind inevitably makes for rascality But oh marvel of our civilization Society rewards virtue with an income of a hundred louis in old age a dwelling on a second floor bread sufficient occasional new bandana handkerchiefs an elderly wife and her offspring So much for virtue But for the opposite course a little boldness a faculty for keeping on the windward side of the law as Turenne outflanked Montecuculli and Society will sanction the theft of millions shower ribbons upon the thief cram him with honors and smother him with consideration Government moreover works harmoniously with this profoundly illogical reasoner Society Government levies a conscription on the young intelligence of the kingdom at the age of seventeen or eighteen a conscription of precocious power Great ability is prematurely exhausted by excessive brain work before it is sent up to be submitted to a process of selection Nurserymen sort and select seeds in much the same way To this process the Government brings professional appraisers of talent men who can assay brains as experts assay gold at the Mint Five hundred such heads set afire with hope are sent up annually by the most progressive portion of the population and of these the Government takes one third puts them in sacks called the Ecoles and shakes them up together for three years Though every one of these young plants represents vast productive power they are made as one may say into cashiers They receive appointments the rank and file of engineers is made up of them they are employed as captains of artillery there is no subaltern grade to which they may not aspire Finally when these men the pick of the youth of the nation fattened on mathematics and stuffed with knowledge have attained the age of fifty years they have their reward and receive as the price of their services the third floor lodging the wife and family and all the comforts that sweeten life for mediocrity If from among this race of dupes there should escape some five or six men of genius who climb the highest heights is it not miraculous This is an exact statement of the relations between Talent and Probity on the one hand and Government and Society on the other in an age that considers itself to be progressive Without this prefatory explanation a recent occurrence in Paris would seem improbable but preceded by this summing up of the situation it will perhaps receive some thoughtful attention from minds capable oL recognizing the real plague spots of our civilization a civilization which since eighteen fifteen has been moved by the spirit of gain rather than by principles of honor About five o clock on a dull autumn afternoon the cashier of one of the largest banks in Paris was still at his desk working by the light of a lamp that had been lit for some time In accordance with the use and wont of commerce the counting house was in the darkest corner of the low ceiled and far from spacious mezzanine floor and at the very end of a passage lighted only by borrowed lights The office doors along this corridor each with its label gave the place the look of a bath house At four o clock the stolid porter had proclaimed according to his orders The bank is closed And by this time the departments were deserted the letters dispatched the clerks had taken their leave The wives of the partners in the firm were expecting their lovers the two bankers dining with their mistresses Everything was in order The place where the strong boxes had been bedded in sheet iron was just behind the little sanctum where the cashier was busy Doubtless he was balancing his books The open front gave a glimpse of a safe of hammered iron so enormously heavy thanks to the science of the modern inventor that burglars could not carry it away The door only opened at the pleasure of those who knew its password The letter lock was a warden who kept its own secret and could not be bribed the mysterious word was an ingenious realization of the Open sesame in the Arabian Nights But even this was as nothing A man might discover the password but unless he knew the lock s final secret the ultima ratio of this gold guarding dragon of mechanical science it discharged a blunderbuss at his head The door of the room the walls of the room the shutters of the windows in the room the whole place in fact was lined with sheet iron a third of an inch in thickness concealed behind the thin wooden paneling The shutters had been closed the door had been shut If ever man could feel confident that he was absolutely alone and that there was no remote possibility of being watched by prying eyes that man was the cashier of the house of Nucingen and Company in the Rue Saint Lazare Accordingly the deepest silence prevailed in that iron cave The fire had died out in the stove but the room was full of that tepid warmth which produces the dull heavy headedness and nauseous queasiness of a morning after an orgy The stove is a mesmerist that plays no small part in the reduction of bank clerks and porters to a state of idiocy A room with a stove in it is a retort in which the power of strong men is evaporated where their vitality is exhausted and their wills enfeebled Government offices are part of a great scheme for the manufacture of the mediocrity necessary for the maintenance of a Feudal System on a pecuniary basis and money is the foundation of the Social Contract See Les Employes The mephitic vapors in the atmosphere of a crowded room contribute in no small degree to bring about a gradual deterioration of intelligences the brain that gives off the largest quantity of nitrogen asphyxiates the others in the long run The cashier was a man of five and forty or thereabouts As he sat at the table the light from a moderator lamp shining full on his bald head and glistening fringe of iron gray hair that surrounded it this baldness and the round outlines of his face made his head look very like a ball His complexion was brick red a few wrinkles had gathered about his eyes but he had the smooth plump hands of a stout man His blue cloth coat a little rubbed and worn and the creases and shininess of his trousers traces of hard wear that the clothes brush fails to remove would impress a superficial observer with the idea that here was a thrifty and upright human being sufficient of the philosopher or of the aristocrat to wear shabby clothes But unluckily it is easy to find penny wise people who will prove weak wasteful or incompetent in the capital things of life The cashier wore the ribbon of the Legion of Honor at his buttonhole for he had been a major of dragoons in the time of the Emperor M de Nucingen who had been a contractor before he became a banker had had reason in those days to know the honorable disposition of his cashier who then occupied a high position Reverses of fortune had befallen the major and the banker out of regard for him paid him five hundred francs a month The soldier had become a cashier in the year eighteen thirteen after his recovery from a wound received at Studzianka during the Retreat from Moscow followed by six months of enforced idleness at Strasbourg whither several officers had been transported by order of the Emperor that they might receive skilled attention This particular officer Castanier by name retired with the honorary grade of colonel and a pension of two thousand four hundred francs In ten years time the cashier had completely effaced the soldier and Castanier inspired the banker with such trust in him that he was associated in the transactions that went on in the private office behind his little counting house The baron himself had access to it by means of a secret staircase There matters of business were decided It was the bolting room where proposals were sifted the privy council chamber where the reports of the money market were analyzed circular notes issued thence and finally the private ledger and the journal which summarized the work of all the departments were kept there Castanier had gone himself to shut the door which opened on to a staircase that led to the parlor occupied by the two bankers on the first floor of their hotel This done he had sat down at his desk again and for a moment he gazed at a little collection of letters of credit drawn on the firm of Watschildine of London Then he had taken up the pen and imitated the banker s signature upon each Nucingen he wrote and eyed the forged signatures critically to see which seemed the most perfect copy Suddenly he looked up as if a needle had pricked him You are not alone a boding voice seemed to cry in his heart and indeed the forger saw a man standing at the little grated window of the counting house a man whose breathing was so noiseless that he did not seem to breathe at all Castanier looked and saw that the door at the end of the passage was wide open the stranger must have entered by that way For the first time in his life the old soldier felt a sensation of dread that made him stare open mouthed and wide eyed at the man before him and for that matter the appearance of the apparition was sufficiently alarming even if unaccompanied by the mysterious circumstances of so sudden an entry The rounded forehead the harsh coloring of the long oval face indicated quite as plainly as the cut of his clothes that the man was an Englishman reeking of his native isles You had only to look at the collar of his overcoat at the voluminous cravat which smothered the crushed frills of a shirt front so white that it brought out the changeless leaden hue of an impassive face and the thin red line of the lips that seemed made to suck the blood of corpses and you could guess at once at the black gaiters buttoned up to the knee and the half puritanical costume of a wealthy Englishman dressed for a walking excursion The intolerable glitter of the stranger s eyes produced a vivid and unpleasant impression which was only deepened by the rigid outlines of his features The dried up emaciated creature seemed to carry within him some gnawing thought that consumed him and could not be appeased He must have digested his food so rapidly that he could doubtless eat continually without bringing any trace of color into his face or features A tun of Tokay vin de succession would not have caused any faltering in that piercing glance that read men s inmost thoughts nor dethroned the merciless reasoning faculty that always seemed to go to the bottom of things There was something of the fell and tranquil majesty of a tiger about him I have come to cash this bill of exchange sir he said Castanier felt the tones of his voice thrill through every nerve with a violent shock similar to that given by a discharge of electricity The safe is closed said Castanier It is open said the Englishman looking round the counting house To morrow is Sunday and I cannot wait The amount is for five hundred thousand francs You have the money there and I must have it But how did you come in sir The Englishman smiled That smile frightened Castanier No words could have replied more fully nor more peremptorily than that scornful and imperial curl of the stranger s lips Castanier turned away took up fifty packets each containing ten thousand francs in bank notes and held them out to the stranger receiving in exchange for them a bill accepted by the Baron de Nucingen A sort of convulsive tremor ran through him as he saw a red gleam in the stranger s eyes when they fell on the forged signature on the letter of credit It it wants your signature stammered Castanier handing back the bill Hand me your pen answered the Englishman Castanier handed him the pen with which he had just committed forgery The stranger wrote John Melmoth then he returned the slip of paper and the pen to the cashier Castanier looked at the handwriting noticing that it sloped from right to left in the Eastern fashion and Melmoth disappeared so noiselessly that when Castanier looked up again an exclamation broke from him partly because the man was no longer there partly because he felt a strange painful sensation such as our imagination might take for an effect of poison The pen that Melmoth had handled sent the same sickening heat through him that an emetic produces But it seemed impossible to Castanier that the Englishman should have guessed his crime His inward qualms he attributed to the palpitation of the heart that according to received ideas was sure to follow at once on such a turn as the stranger had given him The devil take it I am very stupid Providence is watching over me for if that brute had come round to see my gentlemen to morrow my goose would have been cooked said Castanier and he burned the unsuccessful attempts at forgery in the stove He put the bill that he meant to take with him in an envelope and helped himself to five hundred thousand francs in French and English bank notes from the safe which he locked Then he put everything in order lit a candle blew out the lamp took up his hat and umbrella and went out sedately as usual to leave one of the two keys of the strong room with Madame de Nucingen in the absence of her husband the baron You are in luck M Castanier said the banker s wife as he entered her room we have a holiday on Monday you can go into the country or to Soizy Madame will you be so good as to tell your husband that the bill of exchange on Watschildine which was behind time has just been presented The five hundred thousand francs have been paid so I shall not come back till noon on Tuesday Good by monsieur I hope you will have a pleasant time The same to you madame replied the old dragoon as he went out He glanced as he spoke at a young man well known in fashionable society at that time a M de Rastignac who was regarded as Madame de Nucingen s lover Madame remarked this latter the old boy looks to me as if he meant to play you some ill turn Pshaw impossible he is too stupid Piquoizeau said the cashier walking into the porter s room what made you let anybody come up after four o clock I have been smoking a pipe here in the doorway ever since four o clock said the man and nobody has gone into the bank Nobody has come out either except the gentlemen Are you quite sure Yes upon my word and honor Stay though at four o clock M Werbrust s friend came a young fellow from Messrs du Tillet company in the Rue Joubert All right said Castanier and he hurried away The sickening sensation of heat that he had felt when he took back the pen returned in greater intensity Mille diables thought he as he threaded his way along the Boulevard de Gand haven t I taken proper precautions Let me think Two clear days Sunday and Monday then a day of uncertainty before they begin to look for me altogether three days and four nights respite I have a couple of passports and two different disguises is not that enough to throw the cleverest detective off the scent On Tuesday morning I shall draw a million francs in London before the slightest suspicion has been aroused My debts I am leaving behind for the benefit of my creditors who will put a P one on the bills and I shall live comfortably in Italy for the rest of my days as the Conte Ferraro I was alone with him when he died poor fellow in the marsh of Zembin and I shall slip into his skin Mille diables the woman who is to follow after me might give them a clew Think of an old campaigner like me infatuated enough to tie myself to a petticoat tail Why take her I must leave her behind Yes I could make up my mind to it but I know myself I should be ass enough to go back for her Still nobody knows Aquilina Shall I take her or leave her one Protested You will not take her cried a voice that filled Castanier with sickening dread He turned sharply and saw the Englishman The devil is in it cried the cashier aloud Melmoth had passed his victim by this time and if Castanier s first impulse had been to fasten a quarrel on a man who read his own thoughts he was so much torn by opposing feelings that the immediate result was a temporary paralysis When he resumed his walk he fell once more into that fever of irresolution which besets those who are so carried away by passion that they are ready to commit a crime but have not sufficient strength of character to keep it to themselves without suffering terribly in the process So although Castanier had made up his mind to reap the fruits of a crime which was already half executed he hesitated to carry out his designs For him as for many men of mixed character in whom weakness and strength are equally blended the least trifling consideration determines whether they shall continue to lead blameless lives or become actively criminal In the vast masses of men enrolled in Napoleon s armies there were many who like Castanier possessed the purely physical courage demanded on the battlefield yet lacked the moral courage which makes a man as great in crime as he could have been in virtue The letter of credit was drafted in such terms that immediately on his arrival he might draw twenty five thousand pounds on the firm of Watschildine the London correspondents of the house of Nucingen The London house had been already advised of the draft about to be made upon them he had written to them himself He had instructed an agent chosen at random to take his passage in a vessel which was to leave Portsmouth with a wealthy English family on board who were going to Italy and the passage money had been paid in the name of the Conte Ferraro The smallest details of the scheme had been thought out He had arranged matters so as to divert the search that would be made for him into Belgium and Switzerland while he himself was at sea in the English vessel Then by the time that Nucingen might flatter himself that he was on the track of his late cashier the said cashier as the Conte Ferraro hoped to be safe in Naples He had determined to disfigure his face in order to disguise himself the more completely and by means of an acid to imitate the scars of smallpox Yet in spite of all these precautions which surely seemed as if they must secure him complete immunity his conscience tormented him he was afraid The even and peaceful life that he had led for so long had modified the morality of the camp His life was stainless as yet he could not sully it without a pang So for the last time he abandoned himself to all the influences of the better self that strenuously resisted Pshaw he said at last at the corner of the Boulevard and the Rue Montmartre I will take a cab after the play this evening and go out to Versailles A post chaise will be ready for me at my old quartermaster s place He would keep my secret even if a dozen men were standing ready to shoot him down The chances are all in my favor so far as I see so I shall take my little Naqui with me and I will go You will not go exclaimed the Englishman and the strange tones of his voice drove all the cashier s blood back to his heart Melmoth stepped into a tilbury which was waiting for him and was whirled away so quickly that when Castanier looked up he saw his foe some hundred paces away from him and before it even crossed his mind to cut off the man s retreat the tilbury was far on its way up the Boulevard Montmartre Well upon my word there is something supernatural about this said he to himself If I were fool enough to believe in God I should think that He had set Saint Michael on my tracks Suppose that the devil and the police should let me go on as I please so as to nab me in the nick of time Did anyone ever see the like But there this is folly Castanier went along the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre slackening his pace as he neared the Rue Richer There on the second floor of a block of buildings which looked out upon some gardens lived the unconscious cause of Castanier s crime a young woman known in the quarter as Mme de la Garde A concise history of certain events in the cashier s past life must be given in order to explain these facts and to give a complete presentment of the crisis when he yielded to temptation Mme de la Garde said that she was a Piedmontese No one not even Castanier knew her real name She was one of those young girls who are driven by dire misery by inability to earn a living or by fear of starvation to have recourse to a trade which most of them loathe many regard with indifference and some few follow in obedience to the laws of their constitution But on the brink of the gulf of prostitution in Paris the young girl of sixteen beautiful and pure as the Madonna had met with Castanier The old dragoon was too rough and homely to make his way in society and he was tired of tramping the boulevard at night and of the kind of conquests made there by gold For some time past he had desired to bring a certain regularity into an irregular life He was struck by the beauty of the poor child who had drifted by chance into his arms and his determination to rescue her from the life of the streets was half benevolent half selfish as some of the thoughts of the best of men are apt to be Social conditions mingle elements of evil with the promptings of natural goodness of heart and the mixture of motives underlying a man s intentions should be leniently judged Castanier had just cleverness enough to be very shrewd where his own interests were concerned So he concluded to be a philanthropist on either count and at first made her his mistress Hey hey he said to himself in his soldierly fashion I am an old wolf and a sheep shall not make a fool of me Castanier old man before you set up housekeeping reconnoiter the girl s character for a bit and see if she is a steady sort This irregular union gave the Piedmontese a status the most nearly approaching respectability among those which the world declines to recognize During the first year she took the nom de guerre of Aquilina one of the characters in Venice Preserved which she had chanced to read She fancied that she resembled the courtesan in face and general appearance and in a certain precocity of heart and brain of which she was conscious When Castanier found that her life was as well regulated and virtuous as was possible for a social outlaw he manifested a desire that they should live as husband and wife So she took the name of Mme de la Garde in order to approach as closely as Parisian usages permit the conditions of a real marriage As a matter of fact many of these unfortunate girls have one fixed idea to be looked upon as respectable middle class women who lead humdrum lives of faithfulness to their husbands women who would make excellent mothers keepers of household accounts and menders of household linen This longing springs from a sentiment so laudable that society should take it into consideration But society incorrigible as ever will assuredly persist in regarding the married woman as a corvette duly authorized by her flag and papers to go on her own course while the woman who is a wife in all but name is a pirate and an outlaw for lack of a document A day came when Mme de la Garde would fain have signed herself Mme Castanier The cashier was put out by this So you do not love me well enough to marry me she said Castanier did not answer he was absorbed by his thoughts The poor girl resigned herself to her fate The ex dragoon was in despair Naqui s heart softened toward him at the sight of his trouble she tried to soothe him but what could she do when she did not know what ailed him When Naqui made up her mind to know the secret although she never asked him a question the cashier dolefully confessed to the existence of a Mme Castanier This lawful wife a thousand times accursed was living in a humble way in Strasbourg on a small property there he wrote to her twice a year and kept the secret of her existence so well that no one suspected that he was married The reason of this reticence If it is familiar to many military men who may chance to be in a like predicament it is perhaps worth while to give the story Your genuine trooper if it is allowable here to employ the word which in the army signifies a man who is destined to die as a captain is a sort of serf a part and parcel of his regiment an essentially simple creature and Castanier was marked out by nature as a victim to the wiles of mothers with grown up daughters left too long on their hands It was at Nancy during one of those brief intervals of repose when the Imperial armies were not on active service abroad that Castanier was so unlucky as to pay some attention to a young lady with whom he danced at a ridotto the provincial name for the entertainments often given by the military to the townsfolk or vice versa in garrison towns A scheme for inveigling the gallant captain into matrimony was immediately set on foot one of those schemes by which mothers secure accomplices in a human heart by touching all its motive springs while they convert all their friends into fellow conspirators Like all people possessed by one idea these ladies press everything into the service of their great project slowly elaborating their toils much as the ant lion excavates its funnel in the sand and lies in wait at the bottom for its victim Suppose that no one strays after all into that carefully constructed labyrinth Suppose that the ant lion dies of hunger and thirst in her pit Such things may be but if any heedless creature once enters in it never comes out All the wires which could be pulled to induce action on the captain s part were tried appeals were made to the secret interested motives that always come into play in such cases they worked on Castanier s hopes and on the weaknesses and vanity of human nature Unluckily he had praised the daughter to her mother when he brought her back after a waltz a little chat followed and then an invitation in the most natural way in the world Once introduced into the house the dragoon was dazzled by the hospitality of a family who appeared to conceal their real wealth beneath a show of careful economy He was skillfully flattered on all sides and everyone extolled for his benefit the various treasures there displayed A neatly timed dinner served on plate lent by an uncle the attention shown to him by the only daughter of the house the gossip of the town a well to do sub lieutenant who seemed likely to cut the ground from under his feet all the innumerable snares in short of the provincial ant lion were set for him and to such good purpose that Castanier said five years later To this day I do not know how it came about The dragoon received fifteen thousand francs with the lady who after two years of marriage became the ugliest and consequently the most peevish woman on earth Luckily they had no children The fair complexion maintained by a Spartan regimen the fresh bright color in her face which spoke of an engaging modesty became overspread with blotches and pimples her figure which had seemed so straight grew crooked the angel became a suspicious and shrewish creature who drove Castanier frantic Then the fortune took to itself wings At length the dragoon no longer recognizing the woman whom he had wedded left her to live on a little property at Strasbourg until the time when it should please God to remove her to adorn Paradise She was one of those virtuous women who for want of other occupation would weary the life out of an angel with complainings who pray till if their prayers are heard in heaven they must exhaust the patience of the Almighty and say everything that is bad of their husbands in dove like murmurs over a game of boston with their neighbors When Aquilina learned all these troubles she clung still more affectionately to Castanier and made him so happy varying with woman s ingenuity the pleasures with which she filled his life that all unwittingly she was the cause of the cashier s downfall Like many women who seem by nature destined to sound all the depths of love Mme de la Garde was disinterested She asked neither for gold nor for jewelry gave no thought to the future lived entirely for the present and for the pleasures of the present She accepted expensive ornaments and dresses the carriage so eagerly coveted by women of her class as one harmony the more in the picture of life There was absolutely no vanity in her desire not to appear at a better advantage but to look the fairer and moreover no woman could live without luxuries more cheerfully When a man of generous nature and military men are mostly of this stamp meets with such a woman he feels a sort of exasperation at finding himself her debtor in generosity He feels that he could stop a mail coach to obtain money for her if he has not sufficient for her whims He will commit a crime if so he may be great and noble in the eyes of some woman or of his special public such is the nature of the man Such a lover is like a gambler who would be dishonored in his own eyes if he did not repay the sum he borrowed from a waiter in a gaming house but will shrink from no crime will leave his wife and children without a penny and rob and murder if so he may come to the gaming table with a full purse and his honor remain untarnished among the frequenters of that fatal abode So it was with Castanier He had begun by installing Aquilina in a modest fourth floor dwelling the furniture being of the simplest kind But when he saw the girl s beauty and great qualities when he had known inexpressible and unlooked for happiness with her he began to dote upon her and longed to adorn his idol Then Aquilina s toilet was so comically out of keeping with her poor abode that for both their sakes it was clearly incumbent on him to move The change swallowed up almost all Castanier s savings for he furnished his domestic paradise with all the prodigality that is lavished on a kept mistress A pretty woman must have everything pretty about her the unity of charm in the woman and her surroundings singles her out from among her sex This sentiment of homogeneity indeed though it has frequently escaped the attention of observers is instinctive in human nature and the same prompting leads elderly spinsters to surround themselves with dreary relies of the past But the lovely Piedmontese must have the newest and latest fashions and all that was daintiest and prettiest in stuffs for hangings in silks or jewelry in fine china and other brittle and fragile wares She asked for nothing but when she was called upon to make a choice when Castanier asked her Which do you like she would answer Why this is the nicest Love never counts the cost and Castanier therefore always took the nicest When once the standard had been set up there was nothing for it but everything in the household must be in conformity from the linen plate and crystal through a thousand and one items of expenditure down to the pots and pans in the kitchen Castanier had meant to do things simply as the saying goes but he gradually found himself more and more in debt One expense entailed another The clock called for candle sconces Fires must be lighted in the ornamental grates but the curtains and hangings were too fresh and delicate to be soiled by smuts so they must be replaced by patent and elaborate fireplaces warranted to give out no smoke recent inventions of the people who are clever at drawing up a prospectus Then Aquilina found it so nice to run about barefooted on the carpet in her room that Castanier must have soft carpets laid everywhere for the pleasure of playing with Naqui A bathroom too was built for her everything to the end that she might be more comfortable Shopkeepers workmen and manufacturers in Paris have a mysterious knack of enlarging a hole in a man s purse They cannot give the price of anything upon inquiry and as the paroxysm of longing cannot abide delay orders are given by the feeble light of an approximate estimate of cost The same people never send in the bills at once but ply the purchaser with furniture till his head spins Everything is so pretty so charming and everyone is satisfied A few months later the obliging furniture dealers are metamorphosed and reappear in the shape of alarming totals on invoices that fill the soul with their horrid clamor they are in urgent want of the money they are as you may say on the brink of bankruptcy their tears flow it is heartrending to hear them And then the gulf yawns and gives up serried columns of figures marching four deep when as a matter of fact they should have issued innocently three by three Before Castanier had any idea of how much he had spent he had arranged for Aquilina to have a carriage from a livery stable when she went out instead of a cab Castanier was a gourmand he engaged an excellent cook and Aquilina to please him had herself made the purchases of early fruit and vegetables rare delicacies and exquisite wines But as Aquilina had nothing of her own these gifts of hers so precious by reason of the thought and tact and graciousness that prompted them were no less a drain upon Castanier s purse he did not like his Naqui to be without money and Naqui could not keep money in her pocket So the table was a heavy item of expenditure for a man with Castanier s income The ex dragoon was compelled to resort to various shifts for obtaining money for he could not bring himself to renounce this delightful life He loved the woman too well to cross the freaks of the mistress He was one of those men who through self love or through weakness of character can refuse nothing to a woman false shame overpowers them and they rather face ruin than make the admissions I cannot My means will not permit I cannot afford When therefore Castanier saw that if he meant to emerge from the abyss of debt into which he had plunged he must part with Aquilina and live upon bread and water he was so unable to do without her or to change his habits of life that daily he put off his plans of reform until the morrow The debts were pressing and he began by borrowing money His position and previous character inspired confidence and of this he took advantage to devise a system of borrowing money as he required it Then as the total amount of debt rapidly increased he had recourse to those commercial inventions known as accommodation bills This form of bill does not represent goods or other value received and the first indorser pays the amount named for the obliging person who accepts it This species of fraud is tolerated because it is impossible to detect it and moreover it is an imaginary fraud which only becomes real if payment is ultimately refused When at length it was evidently impossible to borrow any longer whether because the amount of the debt was now so greatly increased or because Castanier was unable to pay the large amount of interest on the aforesaid sums of money the cashier saw bankruptcy before him On making this discovery he decided for a fraudulent bankruptcy rather than an ordinary failure and preferred a crime to a misdemeanor He determined after the fashion of the celebrated cashier of the Royal Treasury to abuse the trust deservedly won and to increase the number of his creditors by making a final loan of the sum sufficient to keep him in comfort in a foreign country for the rest of his days All this as has been seen he had prepared to do Aquilina knew nothing of the irksome cares of this life she enjoyed her existence as many a woman does making no inquiry as to where the money came from even as sundry other folk will eat their buttered rolls untroubled by any restless spirit of curiosity as to the culture and growth of wheat but as the labor and miscalculations of agriculture lie on the other side of the baker s oven so beneath the unappreciated luxury of many a Parisian household lie intolerable anxieties and exorbitant toil While Castanier was enduring the torture of the strain and his thoughts were full of the deed that should change his whole life Aquilina was lying luxuriously back in a great armchair by the fireside beguiling the time by chatting with her waiting maid As frequently happens in such cases the maid had become the mistress s confidante Jenny having first assured herself that her mistress s ascendancy over Castanier was complete What are we to do this evening Leon seems determined to come Mme de la Garde was saying as she read a passionate epistle indicted upon a faint gray note paper Here is the master said Jenny Castanier came in Aquilina nowise disconcerted crumpled up the letter took it with the tongs and held it in the flames So that is what you do with your love letters is it asked Castanier Oh goodness yes said Aquilina is it not the best way of keeping them safe Besides fire should go to the fire as water makes for the river You are talking as if it were a real love letter Naqui Well am I not handsome enough to receive them she said holding up her forehead for a kiss There was a carelessness in her manner that would have told any man less blind than Castanier that it was only a piece of conjugal duty as it were to give this joy to the cashier but use and wont had brought Castanier to the point where clear sightedness is no longer possible for love I have taken a box at the Gymnase this evening he said let us have dinner early and then we need not dine in a hurry Go and take Jenny I am tired of plays I do not know what is the matter with me this evening I would rather stay here by the fire Come all the same though Naqui I shall not be here to bore you much longer Yes Quiqui I am going to start to night and it will be some time before I come back again I am leaving everything in your charge Will you keep your heart for me too Neither my heart nor anything else she said but when you come back again Naqui will still be Naqui for you Well this is frankness So you would not follow me No Why not Eh why how can I leave the lover who writes me such sweet little notes she asked pointing to the blackened scrap of paper with a mocking smile Is there any truth in it asked Castanier Have you really a lover Really cried Aquilina and have you never given it a serious thought dear To begin with you are fifty years old Then you have just the sort of face to put on a fruit stall if the woman tried to sell you for a pumpkin no one would contradict her You puff and blow like a seal when you come upstairs your paunch rises and falls like the diamond on a woman s forehead It is pretty plain that you served in the dragoons you are a very ugly looking old man Fiddle de dee If you have any mind to keep my respect I recommend you not to add imbecility to these qualities by imagining that such a girl as I am will be content with your asthmatic love and not look for youth and good looks and pleasure by way of variety Aquilina you are laughing of course Oh very well and are you not laughing too Do you take me for a fool telling me that you are going away I am going to start to night she said mimicking his tones Stuff and nonsense Would you talk like that if you were really going away from your Naqui You would cry like the booby that you are After all if I go will you follow he asked Tell me first whether this journey of yours is a bad joke or not Yes seriously I am going Well then seriously I shall stay A pleasant journey to you my boy I will wait till you come back I would sooner take leave of life than take leave of my dear cozy Paris Will you not come to Italy to Naples and lead a pleasant life there a delicious luxurious life with this stout old fogey of yours who puffs and blows like a seal No Ungrateful girl Ungrateful she cried rising to her feet I might leave this house this moment and take nothing out of it but myself I shall have given you all the treasures a young girl can give and something that not every drop in your veins and mine can ever give me back If by any means whatever by selling my hopes of eternity for instance I could recover my past self body as soul for I have perhaps redeemed my soul and be pure as a lily for my lover I would not hesitate a moment What sort of devotion has rewarded mine You have housed and fed me just as you give a dog food and a kennel because he is a protection to the house and he may take kicks when we are out of humor and lick our hands as soon as we are pleased to call to him And which of us two will have been the more generous Oh dear child do you not see that I am joking returned Castanier I am going on a short journey I shall not be away for very long But come with me to the Gymnase I shall start just before midnight after I have had time to say good by to you Poor pet so you are really going are you she said She put her arms round his neck and drew down his head against her bodice You are smothering me cried Castanier with his face buried in Aquilina s breast That damsel turned to say in Jenny s ear Go to Leon and tell him not to come till one o clock If you do not find him and he comes here during the leave taking keep him in your room Well she went on setting free Castanier and giving a tweak to the tip of his nose never mind handsomest of seals that you are I will go to the theater with you this evening But all in good time let us have dinner There is a nice little dinner for you just what you like It is very hard to part from such a woman as you exclaimed Castanier Very well then why do you go asked she Ah why why If I were to begin to explain the reasons why I must tell you things that would prove to you that I love you almost to madness Ah if you have sacrificed your honor for me I have sold mine for you we are quits Is that love What is all this about said she Come now promise me that if I had a lover you would still love me as a father that would be love Come now promise it at once and give us your fist upon it I should kill you and Castanier smiled as he spoke They sat down to the dinner table and went thence to the Gymnase When the first part of the performance was over it occurred to Castanier to show himself to some of his acquaintances in the house so as to turn away any suspicion of his departure He left Mme de la Garde in the corner box where she was seated according to her modest wont and went to walk up and down in the lobby He had not gone many paces before he saw the Englishman and with a sudden return of the sickening sensation of heat that once before had vibrated through him and of the terror that he had felt already he stood face to face with Melmoth Forger At the word Castanier glanced round at the people who were moving about them He fancied that he could see astonishment and curiosity in their eyes and wishing to be rid of this Englishman at once he raised his hand to strike him and felt his arm paralyzed by some invisible power that sapped his strength and nailed him to the spot He allowed the stranger to take him by the arm and they walked together to the greenroom like two friends Who is strong enough to resist me said the Englishman addressing him Do you not know that everything here on earth must obey me that it is in my power to do everything I read men s thoughts I see the future and I know the past I am here and I can be elsewhere also Time and space and distance are nothing to me The whole world is at my beck and call I have the power of continual enjoyment and of giving joy I can see through walls discover hidden treasures and fill my hands with them Palaces arise at my nod and my architect makes no mistakes I can make all lands break forth into blossom heap up their gold and precious stones and surround myself with fair women and ever new faces everything is yielded up to my will I could gamble on the Stock Exchange and my speculations would be infallible but a man who can find the hoards that misers have hidden in the earth need not trouble himself about stocks Feel the strength of the hand that grasps you poor wretch doomed to shame Try to bend the arm of iron try to soften the adamantine heart Fly from me if you dare You would hear my voice in the depths of the caves that lie under the Seine you might hide in the Catacombs but would you not see me there My voice could be heard through the sound of the thunder my eyes shine as brightly as the sun for I am the peer of Lucifer Castanier heard the terrible words and felt no protest nor contradiction within himself He walked side by side with the Englishman and had no power to leave him You are mine you have just committed a crime I have found at last the mate whom I have sought Have you a mind to learn your destiny Aha you came here to see a play and you shall see a play nay two Come Present me to Mme de la Garde as one of your best friends Am I not your last hope of escape Castanier followed by the stranger returned to his box and in accordance with the order he had just received he hastened to introduce Melmoth to Mme de la Garde Aquilina seemed to be not in the least surprised The Englishman declined to take a seat in front and Castanier was once more beside his mistress the man s slightest wish must be obeyed The last piece was about to begin for at that time small theaters only gave three pieces One of the actors had made the Gymnase the fashion and that evening Perlet the actor in question was to play in a vaudeville called Le Comedien d Etampes in which he filled four different parts When the curtain rose the stranger stretched out his hand over the crowded house Castanier s cry of terror died away for the walls of his throat seemed glued together as Melmoth pointed to the stage and the cashier knew that the play had been changed at the Englishman s desire He saw the strong room at the bank he saw the Baron de Nucingen in conference with a police officer from the prefecture who was informing him of Castanier s conduct explaining that the cashier had absconded with money taken from the safe giving the history of the forged signature The information was put in writing the document signed and duly dispatched to the public prosecutor Are we in time do you think asked Nucingen Yes said the agent of police he is at the Gymnase and has no suspicion of anything Castanier fidgeted on his chair and made as if he would leave the theater but Melmoth s hand lay on his shoulder and he was obliged to sit and watch the hideous power of the man produced an effect like that of nightmare and he could not move a limb Nay the man himself was the nightmare his presence weighed heavily on his victim like a poisoned atmosphere When the wretched cashier turned to implore the Englishman s mercy he met those blazing eyes that discharged electric currents which pierced through him and transfixed him like darts of steel What have I done to you he said in his prostrate helplessness and he breathed hard like a stag at the water s edge What do you want of me Look cried Melmoth Castanier looked at the stage The scene had been changed The play seemed to be over and Castanier beheld himself stepping from the carriage with Aquilina but as he entered the courtyard of the house in the Rue Richer the scene again was suddenly changed and he saw his own house Jenny was chatting by the fire in her mistress s room with a subaltern officer of a line regiment then stationed at Paris He is going is he said the sergeant who seemed to belong to a family in easy circumstances I can be happy at my ease I love Aquilina too well to allow her to belong to that old toad I myself am going to marry Mme de la Garde cried the sergeant Old toad Castanier murmured piteously Here come the master and mistress hide yourself Stay get in here Monsieur Leon said Jenny The master won t stay here for very long Castanier watched the sergeant hide himself among Aquilina s gowns in her dressing room Almost immediately he himself appeared upon the scene and took leave of his mistress who made fun of him in asides to Jenny while she uttered the sweetest and tenderest words in his ears She wept with one side of her face and laughed with the other The audience called for an encore Accursed creature cried Castanier from his box Aquilina was laughing till the tears came into her eyes Goodness she cried how funny Perlet is as the Englishwoman Why don t you laugh Everyone else in the house is laughing Laugh dear she said to Castanier Melmoth burst out laughing and the unhappy cashier shuddered The Englishman s laughter wrung his heart and tortured his brain it was as if a surgeon had bored his skull with a red hot iron Laughing are they laughing stammered Castanier He did not see the prim English lady whom Perlet was acting with such ludicrous effect nor hear the English French that had filled the house with roars of laughter instead of all this he beheld himself hurrying from the Rue Richer hailing a cab on the Boulevard bargaining with the man to take him to Versailles Then once more the scene changed He recognized the sorry inn at the corner of the Rue de l Orangerie and the Rue des Recollets which was kept by his old quartermaster It was two o clock in the morning the most perfect stillness prevailed no one was there to watch his movements The post horses were put into the carriage it came from a house in the Avenue de Paris in which an Englishman lived and had been ordered in the foreigner s name to avoid raising suspicion Castanier saw that he had his bills and his passports stepped into the carriage and set out But at the barrier he saw two gendarmes lying in wait for the carriage A cry of horror burst from him but Melmoth gave him a glance and again the sound died in his throat Keep your eyes on the stage and be quiet said the Englishman In another moment Castanier saw himself flung into prison at the Conciergerie and in the fifth act of the drama entitled The Cashier he saw himself in three months time condemned to twenty years of penal servitude Again a cry broke from him He was exposed upon the Place du Palais de Justice and the executioner branded him with a red hot iron Then came the last scene of all among some sixty convicts in the prison yard of the Bicetre he was awaiting his turn to have the irons riveted on his limbs Dear me I cannot laugh any more said Aquilina You are very solemn dear boy what can be the matter The gentleman has gone A word with you Castanier said Melmoth when the piece was at an end and the attendant was fastening Mme de la Garde s cloak The corridor was crowded and escape impossible Very well what is it No human power can hinder you from taking Aquilina home and going next to Versailles there to be arrested How so Because you are in a hand that will never relax its grasp returned the Englishman Castanier longed for the power to utter some word that should blot him out from among living men and hide him in the lowest depths of hell Suppose that the devil were to make a bid for your soul would you not give it to him now in exchange for the power of God One single word and those five hundred thousand francs shall be back in the Baron de Nucingen s safe then you can tear up your letter of credit and all traces of your crime will be obliterated Moreover you would have gold in torrents You hardly believe in anything perhaps Well if all this comes to pass you will believe at least in the devil If it were only possible said Castanier joyfully The man who can do it all gives you his word that it is possible answered the Englishman Melmoth Castanier and Mme de la Garde were standing out in the Boulevard when Melmoth raised his arm A drizzling rain was falling the streets were muddy the air was close there was thick darkness overhead but in a moment as the arm was outstretched Paris was filled with sunlight it was high noon on a bright July day The trees were covered with leaves a double stream of joyous holiday makers strolled beneath them Sellers of licorice water shouted their cool drinks Splendid carriages rolled past along the streets A cry of terror broke from the cashier and at that cry rain and darkness once more settled down upon the Boulevard Mme de la Garde had stepped into the carriage Do be quick dear she cried either come in or stay out Really you are as dull as ditch water this evening What must I do Castanier asked of Melmoth Would you like to take my place inquired the Englishman Yes Very well then I will be at your house in a few moments By the bye Castanier you are rather off your balance Aquilina remarked There is some mischief brewing you were quite melancholy and thoughtful all through the play Do you want anything that I can give you dear Tell me I am waiting till we are at home to know whether you love me You need not wait till then she said throwing her arms round his neck There she said as she embraced him passionately to all appearance and plied him with the coaxing caresses that are part of the business of such a life as hers like stage action for an actress Where is the music asked Castanier What next Only think of your hearing music now Heavenly music he went on The sounds seem to come from above What You have always refused to give me a box at the Italiens because you could not abide music and are you turning music mad at this time of day Mad that you are The music is inside your own noddle old addle pate she went on as she took his head in her hands and rocked it to and fro on her shoulder Tell me now old man isn t it the creaking of the wheels that sings in your ears Just listen Naqui If the angels make music for God Almighty it must be such music as this that I am drinking in at every pore rather than hearing I do not know how to tell you about it it is as sweet as honey water Why of course they have music in heaven for the angels in all the pictures have harps in their hands He is mad upon my word she said to herself as she saw Castanier s attitude he looked like an opium eater in a blissful trance They reached the house Castanier absorbed by the thought of all that he had just heard and seen knew not whether to believe it or no he was like a drunken man and utterly unable to think connectedly He came to himself in Aquilina s room whither he had been supported by the united efforts of his mistress the porter and Jenny for he had fainted as he stepped from the carriage He will be here directly Oh my friends my friends he cried and he flung himself despairingly into the depths of a low chair beside the fire Jenny heard the bell as he spoke and admitted the Englishman She announced that a gentleman had come who had made an appointment with the master when Melmoth suddenly appeared and deep silence followed He looked at the porter the porter went he looked at Jenny and Jenny went likewise Madame said Melmoth turning to Aquilina with your permission we will conclude a piece of urgent business He took Castanier s hand and Castanier rose and the two men went into the drawing room There was no light in the room but Melmoth s eyes lit up the thickest darkness The gaze of those strange eyes had left Aquilina like one spellbound she was helpless unable to take any thought for her lover moreover she believed him to be safe in Jenny s room whereas their early return had taken the waiting woman by surprise and she had hidden the officer in the dressing room It had all happened exactly as in the drama that Melmoth had displayed for his victim Presently the house door was slammed violently and Castanier reappeared What ails you cried the horror struck Aquilina There was a change in the cashier s appearance A strange pallor overspread his once rubicund countenance it wore the peculiarly sinister and stony look of the mysterious visitor The sullen glare of his eyes was intolerable the fierce light in them seemed to scorch The man who had looked so good humored and good natured had suddenly grown tyrannical and proud The courtesan thought that Castanier had grown thinner there was a terrible majesty in his brow it was as if a dragon breathed forth a malignant influence that weighed upon the others like a close heavy atmosphere For a moment Aquilina knew not what to do What passed between you and that diabolical looking man in those few minutes she asked at length I have sold my soul to him I feel it I am no longer the same He has taken my self and given me his soul in exchange What You would not understand it at all Ah he was right Castanier went on the fiend was right I see everything and know all things You have been deceiving me Aquilina turned cold with terror Castanier lighted a candle and went into the dressing room The unhappy girl followed him in dazed bewilderment and great was her astonishment when Castanier drew the dresses that hung there aside and disclosed the sergeant Come out my boy said the cashier and taking Leon by a button of his overcoat he drew the officer into his room The Piedmontese haggard and desperate had flung herself into her easy chair Castanier seated himself on a sofa by the fire and left Aquilina s lover in a standing position You have been in the army said Leon I am ready to give you satisfaction You are a fool said Castanier dryly I have no occasion to fight I could kill you by a look if I had any mind to do it I will tell you what it is youngster why should I kill you I can see a red line round your neck the guillotine is waiting for you Yes you will end in the Place de Greve You are the headsman s property there is no escape for you You belong to a vendita of the Carbonari You are plotting against the Government You did not tell me that cried the Piedmontese turning to Leon So you do not know that the Minister decided this morning to put down your Society the cashier continued The Procureur General has a list of your names You have been betrayed They are busy drawing up the indictment at this moment Then was it you who betrayed him cried Aquilina and with a hoarse sound in her throat like the growl of a tigress she rose to her feet she seemed as if she would tear Castanier in pieces You know me too well to believe it Castanier retorted Aquilina was benumbed by his coolness Then how did you know it she murmured I did not know it until I went into the drawing room now I know it now I see and know all things and can do all things The sergeant was overcome with amazement Very well then save him save him dear cried the girl flinging herself at Castanier s feet If nothing is impossible to you save him I will love you I will adore you I will be your slave and not your mistress I will obey your wildest whims you shall do as you will with me Yes yes I will give you more than love you shall have a daughter s devotion as well as Rodolphe why will you not understand After all however violent my passions may be I shall be yours forever What should I say to persuade you I will invent pleasures I Great heavens one moment whatever you shall ask of me to fling myself from the window for instance you will need to say but one word Leon and I will plunge down into hell I would bear any torture any pain of body or soul anything you might inflict upon me Castanier heard her with indifference For all answer he indicated Leon to her with a fiendish laugh The guillotine is waiting for him he repeated No no no He shall not leave this house I will save him she cried Yes I will kill anyone who lays a finger upon him Why will you not save him she shrieked aloud her eyes were blazing her hair unbound Can you save him I can do everything Why do you not save him Why shouted Castanier and his voice made the ceiling ring Eh it is my revenge Doing evil is my trade Die said Aquilina must he die my lover Is it possible She sprang up and snatched a stiletto from a basket that stood on the chest of drawers and went to Castanier who began to laugh You know very well that steel cannot hurt me now Aquilina s arm suddenly dropped like a snapped harp string Out with you my good friend said the cashier turning to the sergeant and go about your business He held out his hand the other felt Castanier s superior power and could not choose but obey This house is mine I could send for the commissary of police if I chose and give you up as a man who has hidden himself on my premises but I would rather let you go I am a fiend I am not a spy I shall follow him said Aquilina Then follow him returned Castanier Here Jenny Jenny appeared Tell the porter to hail a cab for them Here Naqui said Castanier drawing a bundle of banknotes from his pocket you shall not go away like a pauper from a man who loves you still He held out three hundred thousand francs Aquilina took the notes flung them on the floor spat on them and trampled upon them in a frenzy of despair We will leave this house on foot she cried without a farthing of your money Jenny stay where you are Good evening answered the cashier as he gathered up the notes again I have come back from my journey Jenny he added looking at the bewildered waiting maid you seem to me to be a good sort of girl You have no mistress now Come here This evening you shall have a master Aquilina who felt safe nowhere went at once with the sergeant to the house of one of her friends But all Leon s movements were suspiciously watched by the police and after a time he and three of his friends were arrested The whole story may be found in the newspapers of that day Castanier felt that he had undergone a mental as well as a physical transformation The Castanier of old no longer existed the boy the young Lothario the soldier who had proved his courage who had been tricked into a marriage and disillusioned the cashier the passionate lover who had committed a crime for Aquilina s sake His inmost nature had suddenly asserted itself His brain had expanded his senses had developed His thoughts comprehended the whole world he saw all the things of earth as if he had been raised to some high pinnacle above the world Until that evening at the play he had loved Aquilina to distraction Rather than give her up he would have shut his eyes to her infidelities and now all that blind passion had passed away as a cloud vanishes in the sunlight Jenny was delighted to succeed to her mistress s position and fortune and did the cashier s will in all things but Castanier who could read the inmost thoughts of the soul discovered the real motive underlying this purely physical devotion He amused himself with her however like a mischievous child who greedily sucks the juice of the cherry and flings away the stone The next morning at breakfast time when she was fully convinced that she was a lady and the mistress of the house Castanier uttered one by one the thoughts that filled her mind as she drank her coffee Do you know what you are thinking child he said smiling I will tell you So all that lovely rosewood furniture that I coveted so much and the pretty dresses that I used to try on are mine now All on easy terms that madame refused I do not know why My word if I might drive about in a carriage have jewels and pretty things a box at the theater and put something by with me he should lead a life of pleasure fit to kill him if he were not as strong as a Turk I never saw such a man Was not that just what you were thinking he went on and something in his voice made Jenny turn pale Well yes child you could not stand it and I am sending you away for your own good you would perish in the attempt Come let us part good friends and he coolly dismissed her with a very small sum of money The first use that Castanier had promised himself that he would make of the terrible power bought at the price of his eternal happiness was the full and complete indulgence of all his tastes He first put his affairs in order readily settled his account with M de Nucingen who found a worthy German to succeed him and then determined on a carouse worthy of the palmiest days of the Roman Empire He plunged into dissipation as recklessly as Belshazzar of old went to that last feast in Babylon Like Belshazzar he saw clearly through his revels a gleaming hand that traced his doom in letters of flame not on the narrow walls of the banqueting chamber but over the vast spaces of heaven that the rainbow spans His feast was not indeed an orgy confined within the limits of a banquet for he squandered all the powers of soul and body in exhausting all the pleasures of earth The table was in some sort earth itself the earth that trembled beneath his feet He was the last festival of the reckless spendthrift who has thrown all prudence to the winds The devil had given him the key of the storehouse of human pleasures he had filled and refilled his hands and he was fast nearing the bottom In a moment he had felt all that that enormous power could accomplish in a moment he had exercised it proved it wearied of it What had hitherto been the sum of human desires became as nothing So often it happens that with possession the vast poetry of desire must end and the thing possessed is seldom the thing that we dreamed of Beneath Melmoth s omnipotence lurked this tragical anticlimax of so many a passion and now the inanity of human nature was revealed to his successor to whom infinite power brought Nothingness as a dowry To come to a clear understanding of Castanier s strange position it must be borne in mind how suddenly these revolutions of thought and feeling had been wrought how quickly they had succeeded each other and of these things it is hard to give any idea to those who have never broken the prison bonds of time and space and distance His relation to the world without had been entirely changed with the expansion of his faculties Like Melmoth himself Castanier could travel in a few moments over the fertile plains of India could soar on the wings of demons above African desert spaces or skim the surface of the seas The same insight that could read the inmost thoughts of others could apprehend at a glance the nature of any material object just as he caught as it were all flavors at once upon his tongue He took his pleasure like a despot a blow of the ax felled the tree that he might eat its fruits The transitions the alternations that measure joy and pain and diversify human happiness no longer existed for him He had so completely glutted his appetites that pleasure must overpass the limits of pleasure to tickle a palate cloyed with satiety and suddenly grown fastidious beyond all measure so that ordinary pleasures became distasteful Conscious that at will he was the master of all the women that he could desire knowing that his power was irresistible he did not care to exercise it they were pliant to his unexpressed wishes to his most extravagant caprices until he felt a horrible thirst for love and would have love beyond their power to give The world refused him nothing save faith and prayer the soothing and consoling love that is not of this world He was obeyed it was a horrible position The torrents of pain and pleasure and thought that shook his soul and his bodily frame would have overwhelmed the strongest human being but in him there was a power of vitality proportioned to the power of the sensations that assailed him He felt within him a vague immensity of longing that earth could not satisfy He spent his days on outspread wings longing to traverse the luminous fields of space to other spheres that he knew afar by intuitive perception a clear and hopeless knowledge His soul dried up within him for he hungered and thirsted after things that can neither be drunk nor eaten but for which he could not choose but crave His lips like Melmoth s burned with desire he panted for the unknown for he knew all things The mechanism and the scheme of the world was apparent to him and its working interested him no longer he did not long disguise the profound scorn that makes of a man of extraordinary powers a sphinx who knows everything and says nothing and sees all things with an unmoved countenance He felt not the slightest wish to communicate his knowledge to other men He was rich with all the wealth of the world with one effort he could make the circle of the globe and riches and power were meaningless for him He felt the awful melancholy of omnipotence a melancholy which Satan and God relieve by the exercise of infinite power in mysterious ways known to them alone Castanier had not like his Master the inextinguishable energy of hate and malice he felt that he was a devil but a devil whose time was not yet come while Satan is a devil through all eternity and being damned beyond redemption delights to stir up the world like a dungheap with his triple fork and to thwart therein the designs of God But Castanier for his misfortune had one hope left If in a moment he could move from one pole to the other as a bird springs restlessly from side to side in its cage when like the bird he had crossed his prison he saw the vast immensity of space beyond it That vision of the Infinite left him forever unable to see humanity and its affairs as other men saw them The insensate fools who long for the power of the Devil gauge its desirability from a human standpoint they do not see that with the Devil s power they will likewise assume his thoughts and that they will be doomed to remain as men among creatures who will no longer understand them The Nero unknown to history who dreams of setting Paris on fire for his private entertainment like an exhibition of a burning house on the boards of a theater does not suspect that if he had that power Paris would become for him as little interesting as an ant heap by the roadside to a hurrying passer by The circle of the sciences was for Castanier something like a logogriph for a man who does not know the key to it Kings and Governments were despicable in his eyes His great debauch had been in some sort a deplorable farewell to his life as a man The earth had grown too narrow for him for the infernal gifts laid bare for him the secrets of creation he saw the cause and foresaw its end He was shut out from all that men call heaven in all languages under the sun he could no longer think of heaven Then he came to understand the look on his predecessor s face and the drying up of the life within then he knew all that was meant by the baffled hope that gleamed in Melmoth s eyes he too knew the thirst that burned those red lips and the agony of a continual struggle between two natures grown to giant size Even yet he might be an angel and he knew himself to be a fiend His was the fate of a sweet and gentle creature that a wizard s malice has imprisoned in a misshapen form entrapping it by a pact so that another s will must set it free from its detested envelope As a deception only increases the ardor with which a man of really great nature explores the infinite of sentiment in a woman s heart so Castanier awoke to find that one idea lay like a weight upon his soul an idea which was perhaps the key to loftier spheres The very fact that he had bartered away his eternal happiness led him to dwell in thought upon the future of those who pray and believe On the morrow of his debauch when he entered into the sober possession of his power this idea made him feel himself a prisoner he knew the burden of the woe that poets and prophets and great oracles of faith have set forth for us in such mighty words he felt the point of the Flaming Sword plunged into his side and hurried in search of Melmoth What had become of his predecessor The Englishman was living in a mansion in the Rue Ferou near Saint Sulpice a gloomy dark damp and cold abode The Rue Ferou itself is one of the most dismal streets in Paris it has a north aspect like all the streets that lie at right angles to the left bank of the Seine and the houses are in keeping with the site As Castanier stood on the threshold he found that the door itself like the vaulted roof was hung with black rows of lighted tapers shone brilliantly as though some king were lying in state and a priest stood on either side of a catafalque that had been raised there There is no need to ask why you have come sir the old hall porter said to Castanier you are so like our poor dear master that is gone But if you are his brother you have come too late to bid him good by The good gentleman died the night before last How did he die Castanier asked of one of the priests Set your mind at rest said an old priest he partly raised as he spoke the black pall that covered the catafalque Castanier looking at him saw one of those faces that faith has made sublime the soul seemed to shine forth from every line of it bringing light and warmth for other men kindled by the unfailing charity within This was Sir John Melmoth s confessor Your brother made an end that men may envy and that must rejoice the angels Do you know what joy there is in heaven over a sinner that repents His tears of penitence excited by grace flowed without ceasing death alone checked them The Holy Spirit dwelt in him His burning words full of lively faith were worthy of the Prophet King If in the course of my life I have never heard a more dreadful confession than from the lips of this Irish gentleman I have likewise never heard such fervent and passionate prayers However great the measures of his sins may have been his repentance has filled the abyss to overflowing The hand of God was visibly stretched out above him for he was completely changed there was such heavenly beauty in his face The hard eyes were softened by tears the resonant voice that struck terror into those who heard it took the tender and compassionate tones of those who themselves have passed through deep humiliation He so edified those who heard his words that some who had felt drawn to see the spectacle of a Christian s death fell on their knees as he spoke of heavenly things and of the infinite glory of God and gave thanks and praise to Him If he is leaving no worldly wealth to his family no family can possess a greater blessing than this that he surely gained for them a soul among the blessed who will watch over you all and direct you in the path to heaven These words made such a vivid impression upon Castanier that he instantly hurried from the house to the Church of Saint Sulpice obeying what might be called a decree of fate Melmoth s repentance had stupefied him At that time on certain mornings in the week a preacher famed for his eloquence was wont to hold conferences in the course of which he demonstrated the truths of the Catholic faith for the youth of a generation proclaimed to be indifferent in matters of belief by another voice no less eloquent than his own The conference had been put off to a later hour on account of Melmoth s funeral so Castanier arrived just as the great preacher was epitomizing the proofs of a future existence of happiness with all the charm of eloquence and force of expression which have made him famous The seeds of divine doctrine fell into a soil prepared for them in the old dragoon into whom the Devil had glided Indeed if there is a phenomenon well attested by experience is it not the spiritual phenomenon commonly called the faith of the peasant The strength of belief varies inversely with the amount of use that a man has made of his reasoning faculties Simple people and soldiers belong to the unreasoning class Those who have marched through life beneath the banner of instinct are far more ready to receive the light than minds and hearts overwearied with the world s sophistries Castanier had the southern temperament he had joined the army as a lad of sixteen and had followed the French flag till he was nearly forty years old As a common trooper he had fought day and night and day after day and as in duty bound had thought of his horse first and of himself afterwards While he served his military apprenticeship therefore he had but little leisure in which to reflect on the destiny of man and when he became an officer he had his men to think of He had been swept from battlefield to battlefield but he had never thought of what comes after death A soldier s life does not demand much thinking Those who cannot understand the lofty political ends involved and the interests of nation and nation who cannot grasp political schemes as well as plans of campaign and combine the science of the tactician with that of the administrator are bound to live in a state of ignorance the most boorish peasant in the most backward district in France is scarcely in a worse case Such men as these bear the brunt of war yield passive obedience to the brain that directs them and strike down the men opposed to them as the woodcutter fells timber in the forest Violent physical exertion is succeeded by times of inertia when they repair the waste They fight and drink fight and eat fight and sleep that they may the better deal hard blows the powers of the mind are not greatly exercised in this turbulent round of existence and the character is as simple as heretofore When the men who have shown such energy on the battlefield return to ordinary civilization most of those who have not risen to high rank seem to have acquired no ideas and to have no aptitude no capacity for grasping new ideas To the utter amazement of a younger generation those who made our armies so glorious and so terrible are as simple as children and as slow witted as a clerk at his worst and the captain of a thundering squadron is scarcely fit to keep a merchant s day book Old soldiers of this stamp therefore being innocent of any attempt to use their reasoning faculties act upon their strongest impulses Castanier s crime was one of those matters that raise so many questions that in order to debate about it a moralist might call for its discussion by clauses to make use of a parliamentary expression Passion had counseled the crime the cruelly irresistible power of feminine witchery had driven him to commit it no man can say of himself I will never do that when a siren joins in the combat and throws her spells over him So the word of life fell upon a conscience newly awakened to the truths of religion which the French Revolution and a soldier s career had forced Castanier to neglect The solemn words You will be happy or miserable for all eternity made but the more terrible impression upon him because he had exhausted earth and shaken it like a barren tree because his desires could effect all things so that it was enough that any spot in earth or heaven should be forbidden him and he forthwith thought of nothing else If it were allowable to compare such great things with social follies Castanier s position was not unlike that of a banker who finding that his all powerful millions cannot obtain for him an entrance into the society of the noblesse must set his heart upon entering that circle and all the social privileges that he has already acquired are as nothing in his eyes from the moment when he discovers that a single one is lacking Here was a man more powerful than all the kings on earth put together a man who like Satan could wrestle with God Himself leaning against one of the pillars in the Church of Saint Sulpice weighed down by the feelings and thoughts that oppressed him and absorbed in the thought of a Future the same thought that had engulfed Melmoth He was very happy was Melmoth cried Castanier He died in the certain knowledge that he would go to heaven In a moment the greatest possible change had been wrought in the cashier s ideas For several days he had been a devil now he was nothing but a man an image of the fallen Adam of the sacred tradition embodied in all cosmogonies But while he had thus shrunk to manhood he retained a germ of greatness he had been steeped in the Infinite The power of hell had revealed the divine power He thirsted for heaven as he had never thirsted after the pleasures of earth that are so soon exhausted The enjoyments which the fiend promises are but the enjoyments of earth on a larger scale but to the joys of heaven there is no limit He believed in God and the spell that gave him the treasures of the world was as nothing to him now the treasures themselves seemed to him as contemptible as pebbles to an admirer of diamonds they were but gewgaws compared with the eternal glories of the other life A curse lay he thought on all things that came to him from this source He sounded dark depths of painful thought as he listened to the service performed for Melmoth The Dies irae filled him with awe he felt all the grandeur of that cry of a repentant soul trembling before the Throne of God The Holy Spirit like a devouring flame passed through him as fire consumes straw The tears were falling from his eyes when Are you a relation of the dead the beadle asked him I am his heir Castanier answered Give something for the expenses of the services cried the man No said the cashier The Devil s money should not go to the Church For the poor No For repairing the Church No The Lady Chapel No For the schools No Castanier went not caring to expose himself to the sour looks that the irritated functionaries gave him Outside in the street he looked up at the Church of Saint Sulpice What made people build the giant cathedrals I have seen in every country he asked himself The feeling shared so widely throughout all time must surely be based upon something Something Do you call God something cried his conscience God God God The word was echoed and reechoed by an inner voice till it overwhelmed him but his feeling of terror subsided as he heard sweet distant sounds of music that he had caught faintly before They were singing in the church he thought and his eyes scanned the great doorway But as he listened more closely the sounds poured upon him from all sides he looked round the square but there was no sign of any musicians The melody brought visions of a distant heaven and far off gleams of hope but it also quickened the remorse that had set the lost soul in a ferment He went on his way through Paris walking as men walk who are crushed beneath the burden of their sorrow seeing everything with unseeing eyes loitering like an idler stopping without cause muttering to himself careless of the traffic making no effort to avoid a blow from a plank of timber Imperceptibly repentance brought him under the influence of the divine grace that soothes while it bruises the heart so terribly His face came to wear a look of Melmoth something great with a trace of madness in the greatness A look of dull and hopeless distress mingled with the excited eagerness of hope and beneath it all a gnawing sense of loathing for all that the world can give The humblest of prayers lurked in the eyes that saw with such dreadful clearness His power was the measure of his anguish His body was bowed down by the fearful storm that shook his soul as the tall pines bend before the blast Like his predecessor he could not refuse to bear the burden of life he was afraid to die while he bore the yoke of hell The torment grew intolerable At last one morning he bethought himself how that Melmoth now among the blessed had made the proposal of an exchange and how that he had accepted it others doubtless would follow his example for in an age proclaimed by the inheritors of the eloquence of the Fathers of the Church to be fatally indifferent to religion it should be easy to find a man who would accept the conditions of the contract in order to prove its advantages There is one place where you can learn what kings will fetch in the market where nations are weighed in the balance and systems appraised where the value of a government is stated in terms of the five franc piece where ideas and beliefs have their price and everything is discounted where God Himself in a manner borrows on the security of His revenue of souls for the Pope has a running account there Is it not there that I should go to traffic in souls Castanier went quite joyously on Change thinking that it would be as easy to buy a soul as to invest money in the Funds Any ordinary person would have feared ridicule but Castanier knew by experience that a desperate man takes everything seriously A prisoner lying under sentence of death would listen to the madman who should tell him that by pronouncing some gibberish he could escape through the keyhole for suffering is credulous and clings to an idea until it fails as the swimmer borne along by the current clings to the branch that snaps in his hand Toward four o clock that afternoon Castanier appeared among the little knots of men who were transacting private business after Change He was personally known to some of the brokers and while affecting to be in search of an acquaintance he managed to pick up the current gossip and rumors of failure Catch me negotiating bills for Claparon company my boy The bank collector went round to return their acceptances to them this morning said a fat banker in his outspoken way If you have any of their paper look out Claparon was in the building in deep consultation with a man well known for the ruinous rate at which he lent money Castanier went forthwith in search of the said Claparon a merchant who had a reputation for taking heavy risks that meant wealth or utter ruin The money lender walked away as Castanier came up A gesture betrayed the speculator s despair Well Claparon the bank wants a hundred thousand francs of you and it is four o clock the thing is known and it is too late to arrange your little failure comfortably said Castanier Sir Speak lower the cashier went on How if I were to propose a piece of business that would bring you in as much money as you require It would not discharge my liabilities every business that I ever heard of wants a little time to simmer in I know of something that will set you straight in a moment answered Castanier but first you would have to Do what Sell your share of Paradise It is a matter of business like anything else isn t it We all hold shares in the great Speculation of Eternity I tell you this said Claparon angrily that I am just the man to lend you a slap in the face When a man is in trouble it is no time to play silly jokes on him I am talking seriously said Castanier and he drew a bundle of notes from his pocket In the first place said Claparon I am not going to sell my soul to the Devil for a trifle I want five hundred thousand francs before I strike Who talks of stinting you asked Castanier cutting him short You should have more gold than you could stow in the cellars of the Bank of France He held out a handful of notes That decided Claparon Done he cried but how is the bargain to be made Let us go over yonder no one is standing there said Castanier pointing to a corner of the court Claparon and his tempter exchanged a few words with their faces turned to the wall None of the onlookers guessed the nature of this by play though their curiosity was keenly excited by the strange gestures of the two contracting parties When Castanier returned there was a sudden outburst of amazed exclamation As in the Assembly where the least event immediately attracts attention all faces were turned to the two men who had caused the sensation and a shiver passed through all beholders at the change that had taken place in them The men who form the moving crowd that fills the Stock Exchange are soon known to each other by sight They watch each other like players round a card table Some shrewd observers can tell how a man will play and the condition of his exchequer from a survey of his face and the Stock Exchange is simply a vast card table Everyone therefore had noticed Claparon and Castanier The latter like the Irishman before him one had been muscular and powerful his eyes were full of light his color high The dignity and power in his face had struck awe into them all they wondered how old Castanier had come by it and now they beheld Castanier divested of his power shrunken wrinkled aged and feeble He had drawn Claparon out of the crowd with the energy of a sick man in a fever fit he had looked like an opium eater during the brief period of excitement that the drug can give now on his return he seemed to be in the condition of utter exhaustion in which the patient dies after the fever departs or to be suffering from the horrible prostration that follows on excessive indulgence in the delights of narcotics The infernal power that had upheld him through his debauches had left him and the body was left unaided and alone to endure the agony of remorse and the heavy burden of sincere repentance Claparon s troubles everyone could guess but Claparon reappeared on the other hand with sparkling eyes holding his head high with the pride of Lucifer The crisis had passed from the one man to the other one Referring to John Melmoth see note at head of this story EDITOR Now you can drop off with an easy mind old man said Claparon to Castanier For pity s sake send for a cab and for a priest send for the curate of Saint Sulpice answered the old dragoon sinking down upon the curbstone The words a priest reached the ears of several people and produced uproarious jeering among the stockbrokers for faith with these gentlemen means a belief that a scrap of paper called a mortgage represents an estate and the List of Fundholders is their Bible Shall I have time to repent said Castanier to himself in a piteous voice that impressed Claparon A cab carried away the dying man the speculator went to the bank at once to meet his bills and the momentary sensation produced upon the throng of business men by the sudden change on the two faces vanished like the furrow cut by a ship s keel in the sea News of the greatest importance kept the attention of the world of commerce on the alert and when commercial interests are at stake Moses might appear with his two luminous horns and his coming would scarcely receive the honors of a pun the gentlemen whose business it is to write the Market Reports would ignore his existence When Claparon had made his payments fear seized upon him There was no mistake about his power He went on Change again and offered his bargain to other men in embarrassed circumstances The Devil s bond together with the rights easements and privileges appertaining thereunto to use the expression of the notary who succeeded Claparon changed hands for the sum of seven hundred thousand francs The notary in his turn parted with the agreement with the Devil for five hundred thousand francs to a building contractor in difficulties who likewise was rid of it to an iron merchant in consideration of a hundred thousand crowns In fact by five o clock people had ceased to believe in the strange contract and purchasers were lacking for want of confidence At half past five the holder of the bond was a house painter who was lounging by the door of the building in the Rue Feydeau where at that time stockbrokers temporarily congregated The house painter simple fellow could not think what was the matter with him He felt all anyhow so he told his wife when he went home The Rue Feydeau as idlers about town are aware is a place of pilgrimage for youths who for lack of a mistress bestow their ardent affection upon the whole sex On the first floor of the most rigidly respectable domicile therein dwelt one of those exquisite creatures whom it has pleased heaven to endow with the rarest and most surpassing beauty As it is impossible that they should all be duchesses or queens since there are many more pretty women in the world than titles and thrones for them to adorn they are content to make a stockbroker or a banker happy at a fixed price To this good natured beauty Euphrasia by name an unbounded ambition had led a notary s clerk to aspire In short the second clerk in the office of Maitre Crottat notary had fallen in love with her as youth at two and twenty can fall in love The scrivener would have murdered the Pope and run amuck through the whole sacred college to procure the miserable sum of a hundred louis to pay for a shawl which had turned Euphrasia s head at which price her waiting woman had promised that Euphrasia should be his The infatuated youth walked to and fro under Madame Euphrasia s windows like the polar bears in their cage at the Jardin des Plantes with his right hand thrust beneath his waistcoat in the region of the heart which he was fit to tear from his bosom but as yet he had only wrenched at the elastic of his braces What can one do to raise ten thousand francs he asked himself Shall I make off with the money that I must pay on the registration of that conveyance Good heavens my loan would not ruin the purchaser a man with seven millions And then next day I would fling myself at his feet and say I have taken ten thousand francs belonging to you sir I am twenty two years of age and I am in love with Euphrasia that is my story My father is rich he will pay you back do not ruin me Have not you yourself been twenty two years old and madly in love But these beggarly landowners have no souls He would be quite likely to give me up to the public prosecutor instead of taking pity upon me Good God if it were only possible to sell your soul to the Devil But there is neither a God nor a Devil it is all nonsense out of nursery tales and old wives talk What shall I do If you have a mind to sell your soul to the Devil sir said the house painter who had overheard something that the clerk let fall you can have the ten thousand francs And Euphrasia cried the clerk as he struck a bargain with the devil that inhabited the house painter The pact concluded the frantic clerk went to find the shawl and mounted Madame Euphrasia s staircase and as literally the devil was in him he did not come down for twelve days drowning the thought of hell and of his privileges in twelve days of love and riot and forgetfulness for which he had bartered away all his hopes of a paradise to come And in this way the secret of the vast power discovered and acquired by the Irishman the offspring of Maturin s brain was lost to mankind and the various Orientalists Mystics and Archaeologists who take an interest in these matters were unable to hand down to posterity the proper method of invoking the Devil for the following sufficient reasons On the thirteenth day after these frenzied nuptials the wretched clerk lay on a pallet bed in a garret in his master s house in the Rue Saint Honore Shame the stupid goddess who dares not behold herself had taken possession of the young man He had fallen ill he would nurse himself misjudged the quantity of a remedy devised by the skill of a practitioner well known on the walls of Paris and succumbed to the effects of an overdose of mercury His corpse was as black as a mole s back A devil had left unmistakable traces of its passage there could it have been Ashtaroth The estimable youth to whom you refer has been carried away to the planet Mercury said the head clerk to a German demonologist who came to investigate the matter at first hand I am quite prepared to believe it answered the Teuton Oh Yes sir returned the other The opinion you advance coincides with the very words of Jacob Boehme In the forty eighth proposition of The Threefold Life of Man he says that if God hath brought all things to pass with a LET THERE BE the FIAT is the secret matrix which comprehends and apprehends the nature which is formed by the spirit born of Mercury and of God What do you say sir The German delivered his quotation afresh We do not know it said the clerks Fiat said a clerk Fiat lux You can verify the citation for yourselves said the German You will find the passage in the Treatise of the Threefold Life of Man page seventy five the edition was published by M Migneret in eighteen oh nine It was translated into French by a philosopher who had a great admiration for the famous shoemaker Oh he was a shoemaker was he said the head clerk In Prussia said the German Did he work for the King of Prussia inquired a Boeotian of a second clerk He must have vamped up his prose said a third That man is colossal cried the fourth pointing to the Teuton That gentleman though a demonologist of the first rank did not know the amount of devilry to be found in a notary s clerk He went away without the least idea that they were making game of him and fully under the impression that the young fellows regarded Boehme as a colossal genius Education is making strides in France said he to himself The Conscript The inner self by a phenomenon of vision or of locomotion has been known at times to abolish Space in its two modes of Time and Distance the one intellectual the other physical HISTORY OF LOUIS LAMBERT On a November evening in the year seventeen ninety three the principal citizens of Carentan were assembled in Mme de Dey s drawing room Mme de Dey held this reception every night of the week but an unwonted interest attached to this evening s gathering owing to certain circumstances which would have passed altogether unnoticed in a great city though in a small country town they excited the greatest curiosity For two days before Mme de Dey had not been at home to her visitors and on the previous evening her door had been shut on the ground of indisposition Two such events at any ordinary time would have produced in Carentan the same sensation that Paris knows on nights when there is no performance at the theaters existence is in some sort incomplete but in those times when the least indiscretion on the part of an aristocrat might be a matter of life and death this conduct of Mme de Dey s was likely to bring about the most disastrous consequences for her 
3851_9210_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Her position in Carentan ought to be made clear if the reader is to appreciate the expression of keen curiosity and cunning fanaticism on the countenances of these Norman citizens and what is of most importance the part that the lady played among them 
3851_9210_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Many a one during the days of the Revolution has doubtless passed through a crisis as difficult as hers at that moment and the sympathies of more than one reader will fill in all the coloring of the picture 
none	none	Mme de Dey was the widow of a Lieutenant General a Knight of the Orders of Saint Michael and of the Holy Ghost She had left the Court when the Emigration began and taken refuge in the neighborhood of Carentan where she had large estates hoping that the influence of the Reign of Terror would be but little felt there 
3851_9210_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Her calculations based on a thorough knowledge of the district proved correct 
3851_9210_000011_000003	train-clean-360	The Revolution made little disturbance in Lower Normandy 
none	none	Formerly when Mme de Dey had spent any time in the country her circle of acquaintance had been confined to the noble families of the district but now from politic motives she opened her house to the principal citizens and to the Revolutionary authorities of the town endeavoring to touch and gratify their social pride without arousing either hatred or jealousy Gracious and kindly possessed of the indescribable charm that wins good will without loss of dignity or effort to pay court to any she had succeeded in gaining universal esteem the discreet warnings of exquisite tact enabled her to steer a difficult course among the exacting claims of this mixed society without wounding the overweening self love of parvenus on the one hand or the susceptibilities of her old friends on the other 
3851_9210_000012_000000	train-clean-360	She was about thirty eight years of age and still preserved not the fresh high colored beauty of the Basse Normandes but a fragile loveliness of what may be called an aristocratic type 
3851_9210_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Her figure was lissome and slender her features delicate and clearly cut the pale face seemed to light up and live when she spoke but there was a quiet and devout look in the great dark eyes for all their graciousness of expression a look that seemed to say that the springs of her life lay without her own existence 
3851_9210_000013_000000	train-clean-360	In her early girlhood she had been married to an elderly and jealous soldier 
none	none	Her false position in the midst of a gay Court had doubtless done something to bring a veil of sadness over a face that must once have been bright with the charms of quick pulsed life and love 
3851_9210_000013_000002	train-clean-360	She had been compelled to set constant restraint upon her frank impulses and emotions at an age when a woman feels rather than thinks and the depths of passion in her heart had never been stirred 
3851_9210_000013_000003	train-clean-360	In this lay the secret of her greatest charm a youthfulness of the inmost soul betrayed at times by her face and a certain tinge of innocent wistfulness in her ideas 
3851_9210_000013_000004	train-clean-360	She was reserved in her demeanor but in her bearing and in the tones of her voice there was still something that told of girlish longings directed toward a vague future

3851_9210_000013_000006	train-clean-360	Her great soul strengthened by the cruel ordeals through which she had passed seemed to set her too far above the ordinary level and these men weighed themselves and instinctively felt that they were found wanting 
3851_9210_000013_000007	train-clean-360	Such a nature demanded an exalted passion 
none	none	Moreover Mme de Dey s affections were concentrated in one sentiment a mother s love for her son 
3851_9210_000014_000001	train-clean-360	All the happiness and joy that she had not known as a wife she had found later in her boundless love for him 
none	none	The coquetry of a mistress the jealousy of a wife mingled with the pure and deep affection of a mother 
3851_9210_000014_000003	train-clean-360	She was miserable when they were apart and nervous about him while he was away she could never see enough of him and lived through and for him alone 
none	none	Some idea of the strength of this tie may be conveyed to the masculine understanding by adding that this was not only Mme de Dey s only son but all she had of kith or kin in the world the one human being on earth bound to her by all the fears and hopes and joys of her life 
3851_9210_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The late Comte de Dey was the last of his race and she his wife was the sole heiress and descendant of her house 
3851_9210_000015_000001	train-clean-360	So worldly ambitions and family considerations as well as the noblest cravings of the soul combined to heighten in the Countess a sentiment that is strong in every woman s heart 
3851_9210_000015_000002	train-clean-360	The child was all the dearer because only with infinite care had she succeeded in rearing him to man s estate medical science had predicted his death a score of times but she had held fast to her presentiments and her hopes and had known the inexpressible joy of watching him pass safely through the perils of infancy of seeing his constitution strengthen in spite of the decrees of the Faculty 
3851_9210_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Thanks to her constant care the boy had grown up and developed so favorably that at twenty years of age he was regarded as one of the most accomplished gentlemen at the Court of Versailles 
3851_9210_000016_000001	train-clean-360	One final happiness that does not always crown a mother s efforts was hers her son worshiped her and between these two there was the deep sympathy of kindred souls 
3851_9210_000016_000002	train-clean-360	If they had not been bound to each other already by a natural and sacred tie they would instinctively have felt for each other a friendship that is rarely met with between two men 
none	none	At the age of eighteen the young Count had received an appointment as sub lieutenant in a regiment of dragoons and had made it a point of honor to follow the emigrant Princes into exile Then Mme de Dey faced the dangers of her cruel position 
3851_9210_000018_000001	train-clean-360	She was rich noble and the mother of an Emigrant 
3851_9210_000018_000002	train-clean-360	With the one desire to look after her son s great fortune she had denied herself the happiness of being with him and when she read the rigorous laws in virtue of which the Republic was daily confiscating the property of Emigrants at Carentan she congratulated herself on the courageous course that she had taken Was she not keeping watch over the wealth of her son at the risk of her life 
3851_9210_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Later when news came of the horrible executions ordered by the Convention she slept happy in the knowledge that her own treasure was in safety out of reach of peril far from the scaffolds of the Revolution 
none	none	She loved to think that she had followed the best course that she had saved her darling and her darling s fortunes and to this secret thought she made such concessions as the misfortunes of the times demanded without compromising her dignity or her aristocratic tenets and enveloped her sorrows in reserve and mystery 
3851_9210_000018_000005	train-clean-360	She had foreseen the difficulties that would beset her at Carentan 
3851_9210_000018_000006	train-clean-360	Did she not tempt the scaffold by the very fact of going thither to take a prominent place 
3851_9210_000018_000007	train-clean-360	Yet sustained by a mother s courage she succeeded in winning the affection of the poor ministering without distinction to everyone in trouble and made herself necessary to the well to do by providing amusements for them 
none	none	The procureur of the commune might be seen at her house the mayor the president of the district and the public prosecutor and even the judges of the Revolutionary tribunals went there The four first named gentlemen were none of them married and each paid court to her in the hope that Mme de Dey would take him for her husband either from fear of making an enemy or from a desire to find a protector The public prosecutor once an attorney at Caen and the Countess s man of business did what he could to inspire love by a system of devotion and generosity a dangerous game of cunning 
3851_9210_000020_000001	train-clean-360	He was the most formidable of all her suitors 
3851_9210_000020_000002	train-clean-360	He alone knew the amount of the large fortune of his sometime client and his fervor was inevitably increased by the cupidity of greed and by the consciousness that he wielded an enormous power the power of life and death in the district 
none	none	He was still a young man and owing to the generosity of his behavior Mme de Dey was unable as yet to estimate him truly 
3851_9210_000020_000004	train-clean-360	But in despite of the danger of matching herself against Norman cunning she used all the craft and inventiveness that Nature has bestowed on women to play off the rival suitors one against another 
3851_9210_000020_000005	train-clean-360	She hoped by gaining time to emerge safe and sound from her difficulties at last for at that time Royalists in the provinces flattered themselves with a hope daily renewed that the morrow would see the end of the Revolution a conviction that proved fatal to many of them 
3851_9210_000021_000000	train-clean-360	In spite of difficulties the Countess had maintained her independence with considerable skill until the day when by an inexplicable want of prudence she took occasion to close her salon 
none	none	So deep and sincere was the interest that she inspired that those who usually filled her drawing room felt a lively anxiety when the news was spread then with the frank curiosity characteristic of provincial manners they went to inquire into the misfortune grief or illness that had befallen Mme de Dey 
3851_9210_000022_000000	train-clean-360	To all these questions Brigitte the housekeeper answered with the same formula her mistress was keeping her room and would see no one not even her own servants 
none	none	The almost claustral lives of dwellers in small towns fosters a habit of analysis and conjectural explanation of the business of everybody else so strong is it that when everyone had exclaimed over poor Mme de Dey without knowing whether the lady was overcome by joy or sorrow each one began to inquire into the causes of her sudden seclusion
3851_9210_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 If she were ill she would have sent for the doctor said gossip number one now the doctor has been playing chess in my house all day He said to me laughing that in these days there is only one disease and that unluckily it is incurable 
3851_9210_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The joke was hazarded discreetly 
3851_9210_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Women and men elderly folk and young girls forthwith betook themselves to the vast fields of conjecture Everyone imagined that there was some secret in it and every head was busy with the secret 
3851_9210_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Next day the suspicions became malignant Everyone lives in public in a small town and the women kind were the first to find out that Brigitte had laid in an extra stock of provisions 
3851_9210_000024_000003	train-clean-360	The thing could not be disputed 
3851_9210_000024_000004	train-clean-360	Brigitte had been seen in the market place betimes that morning and wonderful to relate she had bought the one hare to be had 
none	none	The whole town knew that Mme de Dey did not care for game The hare became a starting point for endless conjectures 
3851_9210_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Elderly gentlemen taking their constitutional noticed a sort of suppressed bustle in the Countess s house the symptoms were the more apparent because the servants were at evident pains to conceal them The man servant was beating a carpet in the garden 
3851_9210_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Only yesterday no one would have remarked the fact but to day everybody began to build romances upon that harmless piece of household stuff 
3851_9210_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Everyone had a version 
none	none	On the following day that on which Mme de Dey gave out that she was not well the magnates of Carentan went to spend the evening at the mayor s brother s house 
3851_9210_000026_000001	train-clean-360	He was a retired merchant a married man a strictly honorable soul everyone respected him and the Countess held him in high regard 
3851_9210_000026_000002	train-clean-360	There all the rich widows suitors were fain to invent more or less probable fictions each one thinking the while how to turn to his own advantage the secret that compelled her to compromise herself in such a manner 
none	none	The public prosecutor spun out a whole drama to bring Mme de Dey s son to her house of a night 
3851_9210_000027_000001	train-clean-360	The mayor had a belief in a priest who had refused the oath a refugee from La Vendee but this left him not a little embarrassed how to account for the purchase of a hare on a Friday 
none	none	The president of the district had strong leanings toward a Chouan chief or a Vendean leader hotly pursued 
3851_9210_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Others voted for a noble escaped from the prisons of Paris 
none	none	In short one and all suspected that the Countess had been guilty of some piece of generosity that the law of those days defined as a crime an offense that was like to bring her to the scaffold 
3851_9210_000027_000005	train-clean-360	The public prosecutor moreover said in a low voice that they must hush the matter up and try to save the unfortunate lady from the abyss toward which she was hastening 
3851_9210_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 If you spread reports about he added I shall be obliged to take cognizance of the matter and to search the house and then 
3851_9210_000029_000000	train-clean-360	He said no more but everyone understood what was left unsaid 
none	none	The Countess s real friends were so much alarmed for her that on the morning of the third day the Procureur Syndic of the commune made his wife write a few lines to persuade Mme de Dey to hold her reception as usual that evening 
3851_9210_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The old merchant took a bolder step 
3851_9210_000030_000002	train-clean-360	He called that morning upon the lady 
none	none	Strong in the thought of the service he meant to do her he insisted that he must see Mme de Dey and was amazed beyond expression to find her out in the garden busy gathering the last autumn flowers in her borders to fill the vases
3851_9210_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 She has given refuge to her lover no doubt thought the old man struck with pity for the charming woman before him 
3851_9210_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The Countess s face wore a strange look that confirmed his suspicions Deeply moved by the devotion so natural to women but that always touches us because all men are flattered by the sacrifices that any woman makes for any one of them the merchant told the Countess of the gossip that was circulating in the town and showed her the danger that she was running 
3851_9210_000032_000001	train-clean-360	He wound up at last with saying that if there are some of our public functionaries who are sufficiently ready to pardon a piece of heroism on your part so long as it is a priest that you wish to save no one will show you any mercy if it is discovered that you are sacrificing yourself to the dictates of your heart 
none	none	At these words Mme de Dey gazed at her visitor with a wild excitement in her manner that made him tremble old though he was
3851_9210_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Come in she said taking him by the hand to bring him to her room and as soon as she had assured herself that they were alone she drew a soiled torn letter from her bodice Read it she cried with a violent effort to pronounce the words 
3851_9210_000035_000000	train-clean-360	She dropped as if exhausted into her armchair 
3851_9210_000035_000001	train-clean-360	While the old merchant looked for his spectacles and wiped them she raised her eyes and for the first time looked at him with curiosity then in an uncertain voice I trust in you she said softly 
3851_9210_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Why did I come but to share in your crime the old merchant said simply 
3851_9210_000037_000000	train-clean-360	She trembled 
3851_9210_000037_000001	train-clean-360	For the first time since she had come to the little town her soul found sympathy in another soul 
3851_9210_000037_000002	train-clean-360	A sudden light dawned meantime on the old merchant he understood the Countess s joy and her prostration 
3851_9210_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Her son had taken part in the Granville expedition he wrote to his mother from his prison and the letter brought her a sad sweet hope Feeling no doubts as to his means of escape he wrote that within three days he was sure to reach her disguised 
none	none	The same letter that brought these weighty tidings was full of heartrending farewells in case the writer should not be in Carentan by the evening of the third day and he implored his mother to send a considerable sum of money by the bearer who had gone through dangers innumerable to deliver it 
3851_9210_000038_000002	train-clean-360	The paper shook in the old man s hands 
none	none	And to day is the third day cried Mme de Dey 
3851_9210_000039_000001	train-clean-360	She sprang to her feet took back the letter and walked up and down 
3851_9210_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 You have set to work imprudently the merchant remarked addressing her 
3851_9210_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 Why did you buy provisions 
3851_9210_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Why he may come in dying of hunger worn out with fatigue and She broke off 
3851_9210_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sure of my brother the old merchant went on I will engage him in your interests 
none	none	The merchant in this crisis recovered his old business shrewdness and the advice that he gave Mme de Dey was full of prudence and wisdom After the two had agreed together as to what they were to do and say the old merchant went on various ingenious pretexts to pay visits to the principal houses of Carentan announcing wherever he went that he had just been to see Mme de Dey and that in spite of her indisposition she would receive that evening 
3851_9210_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Matching his shrewdness against Norman wits in the cross examination he underwent in every family as to the Countess s complaint he succeeded in putting almost everyone who took an interest in the mysterious affair upon the wrong scent 
none	none	His very first call worked wonders He told in the hearing of a gouty old lady how that Mme de Dey had all but died of an attack of gout in the stomach how that the illustrious Tronchin had recommended her in such a case to put the skin from a live hare on her chest to stop in bed and keep perfectly still 
3851_9210_000044_000002	train-clean-360	The Countess he said had lain in danger of her life for the past two days but after carefully following out Tronchin s singular prescription she was now sufficiently recovered to receive visitors that evening 
3851_9210_000045_000000	train-clean-360	This tale had an immense success in Carentan 
none	none	The local doctor a Royalist in petto added to its effect by gravely discussing the specific Suspicion nevertheless had taken too deep root in a few perverse or philosophical minds to be entirely dissipated so it fell out that those who had the right of entry into Mme de Dey s drawing room hurried thither at an early hour some to watch her face some out of friendship but the more part attracted by the fame of the marvelous cure 
3851_9210_000046_000000	train-clean-360	They found the Countess seated in a corner of the great chimney piece in her room which was almost as modestly furnished as similar apartments in Carentan for she had given up the enjoyment of luxuries to which she had formerly been accustomed for fear of offending the narrow prejudices of her guests and she had made no changes in her house 
3851_9210_000046_000001	train-clean-360	The floor was not even polished 
none	none	She had left the old somber hangings on the walls had kept the old fashioned country furniture burned tallow candles had fallen in with the ways of the place and adopted provincial life without flinching before its cast iron narrowness its most disagreeable hardships but knowing that her guests would forgive her for any prodigality that conduced to their comfort she left nothing undone where their personal enjoyment was concerned her dinners for instance were excellent 
3851_9210_000046_000003	train-clean-360	She even went so far as to affect avarice to recommend herself to these sordid natures and had the ingenuity to make it appear that certain concessions to luxury had been made at the instance of others to whom she had graciously yielded 
none	none	Toward seven o clock that evening therefore the nearest approach to polite society that Carentan could boast was assembled in Mme de Dey s drawing room in a wide circle about the fire 
3851_9210_000047_000001	train-clean-360	The old merchant s sympathetic glances sustained the mistress of the house through this ordeal with wonderful strength of mind she underwent the curious scrutiny of her guests and bore with their trivial prosings 
3851_9210_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Every time there was a knock at the door at every sound of footsteps in the street she hid her agitation by raising questions of absorbing interest to the countryside 
3851_9210_000047_000003	train-clean-360	She led the conversation on to the burning topic of the quality of various ciders and was so well seconded by her friend who shared her secret that her guests almost forgot to watch her and her face wore its wonted look her self possession was unshaken 
3851_9210_000047_000004	train-clean-360	The public prosecutor and one of the judges of the Revolutionary Tribunal kept silence however noting the slightest change that flickered over her features listening through the noisy talk to every sound in the house 
3851_9210_000047_000005	train-clean-360	Several times they put awkward questions which the Countess answered with wonderful presence of mind So brave is a mother s heart 
none	none	Mme de Dey had drawn her visitors into little groups had made parties of whist boston or reversis and sat talking with some of the young people she seemed to be living completely in the present moment and played her part like a consummate actress 
3851_9210_000048_000001	train-clean-360	She elicited a suggestion of loto and saying that no one else knew where to find the game she left the room 
3851_9210_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 My good Brigitte I cannot breathe down there she cried brushing away the tears that sprang to her eyes that glittered with fever sorrow and impatience She had gone up to her son s room and was looking round it 
3851_9210_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 He does not come she said 
3851_9210_000049_000002	train-clean-360	 Here I can breathe and live 
3851_9210_000049_000003	train-clean-360	A few minutes more and he will be here for he is alive I am sure that he is alive my heart tells me so 
3851_9210_000049_000004	train-clean-360	Do you hear nothing Brigitte 
none	none	Oh 
3851_9210_000049_000006	train-clean-360	I would give the rest of my life to know whether he is still in prison or tramping across the country 
3851_9210_000049_000007	train-clean-360	I would rather not think 
3851_9210_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Once more she looked to see that everything was in order 
3851_9210_000050_000001	train-clean-360	A bright fire blazed on the hearth the shutters were carefully closed the furniture shone with cleanliness the bed had been made after a fashion that showed that Brigitte and the Countess had given their minds to every trifling detail 
none	none	It was impossible not to read her hopes in the dainty and thoughtful preparations about the room love and a mother s tenderest caresses seemed to pervade the air in the scent of flowers None but a mother could have foreseen the requirements of a soldier and arranged so completely for their satisfaction 
3851_9210_000050_000003	train-clean-360	A dainty meal the best of wine clean linen slippers no necessary no comfort was lacking for the weary traveler and all the delights of home heaped upon him should reveal his mother s love 
3851_9210_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Brigitte cried the Countess with a heart rending inflection in her voice 
none	none	She drew a chair to the table as if to strengthen her illusions and realize her longings Ah madame he is coming 
3851_9210_000052_000001	train-clean-360	He is not far off 
3851_9210_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I haven t a doubt that he is living and on his way Brigitte answered 
3851_9210_000052_000003	train-clean-360	 I put a key in the Bible and held it on my fingers while Cottin read the Gospel of saint John and the key did not turn madame 
3851_9210_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that a certain sign the Countess asked 
3851_9210_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Why yes madame everybody knows that 
3851_9210_000054_000001	train-clean-360	He is still alive I would stake my salvation on it God cannot be mistaken 
3851_9210_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 If only I could see him here in the house in spite of the danger 
3851_9210_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor Monsieur Auguste cried Brigitte I expect he is tramping along the lanes 
3851_9210_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 And that is eight o clock striking now cried the Countess in terror 
3851_9210_000058_000000	train-clean-360	She was afraid that she had been too long in the room where she felt sure that her son was alive all those preparations made for him meant that he was alive 
3851_9210_000058_000001	train-clean-360	She went down but she lingered a moment in the peristyle for any sound that might waken the sleeping echoes of the town 
3851_9210_000058_000002	train-clean-360	She smiled at Brigitte s husband who was standing there on guard the man s eyes looked stupid with the strain of listening to the faint sounds of the night 
3851_9210_000058_000003	train-clean-360	She stared into the darkness seeing her son in every shadow everywhere but it was only for a moment 
none	none	Then she went back to the drawing room with an assumption of high spirits and began to play at loto with the little girls 
3851_9210_000058_000005	train-clean-360	But from time to time she complained of feeling unwell and went to sit in her great chair by the fireside 
none	none	So things went in Mme de Dey s house and in the minds of those beneath her roof Meanwhile on the road
3851_9210_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 from Paris 
none	none	to Cherbourg a young man dressed in the inevitable brown carmagnole of those days was plodding his way toward Carentan When the first levies were made there was little or no discipline kept up 
3851_9210_000059_000002	train-clean-360	The exigencies of the moment scarcely admitted of soldiers being equipped at once and it was no uncommon thing to see the roads thronged with conscripts in their ordinary clothes 
3851_9210_000059_000003	train-clean-360	The young fellows went ahead of their company to the next halting place or lagged behind it it depended upon their fitness to bear the fatigues of a long march 
3851_9210_000059_000004	train-clean-360	This particular wayfarer was some considerable way in advance of a company of conscripts on the way to Cherbourg whom the mayor was expecting to arrive every hour for it was his duty to distribute their billets 
3851_9210_000059_000005	train-clean-360	The young man s footsteps were still firm as he trudged along and his bearing seemed to indicate that he was no stranger to the rough life of a soldier 
3851_9210_000059_000006	train-clean-360	The moon shone on the pasture land about Carentan but he had noticed great masses of white cloud that were about to scatter showers of snow over the country and doubtless the fear of being overtaken by a storm had quickened his pace in spite of his weariness 
3851_9210_000060_000000	train-clean-360	The wallet on his back was almost empty and he carried a stick in his hand cut from one of the high thick box hedges that surround most of the farms in Lower Normandy 
none	none	As the solitary wayfarer came into Carentan the gleaming moonlit outlines of its towers stood out for a moment with ghostly effect against the sky 
3851_9210_000060_000002	train-clean-360	He met no one in the silent streets that rang with the echoes of his own footsteps and was obliged to ask the way to the mayor s house of a weaver who was working late The magistrate was not far to seek and in a few minutes the conscript was sitting on a stone bench in the mayor s porch waiting for his billet 
3851_9210_000060_000003	train-clean-360	He was sent for however and confronted with that functionary who scrutinized him closely 
3851_9210_000060_000004	train-clean-360	The foot soldier was a good looking young man who appeared to be of gentle birth 
none	none	There was something aristocratic in his bearing and signs in his face of intelligence developed by a good education
3851_9210_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 What is your name asked the mayor eying him shrewdly 
none	none	Julien Jussieu answered the conscript

none	none	There off with you Citizen Jussieu and he handed over the billet There was a tinge of irony in the stress the magistrate laid on the two last words while he held out a billet on Mme de Dey 
3851_9210_000068_000001	train-clean-360	The conscript read the direction curiously 
none	none	He knows quite well that he has not far to go and when he gets outside he will very soon cross the marketplace said the mayor to himself as the other went out
3851_9210_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 He is uncommonly bold

3851_9210_000069_000004	train-clean-360	Yes but if somebody else had asked to see his papers it would have been all up with him

none	none	It looks as if the prosecutor meant to stop said a lady who noticed that that important personage was not in the group in the market place where they all took leave of one another before going their separate ways home 
3851_9210_000071_000001	train-clean-360	And as a matter of fact that redoubtable functionary was alone with the Countess who waited trembling till he should go 
3851_9210_000071_000002	train-clean-360	There was something appalling in their long silence 
none	none	Citoyenne said he at last I am here to see that the laws of the Republic are carried out Mme de Dey shuddered
3851_9210_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you nothing to tell me 
3851_9210_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing she answered in amazement 
none	none	Ah madame cried the prosecutor sitting down beside her and changing his tone At this moment for lack of a word one of us you or I may carry our heads to the scaffold 
3851_9210_000076_000002	train-clean-360	I have watched your character your soul your manner too closely to share the error into which you have managed to lead your visitors to night 
3851_9210_000076_000003	train-clean-360	You are expecting your son I could not doubt it 
3851_9210_000077_000000	train-clean-360	The Countess made an involuntary sign of denial but her face had grown white and drawn with the struggle to maintain the composure that she did not feel and no tremor was lost on the merciless prosecutor 
3851_9210_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well the Revolutionary official went on receive him but do not let him stay under your roof after seven o clock to morrow morning for to morrow as soon as it is light I shall come with a denunciation that I will have made out and

3851_9210_000081_000001	train-clean-360	A knock at the door rang through the house 
3851_9210_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh cried the terrified mother falling upon her knees save him save him 
none	none	Yes let us save him returned the public prosecutor and his eyes grew bright as he looked at her if it costs us our lives

3851_9210_000084_000001	train-clean-360	The prosecutor raised her politely 
none	none	Madame said he with a flourish of eloquence to your own free will alone would I owe
3851_9210_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Madame he is cried Brigitte thinking that her mistress was alone At the sight of the public prosecutor the old servant s joy flushed countenance became haggard and impassive 
3851_9210_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Who is it Brigitte the prosecutor asked kindly as if he too were in the secret of the household 
3851_9210_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 A conscript that the mayor has sent here for a night s lodging the woman replied holding out the billet 
3851_9210_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 So it is said the prosecutor when he had read the slip of paper 
3851_9210_000089_000001	train-clean-360	 A battalion is coming here to night 
none	none	And he went 
3851_9210_000091_000000	train-clean-360	The Countess s need to believe in the faith of her sometime attorney was so great that she dared not entertain any suspicion of him 
3851_9210_000091_000001	train-clean-360	She fled upstairs she felt scarcely strength enough to stand she opened the door and sprang half dead with fear into her son s arms 
3851_9210_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh my child my child she sobbed covering him with almost frenzied kisses 
3851_9210_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Madame said a stranger s voice 
3851_9210_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh it is not he she cried shrinking away in terror and she stood face to face with the conscript gazing at him with haggard eyes 
none	none	O saint bon Dieu how like he is cried Brigitte There was silence for a moment even the stranger trembled at the sight of Mme de Dey s face
3851_9210_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah monsieur she said leaning on the arm of Brigitte s husband feeling for the first time the full extent of a sorrow that had all but killed her at its first threatening ah monsieur I cannot stay to see you any longer permit my servants to supply my place and to see that you have all that you want 
3851_9210_000098_000000	train-clean-360	She went down to her own room Brigitte and the old serving man half carrying her between them 
3851_9210_000098_000001	train-clean-360	The housekeeper set her mistress in a chair and broke out 
none	none	What madame is that man to sleep in Monsieur Auguste s bed and wear Monsieur Auguste s slippers and eat the pasty that I made for Monsieur Auguste 
3851_9210_000099_000001	train-clean-360	Why if they were to guillotine me for it I 
none	none	Brigitte cried Mme de Dey 
3851_9210_000101_000000	train-clean-360	Brigitte said no more 
3851_9210_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 Hold your tongue chatterbox said her husband in a low voice do you want to kill madame 
3851_9210_000103_000000	train-clean-360	A sound came from the conscript s room as he drew his chair to the table 
none	none	I shall not stay here cried Mme de Dey I shall go into the conservatory I shall hear better there if anyone passes in the night 
3851_9210_000105_000000	train-clean-360	She still wavered between the fear that she had lost her son and the hope of seeing him once more 
3851_9210_000105_000001	train-clean-360	That night was hideously silent 
3851_9210_000105_000002	train-clean-360	Once for the Countess there was an awful interval when the battalion of conscripts entered the town and the men went by one by one to their lodgings 
3851_9210_000105_000003	train-clean-360	Every footfall every sound in the street raised hopes to be disappointed but it was not for long the dreadful quiet succeeded again 
3851_9210_000105_000004	train-clean-360	Toward morning the Countess was forced to return to her room Brigitte ever keeping watch over her mistress s movements did not see her come out again and when she went she found the Countess lying there dead 
none	none	I expect she heard that conscript cried Brigitte walking about Monsieur Auguste s room whistling that accursed Marseillaise of theirs while he dressed as if he had been in a stable 
3851_9210_000106_000001	train-clean-360	That must have killed her 
none	none	But it was a deeper and a more solemn emotion and doubtless some dreadful vision that had caused Mme de Dey s death for at the very hour when she died at Carentan her son was shot in le Morbihan This tragical story may be added to all the instances on record of the workings of sympathies uncontrolled by the laws of time and space These observations collected with scientific curiosity by a few isolated individuals will one day serve as documents on which to base the foundations of a new science which hitherto has lacked its man of genius Introduction to Zadig the Babylonian A work says the author which performs more than it promises Voltaire never heard of a detective story and yet he wrote the first in modern literature so clever as to be a model for all the others that followed He describes his hero Zadig thus His chief talent consisted in discovering the truth in making swift yet marvelous deductions worthy of Sherlock Holmes or any other of the ingenious modern thinking machines But no one would be more surprised than Voltaire to behold the part that Zadig now performs The amusing Babylonian now regarded as the aristocratic ancestor of modern story detectives was created as a chief mocker in a satire on eighteenth century manners morals and metaphysics Voltaire breathed his dazzling brilliance into Zadig as he did into a hundred other characters for a political purpose Their veiled and bitter satire was to make Europe think to sting reason into action to ridicule out of existence a humbugging System of special privileges It did via the French Revolution and the resulting upheavals His prose romances are the most perfect of Voltaire s manifold expressions to this end which mark him the most powerful literary man of the century But the arch wit of his age outdid his brilliant self in Zadig So surpassingly sharp and quick was this finished sleuth that his methods far outlived his satirical mission His razor mind was reincarnated a century later as the fascinator of nations M Dupin And from Poe s wizard up to Sherlock Holmes no one of the thousand detectives drawn in a myriad scenes that thrill the world of readers but owes his outlines at least to Zadig Don t use your reason act like your friends respect conventionalities otherwise the world will absolutely refuse to let you be happy This sums up the theory of life that Zadig satires His comical troubles proceed entirely from his use of independent reason as opposed to the customs of his times The satire fitted ancient Babylonia it fitted eighteenth century France and perhaps the reader of these volumes can find some points of contact with his own surroundings It is still piquant however to remember Zadig s original raison d etre He happened to be cast in the part of what we now know as a detective merely because Voltaire had been reading stories in the Arabian Nights whose heroes get out of scrapes by marvelous deductions from simple signs See Vol VI Voltaire must have grinned at the delicious human interest the subtle irony to pierce complacent humbugs that lurked behind these Oriental situations He made the most of his chance for a quaint parable applicable to the courts the church and science of Europe As the story runs on midst many and sudden adventures the Babylonian reads causes from events in guileless fashion enthusiastic as Sherlock Holmes and no less efficient and all the while behind this innocent mask Voltaire is insinuating a comparison between the practical results of Zadig s common sense and the futile mental cobwebs spun by the alleged thought of the time Especially did Zadig caricature orthodox science and the metaphysicians whose solemn searches after final causes after the reality behind the appearance of things mostly wandered into hopeless tangles and thus formed a great weapon of political oppression by postponing the age of reason and independent thought Zadig did not employ himself in calculating how many inches of water flow in a second of time under the arches of a bridge or whether there fell a cube line of rain in the month of the Mouse more than in the month of the Sheep He never dreamed of making silk of cobwebs or porcelain of broken bottles but he chiefly studied the properties of plants and animals and soon acquired a sagacity that made him discover a thousand differences where other men see nothing but uniformity FRANCOIS MARIE AROUET DE VOLTAIRE Zadig the Babylonian THE BLIND OF ONE EYE There lived at Babylon in the reign of King Moabdar a young man named Zadig of a good natural disposition strengthened and improved by education Though rich and young he had learned to moderate his passions he had nothing stiff or affected in his behavior he did not pretend to examine every action by the strict rules of reason but was always ready to make proper allowances for the weakness of mankind It was matter of surprise that notwithstanding his sprightly wit he never exposed by his raillery those vague incoherent and noisy discourses those rash censures ignorant decisions coarse jests and all that empty jingle of words which at Babylon went by the name of conversation He had learned in the first book of Zoroaster that self love is a football swelled with wind from which when pierced the most terrible tempests issue forth Above all Zadig never boasted of his conquests among the women nor affected to entertain a contemptible opinion of the fair sex He was generous and was never afraid of obliging the ungrateful remembering the grand precept of Zoroaster When thou eatest give to the dogs should they even bite thee He was as wise as it is possible for man to be for he sought to live with the wise Instructed in the sciences of the ancient Chaldeans he understood the principles of natural philosophy such as they were then supposed to be and knew as much of metaphysics as hath ever been known in any age that is little or nothing at all He was firmly persuaded notwithstanding the new philosophy of the times that the year consisted of three hundred and sixty five days and six hours and that the sun was in the center of the world But when the principal magi told him with a haughty and contemptuous air that his sentiments were of a dangerous tendency and that it was to be an enemy to the state to believe that the sun revolved round its own axis and that the year had twelve months he held his tongue with great modesty and meekness Possessed as he was of great riches and consequently of many friends blessed with a good constitution a handsome figure a mind just and moderate and a heart noble and sincere he fondly imagined that he might easily be happy He was going to be married to Semira who in point of beauty birth and fortune was the first match in Babylon He had a real and virtuous affection for this lady and she loved him with the most passionate fondness The happy moment was almost arrived that was to unite them forever in the bands of wedlock when happening to take a walk together toward one of the gates of Babylon under the palm trees that adorn the banks of the Euphrates they saw some men approaching armed with sabers and arrows These were the attendants of young Orcan the minister s nephew whom his uncle s creatures had flattered into an opinion that he might do everything with impunity He had none of the graces nor virtues of Zadig but thinking himself a much more accomplished man he was enraged to find that the other was preferred before him This jealousy which was merely the effect of his vanity made him imagine that he was desperately in love with Semira and accordingly he resolved to carry her off The ravishers seized her in the violence of the outrage they wounded her and made the blood flow from a person the sight of which would have softened the tigers of Mount Imaus She pierced the heavens with her complaints She cried out My dear husband they tear me from the man I adore Regardless of her own danger she was only concerned for the fate of her dear Zadig who in the meantime defended himself with all the strength that courage and love could inspire Assisted only by two slaves he put the ravishers to flight and carried home Semira insensible and bloody as she was On opening her eyes and beholding her deliverer O Zadig said she I loved thee formerly as my intended husband I now love thee as the preserver of my honor and my life Never was heart more deeply affected than that of Semira Never did a more charming mouth express more moving sentiments in those glowing words inspired by a sense of the greatest of all favors and by the most tender transports of a lawful passion Her wound was slight and was soon cured Zadig was more dangerously wounded an arrow had pierced him near his eye and penetrated to a considerable depth Semira wearied Heaven with her prayers for the recovery of her lover Her eyes were constantly bathed in tears she anxiously waited the happy moment when those of Zadig should be able to meet hers but an abscess growing on the wounded eye gave everything to fear A messenger was immediately dispatched to Memphis for the great physician Hermes who came with a numerous retinue He visited the patient and declared that he would lose his eye He even foretold the day and hour when this fatal event would happen Had it been the right eye said he I could easily have cured it but the wounds of the left eye are incurable All Babylon lamented the fate of Zadig and admired the profound knowledge of Hermes In two days the abscess broke of its own accord and Zadig was perfectly cured Hermes wrote a book to prove that it ought not to have been cured Zadig did not read it but as soon as he was able to go abroad he went to pay a visit to her in whom all his hopes of happiness were centered and for whose sake alone he wished to have eyes Semira had been in the country for three days past He learned on the road that that fine lady having openly declared that she had an unconquerable aversion to one eyed men had the night before given her hand to Orcan At this news he fell speechless to the ground His sorrow brought him almost to the brink of the grave He was long indisposed but reason at last got the better of his affliction and the severity of his fate served to console him Since said he I have suffered so much from the cruel caprice of a woman educated at court I must now think of marrying the daughter of a citizen He pitched upon Azora a lady of the greatest prudence and of the best family in town He married her and lived with her for three months in all the delights of the most tender union He only observed that she had a little levity and was too apt to find that those young men who had the most handsome persons were likewise possessed of most wit and virtue THE NOSE One morning Azora returned from a walk in a terrible passion and uttering the most violent exclamations What aileth thee said he my dear spouse What is it that can thus have discomposed thee Alas said she thou wouldst be as much enraged as I am hadst thou seen what I have just beheld I have been to comfort the young widow Cosrou who within these two days hath raised a tomb to her young husband near the rivulet that washes the skirts of this meadow She vowed to heaven in the bitterness of her grief to remain at this tomb while the water of the rivulet should continue to run near it Well said Zadig she is an excellent woman and loved her husband with the most sincere affection Ah replied Azora didst thou but know in what she was employed when I went to wait upon her In what pray beautiful Azora Was she turning the course of the rivulet Azora broke out into such long invectives and loaded the young widow with such bitter reproaches that Zadig was far from being pleased with this ostentation of virtue Zadig had a friend named Cador one of those young men in whom his wife discovered more probity and merit than in others He made him his confidant and secured his fidelity as much as possible by a considerable present Azora having passed two days with a friend in the country returned home on the third The servants told her with tears in their eyes that her husband died suddenly the night before that they were afraid to send her an account of this mournful event and that they had just been depositing his corpse in the tomb of his ancestors at the end of the garden She wept she tore her hair and swore she would follow him to the grave In the evening Cador begged leave to wait upon her and joined his tears with hers Next day they wept less and dined together Cador told her that his friend had left him the greatest part of his estate and that he should think himself extremely happy in sharing his fortune with her The lady wept fell into a passion and at last became more mild and gentle They sat longer at supper than at dinner They now talked with greater confidence Azora praised the deceased but owned that he had many failings from which Cador was free During supper Cador complained of a violent pain in his side The lady greatly concerned and eager to serve him caused all kinds of essences to be brought with which she anointed him to try if some of them might not possibly ease him of his pain She lamented that the great Hermes was not still in Babylon She even condescended to touch the side in which Cador felt such exquisite pain Art thou subject to this cruel disorder said she to him with a compassionate air It sometimes brings me replied Cador to the brink of the grave and there is but one remedy that can give me relief and that is to apply to my side the nose of a man who is lately dead A strange remedy indeed said Azora Not more strange replied he than the sachels of Arnon against the apoplexy This reason added to the great merit of the young man at last determined the lady After all says she when my husband shall cross the bridge Tchinavar in his journey to the other world the angel Asrael will not refuse him a passage because his nose is a little shorter in the second life than it was in the first She then took a razor went to her husband s tomb bedewed it with her tears and drew near to cut off the nose of Zadig whom she found extended at full length in the tomb Zadig arose holding his nose with one hand and putting back the razor with the other Madam said he don t exclaim so violently against young Cosrou the project of cutting off my nose is equal to that of turning the course of a rivulet THE DOG AND THE HORSE Zadig found by experience that the first month of marriage as it is written in the book of Zend is the moon of honey and that the second is the moon of wormwood He was some time after obliged to repudiate Azora who became too difficult to be pleased and he then sought for happiness in the study of nature No man said he can be happier than a philosopher who reads in this great book which God hath placed before our eyes The truths he discovers are his own he nourishes and exalts his soul he lives in peace he fears nothing from men and his tender spouse will not come to cut off his nose Possessed of these ideas he retired to a country house on the banks of the Euphrates There he did not employ himself in calculating how many inches of water flow in a second of time under the arches of a bridge or whether there fell a cube line of rain in the month of the Mouse more than in the month of the Sheep He never dreamed of making silk of cobwebs or porcelain of broken bottles but he chiefly studied the properties of plants and animals and soon acquired a sagacity that made him discover a thousand differences where other men see nothing but uniformity One day as he was walking near a little wood he saw one of the queen s eunuchs running toward him followed by several officers who appeared to be in great perplexity and who ran to and fro like men distracted eagerly searching for something they had lost of great value Young man said the first eunuch hast thou seen the queen s dog It is a female replied Zadig Thou art in the right returned the first eunuch It is a very small she spaniel added Zadig she has lately whelped she limps on the left forefoot and has very long ears Thou hast seen her said the first eunuch quite out of breath No replied Zadig I have not seen her nor did I so much as know that the queen had a dog Exactly at the same time by one of the common freaks of fortune the finest horse in the king s stable had escaped from the jockey in the plains of Babylon The principal huntsman and all the other officers ran after him with as much eagerness and anxiety as the first eunuch had done after the spaniel The principal huntsman addressed himself to Zadig and asked him if he had not seen the king s horse passing by He is the fleetest horse in the king s stable replied Zadig he is five feet high with very small hoofs and a tail three feet and a half in length the studs on his bit are gold of twenty three carats and his shoes are silver of eleven pennyweights What way did he take where is he demanded the chief huntsman I have not seen him replied Zadig and never heard talk of him before The principal huntsman and the first eunuch never doubted but that Zadig had stolen the king s horse and the queen s spaniel They therefore had him conducted before the assembly of the grand desterham who condemned him to the knout and to spend the rest of his days in Siberia Hardly was the sentence passed when the horse and the spaniel were both found The judges were reduced to the disagreeable necessity of reversing their sentence but they condemned Zadig to pay four hundred ounces of gold for having said that he had not seen what he had seen This fine he was obliged to pay after which he was permitted to plead his cause before the counsel of the grand desterham when he spoke to the following effect Ye stars of justice abyss of sciences mirrors of truth who have the weight of lead the hardness of iron the splendor of the diamond and many properties of gold Since I am permitted to speak before this august assembly I swear to you by Oramades that I have never seen the queen s respectable spaniel nor the sacred horse of the king of kings The truth of the matter was as follows I was walking toward the little wood where I afterwards met the venerable eunuch and the most illustrious chief huntsman I observed on the sand the traces of an animal and could easily perceive them to be those of a little dog The light and long furrows impressed on little eminences of sand between the marks of the paws plainly discovered that it was a female whose dugs were hanging down and that therefore she must have whelped a few days before Other traces of a different kind that always appeared to have gently brushed the surface of the sand near the marks of the forefeet showed me that she had very long ears and as I remarked that there was always a slighter impression made on the sand by one foot than the other three I found that the spaniel of our august queen was a little lame if I may be allowed the expression With regard to the horse of the king of kings you will be pleased to know that walking in the lanes of this wood I observed the marks of a horse s shoes all at equal distances This must be a horse said I to myself that gallops excellently The dust on the trees in the road that was but seven feet wide was a little brushed off at the distance of three feet and a half from the middle of the road This horse said I has a tail three feet and a half long which being whisked to the right and left has swept away the dust I observed under the trees that formed an arbor five feet in height that the leaves of the branches were newly fallen from whence I inferred that the horse had touched them and that he must therefore be five feet high As to his bit it must be gold of twenty three carats for he had rubbed its bosses against a stone which I knew to be a touchstone and which I have tried In a word from the marks made by his shoes on flints of another kind I concluded that he was shod with silver eleven deniers fine All the judges admired Zadig for his acute and profound discernment The news of this speech was carried even to the king and queen Nothing was talked of but Zadig in the antechambers the chambers and the cabinet and though many of the magi were of opinion that he ought to be burned as a sorcerer the king ordered his officers to restore him the four hundred ounces of gold which he had been obliged to pay The register the attorneys and bailiffs went to his house with great formality to carry him back his four hundred ounces They only retained three hundred and ninety eight of them to defray the expenses of justice and their servants demanded their fees Zadig saw how extremely dangerous it sometimes is to appear too knowing and therefore resolved that on the next occasion of the like nature he would not tell what he had seen Such an opportunity soon offered A prisoner of state made his escape and passed under the window of Zadig s house Zadig was examined and made no answer But it was proved that he had looked at the prisoner from this window For this crime he was condemned to pay five hundred ounces of gold and according to the polite custom of Babylon he thanked his judges for their indulgence Great God said he to himself what a misfortune it is to walk in a wood through which the queen s spaniel or the king s horse has passed how dangerous to look out at a window and how difficult to be happy in this life THE ENVIOUS MAN Zadig resolved to comfort himself by philosophy and friendship for the evils he had suffered from fortune He had in the suburbs of Babylon a house elegantly furnished in which he assembled all the arts and all the pleasures worthy the pursuit of a gentleman In the morning his library was open to the learned In the evening his table was surrounded by good company But he soon found what very dangerous guests these men of letters are A warm dispute arose on one of Zoroaster s laws which forbids the eating of a griffin Why said some of them prohibit the eating of a griffin if there is no such an animal in nature There must necessarily be such an animal said the others since Zoroaster forbids us to eat it Zadig would fain have reconciled them by saying If there are no griffins we cannot possibly eat them and thus either way we shall obey Zoroaster A learned man who had composed thirteen volumes on the properties of the griffin and was besides the chief theurgite hastened away to accuse Zadig before one of the principal magi named Yebor the greatest blockhead and therefore the greatest fanatic among the Chaldeans This man would have impaled Zadig to do honors to the sun and would then have recited the breviary of Zoroaster with greater satisfaction The friend Cador a friend is better than a hundred priests went to Yebor and said to him Long live the sun and the griffins beware of punishing Zadig he is a saint he has griffins in his inner court and does not eat them and his accuser is an heretic who dares to maintain that rabbits have cloven feet and are not unclean Well said Yebor shaking his bald pate we must impale Zadig for having thought contemptuously of griffins and the other for having spoken disrespectfully of rabbits Cador hushed up the affair by means of a maid of honor with whom he had a love affair and who had great interest in the College of the Magi Nobody was impaled This levity occasioned a great murmuring among some of the doctors who from thence predicted the fall of Babylon Upon what does happiness depend said Zadig I am persecuted by everything in the world even on account of beings that have no existence He cursed those men of learning and resolved for the future to live with none but good company He assembled at his house the most worthy men and the most beautiful ladies of Babylon He gave them delicious suppers often preceded by concerts of music and always animated by polite conversation from which he knew how to banish that affectation of wit which is the surest method of preventing it entirely and of spoiling the pleasure of the most agreeable society Neither the choice of his friends nor that of the dishes was made by vanity for in everything he preferred the substance to the shadow and by these means he procured that real respect to which he did not aspire Opposite to his house lived one Arimazes a man whose deformed countenance was but a faint picture of his still more deformed mind His heart was a mixture of malice pride and envy Having never been able to succeed in any of his undertakings he revenged himself on all around him by loading them with the blackest calumnies Rich as he was he found it difficult to procure a set of flatterers The rattling of the chariots that entered Zadig s court in the evening filled him with uneasiness the sound of his praises enraged him still more He sometimes went to Zadig s house and sat down at table without being desired where he spoiled all the pleasure of the company as the harpies are said to infect the viands they touch It happened that one day he took it in his head to give an entertainment to a lady who instead of accepting it went to sup with Zadig At another time as he was talking with Zadig at court a minister of state came up to them and invited Zadig to supper without inviting Arimazes The most implacable hatred has seldom a more solid foundation This man who in Babylon was called the Envious resolved to ruin Zadig because he was called the Happy The opportunity of doing mischief occurs a hundred times in a day and that of doing good but once a year as sayeth the wise Zoroaster The envious man went to see Zadig who was walking in his garden with two friends and a lady to whom he said many gallant things without any other intention than that of saying them The conversation turned upon a war which the king had just brought to a happy conclusion against the prince of Hircania his vassal Zadig who had signalized his courage in this short war bestowed great praises on the king but greater still on the lady He took out his pocketbook and wrote four lines extempore which he gave to this amiable person to read His friends begged they might see them but modesty or rather a well regulated self love would not allow him to grant their request He knew that extemporary verses are never approved of by any but by the person in whose honor they are written He therefore tore in two the leaf on which he had wrote them and threw both the pieces into a thicket of rosebushes where the rest of the company sought for them in vain A slight shower falling soon after obliged them to return to the house The envious man who stayed in the garden continued the search till at last he found a piece of the leaf It had been torn in such a manner that each half of a line formed a complete sense and even a verse of a shorter measure but what was still more surprising these short verses were found to contain the most injurious reflections on the king They ran thus To flagrant crimes His crown he owes To peaceful times The worst of foes The envious man was now happy for the first time of his life He had it in his power to ruin a person of virtue and merit Filled with this fiendlike joy he found means to convey to the king the satire written by the hand of Zadig who together with the lady and his two friends was thrown into prison His trial was soon finished without his being permitted to speak for himself As he was going to receive his sentence the envious man threw himself in his way and told him with a loud voice that his verses were good for nothing Zadig did not value himself on being a good poet but it filled him with inexpressible concern to find that he was condemned for high treason and that the fair lady and his two friends were confined in prison for a crime of which they were not guilty He was not allowed to speak because his writing spoke for him Such was the law of Babylon Accordingly he was conducted to the place of execution through an immense crowd of spectators who durst not venture to express their pity for him but who carefully examined his countenance to see if he died with a good grace His relations alone were inconsolable for they could not succeed to his estate Three fourths of his wealth were confiscated into the king s treasury and the other fourth was given to the envious man Just as he was preparing for death the king s parrot flew from its cage and alighted on a rosebush in Zadig s garden A peach had been driven thither by the wind from a neighboring tree and had fallen on a piece of the written leaf of the pocketbook to which it stuck The bird carried off the peach and the paper and laid them on the king s knee The king took up the paper with great eagerness and read the words which formed no sense and seemed to be the endings of verses He loved poetry and there is always some mercy to be expected from a prince of that disposition The adventure of the parrot set him a thinking The queen who remembered what had been written on the piece of Zadig s pocketbook caused it to be brought They compared the two pieces together and found them to tally exactly they then read the verses as Zadig had wrote them TYRANTS ARE PRONE TO FLAGRANT CRIMES TO CLEMENCY HIS CROWN HE OWES TO CONCORD AND TO PEACEFUL TIMES LOVE ONLY IS THE WORST OF FOES The king gave immediate orders that Zadig should be brought before him and that his two friends and the lady should be set at liberty Zadig fell prostrate on the ground before the king and queen humbly begged their pardon for having made such bad verses and spoke with so much propriety wit and good sense that their majesties desired they might see him again He did himself that honor and insinuated himself still farther into their good graces They gave him all the wealth of the envious man but Zadig restored him back the whole of it And this instance of generosity gave no other pleasure to the envious man than that of having preserved his estate The king s esteem for Zadig increased every day He admitted him into all his parties of pleasure and consulted him in all affairs of state From that time the queen began to regard him with an eye of tenderness that might one day prove dangerous to herself to the king her august comfort to Zadig and to the kingdom in general Zadig now began to think that happiness was not so unattainable as he had formerly imagined THE GENEROUS The time now arrived for celebrating a grand festival which returned every five years It was a custom in Babylon solemnly to declare at the end of every five years which of the citizens had performed the most generous action The grandees and the magi were the judges The first satrap who was charged with the government of the city published the most noble actions that had passed under his administration The competition was decided by votes and the king pronounced the sentence People came to this solemnity from the extremities of the earth The conqueror received from the monarch s hand a golden cup adorned with precious stones his majesty at the same time making him this compliment Receive this reward of thy generosity and may the gods grant me many subjects like to thee This memorable day being come the king appeared on his throne surrounded by the grandees the magi and the deputies of all nations that came to these games where glory was acquired not by the swiftness of horses nor by strength of body but by virtue The first satrap recited with an audible voice such actions as might entitle the authors of them to this invaluable prize He did not mention the greatness of soul with which Zadig had restored the envious man his fortune because it was not judged to be an action worthy of disputing the prize He first presented a judge who having made a citizen lose a considerable cause by a mistake for which after all he was not accountable had given him the whole of his own estate which was just equal to what the other had lost He next produced a young man who being desperately in love with a lady whom he was going to marry had yielded her up to his friend whose passion for her had almost brought him to the brink of the grave and at the same time had given him the lady s fortune He afterwards produced a soldier who in the wars of Hircania had given a still more noble instance of generosity A party of the enemy having seized his mistress he fought in her defense with great intrepidity At that very instant he was informed that another party at the distance of a few paces were carrying off his mother he therefore left his mistress with tears in his eyes and flew to the assistance of his mother At last he returned to the dear object of his love and found her expiring He was just going to plunge his sword in his own bosom but his mother remonstrating against such a desperate deed and telling him that he was the only support of her life he had the courage to endure to live The judges were inclined to give the prize to the soldier But the king took up the discourse and said The action of the soldier and those of the other two are doubtless very great but they have nothing in them surprising Yesterday Zadig performed an action that filled me with wonder I had a few days before disgraced Coreb my minister and favorite I complained of him in the most violent and bitter terms all my courtiers assured me that I was too gentle and seemed to vie with each other in speaking ill of Coreb I asked Zadig what he thought of him and he had the courage to commend him I have read in our histories of many people who have atoned for an error by the surrender of their fortune who have resigned a mistress or preferred a mother to the object of their affection but never before did I hear of a courtier who spoke favorably of a disgraced minister that labored under the displeasure of his sovereign I give to each of those whose generous actions have been now recited twenty thousand pieces of gold but the cup I give to Zadig May it please your majesty said Zadig thyself alone deservest the cup thou hast performed an action of all others the most uncommon and meritorious since notwithstanding thy being a powerful king thou wast not offended at thy slave when he presumed to oppose thy passion The king and Zadig were equally the object of admiration The judge who had given his estate to his client the lover who had resigned his mistress to a friend and the soldier who had preferred the safety of his mother to that of his mistress received the king s presents and saw their names enrolled in the catalogue of generous men Zadig had the cup and the king acquired the reputation of a good prince which he did not long enjoy The day was celebrated by feasts that lasted longer than the law enjoined and the memory of it is still preserved in Asia Zadig said Now I am happy at last but he found himself fatally deceived THE MINISTER The king had lost his first minister and chose Zadig to supply his place All the ladies in Babylon applauded the choice for since the foundation of the empire there had never been such a young minister But all the courtiers were filled with jealousy and vexation The envious man in particular was troubled with a spitting of blood and a prodigious inflammation in his nose Zadig having thanked the king and queen for their goodness went likewise to thank the parrot Beautiful bird said he tis thou that hast saved my life and made me first minister The queen s spaniel and the king s horse did me a great deal of mischief but thou hast done me much good Upon such slender threads as these do the fates of mortals hang But added he this happiness perhaps will vanish very soon Soon replied the parrot Zadig was somewhat startled at this word But as he was a good natural philosopher and did not believe parrots to be prophets he quickly recovered his spirits and resolved to execute his duty to the best of his power He made everyone feel the sacred authority of the laws but no one felt the weight of his dignity He never checked the deliberation of the diran and every vizier might give his opinion without the fear of incurring the minister s displeasure When he gave judgment it was not he that gave it it was the law the rigor of which however whenever it was too severe he always took care to soften and when laws were wanting the equity of his decisions was such as might easily have made them pass for those of Zoroaster It is to him that the nations are indebted for this grand principle to wit that it is better to run the risk of sparing the guilty than to condemn the innocent He imagined that laws were made as well to secure the people from the suffering of injuries as to restrain them from the commission of crimes His chief talent consisted in discovering the truth which all men seek to obscure This great talent he put in practice from the very beginning of his administration A famous merchant of Babylon who died in the Indies divided his estate equally between his two sons after having disposed of their sister in marriage and left a present of thirty thousand pieces of gold to that son who should be found to have loved him best The eldest raised a tomb to his memory the youngest increased his sister s portion by giving her part of his inheritance Everyone said that the eldest son loved his father best and the youngest his sister and that the thirty thousand pieces belonged to the eldest Zadig sent for both of them the one after the other To the eldest he said Thy father is not dead he is recovered of his last illness and is returning to Babylon God be praised replied the young man but his tomb cost me a considerable sum Zadig afterwards said the same to the youngest God be praised said he I will go and restore to my father all that I have but I could wish that he would leave my sister what I have given her Thou shalt restore nothing replied Zadig and thou shalt have the thirty thousand pieces for thou art the son who loves his father best THE DISPUTES AND THE AUDIENCES In this manner he daily discovered the subtilty of his genius and the goodness of his heart The people at once admired and loved him He passed for the happiest man in the world The whole empire resounded with his name All the ladies ogled him All the men praised him for his justice The learned regarded him as an oracle and even the priests confessed that he knew more than the old arch magi Yebor They were now so far from prosecuting him on account of the griffin that they believed nothing but what he thought credible There had reigned in Babylon for the space of fifteen hundred years a violent contest that had divided the empire into two sects The one pretended that they ought to enter the temple of Mitra with the left foot foremost the other held this custom in detestation and always entered with the right foot first The people waited with great impatience for the day on which the solemn feast of the sacred fire was to be celebrated to see which sect Zadig would favor All the world had their eyes fixed on his two feet and the whole city was in the utmost suspense and perturbation Zadig jumped into the temple with his feet joined together and afterwards proved in an eloquent discourse that the Sovereign of heaven and earth who accepted not the persons of men makes no distinction between the right and left foot The envious man and his wife alleged that his discourse was not figurative enough and that he did not make the rocks and mountains to dance with sufficient agility He is dry said they and void of genius he does not make the flea to fly and stars to fall nor the sun to melt wax he has not the true Oriental style Zadig contented himself with having the style of reason All the world favored him not because he was in the right road or followed the dictates of reason or was a man of real merit but because he was prime vizier He terminated with the same happy address the grand difference between the white and the black magi The former maintained that it was the height of impiety to pray to God with the face turned toward the east in winter the latter asserted that God abhorred the prayers of those who turned toward the west in summer Zadig decreed that every man should be allowed to turn as he pleased Thus he found out the happy secret of finishing all affairs whether of a private or public nature in the morning The rest of the day he employed in superintending and promoting the embellishments of Babylon He exhibited tragedies that drew tears from the eyes of the spectators and comedies that shook their sides with laughter a custom which had long been disused and which his good taste now induced him to revive He never affected to be more knowing in the polite arts than the artists themselves he encouraged them by rewards and honors and was never jealous of their talents In the evening the king was highly entertained with his conversation and the queen still more Great minister said the king Amiable minister said the queen and both of them added It would have been a great loss to the state had such a man been hanged Never was man in power obliged to give so many audiences to the ladies Most of them came to consult him about no business at all that so they might have some business with him But none of them won his attention Meanwhile Zadig perceived that his thoughts were always distracted as well when he gave audience as when he sat in judgment He did not know to what to attribute this absence of mind and that was his only sorrow He had a dream in which he imagined that he laid himself down upon a heap of dry herbs among which there were many prickly ones that gave him great uneasiness and that he afterwards reposed himself on a soft bed of roses from which there sprung a serpent that wounded him to the heart with its sharp and venomed tongue Alas said he I have long lain on these dry and prickly herbs I am now on the bed of roses but what shall be the serpent JEALOUSY Zadig s calamities sprung even from his happiness and especially from his merit He every day conversed with the king and Astarte his august comfort The charms of his conversation were greatly heightened by that desire of pleasing which is to the mind what dress is to beauty His youth and graceful appearance insensibly made an impression on Astarte which she did not at first perceive Her passion grew and flourished in the bosom of innocence Without fear or scruple she indulged the pleasing satisfaction of seeing and hearing a man who was so dear to her husband and to the empire in general She was continually praising him to the king She talked of him to her women who were always sure to improve on her praises And thus everything contributed to pierce her heart with a dart of which she did not seem to be sensible She made several presents to Zadig which discovered a greater spirit of gallantry than she imagined She intended to speak to him only as a queen satisfied with his services and her expressions were sometimes those of a woman in love Astarte was much more beautiful than that Semira who had such a strong aversion to one eyed men or that other woman who had resolved to cut off her husband s nose Her unreserved familiarity her tender expressions at which she began to blush and her eyes which though she endeavored to divert them to other objects were always fixed upon his inspired Zadig with a passion that filled him with astonishment He struggled hard to get the better of it He called to his aid the precepts of philosophy which had always stood him in stead but from thence though he could derive the light of knowledge he could procure no remedy to cure the disorders of his lovesick heart Duty gratitude and violated majesty presented themselves to his mind as so many avenging gods He struggled he conquered but this victory which he was obliged to purchase afresh every moment cost him many sighs and tears He no longer dared to speak to the queen with that sweet and charming familiarity which had been so agreeable to them both His countenance was covered with a cloud His conversation was constrained and incoherent His eyes were fixed on the ground and when in spite of all his endeavors to the contrary they encountered those of the queen they found them bathed in tears and darting arrows of flame They seemed to say We adore each other and yet are afraid to love we both burn with a fire which we both condemn Zadig left the royal presence full of perplexity and despair and having his heart oppressed with a burden which he was no longer able to bear In the violence of his perturbation he involuntarily betrayed the secret to his friend Cador in the same manner as a man who having long supported the fits of a cruel disease discovered his pain by a cry extorted from him by a more severe fit and by the cold sweat that covers his brow I have already discovered said Cador the sentiments which thou wouldst fain conceal from thyself The symptoms by which the passions show themselves are certain and infallible Judge my dear Zadig since I have read thy heart whether the king will not discover something in it that may give him offense He has no other fault but that of being the most jealous man in the world Thou canst resist the violence of thy passion with greater fortitude than the queen because thou art a philosopher and because thou art Zadig Astarte is a woman she suffers her eyes to speak with so much the more imprudence as she does not as yet think herself guilty Conscious of her innocence she unhappily neglects those external appearances which are so necessary I shall tremble for her so long as she has nothing wherewithal to reproach herself Were ye both of one mind ye might easily deceive the whole world A growing passion which we endeavor to suppress discovers itself in spite of all our efforts to the contrary but love when gratified is easily concealed Zadig trembled at the proposal of betraying the king his benefactor and never was he more faithful to his prince than when guilty of an involuntary crime against him Meanwhile the queen mentioned the name of Zadig so frequently and with such a blushing and downcast look she was sometimes so lively and sometimes so perplexed when she spoke to him in the king s presence and was seized with such deep thoughtfulness at his going away that the king began to be troubled He believed all that he saw and imagined all that he did not see He particularly remarked that his wife s shoes were blue and that Zadig s shoes were blue that his wife s ribbons were yellow and that Zadig s bonnet was yellow and these were terrible symptoms to a prince of so much delicacy In his jealous mind suspicions were turned into certainty All the slaves of kings and queens are so many spies over their hearts They soon observed that Astarte was tender and that Moabdar was jealous The envious man brought false report to the king The monarch now thought of nothing but in what manner he might best execute his vengeance He one night resolved to poison the queen and in the morning to put Zadig to death by the bowstring The orders were given to a merciless eunuch who commonly executed his acts of vengeance There happened at that time to be in the king s chamber a little dwarf who though dumb was not deaf He was allowed on account of his insignificance to go wherever he pleased and as a domestic animal was a witness of what passed in the most profound secrecy This little mute was strongly attached to the queen and Zadig With equal horror and surprise he heard the cruel orders given But how to prevent the fatal sentence that in a few hours was to be carried into execution He could not write but he could paint and excelled particularly in drawing a striking resemblance He employed a part of the night in sketching out with his pencil what he meant to impart to the queen The piece represented the king in one corner boiling with rage and giving orders to the eunuch a bowstring and a bowl on a table the queen in the middle of the picture expiring in the arms of her woman and Zadig strangled at her feet The horizon represented a rising sun to express that this shocking execution was to be performed in the morning As soon as he had finished the picture he ran to one of Astarte s women awakened her and made her understand that she must immediately carry it to the queen At midnight a messenger knocks at Zadig s door awakes him and gives him a note from the queen He doubts whether it is a dream and opens the letter with a trembling hand But how great was his surprise and who can express the consternation and despair into which he was thrown upon reading these words Fly this instant or thou art a dead man Fly Zadig I conjure thee by our mutual love and my yellow ribbons I have not been guilty but I find I must die like a criminal Zadig was hardly able to speak He sent for Cador and without uttering a word gave him the note Cador forced him to obey and forthwith to take the road to Memphis Shouldst thou dare said he to go in search of the queen thou wilt hasten her death Shouldst thou speak to the king thou wilt infallibly ruin her I will take upon me the charge of her destiny follow thy own I will spread a report that thou hast taken the road to India I will soon follow thee and inform thee of all that shall have passed in Babylon At that instant Cador caused two of the swiftest dromedaries to be brought to a private gate of the palace Upon one of these he mounted Zadig whom he was obliged to carry to the door and who was ready to expire with grief He was accompanied by a single domestic and Cador plunged in sorrow and astonishment soon lost sight of his friend This illustrious fugitive arriving on the side of a hill from whence he could take a view of Babylon turned his eyes toward the queen s palace and fainted away at the sight nor did he recover his senses but to shed a torrent of tears and to wish for death At length after his thoughts had been long engrossed in lamenting the unhappy fate of the loveliest woman and the greatest queen in the world he for a moment turned his views on himself and cried What then is human life O virtue how hast thou served me Two women have basely deceived me and now a third who is innocent and more beautiful than both the others is going to be put to death Whatever good I have done hath been to me a continual source of calamity and affliction and I have only been raised to the height of grandeur to be tumbled down the most horrid precipice of misfortune Filled with these gloomy reflections his eyes overspread with the veil of grief his countenance covered with the paleness of death and his soul plunged in an abyss of the blackest despair he continued his journey toward Egypt THE WOMAN BEATEN Zadig directed his course by the stars The constellation of Orion and the splendid Dog Star guided his steps toward the pole of Cassiopaea He admired those vast globes of light which appear to our eyes but as so many little sparks while the earth which in reality is only an imperceptible point in nature appears to our fond imaginations as something so grand and noble He then represented to himself the human species as it really is as a parcel of insects devouring one another on a little atom of clay This true image seemed to annihilate his misfortunes by making him sensible of the nothingness of his own being and of that of Babylon His soul launched out into infinity and detached from the senses contemplated the immutable order of the universe But when afterwards returning to himself and entering into his own heart he considered that Astarte had perhaps died for him the universe vanished from his sight and he beheld nothing in the whole compass of nature but Astarte expiring and Zadig unhappy While he thus alternately gave up his mind to this flux and reflux of sublime philosophy and intolerable grief he advanced toward the frontiers of Egypt and his faithful domestic was already in the first village in search of a lodging Upon reaching the village Zadig generously took the part of a woman attacked by her jealous lover The combat grew so fierce that Zadig slew the lover The Egyptians were then just and humane The people conducted Zadig to the town house They first of all ordered his wound to be dressed and then examined him and his servant apart in order to discover the truth They found that Zadig was not an assassin but as he was guilty of having killed a man the law condemned him to be a slave His two camels were sold for the benefit of the town all the gold he had brought with him was distributed among the inhabitants and his person as well as that of the companion of his journey was exposed to sale in the marketplace An Arabian merchant named Setoc made the purchase but as the servant was fitter for labor than the master he was sold at a higher price There was no comparison between the two men Thus Zadig became a slave subordinate to his own servant They were linked together by a chain fastened to their feet and in this condition they followed the Arabian merchant to his house By the way Zadig comforted his servant and exhorted him to patience but he could not help making according to his usual custom some reflections on human life I see said he that the unhappiness of my fate hath an influence on thine Hitherto everything has turned out to me in a most unaccountable manner I have been condemned to pay a fine for having seen the marks of a spaniel s feet I thought that I should once have been impaled on account of a griffin I have been sent to execution for having made some verses in praise of the king I have been upon the point of being strangled because the queen had yellow ribbons and now I am a slave with thee because a brutal wretch beat his mistress Come let us keep a good heart all this perhaps will have an end The Arabian merchants must necessarily have slaves and why not me as well as another since as well as another I am a man This merchant will not be cruel he must treat his slaves well if he expects any advantage from them But while he spoke thus his heart was entirely engrossed by the fate of the Queen of Babylon Two days after the merchant Setoc set out for Arabia Deserta with his slaves and his camels His tribe dwelt near the Desert of Oreb The journey was long and painful Setoc set a much greater value on the servant than the master because the former was more expert in loading the camels and all the little marks of distinction were shown to him A camel having died within two days journey of Oreb his burden was divided and laid on the backs of the servants and Zadig had his share among the rest Setoc laughed to see all his slaves walking with their bodies inclined Zadig took the liberty to explain to him the cause and inform him of the laws of the balance The merchant was astonished and began to regard him with other eyes Zadig finding he had raised his curiosity increased it still further by acquainting him with many things that related to commerce the specific gravity of metals and commodities under an equal bulk the properties of several useful animals and the means of rendering those useful that are not naturally so At last Setoc began to consider Zadig as a sage and preferred him to his companion whom he had formerly so much esteemed He treated him well and had no cause to repent of his kindness THE STONE As soon as Setoc arrived among his own tribe he demanded the payment of five hundred ounces of silver which he had lent to a Jew in presence of two witnesses but as the witnesses were dead and the debt could not be proved the Hebrew appropriated the merchant s money to himself and piously thanked God for putting it in his power to cheat an Arabian Setoc imparted this troublesome affair to Zadig who was now become his counsel In what place said Zadig didst thou lend the five hundred ounces to this infidel Upon a large stone replied the merchant that lies near Mount Oreb What is the character of thy debtor said Zadig That of a knave returned Setoc But I ask thee whether he is lively or phlegmatic cautious or imprudent He is of all bad payers said Setoc the most lively fellow I ever knew Well resumed Zadig allow me to plead thy cause In effect Zadig having summoned the Jew to the tribunal addressed the judge in the following terms Pillow of the throne of equity I come to demand of this man in the name of my master five hundred ounces of silver which he refuses to pay Hast thou any witnesses said the judge No they are dead but there remains a large stone upon which the money was counted and if it please thy grandeur to order the stone to be sought for I hope that it will bear witness The Hebrew and I will tarry here till the stone arrives I will send for it at my master s expense With all my heart replied the judge and immediately applied himself to the discussion of other affairs When the court was going to break up the judge said to Zadig Well friend is not thy stone come yet The Hebrew replied with a smile Thy grandeur may stay here till the morrow and after all not see the stone It is more than six miles from hence and it would require fifteen men to move it Well cried Zadig did not I say that the stone would bear witness Since this man knows where it is he thereby confesses that it was upon it that the money was counted The Hebrew was disconcerted and was soon after obliged to confess the truth The judge ordered him to be fastened to the stone without meat or drink till he should restore the five hundred ounces which were soon after paid The slave Zadig and the stone were held in great repute in Arabia THE FUNERAL PILE Setoc charmed with the happy issue of this affair made his slave his intimate friend He had now conceived as great esteem for him as ever the King of Babylon had done and Zadig was glad that Setoc had no wife He discovered in his master a good natural disposition much probity of heart and a great share of good sense but he was sorry to see that according to the ancient custom of Arabia he adored the host of heaven that is the sun moon and stars He sometimes spoke to him on this subject with great prudence and discretion At last he told him that these bodies were like all other bodies in the universe and no more deserving of our homage than a tree or a rock But said Setoc they are eternal beings and it is from them we derive all we enjoy They animate nature they regulate the seasons and besides are removed at such an immense distance from us that we cannot help revering them Thou receivest more advantage replied Zadig from the waters of the Red Sea which carry thy merchandise to the Indies Why may not it be as ancient as the stars and if thou adorest what is placed at a distance from thee thou oughtest to adore the land of the Gangarides which lies at the extremity of the earth No said Setoc the brightness of the stars command my adoration At night Zadig lighted up a great number of candles in the tent where he was to sup with Setoc and the moment his patron appeared he fell on his knees before these lighted tapers and said Eternal and shining luminaries be ye always propitious to me Having thus said he sat down at table without taking the least notice of Setoc What art thou doing said Setoc to him in amaze I act like thee replied Zadig I adore these candles and neglect their master and mine Setoc comprehended the profound sense of this apologue The wisdom of his slave sunk deep into his soul he no longer offered incense to the creatures but adored the eternal Being who made them There prevailed at that time in Arabia a shocking custom sprung originally from Scythia and which being established in the Indies by the credit of the Brahmans threatened to overrun all the East When a married man died and his beloved wife aspired to the character of a saint she burned herself publicly on the body of her husband This was a solemn feast and was called the Funeral Pile of Widowhood and that tribe in which most women had been burned was the most respected An Arabian of Setoc s tribe being dead his widow whose name was Almona and who was very devout published the day and hour when she intended to throw herself into the fire amidst the sound of drums and trumpets Zadig remonstrated against this horrible custom he showed Setoc how inconsistent it was with the happiness of mankind to suffer young widows to burn themselves every other day widows who were capable of giving children to the state or at least of educating those they already had and he convinced him that it was his duty to do all that lay in his power to abolish such a barbarous practice The women said Setoc have possessed the right of burning themselves for more than a thousand years and who shall dare to abrogate a law which time hath rendered sacred Is there anything more respectable than ancient abuses Reason is more ancient replied Zadig meanwhile speak thou to the chiefs of the tribes and I will go to wait on the young widow Accordingly he was introduced to her and after having insinuated himself into her good graces by some compliments on her beauty and told her what a pity it was to commit so many charms to the flames he at last praised her for her constancy and courage Thou must surely have loved thy husband said he to her with the most passionate fondness Who I replied the lady I loved him not at all He was a brutal jealous insupportable wretch but I am firmly resolved to throw myself on his funeral pile It would appear then said Zadig that there must be a very delicious pleasure in being burned alive Oh it makes nature shudder replied the lady but that must be overlooked I am a devotee and I should lose my reputation and all the world would despise me if I did not burn myself Zadig having made her acknowledge that she burned herself to gain the good opinion of others and to gratify her own vanity entertained her with a long discourse calculated to make her a little in love with life and even went so far as to inspire her with some degree of good will for the person who spoke to her Alas said the lady I believe I should desire thee to marry me Zadig s mind was too much engrossed with the idea of Astarte not to elude this declaration but he instantly went to the chiefs of the tribes told them what had passed and advised them to make a law by which a widow should not be permitted to burn herself till she had conversed privately with a young man for the space of an hour Since that time not a single woman hath burned herself in Arabia They were indebted to Zadig alone for destroying in one day a cruel custom that had lasted for so many ages and thus he became the benefactor of Arabia THE SUPPER Setoc who could not separate himself from this man in whom dwelt wisdom carried him to the great fair of Balzora whither the richest merchants in the earth resorted Zadig was highly pleased to see so many men of different countries united in the same place He considered the whole universe as one large family assembled at Balzora Setoc after having sold his commodities at a very high price returned to his own tribe with his friend Zadig who learned upon his arrival that he had been tried in his absence and was now going to be burned by a slow fire Only the friendship of Almona saved his life Like so many pretty women she possessed great influence with the priesthood Zadig thought it best to leave Arabia Setoc was so charmed with the ingenuity and address of Almona that he made her his wife Zadig departed after having thrown himself at the feet of his fair deliverer Setoc and he took leave of each other with tears in their eyes swearing an eternal friendship and promising that the first of them that should acquire a large fortune should share it with the other Zadig directed his course along the frontiers of Assyria still musing on the unhappy Astarte and reflecting on the severity of fortune which seemed determined to make him the sport of her cruelty and the object of her persecution What said he to himself four hundred ounces of gold for having seen a spaniel condemned to lose my head for four bad verses in praise of the king ready to be strangled because the queen had shoes of the color of my bonnet reduced to slavery for having succored a woman who was beat and on the point of being burned for having saved the lives of all the young widows of Arabia THE ROBBER Arriving on the frontiers which divide Arabia Petraea from Syria he passed by a pretty strong castle from which a party of armed Arabians sallied forth They instantly surrounded him and cried All thou hast belongs to us and thy person is the property of our master Zadig replied by drawing his sword his servant who was a man of courage did the same They killed the first Arabians that presumed to lay hands on them and though the number was redoubled they were not dismayed but resolved to perish in the conflict Two men defended themselves against a multitude and such a combat could not last long The master of the castle whose name was Arbogad having observed from a window the prodigies of valor performed by Zadig conceived a high esteem for this heroic stranger He descended in haste and went in person to call off his men and deliver the two travelers All that passes over my lands said he belongs to me as well as what I find upon the lands of others but thou seemest to be a man of such undaunted courage that I will exempt thee from the common law He then conducted him to his castle ordering his men to treat him well and in the evening Arbogad supped with Zadig The lord of the castle was one of those Arabians who are commonly called robbers but he now and then performed some good actions amid a multitude of bad ones He robbed with a furious rapacity and granted favors with great generosity he was intrepid in action affable in company a debauchee at table but gay in debauchery and particularly remarkable for his frank and open behavior He was highly pleased with Zadig whose lively conversation lengthened the repast At last Arbogad said to him I advise thee to enroll thy name in my catalogue thou canst not do better this is not a bad trade and thou mayest one day become what I am at present May I take the liberty of asking thee said Zadig how long thou hast followed this noble profession From my most tender youth replied the lord I was a servant to a pretty good natured Arabian but could not endure the hardships of my situation I was vexed to find that fate had given me no share of the earth which equally belongs to all men I imparted the cause of my uneasiness to an old Arabian who said to me My son do not despair there was once a grain of sand that lamented that it was no more than a neglected atom in the deserts at the end of a few years it became a diamond and is now the brightest ornament in the crown of the king of the Indies This discourse made a deep impression on my mind I was the grain of sand and I resolved to become the diamond I began by stealing two horses I soon got a party of companions I put myself in a condition to rob small caravans and thus by degrees I destroyed the difference which had formerly subsisted between me and other men I had my share of the good things of this world and was even recompensed with usury for the hardships I had suffered I was greatly respected and became the captain of a band of robbers I seized this castle by force The Satrap of Syria had a mind to dispossess me of it but I was too rich to have anything to fear I gave the satrap a handsome present by which means I preserved my castle and increased my possessions He even appointed me treasurer of the tributes which Arabia Petraea pays to the king of kings I perform my office of receiver with great punctuality but take the freedom to dispense with that of paymaster The grand Desterham of Babylon sent hither a pretty satrap in the name of King Moabdar to have me strangled This man arrived with his orders I was apprised of all I caused to be strangled in his presence the four persons he had brought with him to draw the noose after which I asked him how much his commission of strangling me might be worth He replied that his fees would amount to above three hundred pieces of gold I then convinced him that he might gain more by staying with me I made him an inferior robber and he is now one of my best and richest officers If thou wilt take my advice thy success may be equal to his never was there a better season for plunder since King Moabdar is killed and all Babylon thrown into confusion Moabdar killed said Zadig and what is become of Queen Astarte I know not replied Arbogad All I know is that Moabdar lost his senses and was killed that Babylon is a scene of disorder and bloodshed that all the empire is desolated that there are some fine strokes to be struck yet and that for my own part I have struck some that are admirable But the queen said Zadig for heaven s sake knowest thou nothing of the queen s fate Yes replied he I have heard something of a prince of Hircania if she was not killed in the tumult she is probably one of his concubines but I am much fonder of booty than news I have taken several women in my excursions but I keep none of them I sell them at a high price when they are beautiful without inquiring who they are In commodities of this kind rank makes no difference and a queen that is ugly will never find a merchant Perhaps I may have sold Queen Astarte perhaps she is dead but be it as it will it is of little consequence to me and I should imagine of as little to thee So saying he drank a large draught which threw all his ideas into such confusion that Zadig could obtain no further information Zadig remained for some time without speech sense or motion Arbogad continued drinking told stories constantly repeated that he was the happiest man in the world and exhorted Zadig to put himself in the same condition At last the soporiferous fumes of the wine lulled him into a gentle repose Zadig passed the night in the most violent perturbation What said he did the king lose his senses and is he killed I cannot help lamenting his fate The empire is rent in pieces and this robber is happy O fortune O destiny A robber is happy and the most beautiful of nature s works hath perhaps perished in a barbarous manner or lives in a state worse than death O Astarte what is become of thee At daybreak he questioned all those he met in the castle but they were all busy and he received no answer During the night they had made a new capture and they were now employed in dividing the spoils All he could obtain in this hurry and confusion was an opportunity of departing which he immediately embraced plunged deeper than ever in the most gloomy and mournful reflections Zadig proceeded on his journey with a mind full of disquiet and perplexity and wholly employed on the unhappy Astarte on the King of Babylon on his faithful friend Cador on the happy robber Arbogad in a word on all the misfortunes and disappointments he had hitherto suffered THE FISHERMAN At a few leagues distance from Arbogad s castle he came to the banks of a small river still deploring his fate and considering himself as the most wretched of mankind He saw a fisherman lying on the brink of the river scarcely holding in his weak and feeble hand a net which he seemed ready to drop and lifting up his eyes to Heaven I am certainly said the fisherman the most unhappy man in the world I was universally allowed to be the most famous dealer in cream cheese in Babylon and yet I am ruined I had the most handsome wife that any man in my station could have and by her I have been betrayed I had still left a paltry house and that I have seen pillaged and destroyed At last I took refuge in this cottage where I have no other resource than fishing and yet I cannot catch a single fish Oh my net no more will I throw thee into the water I will throw myself in thy place So saying he arose and advanced forward in the attitude of a man ready to throw himself into the river and thus to finish his life What said Zadig to himself are there men as wretched as I His eagerness to save the fisherman s life was as this reflection He ran to him stopped him and spoke to him with a tender and compassionate air It is commonly supposed that we are less miserable when we have companions in our misery This according to Zoroaster does not proceed from malice but necessity We feel ourselves insensibly drawn to an unhappy person as to one like ourselves The joy of the happy would be an insult but two men in distress are like two slender trees which mutually supporting each other fortify themselves against the storm Why said Zadig to the fisherman dost thou sink under thy misfortunes Because replied he I see no means of relief I was the most considerable man in the village of Derlback near Babylon and with the assistance of my wife I made the best cream cheese in the empire Queen Astarte and the famous minister Zadig were extremely fond of them Zadig transported said What knowest thou nothing of the queen s fate No my lord replied the fisherman but I know that neither the queen nor Zadig has paid me for my cream cheeses that I have lost my wife and am now reduced to despair I flatter myself said Zadig that thou wilt not lose all thy money I have heard of this Zadig he is an honest man and if he returns to Babylon as he expects he will give thee more than he owes thee Believe me go to Babylon I shall be there before thee because I am on horseback and thou art on foot Apply to the illustrious Cador tell him thou hast met his friend wait for me at his house go perhaps thou wilt not always be unhappy O powerful Oromazes continued he thou employest me to comfort this man whom wilt thou employ to give me consolation So saying he gave the fisherman half the money he had brought from Arabia The fisherman struck with surprise and ravished with joy kissed the feet of the friend of Cador and said Thou are surely an angel sent from Heaven to save me Meanwhile Zadig continued to make fresh inquiries and to shed tears What my lord cried the fisherman art thou then so unhappy thou who bestowest favors An hundred times more unhappy than thou art replied Zadig But how is it possible said the good man that the giver can be more wretched than the receiver Because replied Zadig thy greatest misery arose from poverty and mine is seated in the heart Did Orcan take thy wife from thee said the fisherman This word recalled to Zadig s mind the whole of his adventures He repeated the catalogue of his misfortunes beginning with the queen s spaniel and ending with his arrival at the castle of the robber Arbogad Ah said he to the fisherman Orcan deserves to be punished but it is commonly such men as those that are the favorites of fortune However go thou to the house of Lord Cador and there wait my arrival They then parted the fisherman walked thanking Heaven for the happiness of his condition and Zadig rode accusing fortune for the hardness of his lot THE BASILISK Arriving in a beautiful meadow he there saw several women who were searching for something with great application He took the liberty to approach one of them and to ask if he might have the honor to assist them in their search Take care that thou dost not replied the Syrian what we are searching for can be touched only by women Strange said Zadig may I presume to ask thee what it is that women only are permitted to touch It is a basilisk said she A basilisk madam and for what purpose pray dost thou seek for a basilisk It is for our lord and master Ogul whose cattle thou seest on the bank of that river at the end of the meadow We are his most humble slaves The lord Ogul is sick His physician hath ordered him to eat a basilisk stewed in rose water and as it is a very rare animal and can only be taken by women the lord Ogul hath promised to choose for his well beloved wife the woman that shall bring him a basilisk let me go on in my search for thou seest what I shall lose if I am prevented by my companions Zadig left her and the other Assyrians to search for their basilisk and continued to walk in the meadow when coming to the brink of a small rivulet he found another lady lying on the grass and who was not searching for anything Her person seemed to be majestic but her face was covered with a veil She was inclined toward the rivulet and profound sighs proceeded from her mouth In her hand she held a small rod with which she was tracing characters on the fine sand that lay between the turf and the brook Zadig had the curiosity to examine what this woman was writing He drew near he saw the letter Z then an A he was astonished then appeared a D he started But never was surprise equal to his when he saw the two last letters of his name He stood for some time immovable At last breaking silence with a faltering voice O generous lady pardon a stranger an unfortunate man for presuming to ask thee by what surprising adventure I here find the name of Zadig traced out by thy divine hand At this voice and these words the lady lifted up the veil with a trembling hand looked at Zadig sent forth a cry of tenderness surprise and joy and sinking under the various emotions which at once assaulted her soul fell speechless into his arms It was Astarte herself it was the Queen of Babylon it was she whom Zadig adored and whom he had reproached himself for adoring it was she whose misfortunes he had so deeply lamented and for whose fate he had been so anxiously concerned He was for a moment deprived of the use of his senses when he had fixed his eyes on those of Astarte which now began to open again with a languor mixed with confusion and tenderness O ye immortal powers cried he who preside over the fates of weak mortals do ye indeed restore Astarte to me at what a time in what a place and in what a condition do I again behold her He fell on his knees before Astarte and laid his face in the dust at her feet The Queen of Babylon raised him up and made him sit by her side on the brink of the rivulet She frequently wiped her eyes from which the tears continued to flow afresh She twenty times resumed her discourse which her sighs as often interrupted she asked by what strange accident they were brought together and suddenly prevented his answers by other questions she waived the account of her own misfortunes and desired to be informed of those of Zadig At last both of them having a little composed the tumult of their souls Zadig acquainted her in a few words by what adventure he was brought into that meadow But O unhappy and respectable queen by what means do I find thee in this lonely place clothed in the habit of a slave and accompanied by other female slaves who are searching for a basilisk which by order of the physician is to be stewed in rose water While they are searching for their basilisk said the fair Astarte I will inform thee of all I have suffered for which Heaven has sufficiently recompensed me by restoring thee to my sight Thou knowest that the king my husband was vexed to see thee the most amiable of mankind and that for this reason he one night resolved to strangle thee and poison me Thou knowest how Heaven permitted my little mute to inform me of the orders of his sublime majesty Hardly had the faithful Cador advised thee to depart in obedience to my command when he ventured to enter my apartment at midnight by a secret passage He carried me off and conducted me to the temple of Oromazes where the magi his brother shut me up in that huge statue whose base reaches to the foundation of the temple and whose top rises to the summit of the dome I was there buried in a manner but was saved by the magi and supplied with all the necessaries of life At break of day his majesty s apothecary entered my chamber with a potion composed of a mixture of henbane opium hemlock black hellebore and aconite and another officer went to thine with a bowstring of blue silk Neither of us was to be found Cador the better to deceive the king pretended to come and accuse us both He said that thou hadst taken the road to the Indies and I that to Memphis on which the king s guards were immediately dispatched in pursuit of us both The couriers who pursued me did not know me I had hardly ever shown my face to any but thee and to thee only in the presence and by the order of my husband They conducted themselves in the pursuit by the description that had been given them of my person On the frontiers of Egypt they met with a woman of the same stature with me and possessed perhaps of greater charms She was weeping and wandering They made no doubt but that this woman was the Queen of Babylon and accordingly brought her to Moabdar Their mistake at first threw the king into a violent passion but having viewed this woman more attentively he found her extremely handsome and was comforted She was called Missouf I have since been informed that this name in the Egyptian language signifies the capricious fair one She was so in reality but she had as much cunning as caprice She pleased Moabdar and gained such an ascendancy over him as to make him choose her for his wife Her character then began to appear in its true colors She gave herself up without scruple to all the freaks of a wanton imagination She would have obliged the chief of the magi who was old and gouty to dance before her and on his refusal she persecuted him with the most unrelenting cruelty She ordered her master of the horse to make her a pie of sweetmeats In vain did he represent that he was not a pastry cook he was obliged to make it and lost his place because it was baked a little too hard The post of master of the horse she gave to her dwarf and that of chancellor to her page In this manner did she govern Babylon Everybody regretted the loss of me The king who till the moment of his resolving to poison me and strangle thee had been a tolerably good kind of man seemed now to have drowned all his virtues in his immoderate fondness for this capricious fair one He came to the temple on the great day of the feast held in honor of the sacred fire I saw him implore the gods in behalf of Missouf at the feet of the statue in which I was inclosed I raised my voice I cried out The gods reject the prayers of a king who is now become a tyrant and who attempted to murder a reasonable wife in order to marry a woman remarkable for nothing but her folly and extravagance At these words Moabdar was confounded and his head became disordered The oracle I had pronounced and the tyranny of Missouf conspired to deprive him of his judgment and in a few days his reason entirely forsook him Moabdar s madness which seemed to be the judgment of Heaven was the signal to a revolt The people rose and ran to arms and Babylon which had been so long immersed in idleness and effeminacy became the theater of a bloody civil war I was taken from the heart of my statue and placed at the head of a party Cador flew to Memphis to bring thee back to Babylon The Prince of Hircania informed of these fatal events returned with his army and made a third party in Chaldea He attacked the king who fled before him with his capricious Egyptian Moabdar died pierced with wounds I myself had the misfortune to be taken by a party of Hircanians who conducted me to their prince s tent at the very moment that Missouf was brought before him Thou wilt doubtless be pleased to hear that the prince thought me beautiful but thou wilt be sorry to be informed that he designed me for his seraglio He told me with a blunt and resolute air that as soon as he had finished a military expedition which he was just going to undertake he would come to me Judge how great must have been my grief My ties with Moabdar were already dissolved I might have been the wife of Zadig and I was fallen into the hands of a barbarian I answered him with all the pride which my high rank and noble sentiment could inspire I had always heard it affirmed that Heaven stamped on persons of my condition a mark of grandeur which with a single word or glance could reduce to the lawliness of the most profound respect those rash and forward persons who presume to deviate from the rules of politeness I spoke like a queen but was treated like a maidservant The Hircanian without even deigning to speak to me told his black eunuch that I was impertinent but that he thought me handsome He ordered him to take care of me and to put me under the regimen of favorites that so my complexion being improved I might be the more worthy of his favors when he should be at leisure to honor me with them I told him that rather than submit to his desires I would put an end to my life He replied with a smile that women he believed were not so bloodthirsty and that he was accustomed to such violent expressions and then left me with the air of a man who had just put another parrot into his aviary What a state for the first queen of the universe and what is more for a heart devoted to Zadig At these words Zadig threw himself at her feet and bathed them with his tears Astarte raised him with great tenderness and thus continued her story I now saw myself in the power of a barbarian and rival to the foolish woman with whom I was confined She gave me an account of her adventures in Egypt From the description she gave me of your person from the time from the dromedary on which you were mounted and from every other circumstance I inferred that Zadig was the man who had fought for her I doubted not but that you were at Memphis and therefore resolved to repair thither Beautiful Missouf said I thou art more handsome than I and will please the Prince of Hircania much better Assist me in contriving the means of my escape thou wilt then reign alone thou wilt at once make me happy and rid thyself of a rival Missouf concerted with me the means of my flight and I departed secretly with a female Egyptian slave As I approached the frontiers of Arabia a famous robber named Arbogad seized me and sold me to some merchants who brought me to this castle where Lord Ogul resides He bought me without knowing who I was He is a voluptuary ambitious of nothing but good living and thinks that God sent him into the world for no other purpose than to sit at table He is so extremely corpulent that he is always in danger of suffocation His physician who has but little credit with him when he has a good digestion governs him with a despotic sway when he has ate too much He has persuaded him that a basilisk stewed in rose water will effect a complete cure The Lord Ogul hath promised his hand to the female slave that brings him a basilisk Thou seest that I leave them to vie with each other in meriting this honor and never was I less desirous of finding the basilisk than since Heaven hath restored thee to my sight This account was succeeded by a long conversation between Astarte and Zadig consisting of everything that their long suppressed sentiments their great sufferings and their mutual love could inspire into hearts the most noble and tender and the genii who preside over love carried their words to the sphere of Venus The women returned to Ogul without having found the basilisk Zadig was introduced to this mighty lord and spoke to him in the following terms May immortal health descend from heaven to bless all thy days I am a physician at the first report of thy indisposition I flew to thy castle and have now brought thee a basilisk stewed in rose water Not that I pretend to marry thee All I ask is the liberty of a Babylonian slave who hath been in thy possession for a few days and if I should not be so happy as to cure thee magnificent Lord Ogul I consent to remain a slave in her place The proposal was accepted Astarte set out for Babylon with Zadig s servant promising immediately upon her arrival to send a courier to inform him of all that had happened Their parting was as tender as their meeting The moment of meeting and that of parting are the two greatest epochs of life as sayeth the great book of Zend Zadig loved the queen with as much ardor as he professed and the queen more than she thought proper to acknowledge Meanwhile Zadig spoke thus to Ogul My lord my basilisk is not to be eaten all its virtues must enter through thy pores I have inclosed it in a little ball blown up and covered with a fine skin Thou must strike this ball with all thy might and I must strike it back for a considerable time and by observing this regimen for a few days thou wilt see the effects of my art The first day Ogul was out of breath and thought he should have died with fatigue The second he was less fatigued slept better In eight days he recovered all the strength all the health all the agility and cheerfulness of his most agreeable years Thou hast played at ball and thou hast been temperate said Zadig know that there is no such thing in nature as a basilisk that temperance and exercise are the two great preservatives of health and that the art of reconciling intemperance and health is as chimerical as the philosopher s stone judicial astrology or the theology of the magi Ogul s first physician observing how dangerous this man might prove to the medical art formed a design in conjunction with the apothecary to send Zadig to search for a basilisk in the other world Thus having suffered such a long train of calamities on account of his good actions he was now upon the point of losing his life for curing a gluttonous lord He was invited to an excellent dinner and was to have been poisoned in the second course but during the first he happily received a courier from the fair Astarte When one is beloved by a beautiful woman says the great Zoroaster he hath always the good fortune to extricate himself out of every kind of difficulty and danger THE COMBATS The queen was received at Babylon with all those transports of joy which are ever felt on the return of a beautiful princess who hath been involved in calamities Babylon was now in greater tranquillity The Prince of Hircania had been killed in battle The victorious Babylonians declared that the queen should marry the man whom they should choose for their sovereign They were resolved that the first place in the world that of being husband to Astarte and King of Babylon should not depend on cabals and intrigues They swore to acknowledge for king the man who upon trial should be found to be possessed of the greatest valor and the greatest wisdom Accordingly at the distance of a few leagues from the city a spacious place was marked out for the list surrounded with magnificent amphitheaters Thither the combatants were to repair in complete armor Each of them had a separate apartment behind the amphitheaters where they were neither to be seen nor known by anyone Each was to encounter four knights and those that were so happy as to conquer four were then to engage with one another so that he who remained the last master of the field would be proclaimed conqueror at the games Four days after he was to return with the same arms and to explain the enigmas proposed by the magi If he did not explain the enigmas he was not king and the running at the lances was to be begun afresh till a man would be found who was conqueror in both these combats for they were absolutely determined to have a king possessed of the greatest wisdom and the most invincible courage The queen was all the while to be strictly guarded she was only allowed to be present at the games and even there she was to be covered with a veil but was not permitted to speak to any of the competitors that so they might neither receive favor nor suffer injustice These particulars Astarte communicated to her lover hoping that in order to obtain her he would show himself possessed of greater courage and wisdom than any other person Zadig set out on his journey beseeching Venus to fortify his courage and enlighten his understanding He arrived on the banks of the Euphrates on the eve of this great day He caused his device to be inscribed among those of the combatants concealing his face and his name as the law ordained and then went to repose himself in the apartment that fell to him by lot His friend Cador who after the fruitless search he had made for him in Egypt was now returned to Babylon sent to his tent a complete suit of armor which was a present from the queen as also from himself one of the finest horses in Persia Zadig presently perceived that these presents were sent by Astarte and from thence his courage derived fresh strength and his love the most animating hopes Next day the queen being seated under a canopy of jewels and the amphitheaters filled with all the gentlemen and ladies of rank in Babylon the combatants appeared in the circus Each of them came and laid his device at the feet of the grand magi They drew their devices by lot and that of Zadig was the last The first who advanced was a certain lord named Itobad very rich and very vain but possessed of little courage of less address and hardly of any judgment at all His servants had persuaded him that such a man as he ought to be king he had said in reply Such a man as I ought to reign and thus they had armed him for a cap a pie He wore an armor of gold enameled with green a plume of green feathers and a lance adorned with green ribbons It was instantly perceived by the manner in which Itobad managed his horse that it was not for such a man as he that Heaven reserved the scepter of Babylon The first knight that ran against him threw him out of his saddle the second laid him flat on his horse s buttocks with his legs in the air and his arms extended Itobad recovered himself but with so bad a grace that the whole amphitheater burst out a laughing The third knight disdained to make use of his lance but making a pass at him took him by the right leg and wheeling him half round laid him prostrate on the sand The squires of the game ran to him laughing and replaced him in his saddle The fourth combatant took him by the left leg and tumbled him down on the other side He was conducted back with scornful shouts to his tent where according to the law he was to pass the night and as he limped along with great difficulty he said What an adventure for such a man as I The other knights acquitted themselves with greater ability and success Some of them conquered two combatants a few of them vanquished three but none but Prince Otamus conquered four At last Zadig fought him in his turn He successively threw four knights off their saddles with all the grace imaginable It then remained to be seen who should be conqueror Otamus or Zadig The arms of the first were gold and blue with a plume of the same color those of the last were white The wishes of all the spectators were divided between the knight in blue and the knight in white The queen whose heart was in a violent palpitation offered prayers to Heaven for the success of the white color The two champions made their passes and vaults with so much agility they mutually gave and received such dexterous blows with their lances and sat so firmly in their saddles that everybody but the queen wished there might be two kings in Babylon At length their horses being tired and their lances broken Zadig had recourse to this stratagem He passes behind the blue prince springs upon the buttocks of his horse seizes him by the middle throws him on the earth places himself in the saddle and wheels around Otamus as he lay extended on the ground All the amphitheater cried out Victory to the white knight Otamus rises in a violent passion and draws his sword Zadig leaps from his horse with his saber in his hand Both of them are now on the ground engaged in a new combat where strength and agility triumph by turns The plumes of their helmets the studs of their bracelets the rings of their armor are driven to a great distance by the violence of a thousand furious blows They strike with the point and the edge to the right to the left on the head on the breast they retreat they advance they measure swords they close they seize each other they bend like serpents they attack like lions and the fire every moment flashes from their blows At last Zadig having recovered his spirits stops makes a feint leaps upon Otamus throws him on the ground and disarms him and Otamus cries out It is thou alone O white knight that oughtest to reign over Babylon The queen was now at the height of her joy The knight in blue armor and the knight in white were conducted each to his own apartment as well as all the others according to the intention of the law Mutes came to wait upon them and to serve them at table It may be easily supposed that the queen s little mute waited upon Zadig They were then left to themselves to enjoy the sweets of repose till next morning at which time the conqueror was to bring his device to the grand magi to compare it with that which he had left and make himself known Zadig though deeply in love was so much fatigued that he could not help sleeping Itobad who lay near him never closed his eyes He arose in the night entered his apartment took the white arms and the device of Zadig and put his green armor in their place At break of day he went boldly to the grand magi to declare that so great a man as he was conqueror This was little expected however he was proclaimed while Zadig was still asleep Astarte surprised and filled with despair returned to Babylon The amphitheater was almost empty when Zadig awoke he sought for his arms but could find none but the green armor With this he was obliged to cover himself having nothing else near him Astonished and enraged he put it on in a furious passion and advanced in this equipage The people that still remained in the amphitheater and the circus received him with hoots and hisses They surrounded him and insulted him to his face Never did man suffer such cruel mortifications He lost his patience with his saber he dispersed such of the populace as dared to affront him but he knew not what course to take He could not see the queen he could not claim the white armor she had sent him without exposing her and thus while she was plunged in grief he was filled with fury and distraction He walked on the banks of the Euphrates fully persuaded that his star had destined him to inevitable misery and resolving in his own mind all his misfortunes from the adventure of the woman who hated one eyed men to that of his armor This said he is the consequence of my having slept too long Had I slept less I should now have been King of Babylon and in possession of Astarte Knowledge virtue and courage have hitherto served only to make me miserable He then let fall some secret murmurings against Providence and was tempted to believe that the world was governed by a cruel destiny which oppressed the good and prospered knights in green armor One of his greatest mortifications was his being obliged to wear that green armor which had exposed him to such contumelious treatment A merchant happening to pass by he sold it to him for a trifle and bought a gown and a long bonnet In this garb he proceeded along the banks of the Euphrates filled with despair and secretly accusing Providence which thus continued to persecute him with unremitting severity THE HERMIT While he was thus sauntering he met a hermit whose white and venerable beard hung down to his girdle He held a book in his hand which he read with great attention Zadig stopped and made him a profound obeisance The hermit returned the compliment with such a noble and engaging air that Zadig had the curiosity to enter into conversation with him He asked him what book it was that he had been reading It is the Book of Destinies said the hermit wouldst thou choose to look into it He put the book into the hands of Zadig who thoroughly versed as he was in several languages could not decipher a single character of it This only redoubled his curiosity Thou seemest said this good father to be in great distress Alas replied Zadig I have but too much reason If thou wilt permit me to accompany thee resumed the old man perhaps I may be of some service to thee I have often poured the balm of consolation into the bleeding heart of the unhappy Zadig felt himself inspired with respect for the air the beard and the book of the hermit He found in the course of the conversation that he was possessed of superior degrees of knowledge The hermit talked of fate of justice of morals of the chief good of human weakness and of virtue and vice with such a spirited and moving eloquence that Zadig felt himself drawn toward him by an irresistible charm He earnestly entreated the favor of his company till their return to Babylon I ask the same favor of thee said the old man swear to me by Oromazes that whatever I do thou wilt not leave me for some days Zadig swore and they set out together In the evening the two travelers arrived in a superb castle The hermit entreated a hospitable reception for himself and the young man who accompanied him The porter whom one might have easily mistaken for a great lord introduced them with a kind of disdainful civility He presented them to a principal domestic who showed them his master s magnificent apartments They were admitted to the lower end of the table without being honored with the least mark of regard by the lord of the castle but they were served like the rest with delicacy and profusion They were then presented with water to wash their hands in a golden basin adorned with emeralds and rubies At last they were conducted to bed in a beautiful apartment and in the morning a domestic brought each of them a piece of gold after which they took their leave and departed The master of the house said Zadig as they were proceeding on the journey appears to be a generous man though somewhat too proud he nobly performs the duties of hospitality At that instant he observed that a kind of large pocket which the hermit had was filled and distended and upon looking more narrowly he found that it contained the golden basin adorned with precious stones which the hermit had stolen He durst not take any notice of it but he was filled with a strange surprise About noon the hermit came to the door of a paltry house inhabited by a rich miser and begged the favor of an hospitable reception for a few hours An old servant in a tattered garb received them with a blunt and rude air and led them into the stable where he gave them some rotten olives moldy bread and sour beer The hermit ate and drank with as much seeming satisfaction as he had done the evening before and then addressing himself to the old servant who watched them both to prevent their stealing anything and rudely pressed them to depart he gave him the two pieces of gold he had received in the morning and thanked him for his great civility Pray added he allow me to speak to thy master The servant filled with astonishment introduced the two travelers Magnificent lord said the hermit I cannot but return thee my most humble thanks for the noble manner in which thou hast entertained us Be pleased to accept this golden basin as a small mark of my gratitude The miser started and was ready to fall backward but the hermit without giving him time to recover from his surprise instantly departed with his young fellow traveler Father said Zadig what is the meaning of all this Thou seemest to me to be entirely different from other men thou stealest a golden basin adorned with precious stones from a lord who received thee magnificently and givest it to a miser who treats thee with indignity Son replied the old man this magnificent lord who receives strangers only from vanity and ostentation will hereby be rendered more wise and the miser will learn to practice the duties of hospitality Be surprised at nothing but follow me Zadig knew not as yet whether he was in company with the most foolish or the most prudent of mankind but the hermit spoke with such an ascendancy that Zadig who was moreover bound by his oath could not refuse to follow him In the evening they arrived at a house built with equal elegance and simplicity where nothing favored either of prodigality or avarice The master of it was a philosopher who had retired from the world and who cultivated in peace the study of virtue and wisdom without any of that rigid and morose severity so commonly to be found in men of his character He had chosen to build this country house in which he received strangers with a generosity free from ostentation He went himself to meet the two travelers whom he led into a commodious apartment where he desired them to repose themselves a little Soon after he came and invited them to a decent and well ordered repast during which he spoke with great judgment of the last revolutions in Babylon He seemed to be strongly attached to the queen and wished that Zadig had appeared in the lists to dispute the crown But the people added he do not deserve to have such a king as Zadig Zadig blushed and felt his griefs redoubled They agreed in the course of the conversation that the things of this world did not always answer the wishes of the wise The hermit still maintained that the ways of Providence were inscrutable and that men were in the wrong to judge of a whole of which they understood but the smallest part They talked of passions Ah said Zadig how fatal are their effects They are in the winds replied the hermit that swell the sails of the ship it is true they sometimes sink her but without them she could not sail at all The bile makes us sick and choleric but without bile we could not live Everything in this world is dangerous and yet everything is necessary The conversation turned on pleasure and the hermit proved that it was a present bestowed by the deity For said he man cannot give himself either sensations or ideas he receives all and pain and pleasure proceed from a foreign cause as well as his being Zadig was surprised to see a man who had been guilty of such extravagant actions capable of reasoning with so much judgment and propriety At last after a conversation equally entertaining and instructive the host led back his two guests to their apartment blessing Heaven for having sent him two men possessed of so much wisdom and virtue He offered them money with such an easy and noble air as could not possibly give any offense The hermit refused it and said that he must now take his leave of him as he set out for Babylon before it was light Their parting was tender Zadig especially felt himself filled with esteem and affection for a man of such an amiable character When he and the hermit were alone in their apartment they spent a long time in praising their host At break of day the old man awakened his companion We must now depart said he but while all the family are still asleep I will leave this man a mark of my esteem and affection So saying he took a candle and set fire to the house Zadig struck with horror cried aloud and endeavored to hinder him from committing such a barbarous action but the hermit drew him away by a superior force and the house was soon in flames The hermit who with his companion was already at a considerable distance looked back to the conflagration with great tranquillity Thanks be to God said he the house of my dear host is entirely destroyed Happy man At these words Zadig was at once tempted to burst out a laughing to reproach the reverend father to beat him and to run away But he did none of all of these for still subdued by the powerful ascendancy of the hermit he followed him in spite of himself to the next stage This was at the house of a charitable and virtuous widow who had a nephew fourteen years of age a handsome and promising youth and her only hope She performed the honors of her house as well as she could Next day she ordered her nephew to accompany the strangers to a bridge which being lately broken down was become extremely dangerous in passing The young man walked before them with great alacrity As they were crossing the bridge Come said the hermit to the youth I must show my gratitude to thy aunt He then took him by the hair and plunged him into the river The boy sunk appeared again on the surface of the water and was swallowed up by the current O monster O thou most wicked of mankind cried Zadig Thou promisedst to behave with greater patience said the hermit interrupting him Know that under the ruins of that house which Providence hath set on fire the master hath found an immense treasure Know that this young man whose life Providence hath shortened would have assassinated his aunt in the space of a year and thee in that of two Who told thee so barbarian cried Zadig and though thou hadst read this event in thy Book of Destinies art thou permitted to drown a youth who never did thee any harm While the Babylonian was thus exclaiming he observed that the old man had no longer a beard and that his countenance assumed the features and complexion of youth The hermit s habit disappeared and four beautiful wings covered a majestic body resplendent with light O sent of heaven O divine angel cried Zadig humbly prostrating himself on the ground hast thou then descended from the Empyrean to teach a weak mortal to submit to the eternal decrees of Providence Men said the angel Jesrad judge of all without knowing anything and of all men thou best deservest to be enlightened Zadig begged to be permitted to speak I distrust myself said he but may I presume to ask the favor of thee to clear up one doubt that still remains in my mind Would it not have been better to have corrected this youth and made him virtuous than to have drowned him Had he been virtuous replied Jesrad and enjoyed a longer life it would have been his fate to be assassinated himself together with the wife he would have married and the child he would have had by her But why said Zadig is it necessary that there should be crimes and misfortunes and that these misfortunes should fall on the good The wicked replied Jesrad are always unhappy they serve to prove and try the small number of the just that are scattered through the earth and there is no evil that is not productive of some good But said Zadig suppose there were nothing but good and no evil at all Then replied Jesrad this earth would be another earth The chain of events would be ranged in another order and directed by wisdom but this other order which would be perfect can exist only in the eternal abode of the Supreme Being to which no evil can approach The Deity hath created millions of worlds among which there is not one that resembles another This immense variety is the effect of His immense power There are not two leaves among the trees of the earth nor two globes in the unlimited expanse of heaven that are exactly similar and all that thou seest on the little atom in which thou art born ought to be in its proper time and place according to the immutable decree of Him who comprehends all Men think that this child who hath just perished is fallen into the water by chance and that it is by the same chance that this house is burned but there is no such thing as chance all is either a trial or a punishment or a reward or a foresight Remember the fisherman who thought himself the most wretched of mankind Oromazes sent thee to change his fate Cease then frail mortal to dispute against what thou oughtest to adore But said Zadig as he pronounced the word But the angel took his flight toward the tenth sphere Zadig on his knees adored Providence and submitted The angel cried to him from on high Direct thy course toward Babylon THE ENIGMAS Zadig entranced as it were and like a man about whose head the thunder had burst walked at random He entered Babylon on the very day when those who had fought at the tournaments were assembled in the grand vestibule of the palace to explain the enigmas and to answer the questions of the grand magi All the knights were already arrived except the knight in green armor As soon as Zadig appeared in the city the people crowded round him every eye was fixed on him every mouth blessed him and every heart wished him the empire The envious man saw him pass he frowned and turned aside The people conducted him to the place where the assembly was held The queen who was informed of his arrival became a prey to the most violent agitations of hope and fear She was filled with anxiety and apprehension She could not comprehend why Zadig was without arms nor why Itobad wore the white armor A confused murmur arose at the sight of Zadig They were equally surprised and charmed to see him but none but the knights who had fought were permitted to appear in the assembly I have fought as well as the other knights said Zadig but another here wears my arms and while I wait for the honor of proving the truth of my assertion I demand the liberty of presenting myself to explain the enigmas The question was put to the vote and his reputation for probity was still so deeply impressed in their minds that they admitted him without scruple The first question proposed by the grand magi was What of all things in the world is the longest and the shortest the swiftest and the slowest the most divisible and the most extended the most neglected and the most regretted without which nothing can be done which devours all that is little and enlivens all that is great Itobad was to speak He replied that so great a man as he did not understand enigmas and that it was sufficient for him to have conquered by his strength and valor Some said that the meaning of the enigmas was Fortune some the Earth and others the Light Zadig said that it was Time Nothing added he is longer since it is the measure of eternity nothing is shorter since it is insufficient for the accomplishment of our projects nothing more slow to him that expects nothing more rapid to him that enjoys in greatness it extends to infinity in smallness it is infinitely divisible all men neglect it all regret the loss of it nothing can be done without it it consigns to oblivion whatever is unworthy of being transmitted to posterity and it immortalizes such actions as are truly great The assembly acknowledged that Zadig was in the right The next question was What is the thing which we receive without thanks which we enjoy without knowing how which we give to others when we know not where we are and which we lose without perceiving it Everyone gave his own explanation Zadig alone guessed that it was Life and explained all the other enigmas with the same facility Itobad always said that nothing was more easy and that he could have answered them with the same readiness had he chosen to have given himself the trouble Questions were then proposed on justice on the sovereign good and on the art of government Zadig s answers were judged to be the most solid What a pity is it said they that such a great genius should be so bad a knight Illustrious lords said Zadig I have had the honor of conquering in the tournaments It is to me that the white armor belongs Lord Itobad took possession of it during my sleep He probably thought that it would fit him better than the green I am now ready to prove in your presence with my gown and sword against all that beautiful white armor which he took from me that it is I who have had the honor of conquering the brave Otamus Itobad accepted the challenge with the greatest confidence He never doubted but what armed as he was with a helmet a cuirass and brassarts he would obtain an easy victory over a champion in a cap and nightgown Zadig drew his sword saluting the queen who looked at him with a mixture of fear and joy Itobad drew his without saluting anyone He rushed upon Zadig like a man who had nothing to fear he was ready to cleave him in two Zadig knew how to ward off his blows by opposing the strongest part of his sword to the weakest of that of his adversary in such a manner that Itobad s sword was broken Upon which Zadig seizing his enemy by the waist threw him on the ground and fixing the point of his sword at the breastplate Suffer thyself to be disarmed said he or thou art a dead man Itobad always surprised at the disgraces that happened to such a man as he was obliged to yield to Zadig who took from him with great composure his magnificent helmet his superb cuirass his fine brassarts his shining cuishes clothed himself with them and in this dress ran to throw himself at the feet of Astarte Cador easily proved that the armor belonged to Zadig He was acknowledged king by the unanimous consent of the whole nation and especially by that of Astarte who after so many calamities now tasted the exquisite pleasure of seeing her lover worthy in the eyes of all the world to be her husband Itobad went home to be called lord in his own house Zadig was king and was happy The queen and Zadig adored Providence He sent in search of the robber Arbogad to whom he gave an honorable post in his army promising to advance him to the first dignities if he behaved like a true warrior and threatening to hang him if he followed the profession of a robber Setoc with the fair Almona was called from the heart of Arabia and placed at the head of the commerce of Babylon Cador was preferred and distinguished according to his great services He was the friend of the king and the king was then the only monarch on earth that had a friend The little mute was not forgotten But neither could the beautiful Semira be comforted for having believed that Zadig would be blind of an eye nor did Azora cease to lament her having attempted to cut off his nose Their griefs however he softened by his presents The envious man died of rage and shame The empire enjoyed peace glory and plenty This was the happiest age of the earth it was governed by love and justice The people blessed Zadig and Zadig blessed Heaven PEDRO DE ALARCON The Nail I The thing which is most ardently desired by a man who steps into a stagecoach bent upon a long journey is that his companions may be agreeable that they may have the same tastes possibly the same vices be well educated and know enough not to be too familiar When I opened the door of the coach I felt fearful of encountering an old woman suffering with the asthma an ugly one who could not bear the smell of tobacco smoke one who gets seasick every time she rides in a carriage and little angels who are continually yelling and screaming for God knows what Sometimes you may have hoped to have a beautiful woman for a traveling companion for instance a widow of twenty or thirty years of age let us say thirty six whose delightful conversation will help you pass away the time But if you ever had this idea as a reasonable man you would quickly dismiss it for you know that such good fortune does not fall to the lot of the ordinary mortal These thoughts were in my mind when I opened the door of the stagecoach at exactly eleven o clock on a stormy night of the Autumn of eighteen forty four I had ticket No two and I was wondering who No one might be The ticket agent had assured me that No three had not been sold It was pitch dark within When I entered I said Good evening but no answer came The devil I said to myself Is my traveling companion deaf dumb or asleep Then I said in a louder tone Good evening but no answer came All this time the stagecoach was whirling along drawn by ten horses I was puzzled Who was my companion Was it a man Was it a woman Who was the silent No one and whoever it might be why did he or she not reply to my courteous salutation It would have been well to have lit a match but I was not smoking then and had none with me What should I do I concluded to rely upon my sense of feeling and stretched out my hand to the place where No one should have been wondering whether I would touch a silk dress or an overcoat but there was nothing there At that moment a flash of lightning herald of a quickly approaching storm lit up the night and I perceived that there was no one in the coach excepting myself I burst out into a roar of laughter and yet a moment later I could not help wondering what had become of No one A half hour later we arrived at the first stop and I was just about to ask the guard who flashed his lantern into the compartment why there was no No one when she entered In the yellow rays I thought it was a vision a pale graceful beautiful woman dressed in deep mourning Here was the fulfillment of my dream the widow I had hoped for I extended my hand to the unknown to assist her into the coach and she sat down beside me murmuring Thank you sir Good evening but in a tone that was so sad that it went to my very heart How unfortunate I thought There are only fifty miles between here and Malaga I wish to heaven this coach were going to Kamschatka The guard slammed the door and we were in darkness I wished that the storm would continue and that we might have a few more flashes of lightning But the storm didn t It fled away leaving only a few pallid stars whose light practically amounted to nothing I made a brave effort to start a conversation Do you feel well Are you going to Malaga Did you like the Alhambra You come from Granada Isn t the night damp To which questions she respectively responded Thanks very well Yes No sir Yes Awful It was quite certain that my traveling companion was not inclined to conversation I tried to think up something original to say to her but nothing occurred to me so I lost myself for the moment in meditation Why had this woman gotten on the stage at the first stop instead of at Granada Why was she alone Was she married Was she really a widow Why was she so sad I certainly had no right to ask her any of these questions and yet she interested me How I wished the sun would rise In the daytime one may talk freely but in the pitch darkness one feels a certain oppression it seems like taking an unfair advantage My unknown did not sleep a moment during the night I could tell this by her breathing and by her sighing It is probably unnecessary to add that I did not sleep either Once I asked her Do you feel ill and she replied No sir thank you I beg pardon if I have disturbed your sleep Sleep I exclaimed disdainfully I do not care to sleep I feared you were suffering Oh no she exclaimed in a voice that contradicted her words I am not suffering At last the sun rose How beautiful she was I mean the woman not the sun What deep suffering had lined her face and lurked in the depths of her beautiful eyes She was elegantly dressed and evidently belonged to a good family Every gesture bore the imprint of distinction She was the kind of a woman you expect to see in the principal box at the opera resplendent with jewels surrounded by admirers We breakfasted at Colmenar After that my companion became more confidential and I said to myself when we again entered the coach Philip you have met your fate It s now or never II I regretted the very first word I mentioned to her regarding my feelings She became a block of ice and I lost at once all that I might have gained in her good graces Still she answered me very kindly It is not because it is you sir who speak to me of love but love itself is something which I hold in horror But why dear lady I inquired Because my heart is dead Because I have loved to the point of delirium and I have been deceived I felt that I should talk to her in a philosophic way and there were a lot of platitudes on the tip of my tongue but I refrained I knew that she meant what she said When we arrived at Malaga she said to me in a tone I shall never forget as long as I live I thank you a thousand times for your kind attention during the trip and hope you will forgive me if I do not tell you my name and address Do you mean then that we shall not meet again Never And you especially should not regret it And then with a smile that was utterly without joy she extended her exquisite hand to me and said Pray to God for me I pressed her hand and made a low bow She entered a handsome victoria which was awaiting her and as it moved away she bowed to me again Two months later I met her again At two o clock in the afternoon I was jogging along in an old cart on the road that leads to Cordoba The object of my journey was to examine some land which I owned in that neighborhood and pass three or four weeks with one of the judges of the Supreme Court who was an intimate friend of mine and had been my schoolmate at the University of Granada He received me with open arms As I entered his handsome house I could but note the perfect taste and elegance of the furniture and decorations Ah Zarco I said you have married and you have never told me about it Surely this was not the way to treat a man who loved you as much as I do I am not married and what is more I never will marry answered the judge sadly I believe that you are not married dear boy since you say so but I cannot understand the declaration that you never will You must be joking I swear that I am telling you the truth he replied But what a metamorphosis I exclaimed You were always a partisan of marriage and for the past two years you have been writing to me and advising me to take a life partner Whence this wonderful change dear friend Something must have happened to you something unfortunate I fear To me answered the judge somewhat embarrassed Yes to you Something has happened and you are going to tell me all about it You live here alone have practically buried yourself in this great house Come tell me everything The judge pressed my hand Yes yes you shall know all There is no man more unfortunate than I am But listen this is the day upon which all the inhabitants go to the cemetery and I must be there if only for form s sake Come with me It is a pleasant afternoon and the walk will do you good after riding so long in that old cart The location of the cemetery is a beautiful one and I am quite sure you will enjoy the walk On our way I will tell you the incident that ruined my life and you shall judge yourself whether I am justified in my hatred of women As together we walked along the flower bordered road my friend told me the following story Two years ago when I was Assistant District Attorney in I obtained permission from my chief to spend a month in Sevilla In the hotel where I lodged there was a beautiful young woman who passed for a widow but whose origin as well as her reasons for staying in that town were a mystery to all Her installation her wealth her total lack of friends or acquaintances and the sadness of her expression together with her incomparable beauty gave rise to a thousand conjectures Her rooms were directly opposite mine and I frequently met her in the hall or on the stairway only too glad to have the chance of bowing to her She was unapproachable however and it was impossible for me to secure an introduction Two weeks later fate was to afford me the opportunity of entering her apartment I had been to the theater that night and when I returned to my room I thoughtlessly opened the door of her apartment instead of that of my own The beautiful woman was reading by the light of the lamp and started when she saw me I was so embarrassed by my mistake that for a moment I could only stammer unintelligible words My confusion was so evident that she could not doubt for a moment that I had made a mistake I turned to the door intent upon relieving her of my presence as quickly as possible when she said with the most exquisite courtesy In order to show you that I do not doubt your good faith and that I m not at all offended I beg that you will call upon me again intentionally Three days passed before I got up sufficient courage to accept her invitation Yes I was madly in love with her accustomed as I am to analyze my own sensations I knew that my passion could only end in the greatest happiness or the deepest suffering However at the end of the three days I went to her apartment and spent the evening there She told me that her name was Blanca that she was born in Madrid and that she was a widow She played and sang for me and asked me a thousand questions about myself my profession my family and every word she said increased my love for her From that night my soul was the slave of her soul yes and it will be forever I called on her again the following night and thereafter every afternoon and evening I was with her We loved each other but not a word of love had ever been spoken between us One evening she said to me I married a man without loving him Shortly after marriage I hated him Now he is dead Only God knows what I suffered Now I understand what love means it is either heaven or it is hell For me up to the present time it has been hell I could not sleep that night I lay awake thinking over these last words of Blanca s Somehow this woman frightened me Would I be her heaven and she my hell My leave of absence expired I could have asked for an extension pretending illness but the question was should I do it I consulted Blanca Why do you ask me she said taking my hand Because I love you Am I doing wrong in loving you No she said becoming very pale and then she put both arms about my neck and her beautiful lips touched mine Well I asked for another month and thanks to you dear friend it was granted Never would they have given it to me without your influence My relations with Blanca were more than love they were delirium madness fanaticism call it what you will Every day my passion for her increased and the morrow seemed to open up vistas of new happiness And yet I could not avoid feeling at times a mysterious indefinable fear And this I knew she felt as well as I did We both feared to lose one another One day I said to Blanca We must marry as quickly as possible She gave me a strange look You wish to marry me Yes Blanca I said I am proud of you I want to show you to the whole world I love you and I want you pure noble and saintly as you are I cannot marry you answered this incomprehensible woman She would never give a reason Finally my leave of absence expired and I told her that on the following day we must separate Separate It is impossible she exclaimed I love you too much for that But you know Blanca that I worship you Then give up your profession I am rich We will live our lives out together she said putting her soft hand over my mouth to prevent my answer I kissed the hand and then gently removing it I answered I would accept this offer from my wife although it would be a sacrifice for me to give up my career but I will not accept it from a woman who refuses to marry me Blanca remained thoughtful for several minutes then raising her head she looked at me and said very quietly but with a determination which could not be misunderstood I will be your wife and I do not ask you to give up your profession Go back to your office How long will it take you to arrange your business matters and secure from the government another leave of absence to return to Sevilla A month A month Well here I will await you Return within a month and I will be your wife To day is the fifteenth of April You will be here on the fifteenth of May You may rest assured of that You swear it I swear it You love me More than my life Go then and return Farewell I left on the same day The moment I arrived home I began to arrange my house to receive my bride As you know I solicited another leave of absence and so quickly did I arrange my business affairs that at the end of two weeks I was ready to return to Sevilla I must tell you that during this fortnight I did not receive a single letter from Blanca though I wrote her six I started at once for Sevilla arriving in that city on the thirtieth of April and went at once to the hotel where we had first met I learned that Blanca had left there two days after my departure without telling anyone her destination Imagine my indignation my disappointment my suffering She went away without even leaving a line for me without telling me whither she was going It never occurred to me to remain in Sevilla until the fifteenth of May to ascertain whether she would return on that date Three days later I took up my court work and strove to forget her A few moments after my friend Zarco finished the story we arrived at the cemetery This is only a small plot of ground covered with a veritable forest of crosses and surrounded by a low stone wall As often happens in Spain when the cemeteries are very small it is necessary to dig up one coffin in order to lower another Those thus disinterred are thrown in a heap in a corner of the cemetery where skulls and bones are piled up like a haystack As we were passing Zarco and I looked at the skulls wondering to whom they could have belonged to rich or poor noble or plebeian Suddenly the judge bent down and picking up a skull exclaimed in astonishment Look here my friend what is this It is surely a nail Yes a long nail had been driven in the top of the skull which he held in his hand The nail had been driven into the head and the point had penetrated what had been the roof of the mouth What could this mean He began to conjecture and soon both of us felt filled with horror I recognize the hand of Providence exclaimed the judge A terrible crime has evidently been committed and would never have come to light had it not been for this accident I shall do my duty and will not rest until I have brought the assassin to the scaffold III My friend Zarco was one of the keenest criminal judges in Spain Within a very few days he discovered that the corpse to which this skull belonged had been buried in a rough wooden coffin which the grave digger had taken home with him intending to use it for firewood Fortunately the man had not yet burned it up and on the lid the judge managed to decipher the initials A G R together with the date of interment He had at once searched the parochial books of every church in the neighborhood and a week later found the following entry In the parochial church of San Sebastian of the village of on the fourth of May eighteen forty three the funeral rites as prescribed by our holy religion were performed over the body of Don Alfonzo Gutierrez Romeral and he was buried in the cemetery He was a native of this village and did not receive the holy sacrament nor did he confess for he died suddenly of apoplexy at the age of thirty one He was married to Dona Gabriela Zahara del Valle a native of Madrid and left no issue him surviving The judge handed me the above certificate duly certified to by the parish priest and exclaimed Now everything is as clear as day and I am positive that within a week the assassin will be arrested The apoplexy in this case happens to be an iron nail driven into the man s head which brought quick and sudden death to A G R I have the nail and I shall soon find the hammer According to the testimony of the neighbors Senor Romeral was a young and rich landowner who originally came from Madrid where he had married a beautiful wife four months before the death of the husband his wife had gone to Madrid to pass a few months with her family the young woman returned home about the last day of April that is about three months and a half after she had left her husband s residence to go to Madrid the death of Senor Romeral occurred about a week after her return The shock caused to the widow by the sudden death of her husband was so great that she became ill and informed her friends that she could not continue to live in the same place where everything recalled to her the man she had lost and just before the middle of May she had left for Madrid ten or twelve days after the death of her husband The servants of the deceased had testified that the couple did not live amicably together and had frequent quarrels that the absence of three months and a half which preceded the last eight days the couple had lived together was practically an understanding that they were to be ultimately separated on account of mysterious disagreements which had existed between them from the date of their marriage that on the date of the death of the deceased both husband and wife were together in the former s bedroom that at midnight the bell was rung violently and they heard the cries of the wife that they rushed to the room and were met at the door by the wife who was very pale and greatly perturbed and she cried out An apoplexy Run for a doctor My poor husband is dying That when they entered the room they found their master lying upon a couch and he was dead The doctor who was called certified that Senor Romeral had died of cerebral congestion Three medical experts testified that death brought about as this one had been could not be distinguished from apoplexy The physician who had been called in had not thought to look for the head of the nail which was concealed by the hair of the victim nor was he in any sense to blame for this oversight The judge immediately issued a warrant for the arrest of Dona Gabriela Zahara del Valle widow of Senor Romeral Tell me I asked the judge one day do you think you will ever capture this woman I m positive of it Why Because in the midst of all these routine criminal affairs there occurs now and then what may be termed a dramatic fatality which never fails To put it in another way when the bones come out of the tomb to testify there is very little left for the judge to do In spite of the hopes of my friend Gabriela was not found and three months later she was according to the laws of Spain tried found guilty and condemned to death in her absence I returned home not without promising to be with Zarco the following year IV That winter I passed in Granada One evening I had been invited to a great ball given by a prominent Spanish lady As I was mounting the stairs of the magnificent residence I was startled by the sight of a face which was easily distinguishable even in this crowd of southern beauties It was she my unknown the mysterious woman of the stagecoach in fact No one of whom I spoke at the beginning of this narrative I made my way toward her extending my hand in greeting She recognized me at once Senora I said I have kept my promise not to search for you I did not know I would meet you here Had I suspected it I would have refrained from coming for fear of annoying you Now that I am here tell me whether I may recognize you and talk to you I see that you are vindictive she answered graciously putting her little hand in mine But I forgive you How are you In truth I don t know My health that is the health of my soul for you would not ask me about anything else in a ballroom depends upon the health of yours What I mean is that I could only be happy if you are happy May I ask if that wound of the heart which you told me about when I met you in the stagecoach has healed You know as well as I do that there are wounds which never heal With a graceful bow she turned away to speak to an acquaintance and I asked a friend of mine who was passing Can you tell me who that woman is A South American whose name is Mercedes de Meridanueva On the following day I paid a visit to the lady who was residing at that time at the Hotel of the Seven Planets The charming Mercedes received me as if I were an intimate friend and invited me to walk with her through the wonderful Alhambra and subsequently to dine with her During the six hours we were together she spoke of many things and as we always returned to the subject of disappointed love I felt impelled to tell her the experience of my friend Judge Zarco She listened to me very attentively and when I concluded she laughed and said Let this be a lesson to you not to fall in love with women whom you do not know Do not think for a moment I answered that I ve invented this story Oh I don t doubt the truth of it Perhaps there may be a mysterious woman in the Hotel of the Seven Planets of Granada and perhaps she doesn t resemble the one your friend fell in love with in Sevilla So far as I am concerned there is no risk of my falling in love with anyone for I never speak three times to the same man Senora That is equivalent to telling me that you refuse to see me again No I only wish to inform you that I leave Granada to morrow and it is probable that we will never meet again Never You told me that during our memorable ride in the stagecoach and you see that you are not a good prophet I noticed that she had become very pale She rose from the table abruptly saying Well let us leave that to Fate For my part I repeat that I am bidding you an eternal farewell She said these last words very solemnly and then with a graceful bow turned and ascended the stairway which led to the upper story of the hotel I confess that I was somewhat annoyed at the disdainful way in which she seemed to have terminated our acquaintance yet this feeling was lost in the pity I felt for her when I noted her expression of suffering We had met for the last time Would to God that it had been for the last time Man proposes but God disposes V A few days later business affairs brought me to the town wherein resided my friend Judge Zarco I found him as lonely and as sad as at the time of my last visit He had been able to find out nothing about Blanca but he could not forget her for a moment Unquestionably this woman was his fate his heaven or his hell as the unfortunate man was accustomed to saying We were soon to learn that his judicial superstition was to be fully justified The evening of the day of my arrival we were seated in his office reading the last reports of the police who had been vainly attempting to trace Gabriela when an officer entered and handed the judge a note which read as follows In the Hotel of the Lion there is a lady who wishes to speak to Judge Zarco Who brought this asked the judge A servant Who sent him He gave no name The judge looked thoughtfully at the smoke of his cigar for a few moments and then said A woman To see me I don t know why but this thing frightens me What do you think of it Philip That it is your duty as a judge to answer the call of course Perhaps she may be able to give you some information in regard to Gabriela You are right answered Zarco rising He put a revolver in his pocket threw his cloak over his shoulders and went out Two hours later he returned I saw at once by his face that some great happiness must have come to him He put his arms about me and embraced me convulsively exclaiming Oh dear friend if you only knew if you only knew But I don t know anything I answered What on earth has happened to you I m simply the happiest man in the world But what is it The note that called me to the hotel was from her But from whom From Gabriela Zahara Oh stop such nonsense Who is thinking of those things now It was she I tell you the other one In the name of heaven be calm and tell me whom you are talking about Who could it be but Blanca my love my life Blanca I answered with astonishment But the woman deceived you Oh no that was all a foolish mistake on my part Explain yourself Listen Blanca adores me Oh you think she does Well go on When Blanca and I separated on the fifteenth of April it was understood that we were to meet again on the fifteenth of May Shortly after I left she received a letter calling her to Madrid on urgent family business and she did not expect me back until the fifteenth of May so she remained in Madrid until the first But as you know I in my impatience could not wait and returned fifteen days before I had agreed and not finding her at the hotel I jumped to the conclusion that she had deceived me and I did not wait I have gone through two years of torment and suffering all due to my own stupidity But she could have written you a letter She said that she had forgotten the address Ah my poor friend I exclaimed I see that you are striving to convince yourself Well so much the better Now when does the marriage take place I suppose that after so long and dark a night the sun of matrimony will rise radiant Don t laugh exclaimed Zarco you shall be my best man With much pleasure Man proposes but God disposes We were still seated in the library chatting together when there came a knock at the door It was about two o clock in the morning The judge and I were both startled but we could not have told why The servant opened the door and a moment later a man dashed into the library so breathless from hard running that he could scarcely speak Good news judge grand news he said when he recovered breath We have won The man was the prosecuting attorney Explain yourself my dear friend said the judge motioning him to a chair What remarkable occurrence could have brought you hither in such haste and at this hour of the morning We have arrested Gabriela Zahara Arrested her exclaimed the judge joyfully Yes sir we have her One of our detectives has been following her for a month He has caught her and she is now locked up in a cell of the prison Then let us go there at once exclaimed the judge We will interrogate her to night Do me the favor to notify my secretary Owing to the gravity of the case you yourself must be present Also notify the guard who has charge of the head of Senor Romeral It has been my opinion from the beginning that this criminal woman would not dare deny the horrible murder when she was confronted with the evidence of her crime So far as you are concerned said the judge turning to me I will appoint you assistant secretary so that you can be present without violating the law I did not answer A horrible suspicion had been growing within me a suspicion which like some infernal animal was tearing at my heart with claws of steel Could Gabriela and Blanca be one and the same I turned to the assistant district attorney By the way I asked where was Gabriela when she was arrested In the Hotel of the Lion My suffering was frightful but I could say nothing do nothing without compromising the judge besides I was not sure Even if I were positive that Gabriela and Blanca were the same person what could my unfortunate friend do Feign a sudden illness Flee the country My only way was to keep silent and let God work it out in His own way The orders of the judge had already been communicated to the chief of police and the warden of the prison Even at this hour the news had spread throughout the city and idlers were gathering to see the rich and beautiful woman who would ascend the scaffold I still clung to the slender hope that Gabriela and Blanca were not the same person But when I went toward the prison I staggered like a drunken man and was compelled to lean upon the shoulder of one of the officials who asked me anxiously if I were ill VI We arrived at the prison at four o clock in the morning The large reception room was brilliantly lighted The guard holding a black box in which was the skull of Senor Romeral was awaiting us The judge took his seat at the head of the long table the prosecuting attorney sat on his right and the chief of police stood by with his arms folded I and the secretary sat on the left of the judge A number of police officers and detectives were standing near the door The judge touched his bell and said to the warden Bring in Dona Gabriela Zahara I felt as if I were dying and instead of looking at the door I looked at the judge to see if I could read in his face the solution of this frightful problem I saw him turn livid and clutch his throat with both hands as if to stop a cry of agony and then he turned to me with a look of infinite supplication Keep quiet I whispered putting my finger on my lips and then I added I knew it The unfortunate man arose from his chair Judge I exclaimed and in that one word I conveyed to him the full sense of his duty and of the dangers which surrounded him He controlled himself and resumed his seat but were it not for the light in his eyes he might have been taken for a dead man Yes the man was dead only the judge lived When I had convinced myself of this I turned and looked at the accused Good God Gabriela Zahara was not only Blanca the woman my friend so deeply loved but she was also the woman I had met in the stagecoach and subsequently at Granada the beautiful South American Mercedes All these fantastic women had now merged into one the real one who stood before us accused of the murder of her husband and who had been condemned to die There was still a chance to prove herself innocent Could she do it This was my one supreme hope as it was that of my poor friend Gabriela we will call her now by her real name was deathly pale but apparently calm Was she trusting to her innocence or to the weakness of the judge Our doubts were soon solved Up to that moment the accused had looked at no one but the judge I did not know whether she desired to encourage him or menace him or to tell him that his Blanca could not be an assassin But noting the impassibility of the magistrate and that his face was as expressionless as that of a corpse she turned to the others as if seeking help from them Then her eyes fell upon me and she blushed slightly The judge now seemed to awaken from his stupor and asked in a harsh voice What is your name Gabriela Zahara widow of Romeral answered the accused in a soft voice Zarco trembled He had just learned that his Blanca had never existed she told him so herself she who only three hours before had consented to become his wife Fortunately no one was looking at the judge all eyes being fixed upon Gabriela whose marvelous beauty and quiet demeanor carried to all an almost irresistible conviction of her innocence The judge recovered himself and then like a man who is staking more than life upon the cast of a die he ordered the guard to open the black box Madame said the judge sternly his eyes seeming to dart flames approach and tell me whether you recognize this head At a signal from the judge the guard opened the black box and lifted out the skull A cry of mortal agony rang through that room one could not tell whether it was of fear or of madness The woman shrank back her eyes dilating with terror and screamed Alfonzo Alfonzo Then she seemed to fall into a stupor All turned to the judge murmuring She is guilty beyond a doubt Do you recognize the nail which deprived your husband of life said the judge arising from his chair looking like a corpse rising from the grave Yes sir answered Gabriela mechanically That is to say you admit that you assassinated your husband asked the judge in a voice that trembled with his great suffering Sir answered the accused I do not care to live any more but before I die I would like to make a statement The judge fell back in his chair and then asked me by a look What is she going to say I myself was almost stupefied by fear Gabriela stood before them her hands clasped and a far away look in her large dark eyes I am going to confess she said and my confession will be my defense although it will not be sufficient to save me from the scaffold Listen to me all of you Why deny that which is self evident I was alone with my husband when he died The servants and the doctor have testified to this Hence only I could have killed him Yes I committed the crime but another man forced me to do it The judge trembled when he heard these words but dominating his emotion he asked courageously The name of that man madame Tell us at once the name of the scoundrel Gabriela looked at the judge with an expression of infinite love as a mother would look at the child she worshiped and answered By a single word I could drag this man into the depths with me But I will not No one shall ever know his name for he has loved me and I love him Yes I love him although I know he will do nothing to save me The judge half rose from his chair and extended his hands beseechingly but she looked at him as if to say Be careful You will betray yourself and it will do no good He sank back into his chair and Gabriela continued her story in a quiet firm voice I was forced to marry a man I hated I hated him more after I married him than I did before I lived three years in martyrdom One day there came into my life a man whom I loved He demanded that I should marry him he asked me to fly with him to a heaven of happiness and love He was a man of exceptional character high and noble whose only fault was that he loved me too much Had I told him I have deceived you I am not a widow my husband is living he would have left me at once I invented a thousand excuses but he always answered Be my wife What could I do I was bound to a man of the vilest character and habits whom I loathed Well I killed this man believing that I was committing an act of justice and God punished me for my lover abandoned me And now I am very very tired of life and all I ask of you is that death may come as quickly as possible Gabriela stopped speaking The judge had buried his face in his hands as if he were thinking but I could see he was shaking like an epileptic Your honor repeated Gabriela grant my request that I may die soon The judge made a sign to the guards to remove the prisoner Before she followed them she gave me a terrible look in which there was more of pride than of repentance I do not wish to enter into details of the condition of the judge during the following day In the great emotional struggle which took place the officer of the law conquered the man and he confirmed the sentence of death On the following day the papers were sent to the Court of Appeals and then Zarco came to me and said Wait here until I return Take care of this unfortunate woman but do not visit her for your presence would humiliate instead of consoling her Do not ask me whither I am going and do not think that I am going to commit the very foolish act of taking my own life Farewell and forgive me all the worry I have caused you Twenty days later the Court of Appeals confirmed the sentence and Gabriela Zahara was placed in the death cell The morning of the day fixed for the execution came and still the judge had not returned The scaffold had been erected in the center of the square and an enormous crowd had gathered I stood by the door of the prison for while I had obeyed the wish of my friend that I should not call on Gabriela in her prison I believed it my duty to represent him in that supreme moment and accompany the woman he had loved to the foot of the scaffold When she appeared surrounded by her guards I hardly recognized her She had grown very thin and seemed hardly to have the strength to lift to her lips the small crucifix she carried in her hand I am here senora Can I be of service to you I asked her as she passed by me She raised her deep sunken eyes to mine and when she recognized me she exclaimed Oh thanks thanks This is a great consolation for me in my last hour of life Father she added turning to the priest who stood beside her may I speak a few words to this generous friend Yes my daughter answered the venerable minister Then Gabriela asked me Where is he He is absent May God bless him and make him happy When you see him ask him to forgive me even as I believe God has already forgiven me Tell him I love him yet although this love is the cause of my death We had arrived at the foot of the scaffold stairway where I was compelled to leave her A tear perhaps the last one there was in that suffering heart rolled down her cheek Once more she said Tell him that I died blessing him Suddenly there came a roar like that of thunder The mass of people swayed shouted danced laughed like maniacs and above all this tumult one word rang out clearly Pardoned Pardoned At the entrance to the square appeared a man on horseback galloping madly toward the scaffold In his hand he waved a white handkerchief and his voice rang high above the clamor of the crowd Pardoned Pardoned It was the judge Reining up his foaming horse at the foot of the scaffold he extended a paper to the chief of police Gabriela who had already mounted some of the steps turned and gave the judge a look of infinite love and gratitude God bless you she exclaimed and then fell senseless As soon as the signatures and seals upon the document had been verified by the authorities the priest and the judge rushed to the accused to undo the cords which bound her hands and arms and to revive her All their efforts were useless however Gabriela Zahara was dead LUIGI CAPUANA The Deposition I know nothing at all about it your honor Nothing at all How can that be It all happened within fifty yards of your shop Nothing at all I said in an off hand way but really next to nothing I am a barber your honor and Heaven be praised I have custom enough to keep me busy from morning till night There are three of us in the shop and what with shaving and combing and hair cutting not one of the three has the time to stop and scratch his head and I least of all Many of my customers are so kind as to prefer my services to those of my two young men perhaps because I amuse them with my little jokes And what with lathering and shaving this face and that and combing the hair on so many heads how does your honor expect me to pay attention to other people s affairs And the morning that I read about it in the paper why I stood there with my mouth wide open and I said Well that was the way it was bound to end Why did you say That was the way it was bound to end Why because it had ended that way You see on the instant I called to mind the ugly face of the husband Every time I saw him pass up or down the street one of those impressions that no one can account for I used to think That fellow has the face of a convict But of course that proves nothing There are plenty who have the bad luck to be uglier than mortal sin but very worthy people all the same But in this case I didn t think that I was mistaken But you were friends He used to come very often and sit down at the entrance to your barber shop Very often Only once in a while your honor By your leave neighbor he would say He always called me neighbor that was his name for everyone And I would say Why certainly The chair stood there empty Your honor understands that I could hardly be so uncivil as to say to him No you can t sit down A barber shop is a public place like a cafe or a beer saloon At all events one may sit down without paying for it and no need to have a shave or hair cut either By your leave neighbor and there he would sit in silence smoking and scowling with his eyes half shut He would loaf there for half an hour an hour sometimes longer He annoyed me I don t deny it from the very start There was a good deal of talk What sort of talk A good deal of talk Your honor knows better than I how evil minded people are I make it a practice not to believe a syllable of what I am told about anyone good or evil that is the way to keep out of trouble Come come what sort of talk Keep to the point What sort of talk Why one day they would say this and the next day they would say that and by harping on it long enough they made themselves believe that the wife Well your honor knows that a pretty wife is a chastisement of God And after all there are some things that you can t help seeing unless you won t see Then it was he the husband I know nothing about it your honor nothing at all But it is quite true that every time he came and sat down by my doorway or inside the shop I used to say to myself If that man can t see he certainly must be blind and if he won t see he certainly must be Your honor knows what I mean There was certainly no getting out of that out of that Perhaps your honor can help me to the right word Dilemma Dilemma yes your honor And Biasi the notary who comes to me to be shaved uses another word that just fits the case begging your honor s pardon Then according to you this Don Nicasio Oh I won t put my finger in the pie Let him answer for himself Everyone has a conscience of his own and Jesus Christ has said Judge not lest ye be judged Well one morning or was it in the evening I don t exactly remember yes now it comes back to me that it was in the morning I saw him pass by scowling and with his head bent down I was in my doorway sharpening a razor Out of curiosity I gave him a passing word as well as a nod adding a gesture that was as good as a question He came up to me looked me straight in the face and answered Haven t I told you that sooner or later I should do something crazy And I shall neighbor yes I shall They are dragging me by the hair Let me cut it off then I answered jokingly to make him forget himself So he had told you before had he How did he happen to tell you before Oh your honor knows how words slip out of the mouth at certain moments Who pays attention to them For my part I have too many other things in my head Come come what had he been talking about when he told you before Great heavens give me time to think your honor What had he been talking about Why about his wife of course Who knows Some one must have put a flea in his ear It needs only half a word to ruin a poor devil s peace of mind And that is how a man lets such words slip out of his mouth as Sooner or later I shall do something crazy That is all I know nothing else about it your honor And the only answer you made him was a joke I could not say to him Go ahead and do it could I As it was he went off shaking his head And what idea he kept brooding over after that who knows One can t see inside of another man s brain But sometimes when I heard him freeing his mind Then he used to free his mind to you Why yes to me and maybe to others besides You see one bears things and bears things and bears things and at last rather than burst with them one frees one s mind to the first man who comes along But you were not the first man who came along You used to call at his house Only as a barber your honor Only when Don Nicasio used to send for me And very often I would get there too late though I tried my best And very likely you sometimes went there when you knew that he was not at home On purpose your honor No never And when you found his wife alone you allowed yourself Calumnies your honor Who dares say such a thing Does she say so It may be that once or twice a few words escaped me in jest You know how it is when I found myself face to face with a pretty woman you know how it is if only not to cut a foolish figure But it was very far from a joke You ended by threatening her What calumnies Threaten her What for A woman of her stamp doesn t need to be threatened I would never have stooped so low I am no schoolboy Passion leads men into all sorts of folly That woman is capable of anything She would slander our Lord himself to His face Passion I At my age I am well on in the forties your honor and many a gray hair besides Many a folly I committed in my youth like everyone else But now Besides with a woman like that I was no blind man even if Don Nicasio was I knew that that young fellow poor fool he paid dearly for her I knew that he had turned her head That s the way with some women they go their own gait they re off with one and on with another and then they end by becoming the slave of some scalawag who robs and abuses them He used to beat her your honor many and many a time your honor And I for the sake of the poor husband whom I pitied Yes that is why she says that I threatened her She says so because I was foolish enough to go and give her a talking to the day that Don Nicasio said to me I shall do something crazy She knew what I meant at least she pretended that she did No this was what you said Yes your honor I remember now exactly what I said I ll spoil your sport I told her if it sends me to the galleys but I was speaking in the name of the husband In the heat of the moment one falls into a part The husband knew nothing of all this Was I to boast to him of what I had done A friend either gives his services or else he doesn t That is how I understand it Why were you so much concerned about it I ought not to have been your honor I have too soft a heart Your threats became troublesome And not threats alone but promise after promise And gifts besides a ring and a pair of earrings That is true I won t deny it I found them in my pocket quite by chance They belonged to my wife It was an extravagance but I did it to keep poor Don Nicasio from doing something crazy If I could only win my point I told myself if I could only get that young fellow out of the way then it would be time enough to say to Don Nicasio My friend give me back my ring and my earrings He would not have needed to be told twice He is an honorable man Don Nicasio But when she answered you Keep them yourself I don t want them you began to beg her almost in tears Ah your honor since you must be told I don t know how I managed to control myself I had so completely put myself in the place of the husband I could have strangled her with my own hands I could have done that very same crazy thing that Don Nicasio thought of doing Yet you were very prudent that is evident You said to yourself If not for me then not for him The lover I mean not Don Nicasio And you began to work upon the husband who up to that time had let things slide either because he did not believe or else because he preferred to bear the lesser evil It may be that some chance word escaped me There are times when a man of honor loses his head but beyond that nothing your honor Don Nicasio himself will bear me witness But Don Nicasio says He too Has he failed me Has he turned against me A fine way to show his gratitude He has nothing to be grateful for Don t excite yourself Sit down again You began by protesting that you knew nothing at all about it And yet you knew so many things You must know quite a number more Don t excite yourself You want to drag me over a precipice your honor I begin to understand Men who are blinded by passion walk over precipices on their own feet But then your honor imagines that I myself I imagine nothing It is evident that you were the instigator and something more than the instigator too Calumny calumny your honor That same evening you were seen talking with the husband until quite late I was trying to persuade him not to I said to him Let things alone Since it is your misfortune to have it so what difference does it make whether he is the one or somebody else And he kept repeating Somebody else yes but not that rotten beast His very words your honor You stood at the corner of the adjoining street lying in wait Who saw me there Who saw us your honor You were seen Come make up your mind to tell all you know It will be better for you The woman testifies There were two of them but in the dark she could not recognize the other one Just because I wanted to do a kind act This is what I have brought on myself by trying to do a kind act You stood at the street corner It was like this your honor I had gone with him as far as that But when I saw that it was no use to try to stop him it was striking eleven the streets were deserted I started to leave him indignantly without a parting word Well what next Do I need tongs to drag the words out of your mouth What next Why your honor knows how it is at night under the lamplight You see and then you don t see that s the way it is I turned around Don Nicasio had plunged through the doorway of his home just by the entrance to the little lane A cry then nothing more You ran forward That was quite natural I hesitated on the threshold the hallway was so dark You couldn t have done that The woman would have recognized you by the light of the street lamp The lamp is some distance off You went in one after the other Which of you shut the door Because the door was shut immediately In the confusion of the moment two men struggling together I could hear them gasping I wanted to call for help then a fall And then I felt myself seized by the arm Run neighbor run This is no business of yours It didn t sound like the voice of a human being And that was how that was how I happened to be there a helpless witness I think that Don Nicasio meant to kill his wife too but the wretched woman escaped She ran and shut herself up in her room That is I read so afterwards in the papers The husband would have been wiser to have killed her first Evil weeds had better be torn up by the roots What are you having that man write your honor Nothing at all as you call it Just your deposition The clerk will read it to you now and you will sign it Can any harm come to me from it I am innocent I have only said what you wanted to make me say You have tangled me up in a fine net like a little fresh water fish Wait a moment And this is the most important thing of all How did it happen that the mortal wounds on the dead man s body were made with a razor Oh the treachery of Don Nicasio My God My God Yes your honor Two days before no one can think of everything no one can foresee everything he came to the shop and said to me Neighbor lend me a razor I have a corn that is troubling me He was so matter of fact about it that I did not hesitate for an instant I even warned him Be careful you can t joke with corns A little blood and you may start a cancer Don t borrow trouble neighbor he answered But the razor could not be found You must have brought it away I Who would remember a little thing like that I was more dead than alive your honor Where are you trying to lead me with your questions I tell you I am innocent Do not deny so obstinately A frank confession will help you far more than to protest your innocence The facts speak clearly enough It is well known how passion maddens the heart and the brain A man in that state is no longer himself That is the truth your honor That wretched woman bewitched me She is sending me to the galleys The more she said No no no the more I felt myself going mad from head to foot as if she were pouring fire over me with her No no no But now I do not want another man to suffer in my place Yes I was the one I was the one who killed him I was bewitched your honor I am willing to go to the galleys But I am coming back here if I have the good luck to live through my term Oh the justice of this world To think that she goes scot free the real and only cause of all the harm But I will see that she gets justice that I solemnly swear with these two hands of mine your honor In prison I shall think of nothing else And if I come back and find her alive grown old and ugly it makes no difference she will have to pay for it she will have to make good Ah no no no But I will say Yes yes yes And I will drain her last drop of blood if I have to end my days in the galleys And the sooner the better LUCIUS APULEIUS The Adventure of the Three Robbers The great satire of Lucius Apuleius the work through which his name lives after the lapse of nearly eighteen centuries is The Golden Ass a romance from which the following passage has been selected and translated for these Mystery Stories Lucius the personage who tells the story is regarded in some quarters as a portrayal of the author himself The purpose of The Golden Ass was to satirize false priests and other contemporary frauds But interspersed are many episodes of adventure and strange situations one of which is here given As Telephron reached the point of his story his fellow revelers befuddled with their wine renewed the boisterous uproar And while the old topers were clamoring for the customary libation to laughter Byrrhaena explained to me that the morrow was a day religiously observed by her city from its cradle up a day on which they alone among mortals propitiated that most sacred god Laughter with hilarious and joyful rites The fact that you are here she added will make it all the merrier And I do wish that you would contribute something amusing out of your own cleverness in honor of the god to help us duly worship such an important divinity Surely said I what you ask shall be done And by Jove I hope I shall hit upon something good enough to make this mighty god of yours reveal his presence Hereupon my slave reminding me what hour of night it was I speedily got upon my feet although none too steadily after my potations and having duly taken leave of Byrrhaena guided my zigzag steps upon the homeward way But at the very first corner we turned a sudden gust of wind blew out the solitary torch on which we depended and left us plunged in the unforeseen blackness of night to stumble wearily and painfully to our abode bruising our feet on every stone in the road But when at last holding each other up we drew near our goal there ahead of us were three others of big and brawny build expending the full energy of their strength upon our doorposts And far from being in the least dismayed by our arrival they seemed only fired to a greater zeal and made assault more fiercely Quite naturally it seemed clear to us both and especially to me that they were robbers and of the most dangerous sort So I forthwith drew the blade which I carry hidden under my cloak for such emergencies and threw myself undismayed into the midst of these highwaymen One after another as they successively tried to withstand me I ran them through until finally all three lay stretched at my feet riddled with many a gaping wound through which they yielded up their breath By this time Fotis the maid had been aroused by the din of battle and still panting and perspiring freely I slipped in through the opening door and as weary as though I had fought with the three formed Geryon instead of those pugnacious thieves I yielded myself at one and the same moment to bed and to slumber Soon rosy fingered Dawn shaking the purple reins was guiding her steeds across the path of heaven and snatched from my untroubled rest night gave me back to day Dismay seized my soul at the recollection of my deeds of the past evening I sat there crouching on my bed with my interlaced fingers hugging my knees and freely gave way to my distress I already saw in fancy the court the jury the verdict the executioner How could I hope to find any judge so mild so benevolent as to pronounce me innocent soiled as I was with a triple murder stained with the blood of so many citizens Was this the glorious climax of my travels that the Chaldean Diophanes had so confidently predicted for me Again and again I went over the whole matter bewailing my hard lot Hereupon there came a pounding at our doors and a steadily growing clamor on the threshold No sooner was admission given than with an impetuous rush the whole house was filled with magistrates police and the motley crowd that followed Two officers by order of the magistrates promptly laid hands upon me and started to drag me off though resistance was the last thing I should have thought of By the time we had reached the first cross street the entire city was already trailing at our heels in an astonishingly dense mass And I marched gloomily along with my head hanging down to the very earth I might even say to the lower regions below the earth At length after having made the circuit of every city square in exactly the way that the victims are led around before a sacrifice meant to ward off evil omens I was brought into the forum and made to confront the tribunal of justice The magistrates had taken their seats upon the raised platform the court crier had commanded silence when suddenly everyone present as if with one voice protested that in so vast a gathering there was danger from the dense crowding and demanded that a case of such importance should be tried instead in the public theater No sooner said than the entire populace streamed onward helter skelter and in a marvelously short time had packed the whole auditorium till every aisle and gallery was one solid mass Many swarmed up the columns others dangled from the statues while a few there were that perched half out of sight on window ledges and cornices but all in their amazing eagerness seemed quite careless how far they risked their lives After the manner of a sacrifice I was led by the public officials down the middle of the stage and was left standing in the midst of the orchestra Once more the voice of the court crier boomed forth calling for the prosecutor whereupon a certain old man arose and having first taken a small vase the bottom of which ended in a narrow funnel and having filled it with water which escaping drop by drop should mark the length of his speech addressed the populace as follows This is no trivial case most honored citizens but one which directly concerns the peace of our entire city and one which will be handed down as a weighty precedent Wherefore your individual and common interests equally demand that you should sustain the dignity of the State and not permit this brutal murderer to escape the penalty of the wholesale butchery that resulted from his bloody deeds And do not think that I am influenced by any private motives or giving vent to personal animosity For I am in command of the night watch and up to this time I think there is no one who will question my watchful diligence Accordingly I will state the case and faithfully set forth the events of last night It was about the hour of the third watch and I was making my round of the entire city going from door to door with scrupulous vigilance when suddenly I beheld this bloodthirsty young man sword in hand spreading carnage around him already no less than three victims of his savagery lay writhing at his feet gasping forth their breath in a pool of blood Stricken as well he might be with the guilt of so great a crime the fellow fled and slipping into one of the houses under cover of the darkness lay hidden the rest of the night But thanks to the gods who permit no sinner to go unpunished I forestalled him at daybreak before he could make his escape by secret ways and have brought him here for trial before your sacred tribunal of justice The prisoner at the bar is a threefold murderer he was taken in the very act and furthermore he is a foreigner Accordingly it is your plain duty to return a verdict of guilty against this man from a strange land for a crime which you would severely punish even in the case of one of your own citizens Having thus spoken the remorseless prosecutor suspended his vindictive utterance and the court crier straightway ordered me to begin my defense if I had any to make At first I could not sufficiently control my voice to speak although less overcome alas by the harshness of the accusation than by my own guilty conscience But at last miraculously inspired with courage I made answer as follows I realize how hard it is for a man accused of murder and confronted with the bodies of three of your citizens to persuade so large a multitude of his innocence even though he tells the exact truth and voluntarily admits the facts But if in mercy you will give me an attentive hearing I shall easily make clear to you that far from deserving to be put on trial for my life I have wrongfully incurred the heavy stigma of such a crime as the chance result of justifiable indignation I was making my way home from a dinner party at a rather late hour after drinking pretty freely I won t attempt to deny for that was the head and front of my offense when lo and behold before the very doors of my abode before the home of the good Milo your fellow citizen I beheld a number of villainous thieves trying to effect an entrance and already prying the doors off from the twisted hinges All the locks and bolts so carefully closed for the night had been wrenched away and the thieves were planning the slaughter of the inmates Finally one of them bigger and more active than the rest urged them to action with these words Come on boys Show the stuff you are made of and strike for all you are worth while they are asleep No quarter now no faint hearted weakening Let death go through the house with drawn sword If you find any in bed slit their throats before they wake if any try to resist cut them down Our only chance of getting away safe and sound is to leave no one else safe and sound in the whole house I confess citizens that I was badly frightened both on account of my hosts and myself and believing that I was doing the duty of a good citizen I drew the sword which always accompanies me in readiness for such dangers and started in to drive away or lay low those desperate robbers But the barbarous and inhuman villains far from being frightened away had the audacity to stand against me although they saw that I was armed Their serried ranks opposed me Next the leader and standard bearer of the band assailing me with brawny strength seized me with both hands by the hair and bending me backward prepared to beat out my brains with a paving stone but while he was still shouting for one with an unerring stroke I luckily ran him through and stretched him at my feet Before long a second stroke aimed between the shoulders finished off another of them as he clung tooth and nail to my legs while the third one as he rashly advanced I stabbed full in the chest Since I had fought on the side of law and order in defense of public safety and my host s home I felt myself not only without blame but deserving of public praise I have never before been charged with even the slightest infringement of the law I enjoy a high reputation among my own people and all my life have valued a clear conscience above all material possessions Nor can I understand why I should suffer this prosecution for having taken a just vengeance upon those worthless thieves since no one can show that there had ever before been any enmity between us or for that matter that I had ever had any previous acquaintance with the thieves You have not even established any motive for which I may be supposed to have committed so great a crime At this point my emotion again overcame me and with my hands extended in entreaty I turned from one to another beseeching them to spare me in the name of common humanity for the sake of all that they held dear I thought by this time they must be moved to pity thrilled with sympathy for my wretchedness accordingly I called to witness the Eye of Justice and the Light of Day and intrusted my case to the providence of God when lifting up my eyes I discovered that the whole assembly was convulsed with laughter not excepting my own kind host and relative Milo who was shaking with merriment So much for friendship I thought to myself so much for gratitude In protecting my host I have become a murderer on trial for my life while he far from raising a finger to help me makes a mock of my misery At this moment a woman clad in black rushed down the center of the stage weeping and wailing and clasping a small child to her breast An older woman covered with rags and similarly shaken with sobs followed her both of them waving olive branches as they passed around the bier on which lay the covered bodies of the slain and lifted up their voices in mournful outcry For the sake of common humanity they wailed by all the universal laws of justice be moved to pity by the undeserved death of these young men Give to a lonely wife and mother the comfort of vengeance Come to the aid of this unhappy child left fatherless in his tender years and offer up the blood of the assassin at the shrine of law and order Hereupon the presiding magistrate arose and addressed the people The crime for which the prisoner will later pay the full penalty not even he attempts to deny But still another duty remains to be performed and that is to find out who were his accomplices in this wicked deed since it does not seem likely that one man alone could have overcome three others so young and strong as these We must apply torture to extract the truth and since the slave who accompanied him has made his escape there is no other alternative left us than to wring the names of his companions from the prisoner himself in order that we may effectually relieve the public of all apprehension of danger from this desperate gang Immediately in accordance with the Greek usage fire and the wheel were brought forth together with all the other instruments of torture Now indeed my distress was not only increased but multiplied when I saw that I was fated to perish piecemeal But at this point the old woman whose noisy lamentations had become a nuisance broke out with this demand Honored citizens before you proceed to torture the prisoner on account of the dear ones whom he has taken from me will you not permit the bodies of the deceased to be uncovered in order that the sight of their youth and beauty may fire you with a righteous anger and a severity proportioned to the crime These words were received with applause and straightway the magistrate commanded that I myself should with my own hand draw off the covering from the bodies lying on the bier In spite of my struggles and desperate determination not to look again upon the consequences of my last night s deed the court attendants promptly dragged me forward in obedience to the judge s order and bending my arm by main force from its place at my side stretched it out above the three corpses Conquered in the struggle I yielded to necessity and much against my will drew down the covering and exposed the bodies Great heavens what a sight What a miracle What a transformation in my whole destiny I had already begun to look upon myself as a vassal of Proserpine a bondsman of Hades and now I could only gasp in impotent amazement at the suddenness of the change words fail me to express fittingly the astounding metamorphosis For the bodies of my butchered victims were nothing more nor less than three inflated bladders whose sides still bore the scars of numerous punctures which as I recalled my battle of the previous night were situated at the very points where I had inflicted gaping wounds upon my adversaries Hereupon the hilarity which up to this point had been fairly held in check swept through the crowd like a conflagration Some gave themselves up helplessly to an unrestrained extravagance of merriment others did their best to control themselves holding their aching sides with both hands And having all laughed until they could laugh no more they passed out of the theater their backward glances still centered upon me From the moment that I had drawn down that funeral pall I stood fixed as if frozen into stone as powerless to move as anyone of the theater s statues or columns Nor did I come out of my stupor until Milo my host himself approached and clapping me on the shoulder drew me away with gentle violence my tears now flowing freely and sobs choking my voice He led me back to the house by a roundabout way through the least frequented streets doing his best meanwhile to soothe my nerves and heal my wounded feelings But nothing he could say availed to lessen my bitter indignation at having been made so undeservedly ridiculous But all at once the magistrates themselves still wearing their insignia of office arrived at the house and made personal amends in the following words We are well aware Master Lucius both of your own high merit and that of your family for the renown of your name extends throughout the land Accordingly you must understand that the treatment which you so keenly resent was in no sense intended as an insult Therefore banish your present gloomy mood and dismiss all anger from your mind For the festival which we solemnly celebrate with each returning year in honor of the God of Laughter must always depend upon novelty for its success And so our god who owes you so great a debt to day decrees that his favoring presence shall follow you wherever you go and that your cheerful countenance shall everywhere be a signal for hilarity The whole city out of gratitude bestows upon you exceptional honors enrolling your name as one of its patrons and decreeing that your likeness in bronze shall be erected as a perpetual memorial of to day PLINY THE YOUNGER Letter to Sura Our leisure furnishes me with the opportunity of learning from you and you with that of instructing me Accordingly I particularly wish to know whether you think there exist such things as phantoms possessing an appearance peculiar to themselves and a certain supernatural power or that mere empty delusions receive a shape from our fears For my part I am led to believe in their existence especially by what I hear happened to Curtius Rufus While still in humble circumstances and obscure he was a hanger on in the suite of the Governor of Africa While pacing the colonnade one afternoon there appeared to him a female form of superhuman size and beauty She informed the terrified man that she was Africa and had come to foretell future events for that he would go to Rome would fill offices of state there and would even return to that same province with the highest powers and die in it All which things were fulfilled Moreover as he touched at Carthage and was disembarking from his ship the same form is said to have presented itself to him on the shore It is certain that being seized with illness and auguring the future from the past and misfortune from his previous prosperity he himself abandoned all hope of life though none of those about him despaired Is not the following story again still more appalling and not less marvelous I will relate it as it was received by me There was at Athens a mansion spacious and commodious but of evil repute and dangerous to health In the dead of night there was a noise as of iron and if you listened more closely a clanking of chains was heard first of all from a distance and afterwards hard by Presently a specter used to appear an ancient man sinking with emaciation and squalor with a long beard and bristly hair wearing shackles on his legs and fetters on his hands and shaking them Hence the inmates by reason of their fears passed miserable and horrible nights in sleeplessness This want of sleep was followed by disease and their terrors increasing by death For in the daytime as well though the apparition had departed yet a reminiscence of it flitted before their eyes and their dread outlived its cause The mansion was accordingly deserted and condemned to solitude was entirely abandoned to the dreadful ghost However it was advertised on the chance of some one ignorant of the fearful curse attached to it being willing to buy or to rent it Athenodorus the philosopher came to Athens and read the advertisement When he had been informed of the terms which were so low as to appear suspicious he made inquiries and learned the whole of the particulars Yet none the less on that account nay all the more readily did he rent the house As evening began to draw on he ordered a sofa to be set for himself in the front part of the house and called for his notebooks writing implements and a light The whole of his servants he dismissed to the interior apartments and for himself applied his soul eyes and hand to composition that his mind might not from want of occupation picture to itself the phantoms of which he had heard or any empty terrors At the commencement there was the universal silence of night Soon the shaking of irons and the clanking of chains was heard yet he never raised his eyes nor slackened his pen but hardened his soul and deadened his ears by its help The noise grew and approached now it seemed to be heard at the door and next inside the door He looked round beheld and recognized the figure he had been told of It was standing and signaling to him with its finger as though inviting him He in reply made a sign with his hand that it should wait a moment and applied himself afresh to his tablets and pen Upon this the figure kept rattling its chains over his head as he wrote On looking round again he saw it making the same signal as before and without delay took up a light and followed it It moved with a slow step as though oppressed by its chains and after turning into the courtyard of the house vanished suddenly and left his company On being thus left to himself he marked the spot with some grass and leaves which he plucked Next day he applied to the magistrates and urged them to have the spot in question dug up There were found there some bones attached to and intermingled with fetters the body to which they had belonged rotted away by time and the soil had abandoned them thus naked and corroded to the chains They were collected and interred at the public expense and the house was ever afterwards free from the spirit which had obtained due sepulture The above story I believe on the strength of those who affirm it What follows I am myself in a position to affirm to others I have a freedman who is not without some knowledge of letters A younger brother of his was sleeping with him in the same bed The latter dreamed he saw some one sitting on the couch who approached a pair of scissors to his head and even cut the hair from the crown of it When day dawned he was found to be cropped round the crown and his locks were discovered lying about A very short time afterwards a fresh occurrence of the same kind confirmed the truth of the former one A lad of mine was sleeping in company with several others in the pages apartment There came through the windows so he tells the story two figures in white tunics who cut his hair as he lay and departed the way they came In his case too daylight exhibited him shorn and his locks scattered around Nothing remarkable followed except perhaps this that I was not brought under accusation as I should have been if Domitian in whose reign these events happened had lived longer For in his desk was found an information against me which had been presented by Carus from which circumstance it may be conjectured inasmuch as it is the custom of accused persons to let their hair grow that the cutting off of my slaves hair was a sign of the danger which threatened me being averted I beg then that you will apply your great learning to this subject The matter is one which deserves long and deep consideration on your part nor am I for my part undeserving of having the fruits of your wisdom imparted to me You may even argue on both sides as your way is provided you argue more forcibly on one side than the other so as not to dismiss me in suspense and anxiety when the very cause of my consulting you has been to have my doubts put an end to End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Library of
