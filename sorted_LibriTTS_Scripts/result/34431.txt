PRINCESS BLUEGREEN OF THE SEVEN CITIES The Story of the Origin of the Azores Once upon a time in the lost kingdom of Atlantis there ruled a king whose name was Graywhite He had married the beautiful Queen Rosewhite They lived in a magnificent palace but it was a sad place because there were no little children in it There are plenty of babies in the homes of the poor peasants who can scarcely find food for them mourned King Graywhite Why is it that I the ruler of this vast rich kingdom can have no child to inherit my wealth and my domains Women in tiny hovels have their arms full of rosy dimpled darlings sighed Queen Rosewhite Why is it that I the queen of this magnificent palace can have no baby of my own Queen Rosewhite passed her days and nights in weeping while King Graywhite grew ugly and cruel to his subjects Once he had been the kindest ruler in the world Things went on like this for several years Queen Rosewhite s lovely face grew pale and wan and her beautiful eyes became so sad that it hurt the hearts of her faithful subjects The king s face lost its expression of jolly kindness and became sour and cruel They offered prayers and solemn vows before all the holy shrines in the whole kingdom of Atlantis but no child was born into the royal palace King Graywhite grew so harsh and ugly to his subjects that the entire kingdom offered prayers and vows too As things were life was not worth living in the kingdom of Atlantis In front of the royal palace there was a beautiful terrace where King Graywhite and Queen Rosewhite had loved to walk in the days before they had grown cross and sad One night when they were sitting upon the terrace enjoying the fresh soft evening air and the bright starlight there suddenly appeared a dazzling light which almost blinded them Queen Rosewhite covered her face with her hands and the king bowed his proud head upon his breast Do not fear to look at me said a gentle voice King Graywhite and Queen Rosewhite glanced up They saw a tiny fairy standing before them with a circle of bright light dancing about her King and Queen of Atlantis said the gentle voice You shall have a child a little daughter prettier than the sunlight I have heard your prayers and vows but I have also heard the prayers and vows of your poor subjects too The glad news had brought a happy light into Queen Rosewhite s beautiful eyes but now it faded out and a look of fear crept in It had hurt the queen s loving heart to have her husband so cruel to his subjects She often had told him that punishment would surely come upon him because of his harsh deeds When the little princess is born went on the fairy s voice I shall take her away from you for twenty years No harm will come to her I shall hide her away from you and all the world within seven beautiful cities which I shall construct in the loveliest part of your whole kingdom Around these seven cities I shall place strong walls At the end of twenty years if your heart King Graywhite is free from sin and you have made proper restitution for all your wrongdoing you shall receive the princess into your arms Twenty years is a long time said King Graywhite sadly Tears were running down Queen Rosewhite s cheeks and she could not speak You must wait until the twenty years are over continued the fairy If you attempt to enter the strong walls before that time you shall fall dead and your kingdom shall be consumed by fire Swear to me now in the presence of your faithful queen that you will not try to enter these strong walls which I shall construct about the seven cities I swear it said the king in a voice which trembled as he solemnly lifted his right hand The vision disappeared as suddenly as it had come and King Graywhite and Queen Rosewhite sat alone in the bright starlight on the terrace before the royal palace Have I been dreaming asked the king It was not a dream replied the queen Time passed and a beautiful baby daughter was born to the king and queen of Atlantis They gave her the name of Princess Bluegreen There was great rejoicing throughout the entire kingdom Her birth was celebrated by lavish feasts and gay songs and dances When the little Princess Bluegreen was only three days old she disappeared from the royal palace She had been carried away by the fairy to the seven cities which had been constructed to receive her Years passed Every day the king and queen received reports from the fairy They heard that the little Princess Bluegreen was well and that each hour she grew lovelier Sometimes there was almost joy in the palace when King Graywhite chuckled over the quaint sayings of the little princess which were repeated to him and the queen heard with a tender smile of the tiny blue slippers and the green parasol which the fairy had given her That day Queen Rosewhite bought new slippers for many little maids in the city As time went on however the royal palace of Atlantis grew almost as sad as it had been before the Princess Bluegreen had been born Only to receive reports of their daughter was not enough to make the king and queen happy They longed to see her with their own eyes and to clasp her in their arms As the weeks and months and years rolled by without seeing the little princess King Graywhite resumed his cruel treatment of his subjects He was growing old and his nature grew sour with the years Queen Rosewhite tried to reason with him We must bear this thing with patience she told him We brought it upon ourselves The king kept raging against the fairy and did not notice Queen Rosewhite s politeness in saying we instead of you It was the king who was responsible for all the cruelty Good Queen Rosewhite had never had a cruel thought in her whole blameless life At last the day of the eighteenth birthday of the Princess Bluegreen grew near Are you sure that it is not eighteen years which the fairy said instead of twenty years asked King Graywhite querulously Queen Rosewhite assured him that it was twenty years as he well knew The king s anger broke out fiercely I will no longer be kept from my daughter he cried Would you break the vow which you solemnly made to the fairy in my presence asked Queen Rosewhite trembling She had never dreamed that he would dare to break it Now however she was thoroughly frightened at the thought which came to her I ll break that foolish vow shouted the king savagely Tears rolled down the cheeks of good Queen Rosewhite No good will come of this she mourned Be prudent dear king It is only two years more which we have to wait The last two years will be the hardest ones of all raged King Graywhite I cannot endure it That very day he started to prepare the army for the expedition to the Seven Cities amid the queen s lamentations and in spite of her fears and warnings Be wise and patient dear king Give up this wild expedition were her last words to him when at length all the preparations completed he set out with his great army upon the dangerous quest of the seven cities surrounded by their strong walls in the loveliest part of the whole kingdom of Atlantis King Graywhite marched on and on It was a long and perilous journey and the army suffered many hardships on the way It seemed as if they would never arrive but at last they drew near to what everybody knew to be the most beautiful part of the whole kingdom where the fairy had taken the Princess Bluegreen to conceal her Storms raged lightning flashed ominous roarings and rumblings sounded from the depths of the earth Let us hasten back to the royal palace before it is too late besought the generals of King Graywhite s army On On cried the king Do you think I would abandon this expedition now The words were hardly out of his mouth when a huge rock fell from its place near where he stood and rushed away down the mountainside The earth trembled violently beneath their feet Fearful rumblings and roarings sounded all about them On ON shouted the maddened king Before them rose the great walls which the fairy had built around the seven cities Within these walls was the Princess Bluegreen radiant with the beauty of her eighteen winters and summers passed in peace and happiness under the watchful care of the kind fairy The thought of her thrilled the heart of King Graywhite On On he shouted to the generals about him On On they in turn passed the word along to the trembling soldiers which composed the royal army With the fearful sounds and shakings about them the poor men heartily wished they were safe at home They rallied however for a final charge and swept up to the walls which surrounded the seven cities King Graywhite struck his royal sword against the great wall At that moment the walls fell The earth beneath their feet rose Great flames swept up towards the sky and rushed over the land sweeping everything before them Then the sea raged over the earth in violence until it had covered the whole kingdom of Atlantis Illustration King Graywhite struck his royal sword against the great wall The fairy s curse had been fulfilled The king was dead His kingdom was consumed by fire When at last the waters grew calm again all that remained of the great rich kingdom of Atlantis was the group of nine rocky islands which to day is called the Azores In the largest of these islands saint Michael there is still an enchanted spot called Seven Cities Great wall like mountains tower toward the sky In the crater valley amid the wall like mountains there is a lake of green and one of blue The blue lake is where the beautiful Princess Bluegreen left her little blue slippers they say and the green lake is where she left her lovely green parasol THE ISLANDS OF FLOWERS Another Story of the Origin of the Islands Paradise is of course ruled by loving law All places good to live in are governed by laws Long long ago there was a little angel who broke one of the rules of Paradise Of course she had to be punished Punishment always follows broken laws She was banished from her heavenly home Never again could she join in the chorus of celestial music Never again could she look up into the face of the great King Now it happened that this little angel loved the flowers of Paradise especially For the last time she walked through the heavenly gardens Oh my exquisite ones I cannot bear to leave you she sobbed to her favorite blossoms It breaks my heart The flowers lifted their fair faces to hers in loving sympathy They breathed out their sweetest perfume at her gentle touch They stretched out their hands to catch her trailing garments as she passed them My best beloveds You are asking me to take you with me cried the little angel She filled her arms with the lovely blossoms of Paradise Now the angel was a very little angel and the flowers she gathered made a very large armful indeed She could not bear to leave any of her favorites behind Slowly and sorrowfully she left the heavenly gardens Slowly and sorrowfully she passed outside the celestial gate When she had left the gates of Paradise far behind the lovely blossoms in her grasp were all that remained of Heaven to her They filled her arms so full that she could not hold them all Some of them fell Down down to earth they floated They came to rest on the smiling blue waters of the broad Atlantic Illustration She could not hold them all Oh what shall I do I have lost my exquisite ones sobbed the little angel The flowers of Paradise smiled up at her from the place where they had fallen Never had they looked lovelier My best beloveds are beautiful and happy she cried as she smiled through her tears I still have all I can carry I ll leave them where they are There are nine of the flowers of Paradise which the angel dropped They have always remained in the blue Atlantic where she left them After many years Portuguese mariners found them and Portugal claimed them as her own She named them the Azores To this very day however one of the islands is called Flores which means flowers WHY DOGS SNIFF The Story of the Dogs Dinner Party Once upon a time the dogs gave a dinner party All the dogs were invited and all the dogs accepted the invitation There were big dogs and little dogs and middle sized dogs There were black dogs and white dogs and brown dogs and gray dogs and yellow dogs and spotted dogs There were dogs with long tails and dogs with short tails and dogs with no tails at all There were dogs with little sharp pointed ears and dogs with big flat drooping ears There were dogs with long slender noses and dogs with short fat turn up noses All these dogs came to the party Now the dinner was a most elaborate affair Everything had been arranged with the utmost care All the good things to eat were spread out upon the rocks by the sea A gay sparkling little brook brought water to drink The sun was shining brightly and a soft gentle little breeze was blowing Everything seemed absolutely perfect But there was a cross fussy old dog who came to the party She was a yellow dog they say Nothing ever suited her Whenever she went to a party she always found fault with something Sometimes there was too little to eat and sometimes there was too much Sometimes the hot things were not hot enough and sometimes the cold things were not cold enough Sometimes the hot things were so hot they burned her mouth and the cold things so cold that they gave her indigestion There was always something wrong At this party however there was not too much to eat and there was not too little to eat The hot things were all just hot enough and the cold things were all just cold enough Everything seemed to be exactly as it should be How good everything tastes remarked the big black dog between polite mouthfuls Everything is seasoned exactly right added the black and white spotted dog between mouthfuls which were entirely too large to be polite That was an unfortunate remark The cross fussy yellow dog heard it She noticed immediately that the big juicy bone she was eating had not been seasoned with pepper Will somebody please pass the pepper she asked Illustration Will somebody please pass the pepper All the black dogs and white dogs and brown dogs and yellow dogs and gray dogs and spotted dogs fell over each other trying to find the pepper to pass There was not a single bit of pepper at that dinner party I can t eat a mouthful until I have some pepper whined the yellow dog I ll go into the city and get some pepper said one of the dogs Nobody ever knew which dog it was The dog who went into the city to get the pepper never came back Nobody ever knew what became of him Whenever two dogs meet they always sniff at each other If one of them should happen to be the dog who went into the city to get the pepper he would surely smell of pepper LONGSTAFF PINEPULLER AND ROCKHEAVER The Story of Three Friends Long ago there lived a blacksmith upon whose strong right arm there swelled great muscles and whose big hairy fist was capable of delivering so heavy a blow that all the men in the village and nearby countryside stood in awe of him He had a hot temper as well as a strong right arm and his pretty young wife grew so afraid of him that she ran away into the forest taking her baby son with her The blacksmith had become crosser and crosser of late because the baby sometimes cried at night and disturbed his rest In the deep forest the young wife found nuts and herbs and wild fruits to eat The baby boy thrived most marvelously Soon he was big and strong able to kill wild beasts to add to their food At last his strength was so great that he could lift big rocks and pull up huge trees One day he said to his mother Dearest one I d like to leave you for a little while I want to go back to the village where I was born The stories you have told me about it keep ringing in my ears I must see the place for myself Do you mind mother dear if I take this journey His mother had long foreseen that a day would come when he would no longer be content to live alone with her in the deep forest Her heart ached but she gave her consent to the expedition When the lad reached the village he went straight to the shop of the blacksmith His mother had described it to him so often that he had no difficulty in finding it He knew at once that the man at the forge was his father He looked exactly as he had always imagined his father looked Good day said he I d like you to weld an iron bar for me a bar as tall as the tallest tree in front of your shop The blacksmith glanced at the lad and then at the tree You must have made a mistake in your measurements he replied You don t know what you are talking about The boy from the forest smiled quietly and stepped a trifle nearer to the blacksmith You are quite right he admitted Thank you for pointing out to me my mistake I should have said that I want this iron bar made twice as tall as the tallest tree before your door I want it to be of good thickness too I plan to use it as my staff The blacksmith looked the lad over more carefully In truth he appeared as if he might be able to use the staff after all The blacksmith hastily agreed to make it at once and he didn t say a word about arranging the price in advance according to his custom Have my staff ready for me next week commanded the boy as he bade the blacksmith good by When at last the lad was once more with his mother in the deep forest he told her all that had passed When I return for my staff I want you to go with me dear mother were his words when he had ended his story I cried the woman in alarm I d be afraid to go From your description I am sure the blacksmith is in truth your father and I fear that his disposition has not improved with the years Don t be afraid dear heart said the son I ll be there and I ll take care of you I ll see that he does you no harm They started out on their journey and just a week from the day of the lad s first visit to the blacksmith shop he stood once more in the door He had left his mother hidden behind the bushes and shrubs Good day he said to the blacksmith Is my staff ready Yes indeed It is entirely completed replied the blacksmith more politely than he was in the habit of speaking even to the parish priest himself I have just sent for two yokes of oxen and enough men to drag it out of my shop That is quite unnecessary responded the boy I m sorry indeed to hear that you have inconvenienced yourself He picked up the staff and tossed it about as jauntily as if it had been a slender cane The blacksmith stared at him in amazement his mouth wide open and his eyes bulging out of his head May I ask who you are he asked as soon as he could catch his breath My name from this day forth shall be Longstaff replied the lad And it so happens that I am your own son The blacksmith listened in surprise while the boy told the story of the years he and his mother had lived in the deep forest He embraced his son tenderly

none	none	he cried Come and live with me We shall have a happy life together The blacksmith was thinking that a strong young man like this would be a great help around the shop Longstaff shook his head Thank you but I cannot tarry here he said I must go away and see the world a bit My mother however is waiting behind the bushes I fear she will be very lonely while I am away When Longstaff s mother came in response to his call her husband embraced her lovingly and kissed her I ve really missed you about the house while you have been away he told her If you are not good to her you ll hear from me said his son as he looked him straight in the eye Longstaff then set out to see the world travelling from one country to another After a time he came to a place where there was a man pulling up pine trees by the roots as easily as if they were the weeds in your garden Good day said Longstaff What is your name I am called PINEPULLER was the reply I m very strong as you can see for yourself but I ve heard that there is somebody stronger than I am His name is LONGSTAFF I am told Longstaff gave his iron staff a gay toss into the air and caught it again in his hand That happens to be my name he said I like you Won t you join me in my travels about the country We two would have a jolly time together Pinepuller accepted the invitation and together they journeyed on Soon they came to a place where there was a man picking up great rocks and tossing them about as lightly as if they had been rubber balls Good day said Longstaff What is your name My name is ROCKHEAVER replied the other You can see for yourself that I am very strong I ve heard however that there is somebody stronger than I am His name is LONGSTAFF I am told That happens to be my name said Longstaff and this is my friend Pinepuller You are just the man to complete our little party Won t you join us as we travel about the country Rockheaver accepted the invitation with glee and the three friends journeyed on together from that hour Everywhere they went they had everything their own way because of their great strength Illustration The three friends journeyed on together One day Longstaff Pinepuller and Rockheaver sat on a rock by the sea Suddenly they spied two pretty girls tossing glass balls back and forth and catching them They had not stood there on the sand a moment before when the three friends had passed that way Possibly they had been bathing and had only just come out of the water Longstaff ran to speak to them He put out his hand and caught their two glass balls at once Then a strange thing happened The two beautiful maidens disappeared the very minute Longstaff put their two glass balls into his pocket and he was left standing alone on the sand by the sea That is queer he complained as he told Pinepuller and Rockheaver what had happened Not far away there was a little house There were no signs of life about the place and consequently the three friends entered Inside the house there were beds beautiful furniture and a kitchen completely furnished with pots and pans I like this house said Longstaff as he seated himself in the largest chair I m going to rest a bit and you two can go hunting When you return I ll have the dinner cooked for you Accordingly Pinepuller and Rockheaver went away to hunt for game Longstaff rested for a while in the big chair and then he went into the kitchen to light the fire Soon the fire was burning merrily and the water in the kettle was bubbling away cozily Longstaff cooked the dinner exactly as his mother had taught him long ago in the deep forest Just for a minute he turned his back to hunt for the salt When he turned around the pots and the frying pan were gone from the fire There was a tiny dwarf with red boots disappearing through the kitchen floor with Longstaff s good dinner Longstaff gasped He was not at all accustomed to having his dinner stolen from under his very nose as it were Soon Pinepuller and Rockheaver came back with the hares they had killed in the hunt They looked at the dying fire at the empty pots and frying pan and at the dazed expression on Longstaff s face Where s the dinner asked Pinepuller I m as hungry as a bear You said you d have it ready when we got back I know what he s done cried Rockheaver He has eaten all the dinner and hasn t left a single mouthful for us When Longstaff told them the story of the dwarf with red boots who had stolen the dinner it was difficult to make them believe it Very well said he if you won t take my word for it why doesn t Pinepuller stay in the kitchen and cook these hares Rockheaver and I will go away and you can see what happens Accordingly Longstaff and Rockheaver went away and Pinepuller made a stew of the hares While he was hunting for the salt the little dwarf with red boots came out from under the table and stole the stew Pinepuller turned around just in time to catch him at it He raised his big arm to seize him but the dwarf in the twinkling of an eye vanished into the floor taking the stew with him When Longstaff and Rockheaver returned Pinepuller told what had happened I believe you now said he to Longstaff I ask your pardon for doubting your word However Rockheaver was not convinced I know what has happened said he You were so hungry you couldn t wait for us and you ate up the stew You and Longstaff have plotted that I shall go with an empty stomach this day Let Rockheaver then be the one to stay in the kitchen suggested Longstaff We have brought back other hares from the hunt Let him cook them and see what happens Longstaff and Pinepuller went away leaving Rockheaver to cook the hares Again the dwarf with red boots jumped out from under the table and stole the dinner When his two friends returned Rockheaver begged their pardon for his moments of distrust These are surely queer doings said Longstaff I m going to make an investigation I ll not rest in peace until I find out where this red booted dwarf lives and where these three dinners have gone Come and help me dig up the ground under the kitchen At once Rockheaver dug up the floor of the kitchen and Pinepuller pulled out the earth beneath Soon they had a deep well like hole reaching down into the ground While they had been digging Longstaff had made a ladder out of the branches of the trees a ladder so long that it could reach very far into the earth I m going to be the one to descend into this hole remarked Longstaff when he thought that it was quite deep enough Indeed his two friends were entirely willing that he should He lowered the ladder he had made and very cautiously he crept down into the earth At the foot of the ladder he came to what looked like a heavy barred door He had brought his big iron staff with him of course and with this he knocked hard at the door Who is there called out a voice from within I am Longstaff Open Go away as fast as you can said the voice This is the home of the seven headed serpent If he catches you it will be serious You ll be enchanted and can never get away I d like to meet this serpent for a minute or two said Longstaff The heavy door swung open and Longstaff stepped inside Immediately he heard a rushing like a great wind With his big iron staff he struck a mighty blow at the seven headed serpent He hit him just in time to avoid being enchanted The huge seven headed serpent fell to the ground completely stunned by Longstaff s blow At the first drop of blood which fell from the wounded monster a beautiful maiden appeared near the door Longstaff recognized her at once as one of the two girls he had seen on the seashore tossing and catching the two glass balls He took the balls out of his pocket Do you recognize these he asked the maiden Indeed I do she replied One of these glass balls belongs to me and the other belongs to my sister She too has been enchanted and is behind the next door you see ahead of you I ll get you away from this evil place said Longstaff and then I ll see what I can do to help your sister He lifted her in his arms and started to carry her up the ladder Wait just a minute she said I think I d better give you back this glass ball I ll not be able to speak a word while you have it but I think you need it more than I She gave him back the glass ball and then they hastened up the long ladder When Pinepuller and Rockheaver saw the lovely maiden in Longstaff s arms they were filled with amazement She is a princess who has been enchanted explained Longstaff Take good care of her while I return for her sister Then we will restore these fair damsels to their father the king who has long mourned them as dead Once more Longstaff crept down the ladder into the depths of the earth The seven headed serpent was still lying where he had fallen and Longstaff stepped past him and knocked at the door which barred his way Who is there called out a voice from within This is Longstaff Open Hurry away as fast as you can This is the home of the dwarf with red boots said the voice That red booted dwarf is exactly the person I want to see answered Longstaff holding fast to his heavy iron bar which his father had made him long ago in the blacksmith s shop The door slowly swung open and Longstaff stepped inside At once he heard the footsteps of the red booted dwarf The tiny dwarf looked up at him in surprise We ll fight and see who is the best man stormed he You fight with the black sword and I ll use the white one No indeed said Longstaff I ll use the white sword and you the black Otherwise I ll not wait to fight with swords but will choose my own weapon which happens to be this iron staff of mine The little red booted dwarf looked up at the heavy iron staff in Longstaff s hand It could crush him very easily indeed Very well said he Just as you like Longstaff fought with the white sword and the dwarf with the black one and soon the dwarf had fallen though his great agility made up for his lack of size With the first drop of blood which fell from the red booted dwarf the beautiful princess was disenchanted She gave her glass ball back to Longstaff after she had recognized it as her own and safe in his arms she was borne up the long ladder to the place where her sister was awaiting her with Pinepuller and Rockheaver I ve left my staff behind cried Longstaff in alarm I must go down once more and get it He had never been without his staff near at hand even when he was asleep Hastily he again descended the ladder There was his staff lying where he had dropped it when he took the white sword When he turned around to go up the ladder again it had disappeared His friends had forgotten all about him so interested had they become in the two beautiful maidens Even at that moment they were on their way to the king s palace They had pulled up the ladder never giving another thought as to how Longstaff was going to get out of the hole Longstaff shouted in vain Then he remembered how the dwarf had appeared in the kitchen Evidently the red booted dwarf knew how to get up to the surface of the earth A drink from Longstaff s flask quickly revived him He reached for the white sword ready to fight again Wait a minute my friend said Longstaff You are now my prisoner I ll let you go as soon as you perform a little service for me Just take me up to the surface of the earth That is easy answered the dwarf Take hold of my hand As soon as Longstaff had taken the hand of the red booted dwarf he felt himself rise In a moment he was safe outside the hole There s another thing I want you to do for me before I let you go he said Take me to the king s palace Longstaff took hold of the dwarf s hand and in a moment more they were at the palace It was only a minute after the king s daughters had been restored to him The royal palace was wild with joy Even the fact that the two lovely maidens were dumb was almost overlooked When Pinepuller and Rockheaver saw Longstaff s angry eyes they ran away as fast as they could They were never seen near the royal palace again Longstaff drew the two glass balls from his pocket and gave one to each of the two beautiful princesses At once they could speak and together they told their story to their father the king You may wed whichever princess you prefer said the king to Longstaff when he had heard how he had made the bold rescue Longstaff wedded the princess who was more beautiful than her sister and when the king died he reigned over the whole kingdom THE TABLE THE SIFTER AND THE PINCHERS The Story of the King s Laborer and His Wages Once upon a time there was a man who was very poor He had so many children it was difficult to earn money enough to provide for them all Accordingly he left home and hired out to the king of a distant land At the end of a year s time he went to the king and said I have served you faithfully for a whole year Now I wish to return to my wife and children Pay me I pray you what you owe me for my work The king said I will not reward you in money I will give you something better than money Here is a table When you are hungry all you have to do is to say Table set yourself Then the table will immediately be spread with food Thank you good king replied the man With this table it will be easy enough to provide food even for all my large family When the man had started home with his table he soon grew hungry He put it down by the roadside under a leafy tree and said Table set yourself Immediately it was full of the most delicious food The man ate all he could and gave the rest away to some beggars who passed that way It is a lucky day for us said the beggars as they thanked him That night the man stopped at an inn He was so delighted with the magic powers of his table that he foolishly told the innkeeper about it That would be a most excellent table for me to possess thought the innkeeper With this in my possession I would soon be a rich man I could charge my guests a price in proportion to the rich food I would serve them and I d never have to spend a cent of my money to buy supplies That night the innkeeper stole the table and substituted another for it which looked exactly like it Early in the morning the man loaded the table on his back and hurried home to his wife and children We ll never be hungry again he cried as he embraced his wife Never again shall our children call for food when we have nothing to give them How much did the king pay you asked his wife in surprise The good woman well knew how much it cost to buy food enough to keep all their children from going hungry The king did not pay me in money He gave me something better than money replied the man Do you see this table Call the children I want to show you something The man s wife and children all gathered about the table watching it curiously Table set yourself said the man Illustration Table set yourself said the man The table remained standing in the center of the floor just as it was What trick is this asked the good wife She had been a bit suspicious from the moment she had heard that there was no money in her husband s pockets I ll get the beggars I fed to prove to you what this table provided yesterday he said when he had told all the story You d better go back to the king as fast as you can advised the wife Take back this good for nothing table which he has imposed upon you and ask for some real money instead The man did as his wife advised The king was thoughtful for a moment He guessed that the man had been robbed At last he said I ll give you a sifter this time Then when you need money all you have to do is to say Sifter sift It will sift out money as freely as if it were flour The man was delighted with the sifter He sifted his pockets full of money immediately and hurried home On the way he again spent the night at the inn When I brought my table home it wouldn t work he told the innkeeper I took it back and got something in its place which is all right The innkeeper watched him sift out money Why don t I get that sifter thought the innkeeper I work very hard serving my guests even though the table provides the food for them If I had this sifter I wouldn t have to work I d close the inn and pass the rest of my life enjoying the money I d sift into my pockets so easily That night he stole the sifter and substituted another which looked exactly like it When the man reached home there was plenty of money in his pockets and his wife and children were happy for a little while However he soon wanted to display the magic gifts of his new sifter Accordingly he called his family together Sifter sift he commanded The sifter behaved just like any ordinary sifter You have been tricked again cried his wife She was very cross indeed and told her husband exactly what she thought of him Home was not a comfortable place for him that day so he decided to hurry back to the king after he had emptied all the money in his pockets into his wife s lap This will supply you for a while he said It is quite as much as any ordinary husband would have brought home for a year s work A woman hates to have her husband made a fool of replied the woman as she rolled up the money and tucked it away carefully When the king had heard the story he was entirely convinced that the man had an enemy who had stolen both the table and the sifter Where did you spend the night he asked The man told of passing the night in the inn I ve heard that innkeeper is going to retire from business he has become so rich said the king You d better hurry there as fast as you can before he leaves town The laborer nodded his head thoughtfully a wise look creeping into his eyes Take these pinchers ordered the king Use them on that innkeeper until he gives back the table and the sifter When the innkeeper was sore and black and blue from the pinchers he gave back the table and the sifter After that there were prosperous days indeed for the king s laborer Whenever the children were hungry he would say Table set yourself and immediately the table would be full of the most delicious food Whenever his wife said I need some money he would call out Sifter sift and the sifter would sift out money as freely and easily as if it were flour As for the pinchers they proved to be quite as useful as the other gifts he received from the king Whenever the children were naughty he had only to glance in the direction of those pinchers The children would immediately behave as they should LINDA BRANCA AND HER MASK The Story of the Girl Who Did Not Like To Be Pretty Long ago there lived a girl who was so pretty she grew tired of being beautiful and longed to be ugly She was so attractive that all the young men in the whole city wanted to marry her Every night the street in front of her house was full of youths who came to sing beneath her balcony Linda Branca that was the girl s name grew tired of being kept awake nights It is well enough for a little while to hear songs about one s pearly teeth and snowy arms one s flashing eyes and waving hair one s rosebud mouth and fairylike feet but a steady diet of it becomes decidedly wearing I wish I were as homely as that girl who is passing by she remarked one day Then I could sleep nights If I were as ugly looking as that I d have a chance to select a really good husband perhaps With so many to choose from it is terribly confusing I ll never be able to make any choice at all as things are now I m afraid I ll die unwedded she added as she carefully surveyed the girl s coarse hair her large feet and hands her ugly big mouth and ears and small red lidded eyes That girl has a much better chance of a successful marriage than I have with all this tiresome crowd of suitors to drive me distracted The girl in the street heard her words and looked up When she saw how lovely Linda Branca was she was amazed indeed at the words she had heard She thought that she must have made a mistake and asked Linda Branca to say it all over again You can be exactly as homely as I am declared the girl when at last she had sufficiently recovered from her surprise to find her tongue I am an artist I can prepare a mask for you which will make you just as ugly as I am Go on and make it as soon as you can cried Linda Branca clapping her little hands in joy That evening the suitors in the street under the balcony thought that the lovely Linda Branca had become very gracious She was frequently to be seen on the balcony looking eagerly up and down the street as if she were expecting some one Her dark eyes were sparkling and her fair cheek had a rosy flush upon it which they had never seen before The beautiful Linda Branca is more charming than ever was the burden of their songs that night Linda Branca was so excited about her new mask that she could not have slept even if there had been no suitors to disturb her with their songs When at last she fell asleep towards morning it was only to dream that the new mask had the face of a donkey It was not until the next week that the mask finally arrived Linda Branca had grown very impatient and was almost in despair lest she should never receive it When at last the girl brought it one could easily see why it had taken a whole week to prepare it So like a human face it was that it was plain that the making of it had called forth great patience and skill as well as necessary time It is even uglier than I had hoped it would be cried Linda Branca in delight when she saw it Surely when she tried it on no one of her suitors would ever have recognized the fair Linda Branca of their songs Now Linda Branca had no mother and her father was away on business so it was an easy matter to prepare for her departure Linda Branca s father was a man of wealth who spared no money in giving his daughter beautiful gowns to enhance her rare beauty She had one dress of blue trimmed with silver and another of blue embroidered in gold As she packed up a few belongings to take with her she decided to add these two favorite garments Who knows but I may need them sometime she mused as she rolled them up carefully With the ugly mask upon her face and dressed in a long dark cloak she quietly stole out of the house She went to the king s palace in a neighboring city and inquired if they were in need of a maid Illustration She quietly stole out of the house Ask my son It is he who rules here said the king s mother The king looked at Linda Branca with a critical eye I hired my last servant because she was so pretty he remarked I think I ll hire this one because she is so ugly Accordingly Linda Branca became a servant in the royal palace She soon discovered however that it was the pretty maid who received all the favors It was good to sleep nights without being disturbed by the songs of suitors under her window Nevertheless after a time Linda Branca could not fail to see that it was the pretty maid who had the happy life I believe I d almost be willing to be pretty again said Linda Branca to herself Perhaps it has some advantages She knew very well that the pretty maid was not as tired as she that night The next day there was to be a great feast which was to last for two days Linda Branca asked the queen if she might be allowed to attend Ask my son said the queen It is he who rules here May I go to the feast asked Linda Branca when she was blacking the king s boots Look out or I ll throw my boot at you said the king That night when the feast had already begun she dressed herself carefully in the robe of blue trimmed with silver It was indeed a pleasure to remove the ugly mask and find that she was still just as lovely as when the crowds of suitors sang about her great beauty That night at the feast every one talked about the beauty of the mysterious stranger in the dress of blue trimmed with silver The king himself danced with her He was completely captivated by her charm Where do you come from lovely lady he asked I come from the land of the boot replied Linda Branca with a gay laugh The king was completely mystified for he did not know where the land of the boot was He asked the queen and all the wisemen of the court but there was not a single one of them who had ever heard of that country The next day they hunted through all the books and all the maps but there was no book or map which mentioned it She is the most beautiful maiden I have ever seen cried the king I d like to marry her but how can I ever see her again if I can t find out the location of the land she comes from He was in deep despair and every one in the royal palace was nearly distracted It was decidedly embarrassing to have the king fall in love with a stranger from a country nobody could find on a map or in a book When the king returned from the feast he saw the ugly little maid he had hired busy at her work about the palace The next day she again asked the queen s permission to go to the feast that night Ask my son was the queen s reply When Linda Branca asked the king s permission he replied Look out or I ll hit you with my hairbrush That night Linda Branca again removed her ugly mask and dressed herself in the beautiful gown of blue embroidered in gold She was even lovelier than the night before When she entered the grand ball room the king was almost wild with joy He ran to her side at once and kept dancing with her the entire evening What country do you come from he asked again I m from the land of the hairbrush replied Linda Branca Where is that land asked the king but Linda Branca would not tell him Where is the land of the hairbrush asked the king of the queen mother and of all the wise men of the court Nobody could tell him and nobody could find the land of the hairbrush upon any map or in any book Stupid ones cried the king I don t believe you have half tried to find it He looked through all the maps and books himself and at last he grew ill from so much studying His friends all gathered about him in the royal bedchamber and sought to console him However he refused consolation I do not care whether I live or die he cried I care for nothing except the beautiful stranger who came to my feast Linda Branca knew that the king was ill and when these words were reported to her she quickly dressed herself in the robe of blue trimmed with silver which she had worn the first night of the feast When she took off her ugly mask and looked at herself in the glass she was really pleased with her reflection It is not so bad after all to be pretty she said as she smiled Linda Branca stole out of the palace and peeped into the window of the royal bedchamber One of the king s counsellors saw her Whose lovely face is that at the window he asked It is surely the beautiful stranger from the land of the boot said one It is the charming maiden from the land of the hairbrush disputed another By the time the king himself had reached the window there was no one to be seen He called for the queen his mother Tell me mother who was outside my window a moment ago he asked No one unless a masquerader replied the queen The poor queen was nearly worn out with worry over her son She was afraid he was so sick that he was going to die The next day the king had in truth grown most decidedly worse The court physicians went about with anxious faces and the whole palace had become a place of deepest gloom Linda Branca put on her dress of blue embroidered with gold and again peeped into the window of the royal bedchamber Now the king had lain upon his richly carved bed with his eyes fixed every moment upon the window where the face had appeared He did not close his eyes at all He can t live long if this keeps up one court physician whispered to another He had just finished saying these words when the king gave a loud cry and sprang from his bed He ran to the window and reached it just in time to catch a piece of the skirt of blue embroidered in gold He held it tight Masquerader unmask he cried Linda Branca had hastily put on the mask which she had brought with her and now she looked up at the king with the face of the little servant he had hired She took off the mask and smiled into his eyes Now at last I know who is the beautiful stranger from the land of the boot and the land of the hairbrush cried the king When Linda Branca had told the king the queen mother and all the courtiers her whole story everybody laughed Who ever before heard of a maiden who wanted to be less beautiful than Nature had made her cried the wise men I always knew that when my son saw fit to select his bride he would choose a rare woman said the queen mother proudly The king himself did not say a single word but gazed and gazed at the lovely face of Linda Branca with such joy in his eyes that she knew in her heart that at last she was glad to be beautiful Stay pretty is a parting greeting between women in the Azores Perhaps it was Linda Branca herself who began saying it in the beginning FRESH FIGS The Story of a Clever Youth and a Foolish One Long ago there lived a little maid who fell ill Her father was very rich and he did everything he could for her One day she said If I only had some fresh figs I m sure I d feel better Now it was in the month of January It would be many long months before the fresh figs would be ripe The rich man was greatly worried Not even his fortune could ripen the figs as he well knew Nevertheless he decided to advertise and therefore said Whoever shall bring fresh figs to my daughter shall marry her if he be young If he be old he shall receive his reward in money This announcement was spread abroad throughout the whole country but no one had any fresh figs in the month of January At last however there was a woman found who had a fig tree close by the side of her house protected from the cold winds by the house and by the high wall of her garden This woman had a few fresh figs but they were small and not very good Send them to the little maid who is sick advised her neighbors Indeed I ll send them as soon as my son can get ready to start replied the good woman Now the woman had two sons One of them was foolish but the other was considered one of the cleverest youths in the whole countryside He left home immediately with the best of the figs in his basket On the way he met a woman dressed in blue with a child in her arms It was really the Holy Mother and her Child but he did not recognize them What are you carrying in your basket asked the woman I am carrying horns replied the clever youth Yes you are carrying horns replied the woman The young man went on to the rich man s house supposing that he was carrying figs in his basket just as when he started out The basket had grown heavy What have you in your basket asked the rich man when he saw the youth at his door I have brought some fresh figs from my garden to your daughter who is ill replied the clever one The rich man was delighted He opened the basket Then he shook the boy roughly by the collar and pushed him away down the steep steps There were horns in the basket What do you mean by playing such a trick on me called the rich man after him Never let me see your face in these parts again There were still a few of the poorest of the fresh figs remaining on the tree The foolish son begged his mother for permission to carry them to the little maid who was sick Yes Go with them replied his mother Who knows but what you may wed the rich man s daughter She laughed as she said it The boy who was foolish started for the rich man s house with the figs in his basket They were only a very few and poor little things indeed On the way he met a woman dressed in blue with a child in her arms What are you carrying in your basket asked the woman Fresh figs for a little maid who is sick replied the boy Yes you are carrying figs said the woman The boy opened his basket Here take one for the baby he said He s a lovely child He gave one of the best figs to the baby and went on his way to the rich man s house What have you in your basket asked the rich man Fresh figs from my garden for your daughter who is sick replied the boy The rich man opened the basket with a scowl upon his face He well remembered how he had been tricked before Then his eyes grew wide with surprise What figs like these in January he cried in amazement The figs had grown large and beautiful on the road to the rich man s house They filled the whole basket The little maid was so happy when she saw them that she began to grow better immediately When her father saw that the youth was foolish he repented of his promise to give his daughter in marriage to any young man who brought fresh figs to her However he had given his word and it was not a thing to be lightly broken I ll tell you what to do to get out of your difficulty said his friend to whom he told his trouble Turn two lively rabbits out on the mountain and tell the boy that he ll lose his life if he doesn t catch them and bring them back at night That is exactly what the rich man did The poor youth tried in vain to catch the rabbits He got very tired and hot and foolish as he was he knew enough to realize that the task set for him was quite impossible Suddenly he saw the woman dressed in blue standing before him with the child in her arms What is the matter she asked him The boy told her how he would lose his life if he did not catch the rabbits and bring them back to the rich man at nightfall The woman cut a reed and made a pipe of it Play on this pipe she said and the rabbits will come back to you of their own accord The youth played such sweet music on his pipe that the two rabbits came running up to him immediately It was all he could do to keep away the other beasts and birds Everything which heard the music was charmed by it Illustration The two rabbits came running up to him On his way back to the rich man s house he met two men who had been sent to kill him No one had dreamed of course that he d really catch the rabbits The two men were so surprised when they saw them in the bag that their eyes stuck out The rich man was even more amazed As for the little maid who had been sick when she heard the sweet music which the youth played upon the pipe she was quite ready to marry him The wedding was celebrated with great joy PETER OF THE PIGS The Story of a Sharp Lad and a Sharper Long ago there lived a man who employed a boy to take care of his pigs The lad s name was Peter and he was commonly called by every one in the countryside Peter of the pigs One day a man came up to him and said Sell me these seven pigs I can t sell but six of them said Peter I must keep one but you may buy the other six if you will cut off their tails and ears and leave them for me The man promised to do this and the boy pocketed the money The six pigs looked sad enough without their tails and ears as they were driven away by their new master Peter led his one remaining pig down to the sand pit He buried it halfway in the sand He buried the tails and ears of the other six pigs too so that part of them stuck out Then he ran with all speed for his master Illustration He buried it halfway in the sand Come and help me get the pigs out of the sand pit he called out His master ran as fast as he could to the sand pit There he saw one of the pigs halfway out of the sand He and Peter together soon pulled it out completely Then he took hold of the tail nearby To his horror it appeared to break off in his hand Run to the house and ask my wife to give you two shovels cried the owner of the pigs With the shovels we can dig out the rest of the pigs The boy ran to the house He knew that his master kept his money in two big bags My master says that you shall give me his two money bags said Peter to his mistress The woman did not approve of doing this Are you sure he said both of them she asked Yes both of them said Peter Go ask him yourself Accordingly the woman ran out of the house Did you say both of them she called to her husband Yes both of them he replied Be quick about it too Of course the poor man thought that she was asking about the two shovels which he had sent Peter to get Thus Peter received his master s two bags of money and set out into the world with the bags on his shoulder and his pockets full of the money he had obtained from the sale of the six pigs After a time Peter of the pigs met a robber The robber stole one of his money bags and ran away with it Peter ran after him Now it happened that the robber had just killed a deer He was carrying the liver inside his blouse As he ran he threw it back so that he could run faster Peter saw what he had done If you want to catch me you ll have to throw away your liver too called out the robber over his shoulder Peter of the pigs pulled out his knife and cut out his liver Of course he dropped dead at once When at last Peter s master found out that he had been deceived he ran after the lad As he found him lying dead there by the wayside he said Oh Peter of the pigs You were sharp but you found some one who was sharper Thus it is in life THE PRINCESS WHO LOST HER RINGS The Story the Lame Old Women Told Long ago there lived a lovely princess who owned the most beautiful rings in the whole world She had rings set with diamonds and rings set with pearls She had rings set with rubies and rings set with sapphires She had rings set with emeralds and turquoises and amethysts and every other kind of precious stone She had rings which had no precious stones in them but which were wonderfully decorated with fine and delicate carving wrought with great skill This princess lived in a magnificent palace surrounded by a high wall Her own apartments opened upon a pleasant balcony From the balcony she could see the blue waters of the ocean and the tall trees of the forest Here she liked to pass her days In a corner of the balcony there was a basin and pitcher of silver always kept filled with water in order that the princess might wash her hands on the balcony instead of having to go inside the house Whenever she washed her hands she always removed the ring she was wearing that day Some days it was one ring and other days it was another but whatever ring it happened to be the princess always took it off carefully when she washed her hands One day a pretty white rabbit came up to the balcony to play with the princess That day the princess was wearing her best diamond ring She removed it very carefully when she washed her hands Then it disappeared She knew that the rabbit must have stolen it The next day the rabbit came again and that day the princess lost her best emerald ring She was very sure that the rabbit must have stolen that too However she liked to play with the rabbit so she said nothing to her father the king about the lost rings Every day the rabbit came and every day there was a ring missing The princess had a large box full of rings in the beginning but one morning she opened the box and saw that it was entirely empty She remembered then that she had put on her last ring one set with a sapphire the morning before The princess became so sad that she would not go out to the balcony to play with the white rabbit Every day she grew sadder and sadder At last her father the king noticed it What is the matter with our daughter the princess he asked the queen She is sad now and once she was the very jolliest happiest princess in the whole world I cannot imagine what the trouble is replied the queen Perhaps she is lonely Let us send for the storytellers of the kingdom to come and tell their stories to entertain her Accordingly the king sent for all the storytellers in the whole kingdom All the storytellers had to come to the palace even if they were old and lame Now it so happened that in the kingdom there were two old women who were very lame They knew the most interesting stories of anybody but it took them so long to reach the palace that they forgot all their best stories on the way What story are you going to tell the princess one of the lame old women asked the other I can t remember a single one of my stories said the other old woman It has taken my lame old legs so long to travel the road to the palace that now that we are almost there I can t think of a single story The two old women tried to remember some of their stories but they could not think of any They were almost at the royal palace too What shall we do if we can t remember our stories asked the first old woman We ll have to learn some new stories replied the other Just then they spied a queer sight There was a little donkey without any feet traveling along the road On his back was a load of wood What a queer donkey cried the first old woman Let us follow along after him Perhaps we shall be able to tell a story about him replied the other The two old women followed the donkey into the forest There was a little thatched roofed house in the forest and before the house there was a fire burning A kettle of something which smelled good was boiling merrily over the fire The donkey which had no feet stopped beside the fire and left his load of wood The two old women stopped beside the fire too What do you suppose is cooking in this kettle asked one of the old women It smells so good I m going to taste and see said the other She started to taste but as she was about to stick in her finger she heard a strange deep voice which seemed to come out of the little thatched house Do not touch It is not yours is what the voice said The two old women went up to the door of the house and one of them peeped through the keyhole Inside the house she saw a pretty white rabbit playing with a box full of rings Suddenly the white rabbit pulled off his skin and changed into a handsome prince What wouldn t I give to see the owner of these rings cried the prince The two lame old women hurried away from the little house in the forest They were frightened at the queer doings there I know a story to tell the princess cried one of the old women when she had recovered from her fright I ll tell her how I peeped through the keyhole and saw the rabbit change his skin I know what I ll tell the princess said the other old woman I ll tell her how I followed the donkey without any feet and what that strange voice said to me when I tried to taste the good smelling broth in the kettle We must keep saying over our stories so we won t forget them said the first old woman We must hurry on our way to the royal palace and get there while we remember them said the other The two old women hurried on their way to the palace as fast as their lame old legs could carry them They rehearsed their stories over and over along the way so they would not forget them Many storytellers had told their tales to the princess They were jolly tales too but the princess was not in the least cheered by them She remembered her lost rings even when she was listening to the stories If the storytellers cannot make the princess happy who can asked the king in despair I m sure I don t know replied the queen She always used to like stories Finally the two old women reached the royal palace and went to tell their tales to the princess The first old woman told the story of the donkey without any feet and the broth in the kettle The princess did not appear to be particularly interested even when the old woman told about the strange deep voice which said Do not touch It is not yours Cold chills however ran up and down the spines of the king and queen and all the courtiers when she came to that part of the tale Next the other old woman told how she peeped through the keyhole of the little thatched house in the forest and saw the white rabbit change his skin The pretty dark eyes of the princess sparkled when the old woman mentioned the rabbit and she leaned forward in her chair eagerly Our dear little princess looks like her own happy self again for the first time in ages whispered the king to the queen When the old woman told of the rabbit s words What would I not give to see the owner of these rings the princess clapped her hands Take me to see this rabbit at once she cried The king and queen and all the courtiers went with the princess to find the white rabbit The two old women went first to point out the way and as these old women were so lame the whole procession moved very slowly At last they drew near the forest There was the donkey without any feet moving along the road with a load of wood on his back The two old women the princess the king and queen and all the courtiers followed the donkey into the deep forest to the door of the little thatched house Before the house the fire was burning and something which smelled good was boiling in the kettle The princess stuck in her finger to try it Illustration The two old women the princess the king and queen and all the courtiers followed Take it It is yours said the strange deep voice from the little house The princess was so surprised that she forgot to taste the good smelling broth She ran to the door of the house and peeped through the keyhole There was the white rabbit playing with a box full of rings set with diamonds and pearls rings set with rubies and sapphires rings set with emeralds and amethysts and turquoises and rings set with no precious stones at all but carved delicately with great skill What wouldn t I give to see the owner of these rings said the rabbit as he pulled off his skin and changed into a handsome prince Here s the owner of the rings cried the princess She is here at your very door The door of the little thatched house in the deep forest swiftly opened and the prince received the princess in his arms Your words have broken my enchantment he cried Now that at last the voice of the owner of these rings is heard at my door I ll never have to put on my rabbit skin again THE MASTER OF MAGIC The Story of a Boy who Learned His Lessons in School Once upon a time there lived a man who had three sons The two older ones worked in the fields but the youngest one went to school He learned how to read and write and do sums and make drawings At last he even learned magic The two elder brothers complained to their father about him one day Their hearts were bitter against him It is not fair father they said We work hard every day in the fields and bring home money to enrich the family Why shouldn t our brother work too He does nothing except study The youngest son heard their words of complaint Will you go hunting with me to morrow father he asked I have learned much magic In fact I have become a master of magic I will turn myself into a hunting dog if you will go into the fields with me The next day the young man changed himself by magic into a hunting dog and his father went into the fields with him He bagged many rabbits that day As they returned home he met one of his friends What luck to day asked his friend The hunter proudly displayed the rabbits he had in his bag I have them thanks to my dog he said I d like to buy that dog of yours said his friend What will you take for him The father named an enormous price and to his great surprise his friend accepted it The money was passed over at once and the hunting dog went home with his new master The next day they went on a hunting expedition into the deep forest Suddenly the dog disappeared His master called and whistled to him in vain Finally he was obliged to return home without him He had lost both the dog and the money he had paid for him Have you seen my hunting dog were his words for many weeks to every one he met His hunting dog had fled into a deep forest and once more resumed his original form He returned home and told his two brothers that in a single day he had earned for his father more than their combined efforts for many weeks Indeed it was quite true The next day the young man said to his father Will you buy a saddle and bridle for me if I turn myself into a horse His father made the purchase and then the young man changed into a handsome black horse His father rode him up and down the streets very proudly The Great Magician noticed the beautiful beast He called the man to him and said That is a very good horse you are riding What will you sell him for The father named an enormous price but he at once paid it cheerfully He ordered the horse placed in his stables Now this Great Magician had a beautiful daughter who was very fond of horses She went out to inspect his new purchase as soon as it was brought home She noticed that the horse ate nothing What a beauty she cried as she stroked his glossy black coat You are the handsomest horse in the stable Why don t you eat I believe your bridle is hurting you I m going to take it off As soon as the bridle was removed it was changed into a bird and flew out the window The Great Magician at that moment changed himself into a hawk and killed the bird never dreaming that it was the bridle of the new horse he had purchased The next morning when the Great Magician went to mount his beautiful black steed there was no new horse to be found in the stable The horse had changed into a kernel of corn Illustration The horse had changed into a kernel of corn The Great Magician transformed himself into a hen to eat up the corn but the youth was too quick for him He changed into a dog and seized the hen between his teeth and gave it a good shaking Then he returned to his own form and explained the whole affair to the Great Magician You are surely a master of magic was the comment of the magician When the Great Magician had forgiven him for the shaking he had received when he was in the form of a hen he gladly gave his consent to his daughter s marriage to the master of magic saint ANTHONY S GODCHILD The Story of Antonia who became a King s Page Long ago there lived a man who had so many children that he could scarcely find godfathers for them all He had requested so many of his friends to serve that when his last baby was born a little dark eyed daughter he vowed that he d ask the first man he met upon the street As luck would have it he happened to meet the good saint Anthony Will you be godfather to my baby daughter he asked Kind saint Anthony gladly consented He named the baby Antonia and said to the father Train up this child in the way she should go Teach her all you can When she is thirteen years old I ll come to get her and I ll give her a good start in life The years flew by and soon little Antonia was thirteen years old The father was afraid that saint Anthony had forgotten his promise but one day the saint appeared Is this my godchild he asked as he looked at Antonia Surely she has grown prettier each year of her life Antonia blushed shyly and looked even more attractive than before Dress yourself in your brother s garments he said to her I am going to take you to the king s court and you are entirely too pretty to go there in your own dresses Accordingly Antonia put on her brother s clothes and went to serve as a page to the king She was now called Anthony instead of Antonia Now the king had a sister who grew very fond of the little page She became angry that the page did not love her in return and plotted against him One day she went to the king and said Your little page says that he can separate all the chaff from the wheat in a single night Let him try responded the king When Anthony heard what the king required he was decidedly worried Then he remembered that he was the godchild of saint Anthony and that the saint was always ready to aid those in need He called upon saint Anthony to help him fulfill the king s command In the morning the king s wheat was entirely free from chaff The king loved his little page more and more and the king s sister was angrier than before that she could not win the affection of the youth She made a new plot against him What do you suppose that page is saying now she asked her brother He boasts that he can go to the palace of the king of the Moors and steal the purse of gold pieces from beneath his pillow The king sent Anthony to the palace of the king of the Moors With saint Anthony s help he climbed up the high wall of the palace and crept in through a window The king of the Moors was so sound asleep that Anthony had no difficulty whatever in slipping his hand under the pillow and stealing the purse Then he crept out again without awakening the king Illustration He climbed up the high wall of the palace That young page Anthony has grown so very boastful remarked the king s sister a few days after his return that he now claims that he can carry away the king of the Moors himself Then she added I ll marry him if he fulfills this boast Bring home the king of the Moors as your captive were the king s orders to Anthony The page was very much worried for he thought that it would be more difficult to capture the king of the Moors than it had been to capture his purse Not at all dear godchild said the kind saint Anthony when he had heard about the king s new command Anthony climbed quietly up the wall as before and crept in through the window Then he rolled the king of the Moors up in the bedclothes and tossed him out of the window By the time the king was really awakened from his sleep he was in the boat ready to sail away When Anthony returned to the palace with his captive the king said My best and bravest page you are worthy indeed of any honor You shall wed my sister I can t marry her said Anthony My name is Antonia In that case said the king I ll marry you myself TROUBLE WHEN ONE S YOUNG The Story of a Maid s Choice Long ago there lived a beautiful maiden whose name was Clarinha She had been betrothed to a prince whom she had never seen When at last he should be old enough to receive the rule of the kingdom he was coming to claim her as his bride Clarinha lived in a magnificent palace surrounded by a beautiful garden Every day she spent many hours among the lovely flowers and trees One day an eagle alighted on the tallest tree in the garden Good morning fair Clarinha he said to her Good morning she replied in surprise Never before had an eagle spoken to her Which do you prefer trouble when you are young or when you are old asked the eagle Clarinha did not know what to say That night she asked her mother which would be better to choose Choose trouble when you re young dear child advised her mother When you are young it is easy to bear anything but when you are old you can endure nothing She remembered her mother s words Next day when the eagle again addressed the same question to her she answered Trouble when I m young Clarinha had hardly said these words when the eagle lifted her up by the pink skirt she was wearing and carried her away On he flew over seas and mountains Clarinha was frightened nearly to death At last the eagle set her down in a strange land She was hungry and accordingly hired out in a bakeshop to earn her living She would have been happier if the eagle had flown away but he remained in a nearby tree top The baker went out leaving Clarinha to bake the dough which he had left ready to put into the oven The little maid carefully closed the door and all the windows so that the eagle would not be able to get inside As soon as the baker was out of sight however he flew down the chimney He tore about the bakeshop spilling all the dough on the floor and breaking the dishes Then he went back up the chimney when he had completed all the damage there was to be done When the baker returned he flew into a terrible rage He gave poor Clarinha a beating and turned her out into the street She walked about the city and at last found work as shopkeeper in a little shop on a corner The owner of the business went away next day leaving her in charge of everything As soon as he was gone she shut the door and all the windows but the eagle flew down the chimney and broke the cups and glasses and plates which were set out for sale in neat rows upon the shelf What have you been doing in my shop cried the owner in anger when he returned and saw the destruction which the eagle had left behind He didn t give the poor girl a chance to reply but seized her roughly and threw her out into the street Clarinha walked and walked seeking work and at last she arrived at the door of the royal palace Do you happen to need a servant she asked the queen I have all the servants I need replied the queen The prince was standing nearby Hire her mother he advised She ll do to take care of the ducks Accordingly the queen hired Clarinha to care for the ducks The next morning all the ducks in the royal duckyard were dead The eagle had killed them all Hire her for a seamstress mother said the prince The poor little thing is crying as if her heart would break I m sorry for her The queen hired Clarinha to be a seamstress in the royal palace That very day the prince left home to visit his betrothed He was going to marry a beautiful maiden in a neighboring land whom he had never seen As he left the palace he asked each one of the servants what gifts he should bring at his return When he came to Clarinha her reply was Bring me a stone from the palace wall of your betrothed The prince thought it a strange request but he promised to fulfill it As soon as the prince arrived in the land where his betrothed lived he found out that the palace was in mourning because of her mysterious disappearance one day from the garden He was so sad that he could not linger in that land He stayed only long enough to buy the gifts which he had promised to bring to the servants Along with the other gifts he carried a stone from the palace garden of his betrothed When Clarinha received her gift she heard the story of the mysterious disappearance of the prince s bride As soon as she held the stone in her hand she knew that it came from the wall of her own loved garden Joy shone in her beautiful eyes For the first time the prince noticed how very lovely Clarinha was He had always liked the little maid even when her face was sad but now that she was happy he saw that she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen What does that pretty little maid intend to do with that stone he asked the queen I cannot guess replied the queen She seemed happy enough to receive it I never saw her look happy before Trouble seems to follow whatever she undertakes I was on the point of discharging her She s caused me nothing but endless annoyance I hired her only to please you The prince followed Clarinha and listened at her door Inside her room she was talking to the stone Oh stone from my garden wall she was saying How are the flowers of my garden Illustration Oh stone from my garden wall she was saying The prince could hardly believe his ears Suddenly he guessed what the truth might be He burst into the room Are you my betrothed who has disappeared from her own land he asked Clarinha She smiled into his eyes Trouble when one s young is hard enough to bear she said when she had told all her story I ve had quite enough to last me all my life Your woes are ended now and a happy life lies before you said the prince Our wedding shall be celebrated at once THE LITTLE MAID WHO WAS WISE The Story of a Robber Who was Outwitted Long ago there lived a merchant who had three daughters Every year at a certain day of a certain month he went away to a distant city to collect money on an account His wife and daughters remained at home and all went well until one sad day the wife died That year the merchant looked forward to his journey with dread for he would have to leave his daughters alone I cannot bear to go away he said to them My heart is filled with fear lest some evil may befall you during my absence He worried about the matter night and day The business was most important and there was no one whom he could send to transact it for him However the question of leaving three such pretty girls unprotected was a thing not to be regarded lightly Do not be afraid to leave us dear father said his daughters Nothing will harm us while you are away How do you know asked their father I am older and wiser than you are and I know that there are many evils which might come upon you There are many bold thieves in this city for instance who would be only too ready to take advantage of my absence and rob my home of all I possess We can lock ourselves securely in the house and not let any one enter said the three daughters Be sure that you admit no one commanded the merchant They gave him their promise and he started on his journey Nevertheless he went with an anxious heart Now outside this city there was a band of bold robbers The captain of the band had watched the merchant s departure and when he was safely away the thief dressed himself in the disguise of an old beggar When it was evening he led his band into a nearby street and in his disguise approached the merchant s house He knocked at the door Have pity upon a poor unfortunate one he called out It is raining outside and no one with mercy in his heart could turn away one who begs shelter from the storm Let me enter I pray you to pass the night under your roof It s surely a terrible storm outside said the merchant s eldest daughter as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beat in torrents against the doors and windows I think we ought to take pity on a poor beggar a night like this The second daughter peeped out of the window at the beggar He is old as well as poor she said Our father has always taught us to show mercy and kindness to the aged Remember our promise to our father cried the youngest one We gave him our word that we would admit no one We can give this poor beggar some alms and send him away with a blessing The eldest daughter frowned It is not for the youngest and most childish one of us to make the plans she said The second daughter added We two are older and wiser than you are It is for us to determine what shall be done If we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it Bui we should not forget our promise to our father cried the youngest daughter However in spite of all she could say the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the beggar They led him into the kitchen to dry his clothes Then they made ready a bed for him to sleep upon They gave him his supper in the kitchen and then they ate their own It is a fearful night to send away a beggar said the eldest sister while they were eating I am glad we have made him comfortable for the night remarked the middle sister I am thinking that our dear father would be anxious if he knew that we had broken our promise so easily said the youngest sister For shame cried the eldest I don t think it was breaking our promise to show kindness to a poor old beggar said the middle one A promise is a promise nevertheless said the youngest While they were talking the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for dessert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them The two eldest ate their apples but the youngest could not eat that night She threw the apple away As soon as they had eaten the girls went to their room and the two eldest were overcome with sleep almost before they had time to get into bed The youngest one was so frightened that she could not sleep a single wink Soon she heard footsteps The beggar entered the room The youngest one pretended that she too was asleep The man went to the bed of the eldest sister and stuck a pin into her foot to see if she were completely unconscious She did not stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work Then he went to the bed of the second sister and did the same She was as completely unconscious as her sister It hurt terribly when he stuck the pin into the foot of the youngest but she did not stir The robber thought that she was as completely overcome by the sleeping powder as the others The youngest sister peeped through her long heavy eyelashes and watched the beggar She saw to her surprise that he had laid aside the heavy ragged old coat which he had kept wrapped about him even while he ate Underneath he was dressed like a robber with a sword pistols and dagger She was so terribly frightened that it was all she could do to keep her teeth from chattering She heard the robber go about the house picking out the valuables which he wanted to steal Then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store She quietly got up and crept out of the room to hear him more distinctly On a chair in the dining room she saw the sword which he had taken off He had evidently thought that with all three girls so sound asleep he d not need to use his weapons Soon she heard the heavy outer doors of the store unbolted The robber had gone outside to call the rest of the band The little girl flew down the stairs and closed the doors of the store securely They were big and heavy but her great fear gave her strength Illustration They were big and heavy but her great fear gave her strength He ll find it difficult to get into our house again she said to herself as she waited to see if the robber returned Soon she heard footsteps outside She knew that the thief had brought back others with him There were frightful words said when they found that the door was shut It was the youngest one who deceived me cried the robber chieftain I knew all the time that she did not want to let me in I was suspicious of her from the first Perhaps you can outwit her yet cried another She may not be so wise as she appears You never can tell The leader of the band of thieves went up close to the keyhole and whispered Kind lady of the house have pity on me The merchant s daughter at first did not answer but as he kept on calling to her she finally asked him what it was that he wanted I have left my charm behind he cried Pray let me enter to get it I promise you I will do you no harm I do not trust your promises replied the little maid You shall not come into my father s house Pass the charm out to me then said the robber It s in the fire replied the girl Go throw vinegar on the fire and put it out said the captain of the thieves Then you can pull my charm out in safety Now it happened that there was a little hole in the door just large enough for a man s hand to enter It is the hole through which beggars often thrust outstretched hands asking for alms Put your hand through the hole in the door replied the little maid Then I ll give you your charm She quickly ran upstairs and got the robber s sword which he had left on a chair in the dining room When she returned his hand was sticking through the hole in the door She struck it with all her might with the great sword and cut it off The cries and curses of the robbers filled the air They tried in vain to break down the great doors The doors were strong and held securely At last it was daylight and the band of thieves had to flee In the morning the effect of the sleeping powder wore off and the two elder sisters awoke When they heard their sister s story they were filled with amazement I don t believe a word of it cried the oldest You are making it up You had a bad dream said the second I had such a nightmare myself that I have a headache this morning It was not until their little sister had shown them the robber s hand and the great sword that they were convinced that she had told them the truth Oh why did we ever let the man into our house cried the eldest Oh why didn t we keep our promise to our father cried the middle one When at last the merchant returned from the distant city where he had been to collect money he was delighted to find his house and his three daughters safe I see that no harm befell you in my absence he said as he embraced them fondly All my worries about you were foolish The eldest daughter blushed and hung her head Great danger threatened us while you were away she said Thanks to our youngest sister we are safe Our little sister was wiser than we were said the middle daughter When the merchant had heard the whole story he said After this we must all give ear to the wisdom of this little maid She is wise beyond her years MANOEL LITTLEBEAN The Story of How He Helped His Father Long ago there lived a man and his wife who had no children I wish I had a little boy said the man I d like a son of my own even if he were not any larger than a little bean said the woman Time passed and a son was born to this worthy couple He was no larger than a little bean and as the years went by he never grew any bigger His name was Manoel Littlebean He caused his mother endless trouble by constantly getting lost Sometimes she d nearly step on him Other times he d fall into the food and she would almost swallow him One day his mother couldn t find him Manoel Littlebean Manoel Littlebean she called There was no answer She went outside the house and called his name anxiously There was no reply She asked all the neighbors if they had seen the child but there was nobody who had noticed him that day His poor mother was nearly wild with anxiety I m afraid I ll never see the dear child again she mourned I m sure I have either stepped on him or swallowed him You never stepped on him or swallowed him yet comforted her husband However he added anxiously I can t see what has become of my Manoel The truth of the matter was that Manoel Littlebean had been swallowed by the goat He was a most active youngster in spite of his small size and he caused the goat a terrible attack of indigestion The goat did not know what was the matter and he tore around so wildly and caused so much destruction that his master decided to kill him I simply can t be bothered with that goat any longer he said I have quite enough to worry about already with Manoel Littlebean lost and my poor wife nearly sick with anxiety because of it He never dreamed that it was his son who was making the goat so wild with misery When the goat was dead he threw it out into the street That night a wolf came and ate the goat He swallowed the goat s stomach so greedily that Manoel Littlebean had no time to escape However he jumped about just as actively inside the wolf as he had done when the goat had swallowed him The wolf was just as uncomfortable as the goat had been What is the matter with me thought the wolf Never in my life have I had such a stomachache I believe I m going to die He ran away into the forest and crept into a cave to await his end Inside the cave was a robbers den Three of the robbers were there counting over the gold they had just brought back When they saw the wolf they were so frightened that they dropped their bags of gold and ran away as fast as they could leaving everything behind them Manoel Littlebean guessed that he was making the wolf sick If I can only make him so ill that he will spit me up said Manoel to himself as he jumped about his liveliest That is exactly what happened The wolf spit Manoel Littlebean out He was decidedly dirty and unattractive but he didn t mind in the least He saw the quantities of gold in the robbers cave and his eyes shone Illustration He saw the quantities of gold If I can only find my way home to tell my father about it he will be a rich man he cried It was a long distance home and several times he thought that he had lost his way Finally however he saw his own mother s light in the window He ran toward it as fast as he could run Manoel Littlebean what have you been doing cried his mother when she saw him Where did you get so dirty Come let me give you a bath the first thing Never mind about the bath mother said Manoel I have more important things to attend to Where is father His mother called her husband and they both forgot how dirty the child was when they heard his story Let us hurry to the robbers cave father he said We must get there before they return What about the wolf asked his mother anxiously Manoel Littlebean laughed The wolf doesn t have any stomachache now he said He went home long ago They went to the robbers cave and brought home the huge sacks full of gold It was enough to make them live like princes for a lifetime I have the best and cleverest son in the world said the father Never in the world was there a son who was such a joy and comfort to his parents said his mother Manoel Littlebean was treated by every one as politely as if he had been big THE NECKLACE OF PEARLS The Story of a Water nymph and an Island Lad In a tiny cottage on the steep rocky hillside of one of the islands of the Azores there lived a poor woman and her only son whose name was Francisco Every day the boy went fishing in his little boat and every night he brought home fish for his mother to cook for their evening meal and to carry into the market to sell In this way they lived very comfortably and they loved each other so dearly that they were as happy as happy can be Francisco with his fair skin blue eyes and thatch of curly golden hair was the handsomest boy in the whole parish and by the time he was sixteen years old there was many a rich man s daughter who had smiled upon him However the lad thought only of his fishing boat and his mother and did not notice the smiles One night the moon was so bright that Francisco could not sleep He awakened his mother who was dozing comfortably in her bed I m going fishing mother dear he said as he kissed her The moonlight is calling me His mother started up from her bed in terror and amazement Why my boy do you do such a thing as this she asked You have never been fishing in the night before Some evil will surely befall you Don t worry about me dear mother replied Francisco laughing at her fears I know how to take care of myself It is as light as day Think how many fish I ll bring back for you to sell in the market to morrow His mother shook her head anxiously but with another loving kiss the lad ran out into the bright moonlight He quickly launched his little fishing boat and soon was floating smoothly along on the peaceful waters of the bay which gleamed like a silver pathway in the moonlight The soft air the gentle rocking of the little boat and the face of the moon upon which his blue eyes were fixed combined to send sleep to his eyelids Soon he was nodding in the little boat A few moments later and he was fast asleep The moon s rays upon his curls made them shine as if they were indeed made of gold Now the village maidens were not the only ones who had noticed Francisco s blue eyes and handsome face A water nymph who dwelt in the depths of the sea had often observed him In the daytime she was invisible to the eye of humans and so the lad had never seen her though she often spent long hours near him never taking her eyes from his face Here comes the beautiful youth in his little fishing boat cried the nymph as she saw the moonlight gleaming upon his bright curls At last my wish has come true Now at night he ll be able to see me She hastily arranged her own beautiful hair before a little mirror she carried Some of the strands of priceless pearls which decked her lovely head were a trifle awry These and the necklaces of rare pearls which hung about her fair throat surrounded her with a gleam of soft light almost like the light of the moon As she approached nearer to the little boat she saw that Francisco was fast asleep She swam in the direction of the lad with all possible speed a wild terror in her eyes What madness is this she asked as she looked down upon his bowed head This frail boat will drift upon the dangerous rocks and be dashed to pieces I ll take him home to my own palace without awakening him Perhaps when he sees how lovely it is he ll even like me a little bit Just for a moment she hesitated thinking how far from home Francisco would be in the palace of mother of pearl in the depths of the sea The rocks are really very dangerous she said to herself as she gently drew his sleeping form into her arms The next morning Francisco s empty fishing boat was found by the fishermen For hours his mother had watched in vain for his return When at last she heard that the empty boat had been found she was nearly wild with grief He was the best son a mother ever had she moaned over and over again How can I live without him Indeed as the days and weeks went by it was increasingly difficult for the poor woman to live She not only missed her boy s loving smile but she also missed the fish he caught so skillfully There was little for the poor woman to eat if she had any appetite for food Why don t you go to the Wiseman of the Sea and tell him your troubles asked one of the neighbors Francisco s mother knew that it was a long and difficult journey to reach the Wiseman of the Sea She decided however it would be worth the effort just to gaze into his wise eyes He knew so much perhaps he would know how to say something to comfort her in her great sorrow and loneliness She had shrugged her shoulders when her neighbor had spoken of it but she could not get the idea out of her mind She knew that she would never rest in peace until she had made this journey Accordingly she launched Francisco s fishing boat and thanks to smooth seas reached the little rocky island in the midst of the sea where the Wiseman of the Sea lived His tall form was outlined above the cliff even as she tied her little boat He was very tall far taller than anybody she had ever seen and his snow white beard fell to his feet He was clothed in fish scales which gleamed in the sunlight Well little mother what can I do for you to day he asked as she came up the path to the summit of the rock The eyes of the Wiseman of the Sea were very kind as well as full of great wisdom Francisco s mother forgot to be afraid of him as she had expected to be She told him the story of her lost son The Wiseman listened carefully to her words and then he said Good mother I am glad to tell you that I know where your Francisco is He is in the power of a water nymph who has carried him away to her castle of mother of pearl in the depths of the sea Francisco s mother felt the tears of joy well up into her eyes Is my boy happy there and is he well she asked eagerly He is entirely well and happy The water nymph gave him a philtre which has made him forget his past life entirely I m glad you told me that said the boy s mother I was just wondering how my dear lad could be happy while he was causing me so much sorrow He has always been the best and kindest son with which a mother ever was blessed The Wiseman of the Sea started to say something but the woman interrupted as a new thought flew into her mind Tell me she cried is there no way of getting him back With all your wisdom can t you think of some way to make him once more remember the mother who loves him and the little home in which we have passed so many happy days together Do you not know some means of breaking the power which this water nymph has over him The Wiseman looked out across the sea in silence for at least a minute and a half He thought hard Francisco s mother watched him with eager eyes She could hardly wait for his answer At last these were the words which fell from his lips You have shed many tears good woman but tears are still to flow if you are to bring back your son Oh must I suffer more cried the heart broken mother It seems that I have already lived a lifetime since my dear lad kissed me in the moonlight I have endured all that I can bear The Wiseman smiled gently as he raised his hand Listen my child he said Your tears must be shed upon the bosom of the waters If perchance one of them should fall upon your son s heart there in the palace of the water nymph in the depths of the sea the power of her philtre will be broken I ll shed whole oceans of tears if I can break the power of that water nymph and bring back my Francisco said his mother The fact is that she began to shed tears then and there even before she had thanked the Wiseman of the Sea for what he had told her Now it happened that Francisco had grown to love the beautiful palace of mother of pearl in the depths of the sea He never tired of all its beauty About the palace there were lovely gardens filled with flowers made of precious gems Each tiny bud of that garden was worth a king s ransom so rich were the jewels which composed it The water nymph often gathered her arms full of these rare blossoms and wove them into a garland to crown Francisco s golden curls He never had a thought of the old life at home with his mother so completely had the nymph s philtre done its work There was always a big fish swimming about the palace On its back there was a cushion of seagreen satin embroidered with lovely pearls This is your riding horse said the water nymph to Francisco the first day he had seen it If you should ever get tired of the palace and find the life here a bit monotonous just mount this horse and ride about for a little The water nymph had shaken out her long fair tresses so that they covered as much as possible of the fishtail she had instead of feet She was very sensitive about the fact that she had no feet upon which to wear pretty little slippers like those of the maidens she had seen so often as they called out gay greetings to the handsome fisher lad Francisco had smiled into her eyes How absurd he cried to think of such a thing as getting tired of this wonderful place In fact the days had slipped by all too fast for the happy youth Then it suddenly happened one day while the water nymph was asleep that he thought of his mother the little house which had been his home for sixteen years and more the fishing boat which was his pride and joy the moonlight night when he had gaily kissed his mother s cheek and gone away never to return He did not stop to waken the sleeping nymph He said no word to the servants of the palace He thought only of the fish with the cushion of sea green satin embroidered with rare pearls Quick he cried to it Take me home as fast as you can My mother s heart is breaking She has shed so many tears for me I know that by this time she may be entirely blind Illustration Take me home as fast as you can In another hour Francisco was safe at home with his mother s arms about him She had shed so many tears that her eyes were swollen almost shut but they were not closed so completely that they could not shine with the great joy which once more filled her heart Promise me one thing she said to him Give me your word that you ll never go fishing again I don t trust that water nymph even in the daytime Accordingly Francisco gave up being a fisherman and became a hunter To make his spears he gathered the young sapling which grew on the hillside even down to the edge of the water He had grown still handsomer while he had lived in the palace of mother of pearl in the depths of the sea and there were twice as many pretty maidens who cast smiling glances in his direction It was the daughter of the rich man of the village who at last won the heart of Francisco When he went a wooing however he had no gift to take except the birds he had killed with his own hand The rich man laughed at him These were his words When my daughter marries it shall be only to a youth who can bring her rich gifts Francisco went away with a sad heart and sat upon the rocks at the edge of the sea gazing out over the water with eyes so full of tears that they saw nothing The water nymph was not far away from the shore those days She was always seeking for a glimpse of the golden head which she had so often crowned with flowers Her joy now at the sight of him was buried by her sorrow when she saw that his heart was full of woe She knew at once the cause of his grief The next morning when Francisco went to get wood to make a new spear he found a necklace of priceless pearls lying on the shore It was the gift of the water nymph but since his heart had been touched by his mother s tears he had entirely forgotten her He took the gift to the maid he loved with never a thought of the giver THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF NAPLES The Story of a Prince s Quest There was once a king who had an only son 
7938_110127_000000_000001	train-clean-360	The years passed by and he did not marry so one day his father called him before him and said 
none	none	The time has come when you should marry my son You are now at the age when you should no longer wait to choose your bride Why is it that you have not already done this 
7938_110127_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The prince replied 
7938_110127_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 I will wed no one except the daughter of the king of Naples 
7938_110127_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you know that the king of Naples has a daughter asked the father 
7938_110127_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 No answered the son 
7938_110127_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 I do not know 
none	none	I should advise you to find out whether or not the king of Naples happens to have a daughter before you decide to marry her remarked the king dryly
7938_110127_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 That is good advice replied the prince 
7938_110127_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 I thank you 
none	none	Accordingly he asked everybody he met whether the king of Naples had a daughter 
7938_110127_000008_000001	train-clean-360	There was no person to be found who knew anything about it 
7938_110127_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll have to go to Naples to obtain this information advised the king 
none	none	It is a long journey but if you are determined to marry nobody except the daughter of the king of Naples there seems to be no way except to go there and learn whether or not he has a daughter Accordingly a ship was prepared and the prince sailed for Naples 
7938_110127_000010_000001	train-clean-360	It was a difficult stormy voyage but finally they arrived safely 
none	none	The moment they landed the beggars came crowding about them The prince distributed alms among them most generously 
7938_110127_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Then he asked Does any one know whether or not the king of Naples has a daughter 
none	none	There was nobody who knew Finally however an old woman said that once she passed by the royal palace and there was a beautiful face at the window I think that perhaps this was the daughter of the king of Naples but I do not know she added Go at once and find out ordered the prince You shall be richly rewarded 
7938_110127_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The old woman hastened to the royal palace 
none	none	She saw the same lovely face at the window which she had seen before Lovely lady I want to talk to you she called out Now it happened that day that the princess was feeling decidedly bored and out of tune with life 
7938_110127_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It looked like an interesting diversion to talk with the old woman 
none	none	Thus it came to pass that she opened the window graciously

7938_110127_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you the daughter of the king of Naples questioned the old woman 
7938_110127_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I am replied the princess 
7938_110127_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 May I come some day to sell you pretty things asked the old woman 
none	none	The princess appointed an hour the next day when she might come with her wares Then the old woman hurried back to the waiting prince
7938_110127_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 The king of Naples has a daughter she cried 
7938_110127_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 A very beautiful daughter too 
none	none	The prince showered the old woman with gold He was so delighted that at last he had found this out that he could well afford to be generous 
7938_110127_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The old woman thanked him 
none	none	I did something else for you kind sir she said
7938_110127_000025_000002	train-clean-360	 I made an appointment to see the princess to morrow 
7938_110127_000025_000003	train-clean-360	I am going to the palace at four o clock to sell pretty things to her 
7938_110127_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Well done good mother cried the prince again thrusting his hand into his purse 
7938_110127_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Let me go in your place 
7938_110127_000027_000000	train-clean-360	The old woman gladly consented and the prince dressed himself as a peddler 
7938_110127_000027_000001	train-clean-360	The next afternoon at four o clock he went to the palace of the king of Naples 
none	none	It is a peddler with many interesting wares for sale said the servant who answered his knock He speaks of an appointment with your Royal Highness
7938_110127_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said the princess 
7938_110127_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 A peddler was to come to day at four o clock with pretty things for me to buy 
none	none	Accordingly the prince was admitted to the presence of the daughter of the king of Naples If she were surprised to find the peddler a handsome young man instead of the old woman with whom she had talked the day before she did not show it What lovely things you have she cried as she examined the tray full of ribbons and beads and trinkets She selected a number of the wares and then she asked What is the price of these 
7938_110127_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The prince would not set a price 
none	none	If your Royal Highness is pleased with these said he I have many more things at home which you will like even better I ll bring them to you to morrow
7938_110127_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 That will be splendid cried the princess 
7938_110127_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 Come again to morrow at this hour 
none	none	The next day the prince again dressed himself as a peddler but underneath the outer garments he wore his own rich clothing When he was admitted to the royal palace he laid aside his peddler s disguise and stood before the princess looking like the true prince he was He was very handsome in his rich suit of crimson velvet with his hat with the long plume in his hand 
7938_110127_000036_000003	train-clean-360	The princess was so surprised that she turned pale 
none	none	Who are you she cried You surely are not the peddler who came here yesterday The prince smiled into her eyes and even without the peddler s garments which were rolled up on the tray she would have recognized him 
7938_110127_000039_000000	train-clean-360	He told her of the quest which had led him there and she admired all the patience and diligence he had shown in finding out her existence When he asked her to marry him at once she readily consented 
none	none	They planned that she should steal down the staircase at night and go away with him on his ship 
7938_110127_000040_000000	train-clean-360	All this sounded very romantic to the daughter of the king of Naples She had never dreamed that a thing like this would ever happen 
none	none	All her life she had been so closely guarded that stealing out of the palace and sailing away in the prince s ship seemed the most wonderful thing in the world The next night had been agreed on and long ahead of the appointed hour the prince sat on horseback at the foot of the stairway down which the princess would steal He was very weary with all the excitement of the past three days and as he waited he fell asleep A robber passed by and saw his sleeping form hanging limply on the saddle I ll gently deposit him on the ground and get away with his horse and saddle thought the thief as he stopped and regarded the horse with a critical eye Just then however he saw something which made him change his mind about hurrying away after he had deposited the prince s sleeping form beneath a tree There was the loveliest maiden he had ever seen creeping silently down the stairway 
7938_110127_000043_000002	train-clean-360	She came straight up to him 
7938_110127_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I m ready beloved were her words 
none	none	The robber silently lifted her behind him on the horse s back and together they rode away
7938_110127_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is your boat asked the princess after they had ridden together for some time without speaking 
none	none	So it is a boat which the fair lady is looking for thought the thief I was expecting this good horse to carry us the whole distance A boat is a bit difficult to arrange but it can be done if necessary There ought to be a boat around somewhere for me to steal He left the daughter of the king of Naples on the shore while he went to steal a boat When he returned the light shone upon his face and the girl thought that he did not look the same as the day before
7938_110127_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course I ve seen him only twice she told herself in an effort to gain assurance 
none	none	It must be the prince my own true love Here is our boat said the robber and together they embarked As the morning light shone upon the robber the princess saw that he was not in the least like the prince who had come a peddling The robber laughed
7938_110127_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Does my lady know with whom she is going away he asked 
none	none	I thought I was going with the prince who is my lover she replied bursting into bitter tears Running away was not half so romantic and delightful as she had pictured it She heartily wished that she were back in the royal palace As for the prince he soon awoke and looked about the palace garden where he was lying under the tree How did I get here he asked as he rubbed his eyes sleepily There was none to tell him so he decided that his horse must have thrown him off and run away It is queer that my fall did not awaken me he said to himself
7938_110127_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 It is a bit awkward to lose my horse 
none	none	However if the princess only keeps her promise and comes to me we shall manage to get to our ship somehow He waited very patiently for a time and then he began to fear that the princess had repented of her promise to run away He did not give her up however until it was almost daylight Then he sorrowfully returned to his waiting ship Illustration Then he sorrowfully returned to his waiting ship I have at least found out that the king of Naples has a daughter and that she is the most beautiful princess in the whole world he said If she prefers not to have a run away marriage it will doubtless be better for me to sail home and tell my father to make arrangements with the king of Naples for our wedding There are some advantages in this more dignified method Thus it happened that the prince sailed away for his own country never dreaming that the princess had kept her promise to steal down the stairway in the night and that she was then in the hands of the wicked robber The daughter of the king of Naples sobbed and cried so loud when she found that it was not her own prince with whom she was sailing that the robber became quite disgusted with her
7938_110127_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought you were a pretty little maid he said when I first saw you but now I ve changed my mind about you 
none	none	Indeed no person with good eyesight would have called the princess pretty at that moment with her face all red and swollen with much weeping The robber decided that he did not want to bother with her any longer so he landed in the country of the Junqueiras and left her there The princess wandered about the place until night came without seeing a single soul nothing but the sea sky and rocks She was really however not far from the hut in which there lived the wife and daughter of a poor fisherman 
7938_110127_000067_000001	train-clean-360	In the stillness of the night they heard a cry 
7938_110127_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Some one is in trouble outside mother said the daughter 
7938_110127_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps the pirates have come and by this cry are trying to lure us out answered her mother cautiously 
7938_110127_000069_000001	train-clean-360	There were often pirate ships which stopped there 
none	none	The daughter listened carefully
7938_110127_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 No mother she insisted 
7938_110127_000070_000001	train-clean-360	 I m sure this is a girl s cry 
7938_110127_000071_000000	train-clean-360	The two women opened their door and crept out in the darkness 
none	none	The sobs of the princess soon led them to the place upon the rocks where she lay crying as if her heart would break 
7938_110127_000071_000002	train-clean-360	They lifted her tenderly and carried her home 
none	none	The fisherman s daughter gave the princess some of her own clothes to wear and they lived together as if they were sisters Together they did all the work of the little house and the princess was too busy to weep Sometimes however she cried in the night when the fisherman s wife and daughter were asleep She wept for her lost love and for the royal palace of the king of Naples which had always been her home Now it happened that the prince s ship encountered a great storm and was driven about by the sea At last it was blown by the gales to the land of the Junqueiras The prince saw the fisherman s daughter and the princess standing on the rocks by the sea 
7938_110127_000074_000001	train-clean-360	He stared hard at the princess 
7938_110127_000074_000002	train-clean-360	Then he spoke in a voice which shook 
none	none	You remind me of some one I used to know he said Tell me your name I pray you fair maid The princess looked down at the garments of the fisher maid which she wore 
7938_110127_000076_000001	train-clean-360	She blushed 
7938_110127_000076_000002	train-clean-360	The prince she had recognized the very moment she had seen him 
none	none	I am the daughter of the king of Naples she said The fisherman s daughter stared at her in amazement
7938_110127_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 She is no king s daughter she cried 
none	none	She is a poor abandoned maid who came to us out of the sea 
7938_110127_000079_000002	train-clean-360	We found her upon these very rocks 
none	none	It is my own dress that she is wearing A king s daughter indeed She is no more the daughter of the king of Naples than I am But the prince had taken the daughter of the king of Naples in his arms As soon as they returned to the palace their wedding was celebrated with great joy and they lived together as God lives with the angels Illustration Headpiece MARIA OF THE FOREST The Story of a King and His Fate Once upon a time there was a young king who went into the deep forest on a hunting expedition 
7938_110128_000003_000001	train-clean-360	He and his favorite page became separated from the rest of the party and soon they realized that they were lost As night approached they found the rude hut of a charcoal burner and begged for permission to pass the night there 
7938_110128_000003_000002	train-clean-360	They were received most hospitably 
none	none	Just at the hour of midnight the king was awakened from his sleep by a voice 
7938_110128_000004_000001	train-clean-360	This is what it said 
7938_110128_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Here in this hut is born to night The maiden of your fate You can t escape your lot young king Your fate for you will wait

7938_110128_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The king turned over on his pillow and tried to sleep but the strange voice kept ringing in his ears 
7938_110128_000007_000001	train-clean-360	He rose early 
none	none	As soon as he saw the charcoal burner the man said A baby daughter was born to me last night
7938_110128_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 At what time asked the king 
7938_110128_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 It was just midnight replied the charcoal burner 
none	none	The king awakened his page and told him what had happened
7938_110128_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I refuse to wed any maid born in this poor hut he said 
none	none	You must help me to escape this fate
7938_110128_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 What can I do about it asked the page yawning 
7938_110128_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 You must steal this babe this very day and put it to death said the king sternly 
none	none	The page did not dare refuse and easily obtained possession of the baby when no one was looking 
7938_110128_000015_000001	train-clean-360	He carried her away into the deep forest but he did not have the heart to put an innocent babe to death He left her in a hollow tree wrapped up in the bright red sash he wore 
none	none	When he had returned to the king he confessed that he had been too tender hearted to slay the baby 
7938_110128_000016_000001	train-clean-360	The king was angry 
7938_110128_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Take me to the baby he said 
7938_110128_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll do the deed myself 
none	none	Though they searched long and faithfully they were unable to find the hollow tree where the baby had been left 
7938_110128_000018_000001	train-clean-360	They of course did not wish to return to the hut of the charcoal burner and at length they found their way out of the deep forest 
none	none	No one will ever discover that baby if I could not find it myself She will soon die without food said the page 
7938_110128_000020_000000	train-clean-360	The king agreed that it was quite impossible for the babe to escape death but he could not forget the strange voice which had said 
none	none	Here in this hut is born to night The maiden of your fate You can t escape your lot young king Your fate for you will wait Tis fate tis fate tis fate 
7938_110128_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Now it happened that very day that a woodcutter was working in the forest 
none	none	Suddenly he heard what sounded like the cry of a baby There can t be a child here in the deep forest he said to himself and went on with his work 
7938_110128_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The cry continued however and it sounded very near almost under the woodcutter s feet 
none	none	He looked into the hollow log and there he found a dimpled baby girl wrapped in a bright red sash Poor little thing 
7938_110128_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Her own mother has abandoned her 
7938_110128_000026_000002	train-clean-360	My good wife will be a mother to her he said 
none	none	The woodcutter s wife had no children of her own and received the baby gladly She named her Maria of the forest As the days flew by and the babe thrived under her care she could not have loved her more had she been her own child The weeks and months passed and soon the little Maria of the forest had grown into a lovely little girl five years old Her kind foster mother made a bonnet for her out of the bright red sash which she had found wrapped about her the first time she saw her 
7938_110128_000028_000002	train-clean-360	It made Maria s dark eyes look even brighter than before 
none	none	Now it happened that the king and his page were again hunting in the forest and passed by the house of the wood cutter The page noticed the pretty little girl and the red bonnet she wore 
7938_110128_000029_000002	train-clean-360	He called her to him and examined it carefully 
none	none	There can be no doubt that material is from my own red sash he confessed to the king This woodcutter s daughter could have such a bonnet as this in no other way The king bade him make inquiries about the child and soon the page found out that the little maid was in truth the baby he had left in the hollow tree 
7938_110128_000031_000001	train-clean-360	The king ordered him again to steal her 
7938_110128_000031_000002	train-clean-360	This time the king plotted her death by drowning 
none	none	He had a box made for her put her in it and threw her into the sea with his own hand I refuse to wed any girl brought up in a woodcutter s hut he raged I ll escape that fate Nevertheless he could not escape the memory of the strange voice which had said Here in this hut is born to night The maiden of your fate You can t escape your lot young king Your fate for you will wait Tis fate tis fate tis fate It was most annoying to remember it It happened soon after that a ship encountered the box floating upon the sea 
7938_110128_000037_000001	train-clean-360	The sailors rescued it and opened it with interest 
none	none	Inside they were surprised to find a pretty little dark eyed girl with a bright red bonnet on her head She could not tell them where she had come from but she said her name was Maria of the forest When the sailors arrived in their own country they told the story of finding the child and the king asked to see her He and the queen were so pleased with her lovely face and gentle manners that they received her into the royal palace She was brought up as a lady of waiting to their own little daughter of about the same age When after a dozen years the princess was wedded all the kings of near by countries were invited to the marriage feast The king who had been lost in the forest came with the others At the feast there was no one more beautiful than Maria of the forest

none	none	Who is the girl was his eager question She has been reared in the royal palace as if she were in truth the sister of the bride was the reply The king fell in love with the beautiful maid and gave her a ring 
7938_110128_000042_000001	train-clean-360	The page however was suspicious when he heard her name 
none	none	He lost no time in making inquiries about her What he found out made him very sure that she was in truth the daughter of the charcoal burner

none	none	Never mind said the king I ll wed the maid anyway One can t escape from one s fate THE SEVEN ENCHANTED PRINCES The Story of How Honoria Kept Her Promise Long ago there was a little maid who lived all alone with her grandmother They were very poor The girl s name was Honoria One day the grandmother sent the girl out to sell some of the oranges from their orange tree You must bring home at least three vintens to me she said Don t dare return without at least that small amount of money Honoria went from door to door trying to sell the oranges Every one seemed to have plenty of them that day There was nobody who would purchase a single one She walked on and on through the town everywhere obtaining the same answer We do not wish to purchase any oranges to day Finally she found herself outside the town and in the forest There was a house with the door wide open and on the table in front of the door lay three vintens There was no one in sight and nobody answered Honoria s knock at the door I ll take the money and leave some oranges in place of it said Honoria That will not be stealing Accordingly she selected some of the largest and finest of her oranges and placed them on the table She put the money away carefully to take to her grandmother Then she turned to leave but found that the door was closed She tried her best to open it but could not Neither could she open any of the windows to climb out by that means The windows were all fastened just as securely as the door What shall I do cried the girl who was now thoroughly frightened She did not like the idea of remaining a prisoner in the house in the forest All day she tried to find some way of escape but there seemed nothing to do except to wait until somebody came to her aid This house is not far from the city Surely some one will be passing this way and will come and help me get out said Honoria I hope they ll come before night There was nothing to eat in the house and she was thankful enough for the big basket full of juicy oranges At last it grew dark Then Honoria heard footsteps outside the house She could not see who was coming but a key was turned in the lock and some one entered She was so frightened that she hid under the table A lighted candle showed that seven dwarfs had entered the house They had brought food with them and they at once went to work to prepare their evening meal Who left us all these fine oranges asked one of the dwarfs I do not know replied another Some one has surely been here and it must have been a kind friend Honoria was almost tempted to crawl from under the table and show herself but she decided that it would be better to stay where she was and go home the next day when it was light When morning came however she found that she had been sleeping so soundly that she had not heard the seven dwarfs when they left the house The door was fastened just as securely as before Honoria looked about the house and saw that there was enough work to keep her busy all day There were dishes to wash and floors to sweep and beds to make Fortunately the dwarfs had left plenty of food When night came she heard the footsteps approaching and again hid under the table As soon as the seven dwarfs came into the house they saw that it had been changed wonderfully during their absence Our dishes are all washed cried one of the dwarfs Last night we forgot to wash them after supper Our beds are all made cried another We left home so early this morning we did not have time to make them Our floors are all swept and everything is in order cried another We never have looked so neat and clean Illustration We never have looked so neat and clean Somebody must have been here said one of the dwarfs It is surely a kind friend said another Perhaps they are here yet cried another If they are men we ll treat them like brothers and if they are women we ll treat them like sisters said the seventh dwarf who had not spoken before He had been looking around the house carefully but he had seen no one Honoria crawled out from under the table The dwarfs joined hands and danced around her in a circle We have a big sister now they cried A big sister to take care of us Honoria knew that if she said anything about leaving the dwarfs they would be heartbroken She knew too that her grandmother would give her a terrible beating for staying away from home so long The easiest thing seemed to be to remain in the forest and keep house for the seven dwarfs Weeks and months went by and Honoria led a happy life in the forest The dwarfs brought home plenty of delicious food and they also brought her the prettiest dresses she had ever seen They were green like the moss and the leaves of the forest and brown like the rich earth about the house There was a little hat with red berries upon it which Honoria thought the most charming hat in the world She tried it on and ran to the brook to look at her reflection for there was not a single mirror in the house One day the king passed by with his gay hunting party That day Honoria had on her prettiest moss green dress and the king thought her the loveliest maiden he had ever seen He stopped to chat with her Do you live here in the forest all alone he asked No I keep house for my seven brothers was Honoria s answer What a lovely little housekeeper cried the king Marry me and come to live in the royal palace I must ask my brothers first responded Honoria I will tell you to morrow what they say That night when the seven dwarfs came home Honoria told them about her visit from the king How can we spare our big sister cried one of the dwarfs Who will keep house for us when she goes away cried another Who will make the beds so nicely asked another Who will sweep our floors Who will wash our dishes Who will sew on our buttons I have known that our big sister would marry sometime said the seventh dwarf who had not spoken but who had been thinking quietly Why shouldn t she marry the king We must let her marry the king We must not be selfish cried all the dwarfs together They decided that Honoria should marry the king but they asked her not to let him kiss her until he had first said these words By permission of the seven enchanted princes He would have to remember it without being reminded by Honoria Honoria told the king what her brothers had said and the wedding was celebrated with great joy When the king tried to kiss Honoria she burst into tears He had forgotten all about saying By permission of the seven enchanted princes Honoria would not let the king kiss her and she cried so much and struggled so hard that the king thought she had gone crazy He ordered her shut up in the dark cell underneath the palace Then he married a new queen Now it happened that there was a faithful servant who was quite sure that Honoria was not crazy When Honoria told her of the words which the king must say before he kissed her this servant tried to think of some way to help her She was very angry at the fact that there was a new queen One day she went to the queen and said Queen Honoria who is shut up in the dark cell underneath the palace is much more clever than you are What does Queen Honoria do that is so clever asked the new queen Queen Honoria will take a sword and cut off her head Then she will put it back on again so that it is as good as new I don t believe you are clever enough to do that I never tried it answered the new queen but just to show you that I m as clever as Queen Honoria I ll do it With these words she seized a sword and cut off her head Of course she fell dead immediately The king married a new queen Then the servant went to the new queen and said Queen Honoria who is shut up in the dark cell underneath the palace is more clever than you are The new queen was indignant at this remark Why is she more clever than I am she asked What can she do that I can t do She can take a sword and cut off her hand Then she ll stick the hand on again and it will be as good as new I ve never tried it but I ll do it just to convince you that I am clever too said this new queen She took up a sword and cut off her right hand Then she fainted away The arm grew full of poison and the queen soon died but not until she had told the king what the servant had said to her The king was very angry at the servant and called her to him What do you mean he thundered by telling such a story about Queen Honoria s magic powers I wanted you to remember where you had found Queen Honoria replied the servant Then the king suddenly remembered how he had first seen Queen Honoria when she was in the house in the forest He thought of how pretty she had been in the dress which looked like soft green moss Then he thought of how she had said that she must ask permission of her seven brothers before she consented to become his queen By permission of the seven enchanted princes he cried I forgot to say these words before I kissed my dear Queen Honoria He quickly ran to the dark cell underneath the palace where she was confined He said the magic words and kissed his fair queen who was just as beautiful as before she had been shut up in the cell though a trifle paler In the house in the forest the seven dwarfs who were in truth seven enchanted princes suddenly were disenchanted Our dear sister Honoria did not forget us after all they cried in joy THE LISTENING KING The Story of the Trouble Which Came to Him Once upon a time there lived a king who liked to walk in disguise about the streets of the city listening at people s doors It was in fact his favorite amusement Other kings of that land had been fond of war or hunting or fishing or games but there had never before been one who liked to listen at doors For this reason he was called the listening king It is the greatest fun I have he often said to his counsellors Being a king would be a stupid life if one didn t have some diversion Be careful that it does not get you into trouble said the wise men We have often heard that listening to other people s secrets is a dangerous practice I ve had nothing but pleasure from it anyway the king would reply Then he would add So far at least Sometimes he would take a friend or two with him and sometimes he would go alone The habit of listening at doors became more and more a favorite one to him as the months and years passed Now in that city there lived a man of humble station who had three pretty daughters One evening the king passed his house and stopped at the door to listen Whom would you like to marry one of the girls was asking It happened to be the youngest one I d like to marry the royal baker the eldest sister replied Why asked the youngest one So that I might always eat fresh bread was the reply Whom would you like to marry the youngest sister asked the middle one I d like to marry the royal meat cook so that I might always eat meat roasted just to a turn was her answer Whom would you like to marry asked the eldest and the middle sister together I d like to marry the listening king himself was the reply which their youngest sister made Silly Silly cried her two sisters We have perhaps a chance of getting our wishes but what chance have you If one wishes for nothing splendid one never gets anything splendid replied the youngest sister with a blush which made her look very charming to the king as he peeped through the keyhole The king went away with a shrewd smile upon his face The next day he sent for the three sisters to come to the palace They were very much frightened Well said the king to the eldest girl do you want to marry the royal baker Yes your majesty she replied I have no objections The king turned to her sister How is it with you he asked What do you say to marrying the royal meatcook I ll be most happy to marry him your majesty she answered The youngest girl was blushing like a rose and her heart was thumping so that she could scarcely breathe The king smiled as he noticed her fair head bowed upon her breast Would you like to marry the listening king he asked her gently Yes your majesty she responded so low that the king could hardly hear her Very well said the king I ll have all these weddings celebrated at once Thus it happened that the two eldest sisters got their wishes and married the royal baker and the royal meatcook while the youngest one wedded the listening king himself The others were very angry at her luck and their hearts were filled with envy Why didn t we wish to be queens or at least princesses one asked the other It would have been just as easy to have had our wishes granted Why didn t we Why didn t we How stupid we were cried the other They passed the time in plotting against their youngest sister the queen A year flew by and twin sons were born to the royal pair They had gold stars on their foreheads The whole kingdom was filled with rejoicing As for the listening king he was so happy that he forgot to listen at people s doors The only persons in the whole country who were not happy were the two jealous sisters They stole the tiny babies out of the palace and threw them into the river Trouble has at last come to our listening king said the wise men when the loss was discovered The basket in which the twins had been placed floated away down the stream It was found by a miller What have we here he asked his wife as together they removed the cover from the basket I guess it is something good to eat said his wife What do you think it is I guess it is a poor little puppy which some one wanted to drown replied the miller Then they took the cover off the basket The two babies opened their eyes and smiled just then The miller and his wife were the most surprised people in the whole country and also the happiest ones Illustration The miller and his wife were the most surprised people in the whole country What beautiful children cried the miller Let s keep them cried his wife Of course we ll keep them replied the miller The good God himself must have sent them to us in answer to our prayers Just then the miller s wife noticed the golden stars upon their foreheads What does this mean she asked I don t know answered her husband as he examined them carefully Perhaps it is just a sign that they are truly the gift of God The miller and his wife cared for the two children as if they had been their own They lived such a long distance from the palace that they never heard the news that the royal babes were missing As the two boys grew older they became the handsomest cleverest lads in the whole kingdom The gold stars shone and twinkled upon their foreheads At last the miller s wife made little caps for them to wear to hide the stars They were altogether too conspicuous Then one sad summer a pestilence came upon the land and the good miller and his wife died The two children were left alone in the world The listening king had decreed all the orphaned children in the kingdom should be brought to the royal city that they might be fed and cared for The miller s two orphans went with the others and the king s wicked sister in laws saw them They recognized them at once because of the golden stars upon their foreheads We must make a new plot to destroy the royal children said one sister to the other And we must be quick about it or the king or queen will see them and recognize them too by the golden stars Are you quite sure these are the two royal babes we threw into the river asked the other sister doubtfully It is a bit difficult for me to believe that our sister s children can be so handsome I m entirely certain of it assured her sister There is no one except the royal babes who could have those golden stars While the wicked sisters plotted the two children had approached the royal gardens Inside the garden there was a beautiful parrot with feathers of green and gold I m going to catch that bird said one of the brothers Wait here while I go inside the gates He could not catch the parrot and he called his brother to come and help him Together they succeeded and with the beautiful green and gold parrot tightly clutched they tried to slip outside the gate of the royal gardens Just as they were almost out the great gates swiftly closed and caught their garments We re caught We re caught cried the two children How can we ever get the gates unfastened At the sound of their cries the royal gardeners the courtiers and the listening king himself came to the rescue When the king saw the golden stars upon their foreheads he leaned against the nearest tree for support What children are these he asked in a voice which shook I never saw them before replied the head gardener I think they are some of the orphan children which the great mercy and clemency of your royal majesty have caused to be rescued from the plague Who are your parents my children asked one of the courtiers We are the children of the good miller and his wife they replied Our kind foster parents are now dead with the plague Where did this miller and his wife find you asked the king eagerly Then the two children told the story of how the miller had found them in a basket in the river They knew it well for it was their favorite story of all the ones which the miller s wife had told them The courtiers looked at each other in amazement Every one had noticed the bright stars shining on the children s brows I believe you are the two dear babes lost from this palace cried the king as he took them in his arms Who put them in that basket asked the king s counsellors If I knew you may be sure that fitting punishment would be visited upon them cried the king The beautiful green and gold parrot had escaped from the children s arms and had flown back to a tree near the gates of the royal gardens Suddenly he was heard to speak Go find the king s sisters in law were the words he said The king s sisters in law were quickly brought into the garden A look at their guilty faces convinced every one that they were the ones who had placed the royal babes in the basket and had thrown them into the river You shall now receive the punishment which you have so richly deserved cried the king as he frowned upon them sternly Where is the good queen some one asked The queen had been sleeping in her own apartments and had not heard the noise in the garden When the courtiers brought her there and she saw the two handsome boys with the bright stars shining on their foreheads she fainted with the joy of it JOSE THE BEAST SLAYER The Story of a Boy Who Grew Up in the Forest There was once a king who had a little daughter

none	none	For twelve years you must keep your daughter in a tower in the forest It should have no door only a little window through which you may pass food to her 
7881_110131_000003_000001	train-clean-360	You must give her meat which has no bones in it 
7881_110131_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The king ordered a tower constructed in the deep forest 
7881_110131_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It had no door and only a little window 
7881_110131_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Here the princess was placed 
none	none	Every day food was passed to her through the little window 
7881_110131_000004_000004	train-clean-360	The king himself took charge of this so that he might be sure that there was no meat given her which had bones in it 
7881_110131_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The years flew by and at last the twelve year period was nearly up Then the king went away one day and left the servants to carry food to the princess 
7881_110131_000005_000001	train-clean-360	They were careless and gave her meat which had a bone in it 
7881_110131_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The little princess had grown very tired of being shut up in the tower of the forest

7881_110131_000007_000002	train-clean-360	I ve tried in vain to make it bigger with my fingers 
7881_110131_000008_000000	train-clean-360	She used the bone to dig away the wall each side of the window and soon the little opening had grown so large that the princess could lean her head out of it and look up at lofty trees 
7881_110131_000008_000001	train-clean-360	That very day a duke passed that way on a hunting expedition and saw the beautiful princess in the tower

7881_110131_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The princess had gone with the duke across a great river which no one else knew how to cross 
7881_110131_000011_000001	train-clean-360	She lived in a big cave in the rocks and after all the years in the tower it seemed a wonderful home indeed She was never tired of admiring the trees and flowers of the forest and listening to the songs of the birds 
7881_110131_000011_000002	train-clean-360	When at last her baby son was born she thought that she was the very happiest person in the whole world

7881_110131_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll come and get you 
7881_110131_000015_000000	train-clean-360	To her amazement he crossed the great river in safety and bravely escorted his mother to the other bank in spite of her tears and cries of fear

7881_110131_000017_000000	train-clean-360	They went to a church and the boy was baptized 
none	none	Jose the Beast Slayer was the name he chose Then they wandered on until at last they came to a house with a door in which a little window had been cut

7881_110131_000019_000001	train-clean-360	There was nobody there and there was nothing to eat Accordingly Jose went out begging 
7881_110131_000019_000002	train-clean-360	He asked alms at the royal palace and there he was given money to buy food 
7881_110131_000019_000003	train-clean-360	There was even enough left over to pay for a gun

constellation of the Hyades her sisters rather than wed an unworthy husband Euphemia became a Christian they say through the efforts of the cherubim She decided to come down to earth and go about doing good deeds Accordingly she came to the island called Seven Cities Now in the island of Seven Cities there lived a rich and venerable Christian prince He adopted Euphemia as his own daughter She

It was as if every day were a feast day Time passed Many changes came to the island but Euphemia herself remained always young always beautiful One day two priests from the outside world visited the island They saw the magnificent palaces the beautiful gardens Two tame lions followed them about They were as gentle as if they had been dogs We are in the celestial regions said one priest to the other Let us stay here forever said the other priest It is indeed the Paradise of which we have dreamed The two priests had come in a tiny launch from a large boat We should return and tell our friends about this celestial region they agreed To morrow we will all explore this wonderful country It was almost dark when the two priests reached their ship by the little launch They reported all the things they had heard and seen in the new land The next morning however the island had entirely disappeared The water stretched before their gaze with an unbroken rippling blue surface What has become of our beautiful island the good priests asked in amazement We were anchored off the shore of one of the enchanted islands was the opinion of everybody Euphemia they say has not yet disappeared entirely She has changed her form She is still found in the Azores in the plant called SOLANEA the flower of saint Cosmo She is still doing good deeds Pain disappears when she comes just as it did in

child safe in her arms They rode upon an ass The Virgin glanced fearfully behind her as they went along the way At any moment Herod s messengers might come in pursuit The tracks of the ass showed plainly in the dusty road Oh cried the Holy Mother Our enemies will see our tracks They will know in what direction we have fled The Alveloa was nearby and heard She spread out her tail like a fan and shook it about in the dusty road The tracks of the ass were completely brushed away The Holy Mother smiled upon her For this kind deed little bird your tail shall be always in motion By this sign you shall be known and your life shall be spared To this very day the tail of the Alveloa is in motion saint Michael himself the patron of the island of S Miguel has asked a special protection for the little bird in his island The Alveloa flew all the way before the Virgin showing her the road into Egypt My blessing upon you little bird said the Virgin May you always have the strength to slay your enemy To this very day the Alveloa is able to slay birds much larger than herself The Alveloa kills the hawk is a saying in the Azores If one wakes in the morning and sees this little gray and white bird before his window he will have a lucky day On the way into Egypt the Virgin pointed to the lupine which grew by the wayside Eat little bird she said Eat until your hunger is satisfied Blessings

THE DOOR LIKE THE MOTHER OF saint PETER A Story of Why She Stays Outside If there is no response when you ring the bell or knock at a door in the Azores you have to stay outside the door like the mother of saint Peter they say This is the story which tells why the mother of saint Peter had to stay outside The very stingiest woman in the whole city was saint Peter s mother She was so stingy that she never gave away a single thing to a beggar No matter if the beggar were old or sick or blind or crippled or even a mother with a babe in her arms she always made the same reply I have nothing to give away Not even when there was famine in the land but plenty in her own home would the mother of saint Peter share with the unfortunate When saint Peter was made the guardian of the keys of Heaven of course he tried to bring his mother inside the celestial gate When your mother lived upon the earth did she ever share her plenty with any of my poor unfortunate children was the question saint Peter thought hard His mother had been a worthy virtuous woman in many respects but he could recall nothing which she had ever given to the poor and the unfortunate At last he remembered a day when she had gone into the garden to get vegetables for the soup A poor beggar woman had stood outside the garden gate crying Alms Alms for the love of God Illustration Alms Alms Get away from my garden said saint Peter s mother I have no alms to give you If I give away the vegetables from my garden I d soon have nothing left to feed my own family I d be begging myself The poor beggar woman started to turn away with tears in her eyes An onion stalk fell from the hand of saint Peter s mother It was bruised by its fall and covered with mud but the beggar seized it eagerly Keep it I wouldn t use it anyway snapped saint Peter s mother saint Peter could remember nothing else to tell so he related this story Go and find the onion was the comment When saint Peter at last found that onion stalk it was still dirty with the mud of the garden and crumpled by its fall just as it had been when his mother had given it to the beggar Hold out the onion and pull your mother in was the order saint Peter held out the onion stalk It did not reach very far down into Purgatory but his mother jumped up as high as she could and seized it eagerly Slowly and very carefully he pulled her up by it to the Heavenly Gate Just as she was about to enter the door the onion stalk broke I m sorry You ll have to stay outside said saint Peter I ve done the best I could for you The onion stalk was not strong enough to pull you through Thus it happens that the mother of saint Peter has to stay outside the door of Heaven WHY THE OWL FLIES AT NIGHT A Story of Good saint Anthony Long ago there was an image of the good saint Anthony washed ashore by the rough waves of the Bay of Angra A little chapel was built to receive it on the steep slopes of Monte Brasil overlooking the bay and here it still remains Once upon a time a little boy named Pedro lived in a tiny cottage near saint Anthony s shrine His mother had died and his father had married a new wife who was often cruel to him She dressed him in ragged shabby clothes and the other children of the parish often pointed their fingers at him in scorn because of his poor garments One day as Pedro knelt before the image of the good saint a strange thing happened His clothing became new and whole He was dressed as well as any boy in the parish Where did you get clothes like this asked the stepmother when he came home that night I always knew you were a good for nothing I believe you have stolen them Little Pedro told what had happened but the woman would not believe him Don t stand there talking any longer she cried Take the water jars and go to the spring and fill them for me Hurry I don t want to be kept waiting for the water Pedro lifted the two great water jars which stood on the floor and slowly climbed up the hill to the little spring which supplied water for the family needs during the greater part of the year Just now the spring had failed as the stepmother had found out that very day Illustration Pedro lifted the two great jars and slowly climbed up the hill There is no water in the spring now said an old man whom little Pedro met on the way The boy had almost reached the spring and the big jars were growing heavy even though they were empty I m so nearly there I ll go on and see for myself decided the lad The other spring is so far away and the jars will be so heavy that I can never carry them all the long distance Perhaps there is still a little water here When he reached the spring he was surprised to see the water flowing faster than in many a day He remembered too the new suit of clothes he was wearing Luck is with me to day he cried as he filled the water jars The good saint Anthony is my friend He it is who has given me my handsome clothing and he it is who has blessed the spring for me When he returned home with the jars full of water his stepmother stared at him in amazement He had not been gone long enough to obtain it from the farther spring Where did you get this water she asked as soon as she could find words with which to speak Pedro told her that it came from the spring just as it always did That spring is dry to day she cried Now I know that you are a liar as well as a thief Just wait until your father comes home I ll see that you get the beating you deserve Pedro wondered why she had sent him to the spring if she had believed it to be dry and while he was thinking of this the angry woman gave him a big basket Here she said Go out in the garden and pick up some wood for me Hurry Don t keep me waiting Your slow ways drive me mad Pedro knew that all the wood in the garden had been picked up long ago Now there was nothing in the garden except roses There were red roses and pink roses and yellow roses and white roses but not a single stick of wood High up on the steep slopes of Monte Brasil there might be wood to gather but the night was dark and the path was steep and long Little Pedro was very tired so tired that two great tears rolled down his cheeks Suddenly the good saint Anthony from the little chapel stood before him He smiled kindly at the child Why are you crying my boy asked the saint I have watched you carefully for a long time and I know you seldom give way to tears though often your burdens are so heavy that a boy less brave would do little else than weep I have to fill my basket with wood and there is nothing except roses in our garden replied Pedro I m tired and it is very dark on Monte Brasil to search there for wood Here dear boy said the saint smiling Just pick the roses and fill your basket with them Then take them to your stepmother and see what she will say to you I ll be with you Pedro filled his big basket with the lovely red and yellow and pink and white roses which grew in the garden in such rich abundance Then he ran into the house with them As the light from the candles fell upon them to his amazement he saw that they were no longer roses The basket was full of wood Where did you get this wood cried the woman angrily There are only roses in the garden Where have you been She seized Pedro roughly by the collar of his new coat and shook him until his teeth chattered He looked up into the saint s eyes saint Anthony s face was stern Stop woman cried the voice which a moment before had been so kind and gentle Now it thundered forth in stern accents This little lad has done no harm You have been guilty of a desire to bring harm to him For this cruelty take the punishment which you so richly merit It is you who have sent this child out into the night Now it is I who sends you out into the night From that moment Pedro s stepmother was no longer a woman She was changed into an owl with her eyes the big round circles they had looked when she had gazed up into the fierce face of angry saint Anthony To this very day the owl has to fly by night Illustration Headpiece THE LABORER AND HIS MASTER The Story of a Man Who Outfitted Another Once upon a time there was a laborer who said to his master It is time to plant the fields Very well said his master The part which grows above the ground shall be mine and you shall have in payment for your labor the part which grows below the ground Agreed said the laborer He planted the fields with potatoes His master had nothing but the tops outside the earth The laborer harvested many baskets of potatoes that year and sold them for a goodly sum The master was angry because of this Next harvest time said he we ll see about things You shall give me what grows below the ground and keep for yourself what grows above Agreed said the laborer That is perfectly fair to me The laborer planted the fields with wheat His master had nothing but the roots while he harvested a rich crop of wheat which he sold for much money I ll settle with you said his master The laborer was frightened Don t be afraid said his wife When your master comes let me talk to him The woman gashed her face and hands with the pruning knife The master came to the door and she opened it Where is your husband he asked He is sharpening his nails said she See what ugly scratches I already have upon my hands and face The master went away without punishing the laborer TIS FAITH WHICH SAVES The Story of a Maid Who Was Betrothed to One She Trusted There was once upon a time a fair maid who lived in the island of Fayal She was betrothed to a young man of the same island One day she fell ill with a disease which baffled the skill of all the physicians Their arts the mourning of her betrothed the prayers and tears of her mother all seemed of no avail It appeared that the fair maid would die Illustration It appeared that the fair maid would die Now it happened that in one of the nearby islands saint Michael there was a miracle working image called the Santo Christo The fair maid begged of her betrothed that he would go to saint Michael and procure some of the mysterious miracle working sweat of the Santo Christo or some of the miraculous parings of the nails of the image which had the power to heal any disease The young man gladly set out on the quest On the boat which conveyed him to saint Michael however he met a maid with beauty and charm a maid whose bright eyes made him forget the sad eyes of his betrothed When he arrived at his destination he thought only of singing gay songs beneath the balcony of his new love The days flew by and soon it was time for the boat to return to Fayal He had forgotten the mission on which he had come and he returned to the boat with no relics of the miracle working Santo Christo The homeward journey was rough and stormy Filled with fear of death at any moment the young man remembered the fair maid of Fayal who even at that very hour might be dying His conscience smote him Oh why did I allow another fair face to crowd out from my heart the image of my beloved he asked himself Faithless wretch that I am what shall I say to my betrothed if good fortune and the sea permit me to stand once more at her side The rough waves beat angrily against the side of the boat in answer That night the storm ceased and in the morning it was fair and clear as the boat entered the beautiful harbor of Fayal under the shadow of Mt Pico With clear skies and smooth seas the young man s conscience became less troublesome He resolved that he would not confess his deceit to his betrothed If I told her it might make her grow worse so rapidly that she would die because of it he said to himself Indeed it was quite enough to have made the girl die of a broken heart had she known the whole story Suddenly the youth s face clouded What shall I say to my beloved as the reason why I have brought back to her neither the miracle working sweat of the Santo Christo nor the miraculous nail parings he was asking His eye fell upon the boat s wooden side Quickly he shaved off some fine parings of this wood He wrapped them up carefully and took them to the fair maid of Fayal as if they were parings from the nails of the miracle working image His betrothed s face shone with joy at his return Tears of thankfulness filled her eyes when she saw the parings which he had brought her How can I ever thank you for your faithfulness in this quest in my behalf and the great love which prompted you to undertake this stormy dangerous journey on the rough seas that I might once more be well The young man did not enjoy hearing her speak of his love and faithfulness He did not reply No maid was ever blessed with so wonderful a lover went on the happy girl You are forgetting to take the parings said the mother They will not cure you if you do not take them The fair maid of Fayal took the parings in a gourd full of water She began to improve immediately and the next day she was entirely well Tis faith which saves and not parings said her betrothed saint BRENDAN S ISLAND The Story of the Little Maid Who Found It There was once an Irish monk called saint Brendan One day he received a visit from a hermit who told him of a most marvelous island Come and visit this earthly Paradise said the hermit There the sun always shines The birds wear golden crowns upon their heads and speak like humans The perfume of the island clung to the garments of the hermit for forty days Good saint Brendan asked many questions about the mysterious island and at last resolved to visit it and see for himself if all the wonders of which he had heard were really true Accordingly he built a coracle of wattle covered with hides tanned in oak bark and softened with butter He loaded it with provisions to last for forty days Then he persuaded some of his disciples to accompany him This was somewhat difficult for they were timid about embarking upon this dangerous expedition in the frail boat saint Brendan however succeeded in overcoming their fears and set out with a little group of his most devoted followers It was seven years before they returned to their native land They were even more enthusiastic about their wonderful island than the hermit had been They urged others to go and find out its marvels but nobody else was ever able to locate it They say that the island of saint Brendan was a floating island in the Atlantic Good saint Brendan did not die but kept on living in the earthly Paradise of his isle When the Christians were hard pressed in their battles with the Moors and were about to be pushed back into the sea the island of saint Brendan appeared upon the horizon and the good saint himself came to fight against the Moors and bring victory to the Christians In the middle of the fifteenth century there was a little maid called Maria who lived in the island of Terceira She heard the story of saint Brendan s isle from a Franciscan brother Day and night she dreamed of it She often sat upon the hillside of Monte Brasil looking eagerly out over the broad expanse of sea hoping with all her heart that the island would appear to her One day there landed in Terceira a cavalier of Rhodes named Vital From his grandfather he had inherited some of the sacred relics of saint Brendan He had come to the Azores in his search for the mysterious island On his doublet he wore an eight pointed star and a band upon which was embroidered in scarlet silk the motto By Faith It was indeed by faith that he had embarked upon his quest The little maid Maria fell in love with him the moment she heard of him and his errand She worshiped him as if he had been the good saint Brendan himself but when she was with him she sat with downcast eyes her long dark eyelashes sweeping her delicate cheek and did not give him a glance much less a word The young cavalier loved the little maid He divided his holy relics of saint Brendan with her and in return he begged of her that she might speak a word of love To tell my love to you said Maria I d have to be where nobody but God could hear Indeed it was quite true that Maria needed to be where nobody but the good God could hear her when she spoke of her love for the cavalier Vital The son of the wealthy Captain of the district had long admired her delicate beauty He had already sought her for his bride His jealousy against Vital rose up like a burning flame He went to Maria and demanded that she should marry him at once Maria firmly refused If you do not wed me said the captain s son I shall have my father lock you up in the stronghold of saint Louis on the hillside I should prefer to spend all my days confined in the castle of saint Louis rather than be your wife said she Why can t you leave me in peace with my relics of the good saint Brendan The mention of saint Brendan s relics stirred the young man s wrath even more He well knew who it was who had given her the holy relics His threat was fulfilled and she was taken that very day to the castle of saint Louis and locked up in that stronghold Her room had a window and there she sat high up in the tower of the castle looking down at the city of Angra beneath her I had longed to serve the good God she cried Why is it that my life has been made useless At that very moment the earth trembled The strong walls of the castle shook as if they had been built of paper Near the fort two doves were sitting on the branches of a cedar tree Let us rescue this fair maid said one dove to the other Yes let us carry her away on our wings agreed the other That instant the earth shook so that the walls of the stronghold fell to the ground The two doves spread out their snow white wings and bore Maria away in safety Over houses and churches they flew Over treetops and the broad expanse of the sea they rose The city the island the sea all disappeared from Maria s sight She felt so dizzy that she closed her eyes When she opened them again she was in an island of such beauty as she had never dreamed It was indeed a garden of Paradise The good saint Brendan himself she saw was the gardener The earthquake caused much damage in the island of Terceira When the disappearance of Maria was known throughout the little city of Angra nobody mourned for her as did the young cavalier Vital What is the island to me without Maria he asked in sorrow Once more he embarked upon the sea in his search for the island of saint Brendan Long days and long nights he tossed about on the ocean One evening just at sunset he saw the clouds of heaven descending to earth like a white ladder Then he observed far away upon the horizon an island He knew in his heart that he had at last a glimpse of saint Brendan s isle Illustration One evening just at sunset A gentle breeze swelled his sails and sent him rapidly toward it As he drew near he saw his loved Maria standing with her arms outstretched A bright light shone about her To speak of my love to you said she I have to be where nobody but God can hear God and the gardener of this island saint Brendan THE SILENT CAVALIER The Story of the Peach Tree In the early days when the Azores had just been discovered there were many Flemish settlers who came to the islands Among them there was a young cavalier of the order of saint George of Borgonha His name was Jesus Maria and the reason why he had come was because a wise monk had told him that his path in life lay by way of the sea Your name given to you in Holy Baptism said the monk is Iesvs Maria Transpose the letters and it says in Latin Maris es via The young cavalier agreed that the sea must be his path of destiny and he at once set sail upon a long voyage which finally led him to the island of Fayal He loved the rocky coast where the waves beat He loved the deep ravine where the laughing brook ran the lake in the ancient crater the snow capped summit of Mt Pico which smiled down in stately majesty from the opposite island He decided that this was to be his home My path of Destiny was indeed the sea he said The sea has brought me to a country which is very fair In the island of Fayal there were already some Portuguese settlers One of these had a beautiful daughter Ida The young Flemish cavalier thought that she was the fairest maid he had ever seen He fell deeply in love with her Now the cavaliers of the order of saint George of Borgonha had vowed that they would never wed Jesus Maria could not break the solemn pledge which he had given when he joined the order Neither could he forget the bright eyes of the Portuguese maiden Ida It seemed as if his heart would break I will leave this island and return to my own country he thought Then he remembered the words which the wise monk had said about the sea being his path He had followed that road and it had led him to a fair island home He decided that he could not return to his native land of Flanders Over across the shining blue water he looked up at the peaceful snow capped summit of Mt Pico The sight of its majestic stillness seemed to give him strength to hold his tongue and keep him from speaking words of love to the beautiful Portuguese maiden Never a word of love broke from him The maiden Ida never knew the shrine she occupied in the heart of the Flemish cavalier Illustration The peaceful snow capped summit of Mt Pico The days dragged slowly by The young man could bear no more He felt that his strength could no longer endure on the same island with Ida If he stayed near her he would break his vow One morning in a little boat he crossed the blue waters to the island of Pico At the foot of the majestic mountain he loved he built the little hut which was to be his home He never returned to the island of Fayal and as the years went by he was spoken of as the good hermit of Pico Nobody knew his secret When at last the Cavalier Jesus Maria died a peach tree grew from his tomb the emblem of silence The leaf of this tree has the form of the human tongue Its fruit has a stone shaped somewhat like the human heart From this stone there comes a seed which when planted produces a new tree Thus it is that words which bear fruit spring from the heart It is silence which teaches one the gift of fruitful words they say in the Azores THE ENCHANTED PALACE The Story of Lake Ginjal In the village of Altos Ares in the island of Terceira there lived once upon a time a fair maid who had been baptized Perola which means Pearl As she grew older she was indeed like a rare pearl among the other maidens of the village so great was the charm of her unusual beauty She was the joy of her home and of the whole community for her disposition was as lovely as her face One bright spring morning Perola leaned over the cistern where she had gone to get water Her reflection showed so plainly in the water that she paused to gaze into the smiling eyes of her own mirrored face As she did so a magic spell was woven about her The water fairy who had come to the cistern had seen her great beauty and had thrown a charm over her In a moment more she fell into the cistern to join her reflection there When Perola could not be found there was great excitement in the little village Nobody could guess what had become of her Her mother prayed devoutly for her safety in the church of saint Roque All the villagers sought for her in every possible place Now at the north of the island of Terceira there are groups of tiny rocks in the sea which are called the Biscoitos or biscuits Here there lived a wise old woman who had a great reputation among all the people of the island for her knowledge Let us go to consult the wise woman of Biscoitos said one of the village youths when they had sought long and faithfully for a trace of the hiding place into which Perola might have vanished Accordingly the young men of Altos Ares went to the wise woman and this is what she told them The fair pearl of your village is safe from the fishers of pearls She is hidden away in an enchanted palace of marble and ivory and tortoise shell and mother of pearl The water fairy had taken Perola through an underground passage which led from the cistern to the beautiful enchanted palace in the lake of Ginjal There she was kept in hiding The fairies never dreamed that anybody would ever be able to guess where she was Illustration The beautiful enchanted palace in the lake of Ginjal Now with the words of the wise woman of Biscoitos to guide them the youths of Altos Ares organized an expedition to search for their lost playmate The sons of the magistrate the rich men the learned men of the island of Terceira joined this expedition They searched through the whole island for a place where an enchanted palace might be located At last upon saint John s Day when the days and nights are of equal length this band of the brave youths of Terceira came to the shores of Lake Ginjal in the interior of the island This is surely the enchanted place Here in this lake must lie the fairies palace of marble and ivory and tortoise shell and mother of pearl somebody cried How shall we be able to approach this magic palace and rescue Perola asked one How shall we be able to break her enchantment asked another Let us camp here upon the border of the lake and consider how best to proceed said the leader of the expedition Now at that very hour on saint John s Day the mother of Perola was in the church of saint Roque in Altos Ares praying devoutly for her daughter s safe return Suddenly she heard a strange voice These were the words which fell upon her ears Your prayers and the perseverance of the youths of the island have at last triumphed Go in peace On the day of saint Peter at the hour of sunset your daughter shall be restored to you Her enchantment shall be broken and she shall be brought to the bank of Lake Ginjal in a boat of ivory drawn by a snow white swan When the youths encamped upon the shore of the lake heard these tidings they set up such a shout of joy that it was indeed enough to break any enchantment At the time appointed Perola was brought to the bank of the lake in a boat of ivory drawn by a snow white swan just as fair and lovely as upon the day when she had vanished from the little village of Altos Ares This is the story of the Lake of Ginjal It is quite probable that the enchanted palace of the water fairies is still there THE FRIEND OF THE DEVIL A Story of the Islands in the Bay of Angra Once upon a time there was a handsome Flemish youth who came to the island of Fayal His name was Fernao de Hutra He fell in love with a beautiful nun in the convent of the Gloria in the city of Horta One day the Devil appeared to him Since you fell in love with this fair nun I see you are a friend of mine said the Devil The young man had not known this but he replied Say rather that I will be your friend if you help me get possession of this nun I love Very well said the Devil but you will have to make a bargain with me What is it asked Fernao rather anxiously Grant me your solemn pledge that you ll give me all your children responded the Devil Agreed said Fernao After that he saw much of the Devil The nun however was as devout as she was beautiful She refused to break the vows she had made and flee with the Flemish youth She firmly resisted both him and the Devil You are not a true friend to me after all said Fernao to the Devil sadly But you are my friend said the Devil in reply Soon after Fernao de Hutra left the city of Horta and the island of Fayal and went to join his kinsmen who had settled in Angra in the island of Terceira Here his handsome face won many friends for him among the youth of the city To some of these he confided the story of his relations with the Devil Now it happened that in the year sixteen sixty six the first bull fight was held in Angra To this very day the island of Terceira is the only one in the Azores which has bull fights Fernao had taken part in this He was one of the chief organizers of the bull fight held on saint John s Day of the following year That day all the men and women and children of the city of Angra assembled in the public square before the fort The bullfighters richly clad rode forth upon prancing steeds decked in costly velvets with streamers and ribbons of gold and silver which sparkled in the bright sunlight The youths were resplendent in their garments of crimson or purple or blue velvet richly embroidered Fernao de Hutra was radiant in his jacket of blue decked with pearls with a plumed hat upon his handsome head He carried a yellow banner embroidered with the arms of his family Gay music sounded The bulls were brought into the ring The bullfighters saluted and the fight began In the windows of the castle the daughters of the chief magistrate of the city of Angra were seated among their friends The eldest daughter Sophia was the most beautiful maid of the whole city The magistrate watched her anxiously as her fair cheek alternately paled and flushed as the struggle went on There could be no doubt about the fact that there was love in her eyes as they rested upon the handsome young Flemish cavalier Fernao de Hutra She was wearing his colors and in her hand she carefully held his bouquet of flowers The ribbon which tied them secured also a piece of paper upon which were written these words Oh beautiful maid of my heart s desire For your dear sake I d go through fire The magistrate withdrew from the gay scene into the silence of the great hall of the castle He bowed his head upon his hands Illustration He bowed his head upon his hands This youth is the friend of the Devil he groaned I cannot consent to my daughter s marriage to him He has promised to give all his children to the Devil they say I cannot allow my own grandchildren to be given to the Devil That very day he began to plot how to get rid of the handsome young Fernao Now in the bay before the city of Angra there are two rocky islands called to day just as they were then the Ilheos de Cabras the islands of goats The brother in law of the magistrate was the owner of these barren islands There were a few goats there a few mulberry bushes and a tiny spring of fresh water The magistrate called his brother in law to him as soon as the bull fight was over He told him all his fears and asked if he might use the islands as a place of banishment for the young Flemish cavalier who was the friend of the Devil You are quite welcome to use these islands for so worthy a purpose replied his brother in law Indeed I have often thought that the deep cave on the island led into Inferno It is a most fitting spot for the habitation of the Devil s friend Thus it happened that the handsome young Flemish cavalier was seized and borne away to the barren rocky islands in the Bay of Angra When he was received there a great earthquake shook the whole island of Terceira When at last the people of the city of Angra were through contemplating all the destruction which had been wrought some one looked in the direction of the island of goats They saw that a great piece had been broken away from one of the islands Thus it was that the Devil received his friend THE MILLER S CLOAK The Story of a Man Who Tried to Stay Home from Church There was once a pious miller He was always to be found in the church praying He prayed for the dead He prayed for those who were alive He prayed for all who suffered for the homeless ones for the hungry ones He prayed for those upon the sea and those upon the land Now it happened that a terrible storm smote the island The sea beat high against the rocky coast Lightning flashed Thunder roared The wind howled The rain fell in torrents as if it were a flood Don t go out in the storm to night counselled his wife It is not a suitable night for one to go to church I agree with you replied the miller I do not need to go to the church in this fierce storm Surely my prayers of other days and nights have been so many that to night I have earned rest in my own dry house The good God will pardon me The miller wrapped his heavy brown cloak about him and lay down upon his bed The wind shrieked Thunder shook the earth Unseen hands pulled the miller s cloak from off his bed The wind has blown out the candle Light another cried the miller to his wife By the dim light of the candle the good miller again arranged his bed He wrapped his heavy mantle about him and once more tried to sleep Again his cloak was pulled from off his bed as if by unseen hands There was no rest for the miller that night His cloak could not be made to cover him as he lay upon his bed I might as well go to church and pray he told his wife I can t rest here He wrapped himself in the brown cloak and went out to the church through the fierce blinding storm He prayed for the dead He prayed for those who were alive He prayed for all who suffered for the homeless ones the hungry ones He prayed for those upon the sea for those upon the land Illustration He wrapped himself in the brown cloak and went out through the fierce blinding storm Surely the prayers of the pious are needed this night said the miller to his wife when he came in out of the fierce storm Lightning flashed Thunder roared The rain fell in torrents The wind howled and drove the pouring rain against the windows It blew in sheets through the door before the miller had time to close it behind him The storm beat upon the thatched roof as if it would carry it away Quick your cloak cried the miller s wife Take it off that I may dry it by the fire The good man started to obey As he touched his cloak however his eyes opened wide in amazement It was entirely dry Feel it yourself said he to his wife There is not a drop of rain upon it The miller s wife discovered that his words were true It is a miracle of God cried she as she crossed herself THE MAGIC MOUTHFUL The Story of a Woman Who Quarreled Once upon a time there was a woman who lived a most unhappy life She and her husband were always quarreling Every day when he came home from work he was cross and said harsh words to her She would respond with bitter words and things would go from bad to worse until at last he would beat her One day the woman took her water jar and went to the fountain to fill it as usual She was so unhappy that great tears were rolling down her cheeks There was a little old woman standing by the fountain What is the matter my daughter she asked as she saw the tears upon the poor woman s cheeks When she had heard all the story the little old woman took the water jar and filled it at the fountain Go home my daughter she said Keep this water in the jar The moment your husband says a cross word to you fill your mouth with the water The sad woman thanked her and went to her own house The next day when her husband came home he began to scold as usual She was about to reply when she suddenly remembered the old woman s advice She ran to the water jar and filled her mouth with water Illustration She ran to the water jar To her great amazement her husband soon stopped scolding That night for the first time in many weeks she went to sleep without a beating Things kept on going well for several days Just as soon as her husband came home cross and said unpleasant things she would fill her mouth with water from the jar Then he would get over being cross Now there were smiles instead of tears on the woman s face At last however the water jar grew empty Once more the woman went to the fountain hoping that she would again find the little old woman who had given her the magic water She found her waiting at the fountain How did my prescription succeed dear daughter she asked as soon as she saw her How can I ever thank you for all you have done for me cried the woman Now I am happy once more My husband no longer beats me I did not dream that my life could ever be so full of joy Give me I pray you some more of the magic water The little old woman smiled gently Dear daughter she said the water which I put in your jar is nothing but the water from this fountain It is the very same which you always carry home This is the secret When your mouth is full of water you cannot reply when your husband says cross words to you If you do not keep up the quarrel it soon ends That is why your life is happy now instead of sad Go home and whenever your husband says an unkind word pretend that your mouth is full of water and do not reply Go in peace my child The woman always remembered this good advice and never again quarreled with her husband When she had children of her own she passed on to them the secret Now it is generally known in the Azores that if one does not want to keep up a quarrel it is well to pretend that his mouth is full of water This is the reason why the people of the islands are so peaceful and happy THE MESSENGERS The Story of a Youth Who Met Death There lived once upon a time in the island of Terceira a youth whose name was Vladmiro He had come from Flanders a cavalier of the order of saint John He was betrothed to a fair maid of the island One morning he was hunting in the forest of cedars when he suddenly saw Death standing before him He fell upon his knees and sent up a fervent prayer to the Holy Virgin Then he said to Death O Death why is it that you have come in search of me so soon I am young rich happy I am betrothed to a maid who loves me Life looks very bright and fair Death stepped back a pace Your prayer to the Holy Mother has saved you he said I had indeed come in search of you You were about to die from an accident with your hunting arms See I have already retreated a pace I have decided not to take you with me this time Vladmiro returned a prayer of thanksgiving Then he said O Death I am going to make a request of you Please do not come up to me so suddenly again It gives me a fright Next time you come for me will you please be so kind as to send messengers in advance to give me a little warning Yes young cavalier responded Death I will gladly do what you ask I give you my promise that next time I will send my messengers ahead of me to warn you that I am approaching With these words Death withdrew and went on alone through the forest of cedars The spring of that very year the young cavalier married the fair maid who loved him Life was full of joy Many children were born to the worthy couple Riches and honors came too The years sped by as if they flew on wings At last a half century had passed Vladmiro held his grandchildren upon his knees and told them the story of the day he met Death in the forest of cedars We are glad that Death passed on and left you said the children If he hadn t we could not have had you for our grandfather said the namesake grandson Vladmiro snuggling closer in his arms You do not have to fear Death now grandfather do you asked the little Maria He will keep his promise and send his messengers don t you think so Yes Death is a good Christian and will keep his word replied the aged cavalier The next morning he set sail for the island of Fayal where there were other grandchildren to visit in the home of his married daughter Francisca On the voyage a fierce storm arose The small boat was buffetted about by the gales Suddenly Vladmiro was startled to see Death standing beside him just as in the forest years ago when he had been young Illustration A fierce storm arose Why have you come to day he cried in alarm Why is it that you have not kept your word You gave me your promise that you would send your messengers next time you came to warn me of your approach I have kept my word said Death I have sent my messengers Where are they asked the old man in amazement Death pointed to Vladmiro s snowy hair I have sent my messengers in your white locks your failing eyesight and hearing the wrinkles on your cheeks Can it be that you have failed to recognize them Vladmiro bowed his head in silence and without a murmur went with Death In truth Death had been a good Christian and had kept his word THE END End of Project Gutenberg s The Islands of Magic by Elsie Spicer Eells END OF THIS PROJECT
