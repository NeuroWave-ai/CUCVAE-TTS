of several airships The man who had rung the bell glanced at the youth who answered his summons Yes I m Tom Swift was the reply Did you wish to see me I do I m mister James Gunmore secretary of the Eagle Park Aviation Association I had some correspondence with you about a prize contest we are going to hold I believe Oh yes I remember now and the young inventor smiled pleasantly as he opened wider the door of his home Won t you come in My father will be glad to see you He is as much interested in airships as I am And Tom led the way to the library where the secretary of the aviation society was soon seated in a big comfortable leather chair I thought we could do better and perhaps come to some decision more quickly if I came to see you than if we corresponded went on mister Gunmore I hope I haven t disturbed you at any of your inventions and the secretary smiled at the youth No I m through for to day replied Tom I m glad to see you I thought at first it was my chum Ned Newton He generally runs over in the evening Our society as I wrote you mister Swift is planning to hold a very large and important aviation meet at Eagle Park which is a suburb of Westville New York State We expect to have all the prominent bird men there to compete for prizes and your name was mentioned I wrote to you as you doubtless recall asking if you did not care to enter And I think I wrote you that my big aeroplane dirigible the Red Cloud was destroyed in Alaska during a recent trip we made to the caves of ice there after gold replied Tom Yes you did admitted mister Gunmore and while our committee was very sorry to hear that we hoped you might have some other air craft that you could enter at our meet We want to make it as complete as possible and we all feel that it would not be so unless we had a Swift aeroplane there It s very kind of you to say so remarked Tom but since my big craft was destroyed I really have nothing I could enter Haven t you an aeroplane of any kind I made this trip especially to get you to enter Haven t you anything in which you could compete for the prizes There are several to be offered some for distance flights some for altitude and the largest ten thousand dollars for the speediest craft Ten thousand dollars is the grand prize to be awarded for the quickest flight on record I surely would like to try for that said Tom but the only craft I have is a small monoplane the Butterfly I call it and while it is very speedy there have been such advances made in aeroplane construction since I made mine that I fear I would be distanced if I raced in her And I wouldn t like that No agreed mister Gunmore I suppose not Still I do wish we could induce you to enter I don t mind telling you that we consider you a drawing card Can t we induce you some way I m afraid not I haven t any machine which Look here exclaimed the secretary eagerly Why can t you build a special aeroplane to enter in the next meet You ll have plenty of time as it doesn t come off for three months yet We are only making the preliminary arrangements It is now June and the meet is scheduled for early in September Couldn t you build a new and speedy aeroplane in that time Eagerly mister Gunmore waited for the answer Tom Swift seemed to be considering it There was an increased brightness to his eyes and one could tell that he was thinking deeply The secretary sought to clinch his argument I believe from what I have heard of your work in the past that you could build an aeroplane which would win the ten thousand dollar prize he went on I would be very glad if you did win it and so I think would be the gentlemen associated with me in this enterprise It would be fine to have a New York State youth win the grand prize Come Tom Swift build a special craft and enter the contest As he paused for an answer footsteps were heard coming along the hall and a moment later an aged gentleman opened the door of the library Oh Excuse me Tom he said I didn t know you had company And he was about to withdraw Don t go father said Tom You will be as much interested in this as I am This is mister Gunmore of the Eagle Park Aviation Association This is my father mister Gunmore I ve heard of you spoke the secretary as he shook hands with the aged inventor You and your son have made in aeronautics a name to be proud of And he wants us to go still farther dad broke in the youth He wants me to build a specially speedy aeroplane and race for ten thousand dollars Hum mused mister Swift Well are you going to do it Tom Seems to me you ought to take a rest You haven t been back from your gold hunting trip to Alaska long enough to more than catch your breath and now Oh he doesn t have to go in this right away eagerly explained mister Gunmore There is plenty of time to make a new craft Well Tom can do as he likes about it said his father Do you think you could build anything speedier than your Butterfly son I think so father That is if you d help me I have a plan partly thought out but it will take some time to finish it Still I might get it done in time I hope you ll try exclaimed the secretary May I ask whether it would be a monoplane or a biplane A monoplane I think answered Tom They are much more speedy than the double deckers and if I m going to try for the ten thousand dollars I need the fastest machine I can build We have the promise of one or two very fast monoplanes for the meet went on mister Gunmore Would yours be of a new type I think it would was the reply of the young inventor In fact I am thinking of making a smaller monoplane than any that have yet been constructed and yet one that will carry two persons The hardest work will be to make the engine light enough and still have it sufficiently powerful to make over a hundred miles an hour if necessary A hundred miles an hour in a small monoplane It isn t possible cried the secretary I ll make better time than that said Tom quietly and with not a trace of boasting in his tones Then you ll enter the meet asked mister Gunmore eagerly Well I ll think about it promised Tom I ll let you know in a few days Meanwhile I ll be thinking out the details for my new craft I have been going to build one ever since I got back after having seen my Red Cloud crushed in the ice cave Now I think I had better begin active work I hope you will soon let me know resumed the secretary I m going to put you down as a possible contestant for the ten thousand dollar prize That can do no harm and I hope you win it I trust He paused suddenly and listened So did Tom Swift and his father for they all distinctly heard stealthy footsteps under the open windows of the library Some one is out there listening said Tom in low tones Perhaps it s Eradicate Sampson suggested mister Swift referring to the eccentric colored man who was employed by the inventor and his son to help around the place Very likely it was Eradicate Tom I don t think so was the lad s answer He went to the village a while ago and said he wouldn t be back until late to night He had to get some medicine for his mule Boomerang who is sick No it wasn t Eradicate but some one was under that window trying to hear what we said As he spoke in guarded tones Tom went softly to the casement and looked out He could observe nothing as the night was dark and the new moon which had been shining was now dimmed by clouds See anything asked mister Gunmore as he advanced to Tom s side No was the low answer I can t hear anything now either I ll go speak to missus Baggert the housekeeper volunteered mister Swift Perhaps it was she or she may know something about it He started from the room and as he went Tom noticed with something of a start that his father appeared older that night than he had ever looked before There was a trace of pain on the face of the aged inventor and his step was lagging I guess dad needs a rest and doctoring up thought the young inventor as he turned the electric chandelier off by a button on the wall in order to darken the room so that he might peer out to better advantage I think he s been working too hard on his wireless motor I must get doctor Gladby to come over and see dad But now I want to find out who that was under this window Once more Tom looked out The moon had emerged from behind a thin bank of clouds and gave a little light See anything asked mister Gunmore cautiously No whispered the youth for it being a warm might the windows were open top and bottom a screen on the outside keeping out mosquitoes and other insects I can t see a thing went on Tom but I m sure He paused suddenly As he spoke there sounded a rustling in the shrubbery a little distance from the window There s something exclaimed mister Gunmore I see answered the young inventor Without another word he softly opened the screen and then stooping down to get under the lower sash for the windows in the library ran all the way to the floor Tom dropped out of the casement upon the thick grass As he did so he was aware of a further movement in the bushes They were violently agitated and a second later a dark object sprang from them and sprinted along the path Here Who are you Hold on cried the young inventor But the figure never halted Tom sprang forward determined to see who it was and if possible capture him Hold on he cried again There was no answer Tom was a

none	none	runner and in a few seconds he had gained on the fugitive who could just be seen in the dim light from the crescent moon I ve got you cried Tom But he was mistaken for at that instant his foot caught on the outcropping root of a tree and the young inventor went flat on his face Just my luck he cried He was quickly on his feet again and took after the fugitive The latter glanced back and as it happened Tom had a good look at his face He almost came to a stop so startled was he Andy Foger he exclaimed as he recognized the bully who had always proved himself such an enemy of our hero Andy Foger sneaking under my windows to hear what I had to say about my new aeroplane I wonder what his game can be I ll soon find out Tom was about to resume the chase when he lost sight of the figure A moment later he heard the puffing of an automobile as some one cranked it up It s too late exclaimed Tom There he goes in his car And knowing it would be useless to keep up the chase the youth turned back toward his house Chapter Two mister Swift is Ill Who was it asked mister Gunmore as Tom again entered the library A friend of yours Hardly a friend replied Tom grimly It was a young fellow who has made lots of trouble for me in the past and who lately with his father tried to get ahead of me and some friends of mine in locating a gold claim in Alaska I don t know what he s up to now but certainly it wasn t any good He s got nerve sneaking up under our windows What do you think was his object It would be hard to say Can t you find him to morrow and ask him There s not much satisfaction in that The less I have to do with Andy Foger the better I m satisfied Well perhaps it s just as well I fell and couldn t catch him There would have been a fight and I don t want to worry dad any more than I can help He hasn t been very well of late No he doesn t look very strong agreed the secretary But I hope he doesn t get sick and I hope no bad consequences result from the eavesdropping of this Foger fellow Tom started for the hall to get a brush with which to remove some of the dust gathered in his chase after Andy As he opened the library door to go out mister Swift came in again I saw missus Baggert Tom he said She wasn t out under the window and as you said Eradicate isn t about His mule is in the barn so it couldn t have been the animal straying around No dad It was Andy Foger Andy Foger Yes I couldn t catch him But you d better go lie down father It s getting late and you look tired I am tired Tom and I think I ll go to bed Have you finished your arrangements with mister Gunmore Well I guess we ve gone as far as we can until I invent the new aeroplane replied Tom with a smile Then you ll really enter the meet asked the secretary eagerly I think I will decided Tom The prize of ten thousand dollars is worth trying for and besides that I ll be glad to get to work again on a speedy craft Yes I ll enter the meet Good exclaimed mister Gunmore shaking hands with the young inventor I didn t have my trip for nothing then I ll go back in the morning and report to the committee that I ve been successful I am greatly obliged to you He left the Swift home after refusing Tom s invitation to remain all night and went to his hotel Tom then insisted that his father retire As for the young inventor he was not satisfied with the result of his attempt to catch Andy Foger He had no idea why the bully was hiding under the library window but Tom surmised that some mischief might be afoot Sam Snedecker or Pete Bailey the two cronies of Andy may still be around here trying to play some trick on me mused Tom I think I ll take a look outside And taking a stout cane from the umbrella rack the youth sallied forth into the yard and extensive grounds surrounding his house While he is thus looking for possible intruders we will tell you a little more about him than has been possible since the call of the aviation secretary Tom Swift lived with his father Barton Swift in the town of Shopton New York State The young man had followed in the footsteps of his parent and was already an inventor of note Their home was presided over by missus Baggert as housekeeper since missus Swift had been dead several years In addition there was Garret Jackson an engineer who aided Tom and his father and Eradicate Sampson an odd colored man who with his mule Boomerang worked about the place In the first volume of this series entitled Tom Swift and his Motor Cycle here was related how he came to possess that machine A certain mister Wakefield Damon an eccentric gentleman who was always blessing himself or something about him owned the cycle but he came to grief on it and sold it to Tom very cheaply Tom had a number of adventures on the wheel and after having used the motor to save a valuable patent model from a gang of unscrupulous men the lad acquired possession of a power boat in which he made several trips and took part in many exciting happenings Some time later in company with John Sharp an aeronaut whom Tom had rescued from Lake Carlopa after the airman had nearly lost his life in a burning balloon the young inventor made a big airship called the Red Cloud With mister Damon Tom made several trips in this craft as set forth in the book Tom Swift and His Airship It was after this that Tom and his father built a submarine boat and went under the ocean for sunken treasure and following that trip Tom built a speedy electric runabout and by a remarkable run in that with mister Damon saved a bank from ruin bringing gold in time to stave off a panic Tom Swift and His Wireless Message told of the young inventor s plan to save the castaways of Earthquake Island and how he accomplished it by constructing a wireless plant from the remains of the wrecked airship Whizzer After Tom got back from Earthquake Island he went with mister Barcoe Jenks whom he met on the ill fated bit of land to discover the secret of the diamond makers They found the mysterious men but the trip was not entirely successful for the mountain containing the cave where the diamonds were made was destroyed by a lightning shock just as mister Parker a celebrated scientist who accompanied the party said it would be But his adventure in seeking to discover the secret of making precious stones did not satisfy Tom Swift and when he and his friends got back from the mountains they prepared to go to Alaska to search for gold in the caves of ice They were almost defeated in their purpose by the actions of Andy Foger and his father who in an under hand manner got possession of a valuable map showing the location of the gold and made a copy of the drawing Then when Tom and his friends set off in the Red Cloud as related in Tom Swift in the Caves of Ice the Fogers in another airship did likewise But Tom and his party were first on the scene and accomplished their purpose though they had to fight the savage Indians The airship was wrecked in a cave of ice that collapsed on it and the survivors had desperate work getting away from the frozen North Tom had been home all the following winter and spring and he had done little more than work on some small inventions when a new turn was given his thoughts and energies by a visit from mister Gunmore as narrated in the first chapter of the present volume Well I guess no one is here remarked the young inventor as he completed the circuit of the grounds and walked slowly back toward the house I think I scared Andy so that he won t come back right away He had the laugh on me though when I stumbled and fell As Tom proceeded he heard some one approaching around the path at the side of the house Who s there he called quickly taking a firmer grasp of his stick It s me Massa Swift was the response I jest come back from town I got some peppermint fo mah mule Boomerang dat s what I got Oh It s you is it Rad asked the youth in easier tones Dat s who it am Did yo t ink it were some un else I did replied Tom Andy Foger has been sneaking around Keep your eyes open the rest of the night Rad I will Massa Tom The youth went into the house having left word with the engineer mister Jackson to be on the alert for anything suspicious And now I guess I ll go to bed and make an early start to morrow morning planning my new aeroplane mused Tom I m going to make the speediest craft of the air ever seen As he started toward his room Tom Swift heard the voice of the housekeeper calling to him Tom Oh Tom Come here quickly What s the matter he asked in vague alarm Something has happened to your father was the startling reply He s fallen down and is unconscious Come quickly Send for the doctor Tom fairly ran toward his father s room Chapter Three The Plans Disappear mister Swift was lying on the floor where he had fallen in front of his bed as he was preparing to retire There was no mark of injury upon him and at first as he knelt down at his father s side Tom was at a loss to account for what had taken place How did it happen When was it he asked of missus Baggert as he held up his father s head and noted that the aged man was breathing slightly I don t know what happened Tom answered the housekeeper but I heard him fall and ran upstairs only to find him lying there just like that Then I called you Hadn t you better have a doctor Yes we ll need one at once Send Eradicate Tell him to run not to wait for his mule Boomerang is too slow Oh no The telephone of course Why didn t I think of that at first Please telephone for doctor Gladby missus Baggert Ask him to come as soon as possible and then tell Garret Jackson to step here I ll have him help me get father into bed The housekeeper hastened to the instrument and was soon in communication with the physician who promised to call at once The engineer was summoned from another part of the house and then Eradicate was aroused missus Baggert had the colored man help her get some kettles of hot water in readiness for possible use by the doctor mister Jackson aided Tom to lift mister Swift up on the bed and they got off some of his clothes I ll try to see if I can revive him with a little aromatic spirits of ammonia decided Tom as he noticed that his father was still unconscious He hastened to prepare the strong spirits while he was conscious of a feeling of fear and alarm mingled with sadness Suppose his father should die Tom could not bear to think of that He would be left all alone and how much he would miss the companionship and comradeship of his father none but himself knew Oh but I mustn t think he s going to die exclaimed the youth as he mixed the medicine mister Swift feebly opened his eyes after Tom and mister Jackson had succeeded in forcing some of the ammonia between his lips Where am I What happened asked the aged inventor faintly We don t know exactly spoke Tom softly You are ill father I ve sent for the doctor He ll fix you up He ll be here soon Yes I m I m ill murmured the aged man Something hurts me here and he put his hand over his heart Tom felt a nameless sense of fear He wished now that he had insisted on his parent consulting a physician some time before when mister Swift first complained of a minor ailment Perhaps now it was too late Oh when will that doctor come murmured Tom impatiently missus Baggert who was nervously going in and out of the room again went to the telephone He s on his way the housekeeper reported His wife said he just started out in his auto doctor Gladby hurried into the room a little later and cast a quick look at mister Swift who had again lapsed into unconsciousness Do you think he think he s going to die faltered Tom He was no longer the self reliant young inventor He could meet danger bravely when it threatened himself alone but when his father was stricken he seemed to lose all courage Die Nonsense exclaimed the doctor heartily He s not dead yet at all events and while there s life there s hope I ll soon have him out of this spell It was some little time however before mister Swift again opened his eyes but he seemed to gain strength from the remedies which doctor Gladby administered and in about an hour the inventor could sit up But you must be careful cautioned the physician Don t overdo yourself I ll be in again in the morning and now I ll leave you some medicine to be taken every two hours Oh I feel much better said mister Swift and his voice certainly seemed stronger I can t imagine what happened I came upstairs after Tom had received a visit from the minister and that s all I remember The minister father exclaimed Tom in great amazement The minister wasn t here this evening That was mister Gunmore the aviation secretary Don t you remember I don t remember any gentleman like that calling here to night mister Swift said blankly It was the minister I m sure Tom The minister was here last night mister Swift said the housekeeper Was he Why it seems like to night And I came upstairs after talking to him and then it all got black and and There now don t try to think advised the doctor You ll be all right in the morning But I can t remember anything about that aviation man protested mister Swift I never used to be that way forgetting things I don t like it Oh it s just because you re tired declared the physician It will all come back to you in the morning I ll stop in and see you then Now try to go to sleep And he left the room Tom followed him missus Baggert and mister Jackson remaining with the sick man What is the matter with my father doctor Gladby asked Tom earnestly as the doctor prepared to take his departure Is it anything serious Well began the medical man I would not be doing my duty Tom if I did not tell you what it is That is it is comparatively serious but it is curable and I think we can bring him around He has an affection of the heart that while it is common enough is sometimes fatal But I do not think it will be so in your father s case He has a fine constitution and this would never have happened had he not been run down from overwork That is the principal trouble What he needs is rest and then with the proper remedies he will be as well as before But that strange lapse of memory doctor Oh that is nothing It is due to the fact that he has been using his brain too much The brain protests and refuses to work until rested Your father has been working rather hard of late hasn t he Yes on a new wireless motor I thought so Well a good rest is what he needs and then his mind and body will be in tune again I ll be around in the morning Tom was somewhat relieved by the doctor s words but not very much so and he spent an anxious night getting up every two hours to administer the medicine Toward morning mister Swift fell into a heavy sleep and did not awaken for some time Oh you re much better declared doctor Gladby when he saw his patient that day Yes I feel better admitted mister Swift And can t you remember about mister Gunmore calling asked Tom The aged inventor shook his head with a puzzled air I can t remember it at all he said The minister is the last person I remember calling here Tom looked worried but the physician said it was a common feature of the disease from which mister Swift suffered and would doubtless pass away And you don t remember how we talked about me building a speedy aeroplane and trying for the ten thousand dollar prize asked Tom I can t remember a thing about it said the inventor with a puzzled shake of his head and I m not going to try at least not right away But Tom if you re going to build a new aeroplane I want to help you I ll give you the benefit of my advice I think my new form of motor can be used in it Now now No inventions at least not just yet objected the physician You must have a good rest first mister Swift and get strong Then you and Tom can build as many airships as you like mister Swift felt so much better about three days later that he wanted to get right to work planning the airship that was to win the big prize but the doctor would not hear of it Tom however began to make rough sketches of what he had in mind changing them from time to time He also worked on a type of motor very light and modeled after one his father had recently patented Then a new idea came to Tom in regard to the shape of his aeroplane and he worked several days drawing the plans for it It was a new idea in construction and he believed it would give him the great speed he desired But I d like dad to see it he said As soon as he s well enough I ll go over it with him That time came a week later and with a complete set of the plans embodying his latest ideas Tom went into the library where his father was seated in an easy chair doctor Gladby had said it would not now harm the aged inventor to do a little work Tom spread the drawings out in front of his father and began to explain them in detail I really think you have something great there Tom exclaimed mister Swift at length It is a very small monoplane to be sure but I think with the new principle you have introduced it will work but if I were you I d shape those wing tips a little differently No they re better that way said Tom pleasantly for he did not often disagree with his father I ll show you from a little model I have made I ll get it right away Anxious to demonstrate that 
7538_100045_000005_000000	train-clean-360	he was right 
none	none	in his theory Tom hurried from the library to get the model of which he had spoken He left the roll of plans lying on a small table near where his father was seated There you see dad said the young inventor as he re entered the library a few minutes later when you warp the wing tips in making a spiral ascent it throws your tail wings out of plumb and so Tom paused in some amazement for mister Swift was lying back in his chair with his eyes closed The lad started in alarm laid aside his model and sprang to his father s side He s had another of those heart attacks gasped Tom He was just going to call missus Baggert when mister Swift opened his eyes He looked at Tom and the lad could see that they were bright and did not show any signs of illness Well I declare exclaimed the inventor I must have dozed off Tom while you were gone That s what I did I fell asleep Oh said Tom much relieved I was afraid you were ill again Now in this model as you will see by the plans it is necessary He paused and looked over at the table where he had left the drawings They were not there The plans father Tom exclaimed The plans I left on the table Where are they I haven t touched them was the answer They were on that table where you put them when I closed my eyes for a little nap I forgot all about them Are you sure they re missing They re not here And Tom gazed wildly about the room Where can they have gone I wasn t out of my chair said mister Swift I ought not to have gone to sleep but Tom fairly jumped toward the long library window the same one from which he had leaped to pursue Andy Foger The casement was open and Tom noted that the screen was also unhooked It had been closed when he went to get the model he was sure of that Look dad See he exclaimed as he picked up from the floor a small piece of paper What is it Tom A sheet on which I did some figuring It is no good but it was in with the plans It must have dropped out Do you mean that some one has been in here and taken the plans of your new aeroplane Tom gasped his father That s just what I mean They sneaked in here while you were dozing took the plans and jumped out of the window with them On the way this paper fell out It s the only clue we have Stay here dad I m going to have a look And Tom jumped from the library window and ran down the path after the unknown thief Chapter Four Anxious Days Peering on all sides as he dashed along the gravel walk hoping to catch a glimpse of the unknown intruder in the garden or shrubbery Tom sprinted on at top speed Now and then he paused to listen but no sound came to him to tell of some one in retreat before him There was only Silence Mighty queer mused the youth Whoever it was he couldn t have had more than a minute start of me no not even half a minute and yet they ve disappeared as completely as though the ground had opened and let them down and the worst of it is that they ve taken my plans with them He turned about and retraced his steps making a careful search He saw no one until turning a corner a little later he met Eradicate Sampson You haven t seen any strangers around here just now have you Rad asked Tom anxiously No indeedy I hasn t Massa Tom What fo kind ob a stranger was him That s just what I don t know Rad But some one sneaked into the library just now and took some of my plans while my father dozed off I jumped out after him as soon as I could but he has disappeared Maybe it were th man who done stowed hisself away on yo airship de time yo all went after de diamonds suggested the colored man No it couldn t have been him If it was anybody it was Andy Foger or some of his crowd You didn t see Andy did you Rad No indeedy but if I do I suah will turn mah mule Boomerang loose on him an he won t take any mo plans not right off Massa Tom No I guess not Well I must get back to dad or he ll worry Keep your eyes open Rad and if you see Andy Foger or any one else around here let me know Just sing out for all you re worth Shall I call out Massa Tom ef I sees dat blessin man You mean mister Damon Dat s de one De general man what s allers a blessin ob hisself or his shoelaces or suffin laik dat Shall I sing out ef I sees him Well no not exactly Rad Just show mister Damon up to the house I d be glad to see him again though I don t fancy he ll call He s off on a little trip and won t be back for a week But watch out Rad And with that Tom turned toward the house shaking his head over the puzzle of the missing plans Did you find any one asked his father eagerly as the young inventor entered the library No was the gloomy answer There wasn t a sign of any one Tom went over to the window and looked about for clues There was none that he could see and a further examination of the ground under the window disclosed nothing There was gravel beneath the casement and this was not the best medium for retaining footprints Nor were the gravel walks any better Not a sign of any one murmured Tom Are you sure you didn t hear any noise dad when you dozed off Not a sound Tom In fact it s rather unusual for me to go to sleep like that but I suppose it s because of my illness But I couldn t have been asleep long not more than two minutes That s what I think Yet in that time someone who must have been on the watch managed to get in here and take my plans for the new sky racer I don t see how they got the wire screen open from the outside though It fastens with a strong hook And was the screen open asked mister Swift Yes it was unhooked Either they pushed a wire in through the mesh caught it under the hook and pulled it up from the outside or else the screen was opened from the inside I don t believe they could get inside to open the screen without some of us seeing them spoke the older inventor More likely Tom it wasn t hooked and they found it an easy matter to simply pull it open That s possible I ll ask missus Baggert if the screen was unhooked But the housekeeper could not be certain on that point and so that part of the investigation amounted to nothing It s too bad exclaimed mister Swift It s my fault for dozing off that way No indeed it isn t declared Tom stoutly Is the loss a serious one asked his father Have you no copy of the plans Yes I have a rough draft from which I made the completed drawings and I can easily make another set But that isn t what worries me the mere loss of the plans What is it then Tom The fact that whoever took them must know that they are the plans for a sky racer that is to take part in the big meet I have worked it out on a new principle and it is not yet patented Whoever stole my plans can make the same kind of a sky racer that I intended to construct and so stand as good a chance to win the prize of ten thousand dollars as I will That certainly is too bad Tom I never thought of that Do you suspect any one No one unless it s Andy Foger He s mean enough to do a thing like that but I didn t think he d have the nerve However I ll see if I can learn anything about him He may have been sneaking around and if he has my plans he d ask nothing better than to make a sky racer and beat me Oh Tom I m so sorry exclaimed mister Swift I I feel very bad about it There never mind spoke the lad seeing that his father was looking ill again Don t think any more about it dad I ll get back those plans Come now It s time for your medicine and then you must lie down For the aged inventor was looking tired and weak Wearily he let Tom lead him to his room and after seeing that the invalid was comfortable Tom called up doctor Gladby to have him come and see mister Swift The doctor said his patient had been overdoing himself a little and must rest more if he was to completely recover Learning that his father was no worse Tom set off to find Andy Foger I can t rest until I know whether or not he has my plans he said to himself I don t want to make a speedy aeroplane and find out at the last minute that Andy or some of his cronies have duplicated it But Tom got little satisfaction from Andy Foger When that bully was accused of having been around Tom s house he denied it and though the young inventor did not actually accuse him of taking the plans he hinted at it Andy muttered many indignant negatives and called on some of his cronies to witness that at the time the plans were taken he and they were some distance from the Swift home So Tom was baffled and though he did not believe the red haired lad s denial there was no way in which he could prove to the contrary If he didn t take the plans who did mused Tom As the young inventor turned away after cross questioning Andy the bully called out You ll never win that ten thousand dollars What do you know about that demanded Tom quickly Oh I know sneered Andy There ll be bigger and better aeroplanes in that meet than you can make and you ll never win the prize I suppose you heard about the affair by sneaking around under our windows and listening said Tom Never mind how I know it but I do retorted the bully Well I ll tell you one thing said Tom calmly If you come around again it won t be healthy for you Look out for live wires if you try to do the listening act any more Andy And with that ominous warning Tom turned away What do you suppose he means Andy asked Pete Bailey one of Andy s cronies It means he s got electrical wires strung around his place declared Sam Snedecker and that we ll be shocked if we go up there I m not going Me either added Pete and Andy laughed uneasily Tom heard what they said and in the next few days he made himself busy by putting some heavy wires in and about the grounds where they would show best But the wires carried no current and were only displayed to impress a sense of fear on Andy and his cronies which purpose they served well But it was like locking the stable door after the horse had been stolen for with all the precautions he could take Tom could not get back his plans and he spent many anxious days seeking them They seemed to have completely disappeared however and the young inventor decided there was nothing else to do but to draw new ones He set to work on them and in the meanwhile tried to learn whether or not Andy had the missing plans He sought this information by stealth and was aided by his chum Ned Newton But all to no purpose Not the slightest trace or clue was discovered Chapter Five Building the Sky Racer What will you do if after you have your little monoplane all constructed and get ready to race you find that some one else has one exactly like it at the meet asked Ned Newton one day when he and Tom were out in the big workshop talking things over What will you do Tom I don t see that there is anything I can do I ll go on to the meet of course and trust to some improvements I have since brought out and to what I know about aeroplanes to help me win the race I ll know too who stole my plans But it will be too late then Yes too late perhaps to stop them from using the drawings but not too late to punish them for the theft It s a great mystery and I ll be on the anxious seat all the while But it can t be helped When are you going to start work on the sky racer Pretty soon now I ve got another set of plans made and I ve fixed them so that if they are stolen it won t do any one any good How s that I ve put in a whole lot of wrong figures and measurements and scores of lines and curves that mean nothing I have marked the right figures and lines by a secret mark and when I work on them I ll use only the proper ones But any one else wouldn t know this Oh I ll fool em this time I hope you do Well when you get the machine done I d like to ride in it Will it carry two as your Butterfly does Yes only it will be much different and of course it will go much faster I ll give you a ride all right Ned Well now I must get busy and see what material I need for what I hope will prove to be the speediest aeroplane in the world That s going some I must be leaving now Don t forget your promise I saw Mary Nestor on my way over here She was asking for you She said you must be very busy for she hadn t seen you in some time Um was all Tom answered but by the blush that mounted to his face it was evident that he was more interested in Mary Nestor than his mere exclamation indicated When Ned had gone Tom got out pencil and paper and was busily engaged in making some intricate calculations He drew odd little sketches on the margin of the sheet and then wrote out a list of the things he would need to construct the new aeroplane This finished he went to mister Jackson the engineer and asked him to get the various things together and to have them put in the special shop where Tom did most of his work I want to get the machine together as soon as I can he remarked to the engineer for it will need to be given a good tryout before I enter in the race and I may find that I ll have to make several changes in it mister Jackson promised to attend to the matter right away and then Tom went in to talk to his father about the motor that was to whirl the propeller of the new air craft mister Swift had improved very much in the past few days and though doctor Gladby said he was far from being well the physician declared there was no reason why he should not do some inventive work He and Tom were deep in an argument of gasoline motors discussing the best manner of attaching the fins to the cylinders to make them air cooled when a voice sounded outside the voice of Eradicate Heah Whar yo goin demanded the colored man Whar yo goin Somebody s out in the garden exclaimed Tom jumping up suddenly Perhaps it s the same person who took the plans suggested mister Swift Hold on dere yelled Eradicate again Then a voice replied Bless my insurance policy What s the matter Have there been burglars around Why all these precautions Bless my steam heater Don t you know me mister Damon cried Tom a look of pleasure coming over his face mister Damon is coming So I should judge responded mister Swift with a smile I wonder why Eradicate didn t recognize him They learned why a moment later for on looking from the library window Tom saw the colored man coming up the walk behind a well dressed gentleman Why mah goodness It s mister Damon exclaimed Eradicate I didn t know yo sah wif dem whiskers on I didn t fo a fac Bless my razor I suppose it does make a difference said the eccentric man Yes my wife thought I d look better and more sedate with a beard so I grew one to please her But I don t like it A beard is too warm this kind of weather eh Tom And mister Damon waved his hand to the young inventor and his father who stood in the low windows of the library Entirely too warm bless my finger nails yes I agree with you exclaimed Tom Come in We re glad to see you I called to see if you aren t going on another trip to the North Pole or somewhere in the Arctic regions went on mister Damon Why inquired Tom Why then this heavy beard of mine would come in handy It would keep my throat and chin warm And mister Damon ran his hands through his luxuriant whiskers No more northern trips right away said Tom I m about to build a speedy monoplane to take part in the big meet at Eagle Park Oh yes I heard about the meet said mister Damon I d like to be in that Well I m building a machine that will carry two went on Tom and if you think you can stand a speed of a hundred miles an hour or better I ll let you come with me There are some races where a passenger is allowed Have you got a razor asked mister Damon suddenly What for inquired mister Swift wondering what the eccentric man was going to do Why bless my shaving soap I m going to cut off my beard If I go in a monoplane at a hundred miles an hour I don t want to make any more resistance to the wind than possible and my whiskers would certainly hold back Tom s machine Where s a razor I m going to shave at once My wife won t mind when I tell her what it s for Lend me a razor please Tom Oh there s plenty of time explained the lad with a laugh The race doesn t take place for over two months But when it does I think you would be better off without a beard I know it said mister Damon simply I ll shave before we enter the contest Tom But now tell me all about it Tom did so relating the story of the theft of the plans mister Damon was for having Andy arrested at once but mister Swift and his son pointed out that they had no evidence against him All we can do said the young inventor is to keep watch on him and see if he is building another aeroplane He has all the facilities and he may attempt to get ahead of me If he enters a sky craft at the meet I ll be pretty sure that he has made it from my stolen plans Bless my wing tips cried mister Damon But can t we do anything to stop him I m afraid not answered Tom and then he showed mister Damon his re drawn plans and told in detail of how he intended to construct the new aeroplane The eccentric man remained as the guest of the Swift family that night departing for his home the next day and promising to be on hand as soon as Tom was ready to test his new craft which would be in about a month As the days passed Tom with the help of his father whose health was slightly better and with the aid of mister Jackson began work on the speedy little sky racer As you boys are all more or less familiar with aeroplanes we will not devote much space to the description of the new one Tom Swift made We can describe it in general terms but there were some features of it which Tom kept a secret from all save his father Suffice it to say that Tom had decided to build a small air craft of the single wing type known as the monoplane It was to be a cross between the Bleriot and the Antoinette with the general features of both but with many changes or improvements The wings were shaped somewhat like those of a humming bird which as is well known can at times vibrate its wings with such velocity that the most rapid camera lens cannot quite catch And when it is known that a bullet in flight has been successfully photographed the speed of the wings of the humming bird can be better appreciated The writer has seen a friend with a very rapid camera which was used to snap automobiles in flight attempt to take a picture of a humming bird He got the picture all right but the plate was blurred showing that the wings had moved faster than the lens could throw them on the sensitive plate Not that Tom intended the wings of his monoplane to vibrate but he adopted that style as being the best adapted to allow of rapid flight through the air and the young inventor had determined that he would clip many minutes from the best record yet made The body of his craft between the forward wings and the rear ones where the rudders were located was shaped like a cigar with side wings somewhat like the fin keels of the ocean liner to prevent a rolling motion In addition Tom had an ingenious device to automatically adapt his monoplane to sudden currents of air that might overturn it and this device was one of the points which he kept secret The motor which was air cooled was located forward and was just above the heads of the operator and the passenger who sat beside him The single propeller which was ten feet in diameter gave a minimum thrust of one thousand pounds at two thousand revolutions per minute This was one feature wherein Tom s craft differed from others The usual aeroplane propeller is eight feet in diameter and gives from four to five hundred pounds thrust at about one thousand revolutions per minute so it can be readily seen wherein Tom had an advantage But I m building this for speed he said to mister Jackson and I m going to get it We ll make a hundred miles an hour without trouble I believe you replied the engineer The motor you and your father have made is a wonder for lightness and power In fact the whole monoplane was so light and frail as to give one the idea of a rather large model instead of a real craft intended for service But a careful inspection showed the great strength it had for it was braced and guyed in a new way and was as rigid as a steel trussed bridge What are you going to call her asked mister Jackson about two weeks after they had started work on the craft and when it had begun to assume shape and form I m going to name her the Humming Bird replied Tom She s little but oh my And I guess she ll bring home the prize added the engineer And as the days went by and Tom his father and mister Jackson continued to work on the speedy craft this hope grew in the heart of the young inventor But he could not rid himself of worry as to the fate of the plans that had disappeared Who had them Was some one making a machine like his own from them Tom wished he knew Chapter Six Andy Foger Will Contest One afternoon as Tom was working away in the shop on his sky racer adjusting one of the rear rudders and pausing now and then to admire the trim little craft he heard some one approaching Looking out through a small observation peephole made for this purpose he saw missus Baggert hurrying toward the building I wonder what s the matter he said aloud for there was a look of worriment on the lady s face Tom threw open the door What is it missus Baggert he called Some one up at the house who wants to see me No it s your father panted the housekeeper for she was quite stout He is very ill again and I can t seem to get doctor Gladby on the telephone Central says he doesn t answer My father worse cried Tom in alarm dropping his tools and hurrying from the shop Where s Eradicate Send him for the doctor Perhaps the wires are broken If he can t locate doctor Gladby get doctor Kurtz We must have some one Here Rad Where are you he called raising his voice Heah I be answered the colored man coming from the direction of the garden which he had been weeding Get out your mule and go for doctor Gladby If he isn t home get doctor Kurtz Hurry Rad I s mighty sorry Massa Tom answered the colored man but I cain t hurry nohow Why not Because Boomerang done gone lame an he won t run I ll go mahse f but I cain t take dat air mule Never mind I ll go in the Butterfly decided Tom quickly I ll run up to the house and see how dad is and while I m gone Rad you get out the Butterfly I can make the trip in that If doctor Kurtz had a phone I could get him but he lives over on the back road where there isn t a line Hurry Rad Yes sah Massa Tom I ll hurry The colored man knew how to get the monoplane in shape for a flight as he had often done it Tom found his father in no immediate danger but mister Swift had had a slight recurrence of his heart trouble and it was thought best to have a doctor So Tom started off in his air craft rising swiftly above the housetop and sailed off toward the old fashioned residence of doctor Kurtz a sturdy elderly German physician who sometimes attended mister Swift Tom decided that as long as doctor Gladby did not answer his phone he could not be at home and this he learned later was the case the physician being in a distant town on a consultation My this Butterfly seems big and clumsy beside my Humming Bird mused Tom as he slid along through the air now flying high and now low merely for practice This machine can go but wait until I have my new one in the air Then I ll show em what speed is He was soon at the physician s house and found him in Won t you ride back with me in the monoplane asked Tom I m anxious to have you see dad as soon as you can Vot Me drust mineself in one ob dem airships I dinks not exclaimed doctor Kurtz ponderously Vy I vould not efen ride in an outer mobile yet so vy should I go in von contrivance vot is efen more dangerous No I gomes to your fader in der carriage mit mine old Dobbin horse Dot vill not drop me to der ground or run me up a tree yet Vot Very well said Tom only hurry please The young inventor in his airship reached home some time before the slow going doctor got there in his carriage mister Swift was no worse Tom was glad to find though he was evidently quite ill So ve must take goot care of him said the doctor when he had examined the patient doctor Gladby he has done much for him und I can do little more You must dake care of yourself Herr Swift or you vill but den vot is der use of being gloomy minded I am sure you vill go more easy und not vork so much I haven t worked much replied the aged inventor I have only been helping my son on a new airship Den dot must stop insisted the doctor You must haf gomplete rest dot s it gomplete rest We ll do just as you say doctor said Tom We ll give up the aeroplane matters dad and go away you and I where we can t see a blueprint or a pattern or hear the sound of machinery We ll cut it all out Dot vould he goot said doctor Kurtz ponderously No I couldn t think of it answered mister Swift I want you to go in that race Tom and win But I ll not do it dad if you re going to be ill He is ill now interrupted the doctor Very ill Dom Swift That settles it I don t go in the race You and I ll go away dad to California or up in Canada We ll travel for your health No no insisted the old inventor gently I will be all right Most of the work on the monoplane is done now isn t it Tom
7538_100043_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes dad 
7538_100043_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes dad 
none	none	Then you go on and finish it You and mister Jackson can do it without me now I ll take a rest doctor but I want my son to enter that race and what s more I want him to win Vell if you don t vork dot is all I ask I must forbid you to do any more Mit Dom dot is different He is young und strong und he can vork But you not Herr Swift or I doctor you no more And the physician shook his big head Very well I ll agree to that if Tom will promise to enter the race said the inventor I will said Tom The physician took his leave shortly after that the medicine he gave to mister Swift somewhat relieving him Then the young inventor who felt in a little better spirits went back to his workshop Poor dad he mused He thinks more of me and this aeroplane than he does of himself Well I will go in the race and I ll yes I ll win And Tom looked very determined He was about to resume work on his craft when something about the way one of the forward planes was tilted attracted his attention I never left it that way mused Tom Some one has been in here I wonder if it was mister Jackson Tom stepped to the door and called for Eradicate The colored man came from the direction of the garden which he was still weeding Has mister Jackson been around Rad asked the lad No sah I ain t seed him Have you been in here looking at the Humming Bird No Massa Tom I nebber goes in dere lessen as how yo is dere Dem s yo orders That s so Rad I might have known you wouldn t go in But did you see any one enter the shop Not a pusson sab Have you been here all the while All but jes a few minutes when I went to de barn to put some liniment on Boomerang s so foot H m Some one might have slipped in here while I was away mused Tom I ought to have locked the doors but I was in a hurry This thing is getting on my nerves I wonder if it s Andy Foger or some one else who is after my secret He made a hasty examination of the shop but could discover nothing more wrong except that one of the planes of the Humming Bird had been shifted It looks as if they were trying to see how it was fastened on and how it worked mused Tom But my plans haven t been touched and no damage has been done Only I don t like to think that people have been in here They may have stolen some of my ideas I must keep this place locked night and day after this Tom spent a busy week in making improvements on his craft mister Swift was doing well and after a consultation by doctor Kurtz and doctor Gladby it was decided to adopt a new style of treatment In the meanwhile mister Swift kept his promise and did no work He sat in his easy chair out in the garden and dozed away while Tom visited him frequently to see if he needed anything Poor old dad mused the young inventor I hope he is well enough to come and see me try for the ten thousand dollar prize and win it I hope I do but if some one builds from my stolen plans a machine on this model I ll have my work cut out for me And he gazed with pride on the Humming Bird For the past two weeks Tom had seen nothing of Andy Foger The red haired bully seemed to have dropped out of sight and even his cronies Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey did not know where he had gone I hope he has gone for good said Ned Newton who lived near Andy He s an infernal nuisance I wish he d never come back to Shopton But Andy was destined to come back One day when Tom was busy installing a wireless apparatus on his new aeroplane he heard Eradicate hurrying up the path that led to the shop I wonder if dad is worse thought Tom that always being his first idea when he knew a summons was coming for him Quickly be opened the door Some one s comin out to see you Massa Tom said the colored man Who is it asked the lad taking the precaution to put his precious plans out of sight I dunno sah but yo father knows him an he said fo me to come out heah ahead ob de general man an tell yo he were comin He ll be right heah Oh well if dad knows him it s all right Let him come Rad Yes sah Heah he comes And the colored man pointed to a figure advancing down the gravel path Tom watched the stranger curiously There was something familiar about him and Tom was sure he had met him before yet he could not seem to place him How are you Tom Swift greeted the newcomer pleasantly I guess you ve forgotten me haven t you He held out his hand which Tom took Don t know me do you he went on Well I m afraid I ve forgotten your name admitted the lad just a bit embarrassed But your face is familiar somehow and yet it isn t I ve shaved off my mustache went on the other That makes a difference But you haven t forgotten John Sharp the balloonist whom you rescued from Lake Carlopa and who helped you build the Red Cloud You haven t forgotten John Sharp have you Tom Well I should say not cried the lad heartily I m real glad to see you What are you doing around here Come in I ve got something to show you and he motioned to the shop where the Humming Bird was housed Oh I know what it is said the veteran balloonist You do Yes It s your new aeroplane In fact I came to see you about it To see me about it Yes I m one of the committee of arrangements for the meet to be held at Eagle Park where I understand you are going to contest I came to see how near you were ready and to get you to make a formal entry of your machine mister Gunmore sent me Oh so you re in with them now eh asked Tom Well I m glad to know I ve got a friend on the committee Yes my machine is getting along very well I ll soon be ready for a trial flight Come in and look at it I think it s a bird a regular Humming Bird And Tom laughed It certainly is something new admitted mister Sharp as his eyes took in the details of the trim little craft By the way Shopton is going to be well represented at the meet How is that I thought I was the only one around here to enter an aeroplane No We have just received an entry from Andy Foger From Andy Foger gasped Tom Is he going to try to win some of the prizes He s entered for the big one the ten thousand dollar prize replied the balloonist He has made formal application to be allowed to compete and we have to accept any one who applies Why do you object to him Tom Object to him mister Sharp let me tell you something Some time ago a set of plans of my machine here were stolen from my house I suspected Andy Foger of taking them but I could get no proof Now you say he is building a machine to compete for the big prize Do you happen to know what style it is It s a small monoplane something like the Antoinette his application states though he may change it later Then he s stolen my ideas and is making a craft like this exclaimed Tom as he sank upon a bench and gazed from the balloonist to the Humming Bird and back to mister Sharp again Andy Foger is trying to beat me with my own machine Chapter Seven Seeking a Clue John Sharp was more than surprised at the effect his piece of information had on Tom Swift Though the young inventor had all along suspected Andy of having the missing plans yet there had been no positive evidence on this point That coupled with the fact that the red haired bully had not been seen in the vicinity of Shopton lately had in a measure lulled Tom s suspicions to rest but now his hope had been rudely shattered Do you really think that s his game asked mister Sharp I m sure of it replied the youth Though where he is building his aeroplane I can t imagine for I haven t seen him in town He s away Are you sure of that Well not absolutely sure replied Tom It s the general rumor that he s out of town Well old General Rumor is sometimes a person not to be relied upon remarked the balloonist grimly Now this is the way I size it up Of course all I know officially is that Andy Foger has sent in an entry for the big race for the ten thousand dollar prize which is offered by the Eagle Park Aviation Association I m a member of the arrangements committee and so I know I also know that you and several others are going to try for the prize That s all I am absolutely sure of Now when you tell me about the missing plans and you conclude that Andy is doing some underhanded work I agree with you But I go a step farther I don t believe he s out of town at all Why not exclaimed Tom Because when he has an airship shed right in his own backyard where you tell me he once made a craft in which he tried to beat you out in the trip to Alaska when you think of that doesn t it seem reasonable that he d use that same building in which to make his new craft Yes it does admitted Tom slowly but then everybody says he s out of town Well what everybody says is generally not So I think you ll find that Andy is keeping himself in seclusion and that he s working secretly in his shop building a machine with which to beat you Do you really I certainly do Have you been around his place lately No I ve been too busy and then I never have much to do with him Then take my advice and see if you can t get a look inside that shop You may see something that will surprise you If you find that Andy is infringing on your patented ideas you can stop him by an injunction You ve got this model patented I take it Oh yes I didn t have at the time the plans were stolen but I ve patented it since I could get at him that way Then take my advice and do it Get a look inside that shed and you ll find Andy working secretly there no matter if his cronies do think he s out of town I believe I will agreed Tom and somehow he felt better now that he had decided on a plan of action He and the balloonist talked over at some length just the best way to go about it for the young inventor recalled the time when he and Ned Newton had endeavored to look into Andy s shed with somewhat disastrous results to themselves but Tom knew that the matter at stake justified a risk and he was willing to take it Well now that s settled said mister Sharp tell me more about yourself and your aeroplane My To think that the Red Cloud was destroyed That was a fine craft Indeed she was agreed Tom I m going to make another on similar lines some day but now all my time is occupied with the Humming Bird She is a hummer too complimented mister Sharp But I almost forgot the real object of my trip here There is no doubt about you going in the race is there I fully expect to replied Tom The only thing that will prevent me will be Don t say you re worried on account of what Andy Foger may do interrupted mister Sharp I m not I ll attend to Andy all right I was going to say that my father s illness might interfere He s not well at all I m quite worried about him Oh I sincerely hope he ll be all right remarked the balloonist We want you in this race In fact we re going to feature you as they say about the actors and story writers The committee is planning to do considerable advertising on the strength of Tom Swift the well known young inventor being a contestant for the ten thousand dollar prize That s very nice I m sure replied Tom and I m going to do my best Perhaps dad will take a turn for the better He wants me to win as much as I want to myself Well we ll not worry about it anyhow until the time comes I want to show you some new features of my latest aeroplane And I want to see them Tom Don t you think you re making a mistake though in equipping it with a wireless outfit Why so Well because it will add to the weight and you want such a small machine to be as light as possible Yes but you see I have a very light engine That part my father helped me with In fact it is the lightest air cooled motor made for the amount of horsepower it develops so I can afford to put on the extra weight of the wireless outfit I may need to signal when I am flying along at a hundred miles an hour That s so Well show me some of the other good points You ve certainly got a wonderful craft here Tom and mister Sharp spent some time going over the Humming Bird and in talking over old times The balloonist paid another visit to mister Swift who was feeling pretty good and who expressed his pleasure in seeing his old friend again Can t you stay for a few days asked Tom when mister Sharp was about to leave If you wait long enough you may be able to help me work up the clues against Andy Foger and also witness a trial flight of the Humming Bird I d like to stay but I can t was the answer The committee will be anxious for me to get back with my report Good luck to you I ll see you at the time of the race if not before Tom resolved to get right to work seeking clues against his old enemy Andy but the next day mister Swift was not so well and Tom had to remain in the house Then followed several days during which time it was necessary to do some important work on his craft and so a week passed without any information having been obtained In the meanwhile Tom had made some cautious inquiries but had learned nothing about Andy He had no chance to interview Pete or Sam the two cronies 
7538_100045_000053_000000	train-clean-360	and he did 
none	none	not think it wise to make a bald request for information at the Foger home Ned Newton could not be of any aid to his friend as he was kept busy in the bank night and day working over a new set of books I wonder how I can find out what I want to know mused Tom one afternoon when he had done considerable work on the Humming Bird I certainly ought to do it soon so as to be able to stop Andy if he s infringing on my patents Yet I don t see how His thoughts were interrupted by hearing a voice outside the shop exclaiming Bless my toothpick I know the way Eradicate my good fellow It isn t necessary for you to come As long as Tom Swift is out there I ll find him Bless my horizontal rudder I m anxious to see what progress he s made I ll find him if he s about Yes sah he s right in dere spoke the colored man He s workin on dat Dragon Fly of his Eradicate did not always get his names right mister Damon exclaimed Tom in delight at the sound of his friend s voice I believe he can help me get evidence against Andy Foger I wonder I didn t think of it before The very thing I ll do it Chapter Eight The Empty Shed Bless my dark lantern Where are you Tom called mister Damon as he entered the dim shed where the somewhat frail appearing aeroplane loomed up in the semi darkness for it was afternoon and rather cloudy Where are you Here called the young inventor I m glad to see you Come in Ah there it is eh exclaimed the odd man as he looked at the aeroplane for there had been much work done on it since he had last seen it Bless my parachute Tom But it looks as though you could blow it over It s stronger than it seems replied the lad But mister Damon I ve got something very important to talk to you about Thereupon Tom told all about mister Sharp s visit of Andy s entry in the big race and of the suspicions of himself and the balloonist And what is it you wish me to do asked mister Damon Work up some clues against Andy Foger Good I ll do it I d like to get ahead of that bully and his father who once tried to wreck the bank I m interested in I ll help you Tom I ll play detective Let me see what disguise shall I assume I think I ll take the part of a tramp Bless my ham sandwich That will be the very thing I ll get some ragged clothes let my beard grow again you see I shaved it off since my last visit and I ll go around to the Foger place and ask for work Then I can get inside the shed and look around How s that for a plan It might be all right agreed Tom only I don t believe you re cut out for the part of a tramp mister Damon Bless my fingernails Why not Oh well it isn t very pleasant to go around in ragged clothes Don t mind about me I ll do it And the odd gentleman seemed quite delighted at the idea He and Tom talked it over at some length and then adjourned to the house where mister Swift who had seemed to improve in the last few days was told of the plan Couldn t you go around after evidence just as you are asked the aged inventor I don t much care for this disguising business Oh it s very necessary insisted mister Damon earnestly Bless my gizzard but it s very necessary Why if I went around the Foger place as I am now they d know me in a minute and I couldn t find out what I want to know Well if you keep on blessing yourself said Tom with a laugh they ll know you no matter what disguise you put on mister Damon That s so admitted the eccentric gentleman I must break myself of that habit I will Bless my topknot I ll never do it any more Bless my trousers buttons I m afraid you ll never do it exclaimed Tom It is rather hard said mister Damon ruefully as he realized what he had said But I ll do it Bless He paused a moment looked at Tom and his father and then burst into a laugh The habit was more firmly fastened on him than he was aware For several hours Tom his father and mister Damon discussed various methods of proceeding and it was finally agreed that mister Damon should first try to learn what Andy was doing if anything without resorting to a disguise Then if that doesn t work I ll become a tramp was the decision of the odd character I ll wear the raggedest clothes I can find Bless But he stopped in time mister Damon took up his residence in the Swift household as he had often done before and for the next week he went and came as he pleased sometimes being away all night It s no use though declared mister Damon at the end of the week I can t get anywhere near that shed nor even get a glimpse inside of it I haven t been able to learn anything either There are two gardeners on guard all the while and several times when I ve tried to go in the side gate they ve stopped me Isn t there any news of Andy about town asked Tom I should think Sam or Pete would know where he is Well I didn t ask them for they d know right away why I was inquiring said mister Damon but it seems to me as if there was something queer going on If Andy Foger is working in that shed of his he s keeping mighty quiet about it Bless my And once more he stopped in time He was conquering the habit in a measure Well what do you propose to do next asked Tom Disguise myself like a tramp and go there looking for work was the firm answer There are plenty of odd jobs on a big place such as the Foger family have I ll find out what I want to know you see It seemed useless to further combat this resolution and in a few days mister Damon presented a very different appearance He had on a most ragged suit there was a scrubby beard on his face and he walked with a curious shuffle caused by a pair of big heavy shoes which he had donned first having taken the precaution to make holes in them and get them muddy Now I m all ready he said to Tom one day when his disguise was complete I m going over and try my luck He left the house by a side door so that no one would see him and started down the walk As he did so a voice shouted Hi there Git right out oh heah Mistah Swift doan t allow no tramps heah an we ain t got no wuk fo yo an there ain t no cold victuals I does all de wuk me an mah mule Boomerang an we takes all de cold victuals too Git right along now It s Eradicate He doesn t know you said Tom with a chuckle So much the better whispered mister Damon But the disguise proved almost too much of a success for seeing the supposed tramp lingering near the house Eradicate caught up a stout stick and rushed forward He was about to strike the ragged man when Tom called out That s mister Damon Rad Wh what gasped the colored man and when the situation had been explained to him and the necessity for silence impressed upon him he turned away too surprised to utter a word He sought consolation in the stable with his mule Just what methods mister Damon used he never disclosed but one thing is certain That night there came a cautious knock on the door of the Swift home and Tom answering it beheld his odd friend Well he asked eagerly what luck Put on a suit of old clothes and come with me said mister Damon We ll look like two tramps and then if we re discovered they won t know it was you Have you found out anything asked Tom eagerly Not yet but I ve got a key to one of the side doors of the shed and we can get in as soon as it s late enough so that everybody there will be in bed A key How did you get it inquired the youth Never mind was the answer with a chuckle That was because of my disguise and I haven t blessed anything to day I m going to soon though I can feel it coming on But hurry Tom or we may be too late And you haven t had a look inside the shed asked the young inventor You don t know what s there No but we soon will Eagerly Tom put on some of the oldest and most ragged garments he could find and then he and the odd gentleman set off toward the Foger home They waited some time after getting in sight of it because they saw a light in one of the windows Then when the house was dark they stole cautiously forward toward the big gloomy shed On this side directed mister Damon in a whisper The key I have opens this door But we can t see when we get inside objected Tom I should have brought a dark lantern I have one of those pocket electric flashlights said mister Damon Bless my candlestick but I thought of that And he chuckled gleefully Cautiously they advanced in the darkness mister Damon fumbled at the lock of the door The key grated as he turned it The portal swung back and Tom and his friend found themselves inside the shed which of late had been such an object of worry and conjecture to the young inventor What would he find there Flash the light he called to mister Damon in a hoarse whisper The eccentric man drew it from his packet He pressed the spring switch and in an instant a brilliant shaft of radiance shot out cutting the intense blackness like a knife mister Damon flashed it on all sides But to the amazement of Tom and his companion it did not illuminate the broad white wings and stretches of canvas of an aeroplane It only shone on the bare walls of the shed and on some piles of rubbish in the corners Up and down to right and left shot the pencil of light There s there s nothing here gasped Tom I I guess you re right agreed mister Damon The shed is empty Then where is Andy Foger building his aeroplane asked Tom in a whisper but mister Damon could not answer him Chapter Nine A Trial Flight For a few moments after their exclamations of surprise Tom and mister Damon did not know what else to say They stared about in amazement hardly able to believe that the shed could be empty They had expected to see some form of aeroplane in it and Tom was almost sure his eyes would meet a reproduction of his Humming Bird made from the stolen plans Can it be possible there s nothing here went on Tom after a long pause He could not seem to believe it Evidently not answered mister Damon as he advanced toward the center of the big building and flashed the light on all sides You can see for yourself Or rather you can t see spoke the youth It isn t here that s sure You can t stick an aeroplane even as small a one as my Humming Bird in a corner No it isn t here Well we ll have to look further went on mister Damon I think But a sudden noise near the big main doors of the shed interrupted him Come on exclaimed Tom in a whisper Some one s coming They may see us Let s get out mister Damon released the pressure on the spring switch and the light went out After waiting a moment to let their eyes become accustomed to the darkness he and Tom stole to the door by which they had entered As they swung it cautiously open they again heard the noise near the main portals by which Andy had formerly taken in and out the Anthony as he had named the aeroplane in which he and his father went to Alaska where like Tom s craft it was wrecked Some one is coming in whispered Tom Hardly had he spoken when a light shone in the direction of the sound The illumination came from a big lantern of the ordinary kind carried by some one who had just entered the shed Can you see who it is whispered mister Damon peering eagerly forward too eagerly for his foot struck against the wooden side wall with a loud bang Who s there suddenly demanded the person carrying the lantern He raised it high above his head in order to cast the gleams into all the distant corners As he did so a ray of light fell upon his face Andy Foger gasped Tom in a hoarse whisper Andy must have heard for he ran forward just as Tom and mister Damon slipped out Hold on Who are you came in the unmistakable tones of the red haired bully I don t think we re going to tell chuckled Tom softly as he and his friend sped off into the darkness They were not followed and as they looked back they could see a light bobbing about in the shed He s looking for us exclaimed mister Damon with an inward laugh Bless my watch chain But it s a good thing we got in ahead of him Are you sure it was Andy himself Sure I d know his face anywhere But I can t understand it Where has he been What is he doing Where is he building his aeroplane I thought he was out of town He may have come back to night said mister Damon That s the only one of your questions I can answer We ll have to wait about the rest I m sure he wasn t around the house to day though for I was working at weeding the flower beds in my disguise as a tramp and if he was home I d have seen him He must have just come back and he went out to his shed to get something Well we did the best we could Indeed we did agreed Tom and I m ever so much obliged to you mister Damon And we ll try again when we get more clues Bless my shoelaces but it s a relief to be able to talk as you like And forthwith the eccentric man began to call down so many blessings on himself and on his belongings no less than on his friends that Tom laughingly warned him that he had better save some for another time The two reached home safely removed their disguises and told mister Swift of the result of their trip He agreed with them that there was a mystery about Andy s aeroplane which was yet to be solved But Tom was glad to find that at any rate the craft was not being made in Shopton and during the next two weeks he devoted all his time to finishing his own machine mister Jackson was a valuable assistant and mister Damon gave what aid he could Well I think I ll be ready for a trial flight in another week said Tom one day as he stepped back to get a view of the almost completed Humming Bird Shall you want a passenger asked mister Damon Yes I wish you would take a chance with me I could use a bag of sand not that I mean you are to be compared to that added Tom quickly but I d rather have a real person in order to test the balancing apparatus Yes we ll make a trial trip together In the following few days Tom went carefully over the aeroplane making some slight changes strengthening it here and there and testing the motor thoroughly It seemed to work perfectly At length the day of the trial came and the Humming Bird was wheeled out of the shed In spite of the fact that it was practically finished there yet remained much to do on it It was not painted or decorated and looked rather crude But what Tom wanted to know was how it would fly what control he had over it what speed it could make and how it balanced For it was at best very frail and the least change in equilibrium might be fatal Before taking his place in the operator s seat Tom started the motor and by means of a spring balance tested the thrust of the propellers It was satisfactory though he knew that when the engine had been run for some time and had warmed up it would do much better All ready I guess mister Damon he called and the odd gentleman took his place Tom got up into his own seat in front of several wheels and levers by which he operated the craft Start the propeller he requested of mister Jackson and soon the motor was spitting fire while the big fan like blades were whirring around like wings of light The engineer and Eradicate were holding back the Humming Bird Let her go cried Tom as he turned on more gasoline and further advanced the spark of the motor The roar increased the propeller looked like a solid circle of wood and the trim little monoplane moved slowly across the rising ground increasing its speed every second until like some graceful bird it suddenly rose in the air as Tom tilted the wing tips and soared splendidly aloft Chapter Ten A Midnight Intruder Tom Swift sent his wonderful little craft upward on a gentle slant Higher and higher it rose above the ground Now it topped the trees now it was well over them On the earth below stood mister Swift mister Jackson Eradicate and missus Baggert They were the only witnesses of the trial flight and as the aged inventor saw his son s latest design in aeroplanes circling in the air he gave a cheer of delight It was too feeble for Tom to hear but the lad glancing down saw his father waving his hand to him Dear old dad thought Tom waving in return I hope he s well enough to see me win the big prize Tom and mister Damon went skimming easily through the air at no great speed to be sure for the young inventor did not want to put too sudden a strain on his motor This is glorious cried the odd gentleman I never shall have enough of aeroplaning Tom Nor I either added his companion But how do you like it Don t you think it s an improvement on my Butterfly mister Damon It certainly is You re a wonder Tom Look out What are you up to for the machine had suddenly swerved in a startling manner Oh that s just a new kind of spiral dip I was trying answered Tom I couldn t do that with my other machine for I couldn t turn sharp enough Well don t do it right away again begged mister Damon who had turned a little white and whose breath was coming in gasps even though he was used to hair raising stunts in the frail craft of the air Tom did not take his machine far away for he did not want to exhibit it to the public yet and he preferred to remain in the vicinity of his home in case of any accident So he circled around did figures of eight went up and down on long slants took sharp turns and gave the craft a good tryout Does it satisfy you asked mister Damon when Tom had once more made the spiral dip but not at high speed In a way yes was the answer I see a chance for several changes and improvements Of course I know nothing about the speed yet and that s something that I m anxious about for I built this with the idea of breaking all records and nothing else I know now that I can construct a craft that will successfully navigate the air in fact there are any number of people who can do that but to construct a monoplane that will beat anything ever before made is a different thing I don t yet know that I have done it When will you Oh when I make some changes get the motor tuned up better and let her out for all she s worth I want to do a hundred miles an hour at least I ll arrange for a speedy flight in about two weeks more Then I think I will stay home said mister Damon No I ll need you insisted Tom laughing Now watch I m going to let her out just a little He did with the result that they skimmed through the air so fast that mister Damon s breath became a mere series of gasps We ll have to wear goggles and mouth protectors when we really go fast yelled Tom above the noise of the motor as he slowed down and turned about for home Go fast Wasn t that fast asked mister Damon

none	none	You wait and you ll see he announced They made a good landing and mister Swift hastened up to congratulate his son I knew you could do it Tom he cried I couldn t though if it hadn t been for that wonderful engine of yours dad How do you feel Pretty good Oh but that s a fine machine Tom It certainly is agreed mister Jackson It will be when I have it in better trim admitted the young inventor modestly By golly cried Eradicate who was grinning almost from ear to ear I s proud oh yo Massa Tom an so will mah mule Boomerang be when I tells him Yes sah dat s what he will be proud ob yo Massa Tom Thanks Rad Well some folks is satisfied with mighty little under em when they go up in the air that s my opinion said missus Baggert Why wouldn t you ride in this asked Tom of the buxom housekeeper Not if you was to give me ten thousand dollars she cried firmly Oh dear I think the potatoes are burning And she rushed back into the house The next day Tom started to work overhauling the Humming Bird and making some changes He altered the wing tips slightly and adjusted the motor until in a thrust test it developed nearly half again as much power as formerly And I ll need it all declared Tom as he thought of the number of contestants that had entered the great race For the Eagle Park meet was to be a large and important one and the principal bird men of the world were to have a part in it Tom knew that he must do his very best and he spared no efforts to make his monoplane come up to his ideal which was a very exacting one We ll have a real speed test to morrow Tom announced to mister Damon one night I ll see what the Humming Bird can really do You ll come won t you Oh I suppose so Bless my insurance policy I might as well take the same chance you do But if you re going to have such a nerve racking thing as that on the program you d better get to bed early and have plenty of sleep Oh I m not tired I think I ll go out this evening Where Oh just around town to see some of the fellows But if Tom was only going around town merely to see his male friends why did he dress so carefully put on a new necktie and take several looks in the glass before he went out We think you can guess and also the girl s name The young inventor got in rather late and after a visit to the aeroplane shed to see that all was right there he went to bed first connecting up the burglar alarm wires that guarded the doors and windows of the aerodrome How long he had been asleep Tom did not know but he was suddenly awakened by hearing the buzzing of the alarm at the head of his bed At first he took it for the droning and humming of the aeroplane motor as he had a hazy notion and a sort of dream that he was in his craft Then with a start he realized what it was the burglar alarm Some one s in the shed he gasped Out of bed he leaped drawing on his trousers and coat and putting on a pair of slippers with speed worthy of a fireman He grabbed up a revolver and rushed from his room pounding on the door of mister Jackson s apartment in passing Some one in the shed after the Humming Bird shouted Tom Get a gun and come down Chapter Eleven Tom Is Hurt As Tom passed down the hall on his way to the side door from which he could more quickly reach the aeroplane shed he saw his father coming from his room What s the matter What is it asked mister Swift and alarm showed on his pale face It s nothing much dad said the youth as quietly as he could for he realized that to excite his father might have a bad effect on the invalid Then why are you in such a hurry Why have you that revolver I know there is something wrong Tom I am going to help you In his father s present weakened state Tom desired this least of all so he said Now never mind dad I thought I heard a noise out in the yard and I m not going to take any chances So I roused mister Jackson and I m going down to see what it is Perhaps it may only be Eradicate s mule Boomerang kicking around or it may be Rad himself or some one after his chickens

none	none	mister Jackson and I can attend to it You go back to bed father Tom spoke with such assurance that mister Swift believed him and retired to his room just as the engineer partly dressed came hurrying out in response to Tom s summons He had his rifle and had the invalid inventor seen that he surely would have worried more Come on whispered Tom Don t make any noise I don t want to excite my father What was it asked the engineer I don t know Burglar alarm went off that s all I can say until we get to the shed Together the two left the house softly and soon were hurrying toward the aeroplane shed Look exclaimed mister Jackson Didn t you see a light just then Tom Where By the side window of the shed No I didn t notice it Oh yes There it is Some one is in there If it s Andy Foger I ll have him arrested sure Maybe we can t catch him That s so Andy is a pretty slippery customer Say mister Jackson you go around and get Eradicate and have him bring a club We can t trust him with a gun Tell him to get at the back door and I ll wait for you to join me and we ll go in the front door Then we ll have em between two fires They can t get away How about the windows They re high up and hard to open since I put the new catches on them Whoever got in must have forced the lock of the door There goes the light again As Tom spoke there was seen the faint glimmer of a light It moved slowly about the interior of the shed and with a peculiar bobbing motion which indicated that some one was carrying it Go for Eradicate and don t make any more noise than you can help in waking him up whispered Tom for they were now close to the shed and might be heard mister Jackson slipped off in the darkness and Tom drew nearer to the building that housed his Humming Bird There was one window lower than the others and near it was a box that Tom remembered having seen that afternoon He planned to get up on that and look in before making a raid to capture the intruder Tom raised himself up to the window The light had been visible a moment before he placed the box in position but an instant later it seemed to go out and the place was in darkness I wonder if they ve gone away thought Tom I can t hear any noise He listened intently It was dark and silent in the shop Suddenly the light flashed up brighter than before and the young inventor caught sight of a man walking around the new aeroplane examining it carefully He carried as Tom could see a large sized electric flash lamp with a brilliant tungsten filament which gave a powerful light As the youth watched he saw the intruder place the light on a bench in such a position that the rays fell full upon the Humming Bird Then adjusting the spring switch so that the light would continue to glow the man stepped back and drew something from an inner pocket I wonder what he s up to mused Tom I wish Eradicate and mister Jackson would hurry back Who can that fellow be I wonder I ve never seen him before as far as I know I thought sure it was going to turn out to be Andy Foger Tom turned around to look into the dark yard surrounding the shed He was anxious to hear the approach of his two allies but there was no sound of their footsteps As he turned back to watch the man he could not repress a cry of alarm for what the intruder had drawn from his pocket was a small hatchet and he was advancing with it toward the Humming Bird He s going to destroy my aeroplane gasped Tom and he raised his revolver to fire He did not intend to shoot at the man but only to fire to scare him and thus hasten the coming of mister Jackson and the colored man But there was no need of this for an instant later the two came running up silently Eradicate with a big club Whar am he he asked in a hoarse whisper Let me git at him Massa Tom Hush exclaimed the young inventor We have no time to lose He s in there getting ready to chop my aeroplane to bits Go to the back door Rad and if he tries to come out don t let him get away I won t declared the colored man emphatically and he shook his club suggestively Come on We ll go in the front door whispered Tom to the engineer I have the key We ll catch him red handed and hand him over to the police Waiting a few seconds to enable Eradicate to get to his place Tom and the engineer stole softly toward the big double doors Every moment the youth expected to hear the crash of the hatchet on his prize machine He shivered in anticipation but the blows did not fall Tom pushed open the door and stepped inside followed by mister Jackson As they did so they saw the man standing in front of the Humming Bird He again raised the little hatchet which was like an Indian tomahawk and poised it for an instant over the delicate framework and planes of the air craft Then his arm began to descend Stop yelled Tom and at the same time he fired in the air The man turned as suddenly as though a bullet had struck him and for a moment Tom was afraid lest he had hit him by accident but an instant later the intruder grabbed up his flashlight and holding it before him so that its rays shone full on Tom and mister Jackson while it left him in the shadow sprang toward them the hatchet still in his hand Look out Tom cried mister Jackson Out of my way shouted the man Bravely Tom stood his ground He wished now that he had a club instead of his revolver The would be vandal was almost upon him mister Jackson clubbed his rifle and swung it at the fellow The latter dodged and came straight at Tom Look out yelled the engineer again but it was too late There was the sound of a blow and Tom went down like a log Then the place was in darkness and the sound of footsteps in rapid flight could be heard outside the shed The intruder after wounding the young inventor had made his escape Chapter Twelve Miss Nestor Calls What s de mattah Shall I come in Am anybody hurted yelled Eradicate Sampson as he pounded on the rear door of the aeroplane shed Let me in Massa Tom All right Wait a minute I m coming called mister Jackson He tried to peer through the darkness to where a huddled heap indicated the presence of Tom Then he thought of the electric lights which were run by a storage battery when the dynamo was shut down and a moment later the engineer had switched on the incandescents filling the big shed with radiance Tom are you badly hurt gasped mister Jackson There was no answer for Tom was unconscious Let me in Let me git at dat robber wif mah club cried the colored man eagerly Knowing that he would need help in carrying Tom to the house mister Jackson hurried to the back door He had a key to it and it was quicker to open it than to send Eradicate away around the shed to the front portals Whar am he gasped the faithful darky as he took a firmer grasp of his club and looked around the place Let me git mah hands on him I ll feed him t Boomerang when I gits froo wif him He s gone said the engineer Help me look after Tom I m afraid he s badly hurt They hastened to the unconscious lad On one side of his head was a bad cut which was bleeding freely Oh he s daid I know he s daid wailed Eradicate Not a bit of it He isn t dead but he may die if we don t get him into the house and have a doctor here soon said mister Jackson sternly Catch hold of him Rad and mind don t carry on and get excited and scare mister Swift Just pretend it isn t very bad or we ll have two patients on our hands instead of only Tom They managed to get the youth into the house and contrary to their fears mister Swift was not nearly so nervous as they had expected Calmly he took charge of matters and even telephoned for doctor Gladby himself while mister Jackson and Eradicate undressed Tom and got him to bed missus Baggert busied herself heating water and getting things in readiness for the doctor who had promised to come at once Tom was just regaining consciousness when the physician came in having driven over at top speed What what happened Did the Humming Bird fall asked Tom in a whisper putting his hand to his head No something fell on you I guess said the doctor who had been hurriedly told of the circumstances But don t worry Tom You ll be all right in a few days You got a bad cut on the head but the skull isn t fractured I m glad to say Here now just drink this and he gave Tom some medicine he had mixed in a glass The cut was soon dressed and Tom felt much better though weak and a trifle dizzy Did he hit me with the hatchet he asked mister Jackson I couldn t tell was the engineer s reply it all happened so quickly In another instant I d have bowled him over instead of him landing on you but I just missed him He either used the hatchet or some blunt instrument Well don t talk about it now urged the doctor I want Tom to get quiet and go to sleep We ll be much better in the morning but I must forbid any aeroplane flights And he shook his finger at Tom in warning You ll have to lie quiet for several days he added All right agreed the young inventor weakly and then he dozed off for the physician had given him a quieting medicine Haven t you any idea who it was asked doctor Gladby of mister Jackson as he prepared to leave Not the slightest It was no one Tom or I had ever seen before But whoever it was he intended to destroy the Humming Bird that was evident The scoundrel I m glad you foiled him in time but it s too bad about Tom However we ll soon have him all right again I knows who done it broke in Eradicate who was a sort of privileged character about the Swift home Who asked mister Jackson It were dat Andy Foger Leastways he send dat man heah t make mincemeat oh de Hummin Bird I s positib bout dat so I am And Eradicate grinned triumphantly Well perhaps Andy did have a hand in it admitted mister Swift but we have no proof of it I can t see what his object would be in wanting to destroy Tom s new craft Pure meanness Afraid that Tom will beat him in the race suggested mister Jackson It s too big a risk to take went on the aged inventor I m inclined to think it might be one of the gang of men who made the diamonds in the cave in the mountains They might have sent a spy on East and he might try to damage the aeroplane to be revenged for what Tom and mister Jenks did to them It s possible agreed the engineer Well we ll wait until Tom can talk and we ll go over it with him Not until he is stronger though stipulated the physician as he went away Don t excite Tom for a few days The young inventor was much better the following day and when doctor Gladby called he said Tom could sit up for a little while Two days later Tom was well enough to be talked to and his father and mister Jackson went over all the details of the matter mister Damon who had returned home came to see his friend as soon as he heard of his plight and was also a member of the consulting party Bless my dictionary exclaimed the eccentric man I wish I had been here to take a hand in it But Tom do you believe it was one of the diamond making gang I hardly think so was the reply They would take some other means of revenge than by destroying my new aeroplane I m inclined to think it was some one who is in with Andy Foger Then we ll hire detectives and locate him and them declared mister Damon blessing several things in succession Tom however did not like that plan and it was decided to do nothing right away In another few days Tom was able to be up though he was still a semi invalid not venturing out of the house It was one afternoon when rather tired of his confinement he was wishing he could resume work on his air craft that missus Baggert came in and said Some one to see you Tom Is it mister Damon No it s a lady She Oh Tom How are you cried a girlish voice and Mary Nestor walked into the room holding out both hands to the young inventor Tom with a blush arose hastily No no Sit still commanded the girl Oh I m so sorry to hear about your accident In fact I only heard this morning We ve been away mamma and I and we just got back Tell me all about it that is if you feel able But don t exert yourself Oh I wish I had hold of that man And Miss Nestor clenched her two pretty little hands and set her white even teeth grimly together as though she would do most desperate things indeed I wish you did too exclaimed Tom That is so you could hold him until I had a chance at him But I m all right now It was very good of you to call How are you and how are your folks Very well But I came to hear about you Tell me and she looked anxiously at Tom while missus Baggert discreetly withdrew to the adjoining room and made a great noise rattling papers and moving chairs about Thereupon Tom told what had happened while Mary Nestor listened interestedly and with expressions of fear at times But if Andy had anything to do with it concluded Tom I can t understand what his object is Andy is acting very strangely lately We can t locate him nor find out where he is building his airship That s what I want to know but mister Damon and I after a lot of trouble only found his aeroplane shed empty And you want to find out where Andy Foger is building his aeroplane which he has entered in the big race asked Miss Nestor That s what I d like to know declared Tom earnestly Only we can t seem to do it No one knows Why don t you write to mister Sharp or some one of the aviation meet committee asked the girl simply They would know for you say Andy made his formal entry with them and the rules require him to tell from what city and State he will enter his craft Write to the committee Tom For a moment the young inventor stared at her Then he banged his fist down on the arm of his chair By Jove Mary That s the very thing he cried I wonder why I never thought of that instead of fiddling around in disguises and things like that I wonder why I never thought of that plan Perhaps because it was so simple she answered with a pretty blush I guess that s it agreed Tom It takes a woman to jump across a bridge to a conclusion every time I ll write to mister Sharp at once Chapter Thirteen A Clash with Andy Tom lost no time in writing to mister Sharp He wondered more and more at his own neglect in not before having asked the balloonist when the latter was in Shopton where Andy was building his aeroplane But as it developed later mister Sharp did not know at that time While waiting for a reply to his letter Tom busied himself about his own craft making several changes he had decided on He also began to paint and decorate it for he wanted to have the Humming Bird present a neat appearance when she was officially entered in the great race Miss Nestor called on Tom again and mister Damon was a frequent visitor He agreed to accompany Tom to the aviation park when it was time for the race and also to be a passenger in the ten thousand dollar contest It must be perfectly wonderful to fly through the air said Miss Nestor one day when Tom and mister Damon had the Humming Bird out on the testing ground trying the engine which had been keyed up to a higher pitch of speed I consider it perfectly marvelous and I can t imagine how it must seem to skim along that way Come and try it urged Tom suddenly There s not a bit of danger Really there isn t Oh I d never dare do it replied the girl with a gasp That machine is too swift by name and swift by nature for me Why don t you take Miss Nestor on a grass cutting flight Tom suggested mister Damon Bless my lawn mower but she wouldn t be frightened at that Grass cutting repeated the girl What in the world does that mean It means skimming along a few feet up in the air answered the young inventor who had now fully recovered from the effects of the blow given him by the midnight intruder In spite of many inquiries no clues to his identity had been obtained How high do you go when you cut grass as you call it asked Miss Nestor and Tom thought he detected a note of eager curiosity in her voice Not high at all he said In fact sometimes I do cut off the tops of tall daisies Come Mary Won t you try that I know you ll like it and when you ve been over the lawn a few times you ll be ready for a high flight Come there s no danger I I almost believe I will she said hesitatingly Will you take me down when I want to come Of course said Tom Get in and we ll start The Humming Bird was all ready for a trial flight and Tom was glad of the chance to test it especially with such a pretty passenger as was Miss Nestor Bless my shoelaces cried mister Damon I can see where I am going to be cut out Tom Swift I ll not get many more rides with you now that Miss Nestor is taking to aeroplaning you young rascal And he playfully shook his finger at Tom Oh I don t expect to get enthusiastic over it said Miss Nestor who now that she had taken her place in one of the small seats under the engine appeared as if she would be glad of the chance to change her mind But she did not Now if you take me more than five feet up in the air I ll never speak to you again Tom Swift she exclaimed Five feet it shall be unless you yourself ask to go higher was the youth s reply as he winked at mister Damon Well he knew the fascination of aeroplaning and he was almost sure of what would happen You can take a tape measure along and see for yourself he added to his fair passenger The barograph will hardly register such a little height Well it s as high as I want to go said the girl Oh with a scream as 
7538_100044_000056_000003	train-clean-360	Tom started the propeller 
none	none	Are we going In a moment was his reply He took his seat beside the girl The motor was speeded up until it sounded like the roar of the ocean surf in a storm Let her go cried Tom to mister Damon and mister Jackson who were holding back the Humming Bird They gave her a slight shove to over come the inertia and the trim little craft darted across the ground at every increasing speed Miss Nestor caught her breath with a gasp glanced at Tom and noted how cool he was and then her frantic grip of the uprights slightly relaxed We ll go up a little way in a minute shouted Tom in her ear as they were speeding over the level ground He pulled a lever slightly and the Humming Bird rose a little in the air but only for a short distance not more than five feet and Tom held her there though he had to run the engine at a greater speed than would have been the case had he been in the sustaining upper currents It was as if the Humming Bird resented being held so closely to the earth Around in a big circle back and forth went the craft at no time being more than seven feet from the ground Tom glanced at Miss Nestor Her cheeks were unusually red and there was a bright sparkle in her eyes It s glorious she cried Do you do you think there s any danger in going higher I believe I d like to go up a bit I knew it cried Tom Up we go And he pulled the wind bending plane lever toward him Upward shot the craft as if alive Oh gasped Mary Sit still It s all right commanded Tom It s glorious glorious she cried I m not a bit afraid now I knew you wouldn t be declared the young inventor who had calculated on the fascination which the motion through the air untrammeled and free always produces Shall we go higher Yes cried Miss Nestor and she gazed fearlessly down at the earth which was falling away from beneath their feet She was in the grip of the air and it was a new and wonderful sensation Tom went up to a considerable distance for once a person loses his first fright one hundred feet or one thousand feet elevation makes little difference to him 
7538_100044_000007_000001	train-clean-360	It was this 
none	none	way with Miss Nestor Now indeed could Tom demonstrate to her some of the fine points of navigation in the upper currents and though he did no risky stunts he showed the girl what it means to do an ascending spiral how to cut corners how to twist around in the figure eight and do other things Tom did not try for the great speed of which he knew his craft was capable for he knew there was some risk with Miss Nestor aboard But he did nearly everything else and when he sent the Humming Bird down he had made another convert and devotee to the royal sport of aeroplaning Oh I never would have dared believe I could do it exclaimed the girl as with flushed cheeks and dancing eyes she dismounted from the seat Mamma and papa will never believe I did it Bring them over and I ll take them for a flight said Tom with a laugh as Mary departed Tom received an answer to his letter to mister Sharp that night Andy Foger s entry blank states wrote the balloonist that he is constructing his aeroplane in the village of Hampton which is about fifty miles from your place If there is anything further I can do for you Tom let me know I will see you at the meet Hope you win the prize In Hampton eh mused Tom So that s where Andy has been keeping himself all this while His uncle lives there and that s the reason for it He wanted to keep it a secret from me so he could use my stolen plans for his craft But he shan t do it I ll go to Hampton And I ll go with you declared mister Damon who was with Tom when he got the note from the balloonist We ll get to the bottom of this mystery after a while Tom Delaying a few days to make the final changes in his aeroplane Tom and mister Damon departed for Hampton one morning They thought first of going in the Butterfly but as they wanted to keep their mission as secret as possible they decided to go by train and arrive in the town quietly and unostentatiously They got to Hampton late that afternoon What s the first thing to be done asked mister Damon as they walked up from the station where they were almost the only persons who alighted from the train Go to the hotel decided Tom There s only one I was told so there s not much choice Hampton was a quiet little country town of about five thousand inhabitants and Tom soon learned the address of mister Bentley Andy s uncle from the hotel clerk What business is mister Bentley in asked Tom for he wanted to learn all he could without inquiring of persons who might question his motives Oh he s retired said the clerk He lives on the interest of his money But of late he s been erecting some sort of a building on his back lot like a big shed and folks are sort of wondering what he s doing in it Keeps mighty secret about it He s got a young fellow helping him Has he got red hair asked Tom while his heart beat strangely fast Who mister Bentley No His hair s black I mean the young fellow Oh his Yes his is red He s a nephew or some relation to mister Bentley I did hear his name but I ve forgotten it Sandy or Andy or some such name as that This was near enough for Tom and mister Damon and they did not want to risk asking any more questions They turned away to go to their rooms as the clerk was busy answering inquiries from some other guests A little later supper was served and Tom having finished whispered to mister Damon to join him upstairs as soon as he was through What are you going to do asked the eccentric man We re going out and have a look at this new shed by moonlight decided Tom I want to see what it s like and if possible I want to get a peep inside I ll soon be able to tell whether or not Andy is using my stolen plans All right I m with you Bless my bill of fare But we seem to be doing a lot of mysterious work of late Yes agreed Tom But if you have to bless anything to night mister Damon please whisper it Andy or some of his friends may be about the shed and as soon as they hear one of your blessings they ll know who s coming Oh I ll be careful promised mister Damon Andy will find out sooner or later that we are in town went on Tom but we may be able to learn to night what we want to know and then we can tell how to act A little later as if they were merely strolling about mister Damon and Tom headed for mister Bentley s place which was on the outskirts of the town There was a full moon and the night was just right for the kind of observation Tom wanted to make There were few persons abroad and the young inventor thought he would have no one spying on him They located the big house of Andy s uncle without trouble Going down a side street they had a glimpse of a shed built of new boards standing in the middle of a large lot About the structure was a new high wooden fence but as Tom and his friend passed along it they saw that a gate in it was open I m going in whispered Tom Will it be safe asked mister Damon I don t care whether it will be or not I ve got to know what Andy is doing Come on We ll take a chance Cautiously they entered the enclosure The big shed was dark and stood out conspicuously in the moonlight There doesn t seem to be any one here whispered Tom I wonder if we could get a look in the window It s worth trying anyhow agreed mister Damon I m with you Tom They drew nearer to the shed Suddenly Tom stepped on a stick which broke with a sharp report Bless my spectacles cried mister Damon half aloud There was silence for a moment and then a voice cried out Who s there Hold on Don t come any farther It s dangerous Tom and mister Damon stood still and from behind the shed stepped Andy Foger and a man Oh it s you is it Tom Swift exclaimed the red haired bully I thought you d come sneaking around Come on Jake We ll make them wish they d stayed home And Andy made a rush for Tom Chapter Fourteen The Great Test Bless my gizzard exclaimed mister Damon who hardly knew what to do We d better be getting out of here Tom Not much exclaimed the young inventor I never ran from Andy Foger yet and I m not going to begin now He assumed an attitude of defense and stood calmly awaiting the onslaught of the bully but Andy knew better than to come to a personal argument with Tom and so the red haired lad halted some paces off The man who had followed young Foger also stopped What do you want around here Tom Swift demanded Andy You know very well what I want said the young inventor calmly I want to know what you did with the aeroplane plans you took from my house I never took any declared Andy vigorously Well there s no use discussing that went on Tom What I came here to find out and I don t mind telling you is whether or not you are building a monoplane to compete against me and building it on a model invented by me and what s more Andy Foger I intend to find this out too Tom started toward the big shed which loomed up in the moonlight Stand back cried Andy getting in Tom s way I can build any kind of an aeroplane I like and you can t stop me We ll see about that declared the young inventor as he kept on I m not going to allow my plans to be stolen and a monoplane made after them and do nothing about it You keep away snarled Andy and he grabbed Tom by the shoulder and struck him a blow in the chest He must have been very much excited or otherwise he never would have come to hostilities this way with Tom whom he well knew could easily beat him The blow together with the many things he had suffered at Andy s hands was too much for our hero He drew back his fist and a moment later Andy Foger was stretched out on the grass He lay there for a moment and then rose up slowly to his knees his face distorted with rage You you hit me he snarled Not until you hit first said Tom calmly Bless my punching bag That s so exclaimed mister Damon You ll suffer for this whined Andy getting to his feet but taking care to retreat from Tom who stood ready for him I ll get square with you for this Jake come on and we ll get our guns Andy turned and hurried back toward the shed followed by the evil looking man who had apparently been undecided whether to attack mister Damon or Tom Now the bully and his companion were in full retreat We ll get our guns and then we ll see whether they ll want to stay where they re not wanted went on Andy threateningly Bless my powderhorn What had we better do asked mister Damon I guess we d better go back said Tom calmly Not that I m afraid of Andy His talk about guns is all bluff but I don t want to get into any more of a row and he is just ugly and reckless enough to make trouble I m afraid we can t learn what we came to find out though I m more convinced than ever that Andy is using my plans to make his aeroplane But what can you do I ll see mister Sharp and send a protest to the aviation committee I ll refuse to enter if Andy flies in a model of my Humming Bird and I ll try to prevent him from using it after he gets it on the ground That is all I can do it seems lacking positive information Come on mister Damon Let s get back to our hotel and we ll start for home in the morning I have a plan whispered the odd man What is it asked Tom narrowly watching for the reappearance of Andy and the man I ll stay here until they come then I ll pretend to run away They ll chase after me and get all excited and you can go up and look in the shed windows Then you can join me later How s that Too risky They might fire at you by mistake No We ll both go I ve found out more than enough to confirm my suspicions They turned out of the lot which contained the shed and walked toward the road just as Andy and his crony came back Huh You d better go taunted the bully Tom had a bitter feeling in his heart It seemed as if he was defeated and he did not like to retreat before Andy You d better not come back here again either went on Andy Tom and mister Damon did not reply but kept on in silence They returned to Shopton the next day Well remarked Tom when he had gone out to look at his Humming Bird I know one thing Andy Foger may build a machine something like this but I don t believe he can put in all the improvements I have and certainly he can t equal that engine eh dad I hope not Tom replied his father who seemed to be much improved in health When are you going to try for speed asked mister Damon To morrow if I can get it tuned up enough replied Tom and I think I can Yes we ll have the great test to morrow and then I ll know whether I really have a chance for that ten thousand dollars Never before had Tom been so exacting in his requirements of his air craft as when the next day the Humming Bird was wheeled out to the flight ground and gotten ready for the test The young inventor went over every bolt brace stay guy wire and upright He examined every square inch of the wings the tips planes and rudders The levers the steering wheel the automatic equilibrium attachments and the balancing weights were looked at again and again As for the engine had it been a delicate watch Tom could not have scrutinized each valve wheel cam and spur gear more carefully Then the gasoline tank was filled the magneto was looked after the oil reservoirs were cleaned out and freshly filled and finally the lad remarked Well I guess I m ready Come along mister Damon Am I going with you in the test Surely I ve been counting on you If you re to be with me in the race you want to get a sample of what we can do Take your place mister Jackson are you ready to time us All ready Tom And dad do you feel well enough to check back mister Jackson s results I don t want any errors Oh yes Tom I can do it Very well then Now this is my plan I m going to mount upward on an easy slant and put her through a few stunts first to warm up and see that everything is all right Then when I give the signal by dropping this small white ball that means I m ready for you to start to time me Then I ll begin to try for the record I ll go about the course in a big ellipse and well we ll see what happens While mister Damon was in his seat the young inventor started the propeller and noted the thrust developed It was satisfactory as measured on the scale and then Tom took his place Let her go he cried to mister Jackson and Eradicate after he had listened to the song of the motor for a moment The Humming Bird flew across the course and a moment later mounted into the air Tom quickly took her up to about two thousand feet and there finding the conditions to his liking he began a few evolutions designed to severely test the craft s stability and to learn whether the engine was working properly How about it asked mister Damon anxiously All right shouted Tom in his ear for the motor was making a great racket I guess we ll make the trial next time we come around Get ready to drop the signal ball Tom slowly brought the aeroplane around in a graceful curve He sighted down and saw the first tall white pole that marked the beginning of the course Drop he called to mister Damon The white rubber ball went to the earth like a shot mister Jackson and mister Swift saw it and started their timing watches Tom opened the throttle and advanced the spark The great test was on The Humming Bird trembled and throbbed with the awful speed of the motor like a thing alive She seemed to rush forward as an eagle dropping down from a dizzy height upon some hapless prey Faster yet murmured Tom We must go faster yet The motor was warming up Streaks of fire came from it The exhaust of the explosions was a continuous roar Faster and faster flew the frail craft Around and around the air course she circled The wind appeared to be rushing beneath the planes and rudders with the velocity of a hurricane Had it not been for the face protectors they wore Tom and mister Damon could not have breathed For ten minutes this fearful speed was kept up Then Tom knowing he had run the motor to the limit slowed it down Next he shut it off completely and prepared to volplane back to earth The silence after the terrific racket was almost startling For a moment neither of the aviators spoke Then mister Damon said Do you think you did it Tom I don t know We ll soon find out They ll have the record And he motioned toward the earth which they were rapidly nearing Chapter Fifteen A Noise in the Night Well did I make it Make any kind of a record asked Tom eagerly as he brought the trim little craft to a stop after it had rolled along the ground on the bicycle wheels What do you think you did asked mister Jackson who had been busy figuring on a slip of paper Did I get her up to ninety miles an hour inquired Tom eagerly If I did I know when the motor wears down a bit smoother that I can make her hit a hundred in the race easily Did I touch ninety mister Jackson Better than that Tom Better than that cried his father Yes joined in mister Jackson Allowing for the difference in our watches Tom your father and I figure that you did the course at the rate of one hundred and twelve miles an hour One hundred and twelve gasped the young inventor hardly able to believe it I made it a hundred and fifteen said mister Swift who was almost as pleased as was his son and mister Jackson made it one hundred and eleven so we split the difference so to speak You certainly have a sky racer Tom my boy And I ll need it too dad if I m to compete with Andy Foger who may have a machine almost like mine But I thought you were going to object to him if he has said mister Damon who had hardly recovered from the speedy flight through space Well I was just providing for a contingency in case my protest was overruled remarked Tom But I m glad the Humming Bird did so well on her first trial I know she ll do better the more I run her Now we ll get her back in her nest and I ll look her over when she cools down and see if anything has worked loose But the trim little craft needed only slight adjustments after her tryout for Tom had built her to stand up under a terrific strain We ll soon be in shape for the big race he announced and when I bring home that ten thousand dollars I m going to abandon this sky scraping business except for occasional trips What will you do to occupy your mind asked mister Damon Oh I m going to travel announced Tom Then there s my new electric rifle which I have not perfected yet I ll work on that after I win the big race For several days after the first real trial of his sky racer Tom was busy going over the Humming Bird making slight changes here and there He was the sort of a lad who was satisfied with nothing short of the best and though neither his father nor mister Jackson could see where there was room for improvement Tom was so exacting that he sat up for several nights to perfect such little details as a better grip for the steering lever a quicker way of making the automatic equilibriumizer take its position or an improved transmitter for the wireless apparatus That was a part of his monoplane of which Tom was justly proud for though many aeroplanes to day are equipped with the sending device few can receive wireless messages in mid air But Tom had seen the advantage of this while making a trip in the ill fated Red Cloud to the cave of the diamond makers and he determined to have his new craft thus provided against emergencies The wireless outfit of the Humming Bird was a marvel of compactness Thus the days passed with Tom very busy so busy in fact that he hardly had time to call on Miss Nestor As for Andy Foger he heard no more from him and the bully was not seen around Shopton Tom concluded that he was at his uncle s place working on his racing craft The young inventor sent a formal protest to the aviation committee to be used in the event of Andy entering a craft which infringed on the Humming Bird and received word from mister Sharp that the interests of the young inventor would be protected This satisfied Tom Still at times he could not help wondering how the first plans had so mysteriously disappeared and he would have given a good deal to know just how Andy got possession of them and how he knew enough to use them He or some one whom he hired must have gotten into our house mighty quickly that day mused Tom and then skipped out while dad fell into a little doze It was a mighty queer thing but it s lucky it was no worse The time was approaching for the big aviation meet Tom s craft was in readiness and had been given several other trials developing more speed each time Additional locks were put on the doors of the shed and more burglar alarm wires were strung so that it was almost a physical impossibility to get into the Humming Bird s nest without arousing some one in the Swift household And if they do I guess we ll be ready for them said Tom grimly He had been unable to find out who it was that had attempted once before to damage the monoplane but he suspected it was the ill favored man who was working with Andy As for mister Swift at times he seemed quite well and again he required the services of a physician You will have to be very careful of your father Tom said doctor Gladby Any sudden shock or excitement may aggravate his malady and in that case a serious operation will be necessary Oh we ll take good care of him said the lad but he could not help worrying though he tried not to let his father see the strain which he was under It was some days after this and lacking about a week until the meet was to open when a peculiar thing happened Tom had given his Humming Bird a tryout one day and had then begun to make arrangements for taking it apart and shipping it to Eagle Park For he would not fly to the meet in it for fear of some accident So big cases had been provided I ll take it apart in the morning decided Tom as he went to his room after seeing to the burglar alarm and ship her off Then mister Damon and I will go there set her up and get ready to win the race Tom had opened all the windows in his room for it was very warm In fact it was so warm that sleep was almost out of the question and he got up to sit near the windows in the hope of feeling a breeze There it was more comfortable and he was just dozing off and beginning to think of getting back into bed when he was aware of a peculiar sound in the air overhead I wonder if that s a heavy wind starting up he mused Good luck if it is We need it The noise increased sounding more and more like wind but Tom looking out into the night saw the leaves of the trees barely moving If that s a breeze it s taking its own time getting here he went on The sound came nearer and then Tom knew that it was not the noise of the wind in the trees It was more like a roaring and rumbling Can it be distant thunder Tom asked himself There is no sign of a storm Once more he looked from the window The night was calm and clear the trees as still as if they were painted The sound was even more plain now and Tom who had sharp ears at once decided that it was just over the house directly overhead An instant later he knew what it was The motor of an aeroplane or a dirigible balloon he exclaimed Some one is flying overhead For an instant he feared lest the shed had been broken into and his Humming Bird taken but a glance toward the place seemed to show that it was all right Then Tom hastily made his way to where a flight of stairs led to a little enclosed observatory on the roof I m going to see what sort of a craft it is making that noise he said As he opened the trap door and stepped out into the little observatory the sound was so plain as to startle him He looked up quickly and directly overhead he saw a curious sight For flying so low as to almost brush the lightning rod on the chimney of the Swift home was a small aeroplane and as Tom looked up he saw in a light that gleamed from it two figures looking down on him Chapter Sixteen A Mysterious Fire For a few moments Tom did not know what to think Not that the sight of aeroplanes in flight were any novelty to him but to see one flying over his house in the dead of night was a little out of the ordinary Then as he realized that night flights were becoming more common Tom tried to make out the details of the craft I wish I had brought the night glasses with me he said aloud Here they are spoke a voice at his side and so suddenly that Tom was startled He looked down and saw mister Jackson standing beside him Did you hear the noise too the lad asked the engineer Yes It woke me up Then I heard you moving around and I heard you come up here I thought maybe it was a flight of meteors you d come to see and I knew the glasses would be handy so I stopped for them Take a look Tom It s an aeroplane isn t it Yes and not moving very fast either They seem to be circling around here The young inventor was peering through the binoculars and as soon as he had the mysterious craft in focus he cried Look mister Jackson it s a new kind of monoplane I never saw one like it before I wonder who could have invented that It s something like a Santos Dumont and a Bleriot with some features of Cornu s Helicopter That s a queer machine It certainly is agreed the engineer who was now sighting through the glasses In spite of the darkness the binoculars brought out the peculiarities of the aeroplane with considerable distinctness Can you make out who are in it asked Tom No answered mister Jackson You try But Tom had no better luck There were two persons in the odd machine which was slowly flying along moving in a great circle with the Swift house for its center I wonder why they re hanging around here asked Tom suspiciously Perhaps they want to talk to you suggested mister Jackson They may be fellow inventors perhaps one of them is that Philadelphia man who had the Whizzer No replied the lad He would have sent me word if he intended calling on me Those are strangers I think There they are coming back again The mysterious aeroplane was once more circling toward the watchers on the roof There was a movement on the steps near which Tom was standing and his father came up Is anything the matter he asked anxiously Only a queer craft circling around up here was the reply Come and see dad mister Swift ascended to the roof The aeroplane was higher now and those in her could not so easily be made out Tom felt a vague sense of fear as though he was being watched by the evil eyes of his enemies More than once he looked over to the shed where his craft was housed as though some danger might threaten it But the shed of the Humming Bird showed no signs of invaders Suddenly the mysterious aeroplane increased its speed It circled about more quickly and shot upward as though to show the watchers of what it was capable Then with a quick swoop it darted downward straight for the building where Tom s newest invention was housed Look out They ll hit something cried the young inventor as though those in the aeroplane could hear him Then just as though they had heeded his warning the pilots of the mysterious craft shot her upward after she had hovered for an instant over the big shed That was a queer move said Tom It looked as if they lost control of her for a moment And they dropped something cried mister Jackson Look something fell from the aeroplane on the roof of the shed Some tool likely spoke Tom I ll get it in the morning and see what sort of instruments they carry I d like to examine that machine though The queer aeroplane was now shooting off in the darkness and Tom followed it with the glasses wondering what its construction could be like He was to have another sight of it sooner than he expected Well we may as well get back to bed said mister Jackson I m tired and we ve got lots to do to morrow Yes agreed Tom It s cooler now Come on dad Tom fell into a light doze He thought afterward he could not have slept more than half an hour when he heard a commotion out in the yard For an instant he could not tell what it was and then as he grew wider awake he knew that it was the shouting of Eradicate Sampson and the braying of Boomerang But what was Eradicate shouting Fire Fire Fire Tom leaped to his window Wake up Massa Tom Wake up De areoplane shed am on fire an de Humming Bird will burn up Hurry Hurry Tom looked out Flames were shooting up from the roof of the shed where his precious craft was kept Chapter Seventeen mister Swift is Worse Almost before the echoes of Eradicate s direful warning cry had died away Tom was on his way out of the house pausing only long enough to slip on a pair of shoes and his trousers There was but one thought in his mind If he could get the Humming Bird safely out he would not care if the shed did burn even though it contained many valuable tools and appliances We must save my new aeroplane thought Tom desperately I ve got to save her As he raced through the hall he caught up a portable chemical fire extinguisher Tom saw his father s door open and mister Swift looked out What is it he called anxiously Fire answered the young inventor almost before he thought of the doctor s warning that mister Swift must not be excited Tom wished he could recall the word but it was too late Besides Eradicate down in the yard was shouting at the top of his voice Fire Fire Fire Where Tom gasped mister Swift and his son thought the aged inventor grew suddenly paler Aeroplane shed answered the lad But don t worry dad It s only a small blaze We ll get it out You stay here We ll attend to it mister Jackson and Eradicate and I No I m going to help exclaimed mister Swift sturdily I ll be with you Tom Go on The lad rushed down to the yard closely followed by the engineer who had caught up another extinguisher Eradicate was rushing about not knowing what to do but still keeping up his shouting It s on de roof De roof am all blazin he yelled Quit your noise and get to work cried Tom Get out a ladder Rad and raise it to the side of the shed Then play this extinguisher on the blaze mister Jackson you help me run the Humming Bird out After she s safe we ll tackle the fire Tom cast a hurried look at the burning shed The flames were shooting high up from the roof now and eating their way down As he rushed toward the big doors which he intended to open to enable him to run out his sky racer he was wondering how the fire came to start so high up as the roof He wondered if a meteor could have fallen and caused it As the doors which were quickly unlocked by Tom swung back and as he and the engineer started to go in they were met by choking fumes as if of some gas They recoiled for the moment What what s that gasped Tom coughing and sneezing Some chemical I I don t know what kind spluttered mister Jackson Have you any carboys of acid in there Tom that might have exploded by the heat No not a thing Let s try again Once more they tried to go in but were again driven back by the distressing fumes The fire was eating down now There was a hole burned in the roof and by the leaping tongues of flame Tom could see his aeroplane It was almost in the path of the blaze We must get her out he shouted I m going in But it was impossible and the daring young inventor nearly succumbed to the choking odors mister Jackson dragged him back We can t go in he cried There has been some mysterious work here Those fumes were put here to keep us from saving the machine This fire has been set by some enemy We can t go in But I am going declared Tom We ll try the back door They rushed to that but again were driven out by the gases and vapors which were mingled with the smoke Disheartened yet with a wild desire to do something to save his precious craft Tom Swift drew back for a moment As he did so he heard a hiss as Eradicate turned the chemical stream on the blaze Tom looked up The faithful colored man was on a ladder near the burning roof acting well his part as a fireman That s the stuff cried Tom Come on mister Jackson Maybe if we use the chemical extinguishers we can drive out those fumes The engineer understood He took up the extinguisher he had brought and Tom got a second one from a nearby shed Then mister Swift came out bearing another You shouldn t have come dad We can attend to it cried Tom fearing for the effect of the excitement on his invalid parent Oh I couldn t stay there and see the shed burn Are you getting it under control Why don t you run out the Humming Bird Tom did not mention the choking fumes He passed up a full extinguisher to Eradicate who had used all the chemical in his Then Tom got another ladder and soon three streams were being directed on the flames They had eaten a pretty big hole in the roof but the chemicals were slowly telling on them As soon as he saw that Eradicate and mister Jackson could control the blaze Tom descended to the ground and ran once more to the big doors He was determined to make another try to wheel out the aeroplane for he saw from above that the flames were now on the side wall and might reach the craft any minute And it would not take much to inflict serious damage on the sky racer I ll get her fumes or no fumes murmured Tom grimly And whether it was the effect of the chemical streams or whether the choking odors were dissipated through the hole in the roof was not manifested but at any rate Tom found that he could go in though he coughed and gasped for breath He wheeled the aeroplane outside for the Humming Bird was almost as light as her namesake A hurried glance by the gleam of the dying fire assured Tom that his craft was not damaged beyond a slight scorching of one of the wing tips That was a narrow escape he murmured as he wheeled the sky racer far away out of any danger from sparks Then he went back to help fight the fire which was extinguished in about ten minutes more It was a mighty queer blaze said mister Jackson starting at the top that way I wonder what caused it We ll investigate in the morning decided Tom Now dad you must get back to your room He turned to help his father in but at that moment mister Swift who was trying to say something fell over in a dead faint Quick Help me carry him into the house cried Tom Then telephone for doctor Gladby mister Jackson The physician looked grave when half an hour later he examined his patient mister Swift is very much worse he said in a low voice The excitement of the fire has aggravated his ailment I would like another doctor to see him Tom Another doctor Tom s voice showed his alarm Yes we must have a consultation I think doctor Kurtz will be a good one to call in I should like his opinion before I decide what course to take I ll send Eradicate for him at once said the young inventor and he went to give the colored man his instructions while his heart was filled with a great fear for his father Chapter Eighteen The Broken Bridge doctor Kurtz looked as grave as did doctor Gladby when he had made an examination of the patient mister Swift was still in a semi conscious condition hardly breathing as he rested on the bed where they had placed him after the fire Vell said the German physician after a long silence vot is your obinion my dear Gladby I think an operation is necessary Yes dot is so but you know vot kind of an operation alone vill safe him eh my dear Gladby doctor Gladby nodded It will be a rare and delicate one he said There is but one surgeon I know of who can do it You mean Herr Hendrix asked doctor Kurtz Yes doctor Edward Hendrix of Kirkville If he can be induced to come I think there is a chance of saving mister Swift s life I ll speak to Tom about it The two physicians who had been consulting together summoned the youth from another room where with missus Baggert and mister Jackson he had been anxiously awaiting the verdict What is it the young inventor asked doctor Gladby The medical man told him to what conclusion he and his colleague had arrived adding We advise that doctor Hendrix be sent for at once But I need hardly tell you Tom that he is a noted specialist and his services are in great demand He is hard to get I ll pay him any sum he asks burst out the youth I ll spend all my fortune and I have made considerable money of late I ll spend every cent to get my father well Money need not stand in the way doctor Gladby I knew that Tom Still doctor Hendrix is a very busy man and it is hard to induce him to come a long distance It is over a hundred miles to Kirkville and it is an out of the way place I never could understand why doctor Hendrix settled there But there he is and if we want him he will have to come from there The worst of it is that there are few trains and only a single railroad line from there to Shopton Then I ll telegraph decided Tom I ll offer him his own price and ask him to rush here as soon as he can You had better let doctor Kurtz and me attend to that part of it suggested the physician doctor Hendrix would hardly come on the request of some one whom he did not know I ll prepare a telegram briefly explaining the case It is the sort of an operation doctor Hendrix is much interested in and I think he will come on that account if for no other reason I ll write out the message and you can have Eradicate take it to the telegraph office I ll take it myself exclaimed Tom as he got ready to go out into the night with the urgent request Is there any immediate danger for my father he asked No not any immediate danger replied doctor Gladby But the operation is imperative if he is to live It is his one and only chance Tom thought only of his father as he hurried on through the night Even the prospect of the great race so soon to take place had no part in his mind I ll not race until I m sure dad is going to get better he decided With the message to the noted specialist Tom also sent one to mister Damon telling him the news and asking him to come to Shopton Tom felt that the presence of the odd gentleman would help him and mister Damon who first intended to stay on at the Swift home until he and Tom departed for Eagle Park had gone back to his own residence to attend to some business Tom knew he would come in the morning and mister Damon did arrive on the first train Bless my soul he exclaimed with ready sympathy as he extended his hand to Tom What s all this The young inventor told him beginning with the fire that had been the cause of the excitement which produced the change in mister Swift But I have great hopes that the specialist will be able to cure him said Tom for with the coming of daylight his courage had returned to him doctor Gladby and doctor Kurtz depend a great deal on doctor Hendrix he said Yes he certainly is a wonderful man I have heard a great deal about him I have no doubt but what he will cure your father But about the fire How did it start I don t know but now that I have a few hours to spare before the doctor can get here I m going to make an examination Bless my penwiper but I ll help you Tom went into the house to inquire of missus Baggert for probably the tenth time that morning how his father was doing mister Swift was still in a semi conscious condition but he recognized Tom when the youth stood at his bedside Don t worry about me son said the brave old inventor as he took Tom s hand I ll be all right Go ahead and get ready for the race I want you to win Tears came into Tom s eyes Would his father be well enough to allow him to take part in the big event He feared not By daylight it was seen that quite a hole had been burned in the aeroplane shed Tom and mister Damon accompanied by mister Jackson walked through the place And you say the fire broke out right after you had seen the mysterious airship hovering over the house asked the eccentric man Well not exactly after answered Tom but within an hour or so Why do you ask But mister Damon did not answer Something on the floor of the shed amid a pile of blackened and charred pieces of wood attracted his attention He stooped over and picked it up Is this yours he asked Tom No What is it The object looked like a small iron ball with a tube about half an inch in diameter projecting slightly from it Tom took it Why it looks like an infernal machine or a dynamite bomb he said I wonder where it came from Guess I d better drop it in a pail of water Maybe Eradicate found it and brought it here I never saw it before mister Jackson please hand me that pail of water We ll soak this bomb There is no need said mister Damon quietly It is harmless now It has done its work It was that which set fire to your shed and which caused the stifling fumes That cried Tom Yes This ball is hollow and was filled with a chemical It was dropped on the roof and after a certain time the plug in the tube was eaten through the chemicals ran out set the roof ablaze and dripping down inside spread the choking odors that nearly prevented you from getting out your aeroplane Are you sure of this asked the young inventor Positive I read about these bombs recently A German invented them to be used in attacking a besieged city in case of war But how did this one get on my shed roof asked Tom It was dropped there by the mysterious airship exclaimed the odd man That was why the aeroplane moved about over your place Those in it hoped that the fire would not break out until you were all asleep and that the shed and the Humming Bird would be destroyed before you came to the rescue Some of your enemies are still after you Tom And it was Andy Foger I ll wager he cried He was in that aircraft Oh I ll have a long score to settle with him Of course you can t be sure it was he said mister Damon but I wouldn t be a bit surprised but what it was Andy is capable of such a thing He wanted to prevent you from taking part in the race Well he sha n t cried Tom and then he thought of his invalid father They made a further examination of the shed and discovered another empty bomb Then Tom recalled having seen something drop from the mysterious aeroplane as it passed over the shed It was these bombs he said We certainly had a narrow escape Oh wait until I settle my score with Andy Foger As there would be but little use for the aeroplane shed now if Tom sent his craft off to the meet it was decided to repair it temporarily only until he returned Accordingly a big tarpaulin was fastened over the hole in the roof Then Tom put a new wing tip on in place of the one that had been scorched He looked all over his sky racer and decided that it was in fit condition for the coming meet I ll begin to take it apart for shipment as soon as I hear from the specialist that dad is well enough for me to go he said It was a few hours after the discovery of the empty bomb that Tom saw doctor Gladby coming along The physician was urging his horse to top speed Tom felt a vague fear in his heart I ve got a message from doctor Hendrix Tom he said as he stopped his carriage and approached the lad When can he come asked the young inventor eagerly He can t get here Tom Can t get here Why not Because the railroad bridge has collapsed and there is no way to come He can t make any other connections to get here in time in time to do your father any good Tom He has just sent me a telegram to that effect doctor Hendrix can t get here and doctor Gladby paused Do you mean that my father may die if the operation is not performed asked Tom in a low voice Yes was the answer But can t doctor Hendrix drive here in an auto asked the lad Surely there must be some way of getting over the river even if the railroad bridge is down Can t he cross in a boat and drive here He wouldn t be in time Tom Don t you understand doctor Hendrix must be here within four hours if he is to save your father s life He never could do it by driving or by coming on some other road or in an auto He can t make the proper connections There is no way Yes there is cried Tom suddenly I know a way How asked doctor Gladby thrilled by Tom s ringing tones How can you do it Tom I ll go for doctor Hendrix in my Humming Bird Going for him would do no good He must be brought here And so he shall be cried Tom I ll bring him here in my sky racer if he has the nerve to stand the journey and I think he has I ll bring doctor Hendrix here and Tom hurried away to prepare for the thrilling trip Chapter Nineteen A Nervy Specialist There was little time to lose Every moment of delay meant so much less chance for the recovery of mister Swift Even now the periods of consciousness were becoming shorter and farther apart He seemed to be sinking Tom resolutely refused to think of the possibility of death as he went in to bid his parent good by before starting off on his trip through the air mister Swift barely knew his son and with tears in his eyes though he bravely tried to keep them back the young inventor went out into the yard There stood the Humming Bird with mister Jackson mister Damon and Eradicate working over her to get her in perfect trim for the race before her a race with death Fortunately there was little to be done to get the speedy craft ready Tom had accomplished most of what was necessary while waiting for word from doctor Hendrix Now about all that needed to be done was to see that there was plenty of gasoline and oil in the reservoirs I ll give you a note to doctor Hendrix said mister Gladby as Tom was fastening on his faceguard I I trust you won t be disappointed Tom I hope he will consent to return with you He s got to come said the young inventor simply as if that was all there was to it Do you think you can make the trip in time asked mister Damon It is a little less than a hundred miles in an airline but you have to go and go back Can the aeroplane do it I d be ashamed of her if she couldn t said Tom with a grim tightening of his lips She s just got to do it that s all But I know she will and he patted the big propeller and the motor s shining cylinders as though the machine was a thing alive like a horse or a dog who could understand him He climbed to his seat the other one holding a bag of sand to maintain a good balance Start her ordered Tom and mister Jackson twisted the propeller The motor caught at once and the air throbbed with the noise of the explosions Tom listened to the tune of the machinery It sang true Two thousand pounds thrust called the engineer as he looked at the scale Let her go cried Tom whose voice was hardly heard above the roar The trim little aeroplane scudded over the ground gathering speed at every revolution of the wheels Then with a spring like that of some great bird launching itself in flight she left the earth and took to the air Tom was off on his trip Those left behind sent up a cautious cheer for they did not want to disturb mister Swift They waved their hands to the young inventor and he waved his in reply Then he settled down for one of the swiftest flights he had ever undertaken Tom ascended until he struck a favorable current of air There was a little wind blowing in the direction he wished to take and that aided him But even against a powerful head wind the Humming Bird could make progress The young inventor saw the ground slipping backward beneath him Carefully he watched the various indicators and listened intently to the sound of the cylinders explosions They came rapidly and regularly The motor was working well 
7538_100045_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Tom glanced at the barograph 
none	none	It registered two thousand feet and he decided to keep at about that height as it gave him a good view and he could see to steer for a route had been hastily mapped out for him by his friends Over cities towns villages scattered farmhouses across stretches of forest over rivers above big stretches of open country he flew Often he could see eager crowds below gazing up at him But he paid no heed He was looking for a sight of a certain broad river which was near Kirkville Then he knew he would be close to his goal He had speeded up the motor to the limit and there was nothing to do now save to manage the planes wing tips and rudders and to see that the gasoline and oil were properly fed to the machine Faster and faster went the Humming Bird but Tom s thoughts were even faster He was thinking of many things of his father of what he would do if mister Swift died of the mysterious airship of the stolen plans of the fire in the shed of the great race and of Andy Foger He took little note of time and when in less than an hour he sighted the river that told him he was near to Kirkville he was rather startled You certainly did come right along Humming Bird he murmured proudly He descended several hundred feet and as he passed over the town the people of which grew wildly excited he looked about for the house of the noted specialist He knew how to pick it out for doctor Gladby had described it to him and Tom was glad to see as he came within view of the residence that it was surrounded by a large yard I can land almost at his door he said and he did volplaning to earth with an ease born of long practice To say that doctor Hendrix was astonished when Tom dropped in on him in this manner would not be exactly true The specialist was not in the habit of receiving calls from youths in aeroplanes but the fact was that doctor Hendrix was so absorbed in his work and thought so constantly about it that it took a great deal to startle him out of his usual calm And so you came for me in your aeroplane he asked of Tom as he gazed at the trim little craft It is doubtful if he really saw it however as doctor Hendrix was just then thinking of an operation he had performed a few hours before I m sorry you had your trip for nothing he went on I d like very much to come to your father but didn t you get my telegram telling about the broken bridge There is no way for me to get to Shopton in time Yes there is cried Tom eagerly How The same way I came in the aeroplane doctor Hendrix you must go back with me It s the only way to save my father s life Come with me in the Humming Bird It s perfectly safe I can make the trip in less than an hour I can carry you and your instruments Will you come Won t you come to save my father s life Tom was fairly pleading now A trip in an aeroplane mused doctor Hendrix I ve never taken such a thing I Don t be afraid there s really no danger said Tom The physician seemed to reach a sudden conclusion His eyes brightened He walked over and looked at the little Humming Bird For the time being he forgot about his operations I ll go with you he suddenly cried I ll go with you Tom Swift If you ve got the nerve so have I and if my science and skill can save your father s life he ll live to be an old man Wait until I get my bag and I ll be with you Tom s heart gave a bound of hope Chapter Twenty Just in Time While doctor Hendrix was in his office getting ready to make the thrilling trip through the air with Tom the young inventor spent a few minutes going over his monoplane The wonderful little craft had made her first big flight in excellent time though Tom knew she could do better the farther she was flown Not a stay had started not a guy wire was loose The motor had not overheated and every bearing was as cool as though it had not taken part in thousands of revolutions Oh I can depend on you murmured Tom as he looked to see that the propeller was tight on the shaft He gave the bearing a slight adjustment to make sure of it He was at this when the specialist reappeared doctor Hendrix after his first show of excitement when he had made his decision to accompany Tom had resumed his usual calm demeanor Once again he was the grave surgeon with his mind on the case before him Well is my auto ready he asked absentmindedly Then as he saw the little aeroplane and Tom standing waiting beside it he added Oh I forgot for the moment that I was to make a trip through the air instead of in my car Well mister Swift are we all ready All ready replied the young inventor We re going to make fast time doctor Hendrix You d better put this on and Tom extended a face protector What s it for The physician looked curiously at it To keep the air from cutting your cheeks and lips We are going to travel a hundred miles an hour this trip A hundred miles an hour doctor Hendrix spoke as though he would like to back out Maybe more if I can manage it went on Tom calmly as he proceeded to remove the bag of sand from the place where the surgeon was to sit Then he looked to the various equilibrium arrangements and the control levers He was so cool about it taking it all for granted as if rising and flying through the air at a speed rivaling that of the fastest birds was a matter of no moment that doctor Hendrix was impressed by the calm demeanor of the young inventor Very well said the surgeon with a shrug of his shoulders I guess I m game Tom Swift The doctor took the seat Tom pointed out to him with his bag of instruments on his knees He put on the face protector and had at the suggestion of our hero donned a heavy coat For it s cold in the upper regions said Tom Several servants in the physician s household had gathered to see him depart in this novel fashion and the chauffeur of the auto in which the specialist usually made his calls was also there I ll give you a hand said the chauffeur to the young inventor I was at an aviation meet once and I know how it s done Good exclaimed Tom Then you can hold the machine and shove when I give the word Tom started the propeller himself and quickly jumped into his seat The chauffeur held back the Humming Bird until the young aviator had speeded up the motor Let go cried the youthful inventor and the man gave the little craft a shove Across the rather uneven ground of the doctor s yard it ran straight for a big iron barrier Look out We ll be into the fence shouted the surgeon We ll be killed He seemed about to leap off Sit still cried Tom and at that instant he tilted the elevation planes and the craft shot upward going over the fence like a circus horse taking a seven barred gate Oh exclaimed the physician in a curious voice They were off on their trip to save the life of mister Swift What the sensations of the celebrated specialist were Tom never learned If he was afraid his fright quickly gave place to wonder and the wonder soon changed to delight as the machine rose higher and higher acquired more speed and soared in the air over the country that spread out in all directions from Kirkville Magnificent Magnificent murmured the doctor and then Tom knew that the surgeon was in the grip of the air and was one of the bird men Every moment the Humming Bird increased her speed They passed over the river near where men were working on the broken bridge It was now no barrier to them Tom noting the barograph and seeing that they were twenty two hundred feet high decided to keep at about that distance from the earth How fast are we going cried doctor Hendrix into the ear of the young inventor Just a little short of a hundred an hour Tom shouted back We ll hit a hundred and five before long His prediction proved true and when about forty miles from Shopton that terrific speed had been attained It seemed as if they were going to have a trip devoid of incident and Tom was congratulating himself on the quick time made when he ran into a contrary strata of air Almost before he knew it the Humming Bird gave a dangerous and sickening dive and tilted at a terrifying angle Are we going to turn turtle cried the doctor I I hope not gasped Tom He could not understand why the equilibrium weights did not work but he had no time then to investigate Quickly he warped the wing tips and brought the craft up on an even keel He gave a sigh of relief as the aeroplane was once more shooting forward and he was not mistaken when he thought he heard doctor Hendrix murmur a prayer of thankfulness Their escape had been a narrow one Tom s nerve and the coolness of the physician had alone saved them from a fall to death But now as if ashamed of her prank the Humming Bird went along even better than before Tom was peering through the slight haze that hung over the earth for a sight of Shopton At length the spires of the churches came into view There it is he called pointing downward We ll land in two minutes more No time to spare murmured the doctor who knew the serious nature of the aged inventor s illness How long did it take us Fifty one minutes replied Tom glancing at a small clock in front of him Then he shut off the motor and volplaned to earth to the no small astonishment of the surgeon He made a perfect landing in the yard before the shed leaped from his seat and called Come doctor Hendrix The surgeon followed him doctor Gladby and doctor Kurtz came to the door of the house On their faces were grave looks They greeted the celebrated surgeon eagerly Well he asked quickly and they knew what he meant You are only just in time said doctor Gladby softly and Tom following the doctors into the house wondered if his trip with the specialist had been in vain Chapter Twenty One Will He Live Soon there were busy scenes in the Swift home as preparations were made for a serious operation on the aged inventor Tom s father had sunk into deep unconsciousness and was stretched out on the bed as though there was no more life in him In fact Tom for the moment feared that it was all over But good old doctor Kurtz noting the look on the lad s face said Ach Dom doan t vorry Maybe it vill yet all be vell und der vater vill hear of der great race Bluck up your courage und doan t gif up Der greatest surgeon in der vorld is here now und if anybody gan safe your vater Herr Hendriz gan Dot vos a great drip you made a great drip Tom felt a little comforted and after a sight of his father and a silent prayer that God would spare his life for years to come the young inventor went out in the yard He wanted to be busy about something for he knew with the doctors and a trained nurse who had been hastily summoned there was no immediate need for him He wanted to get his mind off the operation that would soon take place and so he decided to look over his aeroplane mister Damon came out when Tom was going over the guy wires and braces to see how they had stood the strain Well Tom my lad said the eccentric man sadly as he grasped our hero s hand it s too bad But hope for the best I m sure your father will pull through We will have to begin taking the Humming Bird apart soon won t we if we re going to ship it to Eagle Park He wanted to take Tom s mind off his troubles I don t know whether we will or not was the answer and Tom tried to speak unbrokenly but there was a troublesome lump in his throat and a mist of tears in his eyes that prevented him from seeing well The Humming Bird to him looked as if she was in a fog Nonsense Of course we will cried mister Damon Why bless my wishbone Tom you don t mean to say you re going to let that little shrimp Andy Foger walk away with that ten thousand dollar prize without giving him a fight for it are you This was just what Tom needed and it seemed good to have mister Damon bless something again even if it was only a wishbone No exclaimed Tom in ringing tones Andy Foger isn t going to beat me and if I find out he is going to race with a machine made after my stolen plans I ll make him wish he d never taken them But if the machine he had flying over here when he dropped that bomb on the shed roof and set fire to it is the one he s going to race with it isn t like yours suggested mister Damon who was glad he had turned the conversation into a more cheerful channel That s so agreed the young inventor Well we ll have to wait and see He was busy now going over every detail of the Humming Bird mister Damon helped him and they discovered the defect in the equilibrium weights and remedied it We can t afford to have an accident in the race said Tom He glanced toward the house and wondered if the operation had begun yet He could see the trained nurse hurrying here and there missus Baggert helping her Eradicate Sampson shuffled out from the stable where he kept his mule Boomerang On the face of the honest colored man there was a dejected look Am Massa Swift any better Massa Tom he asked We can t tell yet was the answer Well if he doan t git well den I m goin t sell mah mule went on the dirt chaser from which line of activity Eradicate had derived his name Sell Boomerang Bless my curry comb what for asked mister Damon Case as how he wouldn t neber be any good fo wuk any mo explained Eradicate He s got so attached t dis place an all de folkes on it dat he d feel so sorry ef ef well ef any ob em went away dat I couldn t git no mo wuk out ob him no how So ef Massa Swift doan t git well den I an Boomerang parts Well we hope it won t happen said Tom greatly touched by the simple grief of Eradicate The young inventor was silent a moment and then he softly added I I wonder when when we ll know Soon now I think answered mister Damon in a low voice Silently they waited about the aeroplane Tom tried to busy himself but he could not He kept his eyes fastened on the house It seemed like several hours but it was not more than one ere the white capped nurse came to the door and waved her hand to Tom He sprang to his feet and rushed forward What would be the message he was to receive He stood before the nurse his heart madly beating She looked gently at him Will he will he live Tom asked pantingly I think so she answered gently The operation is over It was a success so far Time alone will tell now doctor Hendrix says you can see your father for just a moment Chapter Twenty Two Off to the Meet Softly Tom tiptoed into the room where his father lay At the bedside were the three doctors and the nurse followed the young inventor in missus Baggert stood in the hall and near her was Garret Jackson The aged housekeeper had been weeping but she smiled at Tom through her tears
7538_100043_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 I think he s going to get well she whispered

7538_100043_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Tom s heart felt better 
none	none	You must only speak a few words to him cautioned the specialist who had performed such a rare and delicate operation near the heart of the invalid He is very weak Tom mister Swift opened his eyes as his son approached 
7538_100043_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He looked around feebly 
none	none	Tom are you there he asked in a whisper
7538_100043_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes dad was the eager answer

none	none	Yes dad How did she work Fine 
7538_100043_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Over a hundred and the motor wasn t at its best 
7538_100043_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 That s good 
none	none	Then you can go in the big race and win No I don t believe I ll go dad
7538_100043_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not mister Swift spoke more strongly 
7538_100043_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I because well I don t want to

none	none	The invalid s strength was fast leaving him
7538_100043_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I I began Tom 
none	none	Promise insisted the aged inventor trying to rise 
7538_100043_000021_000001	train-clean-360	doctor Hendrix made a hasty move toward the bed 
none	none	Promise whispered the surgeon to Tom
7538_100043_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I I promise exclaimed Tom and the aged inventor sank back with a smile of satisfaction on his pale face 
7538_100043_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Now you must go said doctor Gladby to Tom 
7538_100043_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 He has talked long enough He must sleep now and get up his strength 
none	none	Will he get better asked Tom anxiously

none	none	I don t want to enter the race unless I know he is going to live went on Tom as doctor Gladby followed him out of the room
7538_100043_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 No one can say for a certainty that he will recover spoke the physician 
7538_100043_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 You will have to hope for the best that is all Tom 
7538_100043_000028_000002	train-clean-360	If I were you I d go in the race 
none	none	It will occupy your mind and if you could send good news to your father it might help him in the fight for life he is making But suppose suppose something happens while I am away suggested the young inventor 
7538_100043_000030_000000	train-clean-360	The doctor thought for a moment 
7538_100043_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Then he exclaimed 
none	none	You have a wireless outfit on your craft haven t you Yes Then you can receive messages from here every hour if you wish Garret Jackson your engineer can send them and you can pick them up in mid air if need be So I can cried Tom
7538_100043_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 I will go to the meet 
7538_100043_000034_000002	train-clean-360	I ll take the Humming Bird apart at once and ship it to Eagle Park 
7538_100043_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Unless doctor Hendrix wants to go back in it he added as an after thought 
none	none	No spoke doctor Gladby doctor Hendrix is going to remain here for a few days in case of an emergency 
7538_100043_000035_000001	train-clean-360	By that time the bridge will have been repaired and he can go back by train 
none	none	I gather from what he said that though he liked the air trip he will not care for another one Very well assented Tom and mister Damon and he were kept busy packing the Humming Bird for shipment mister Jackson helped them and Eradicate and his mule Boomerang were called on occasionally when boxes or crates were to be taken to the railroad station In the meanwhile mister Swift if he did not improve any at least held his own This the doctors said was a sign of hope and though Tom was filled with anxiety he tried to think that fate would be kind to him and that his father would recover doctor Hendrix left saying there was nothing more he could do and that the rest depended on the local physicians and on the nurse Und ve vill do our duty ponderously exclaimed doctor Kurtz You go off to dot bird race Dom und doan t vorry Ve vill send der with out vire messages to you venever dere is anyt ing to report Go mit a light heart How Tom wished he could but it was out of the question The last of the parts of the Humming Bird had been sent away and our hero forwarded a telegram to mister Sharp of the arrangement committee stating that he and mister Damon would soon follow Then having bidden his father a fond farewell and after arranging with mister Jackson to send frequent wireless messages Tom and the eccentric man left for the meet There was a wireless station at Eagle Park and Tom had planned to receive the messages from home there until he could set up his own plant He would have two outfits One in the big tent where the Humming Bird was to be put together and another on the machine itself so that when in the air practicing or even in the great race itself there would be no break in the news that was to be flashed through space Tom and mister Damon arrived at Eagle Park on time and Tom s first inquiry was for a message from home There was one stating that mister Swift was fairly comfortable and seemed to be doing well With happiness in his heart the young inventor then set about getting the parts of his craft from the station to the park where he and mister Damon with a trusty machinist whom mister Sharp had recommended would assemble it Tom arranged that in his absence the wireless operator on the grounds would take any message that came for him The Humming Bird in the big cases and boxes had safely arrived and these were soon in the tent which had been assigned to Tom It was still several days until the opening of the meet and the grounds presented a scene of confusion Workmen were putting up grand stands tents and sheds were being erected exhibitors were getting their machines in shape and excited contestants of many nationalities were hurrying to and fro inquiring about parts delayed in shipment or worrying lest some of their pet ideas be stolen Tom and mister Damon with Frank Forker the young machinist were soon busy in their big tent which was a combined workshop and living quarters for Tom had determined to stay right on the ground until the big race was over I don t see anything of Andy Foger remarked mister Damon on the second day of their residence in the park There are lots of new entries arriving but he doesn t seem to be on hand There s time enough replied Tom I am afraid he s hanging back until the last minute and will spring his machine so late that I won t have time to lodge a protest 
7538_100043_000046_000002	train-clean-360	It would be just like him 
none	none	Well I ll be on the lookout for him 
7538_100043_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Have you heard from home to day Tom 
none	none	No I m expecting a message any minute The young inventor glanced toward the wireless apparatus which had been set up in the tent At that moment there came the peculiar sound which indicated a message coming through space and down the receiving wires There s something now exclaimed Tom as he hurried over and clamped the telephone receiver to his ear 
7538_100043_000048_000003	train-clean-360	He listened a moment 
7538_100043_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Good news he exclaimed 
none	none	Dad sat up a little to day I guess he s going to get well and he clicked back congratulations to his father and the others in Shopton Another day saw the Humming Bird almost in shape again and Tom was preparing for a tryout of the engine mister Damon had gone over to the committee headquarters to consult with mister Sharp about the steps necessary for Tom to take in case Andy did attempt to enter a craft that infringed on the ideas of the young inventor and on his way back he saw a newly erected tent There was a young man standing in the entrance at the sight of whom the eccentric man murmured Bless my skate strap 
7538_100043_000052_000001	train-clean-360	His face looks very familiar 
none	none	The youth disappeared inside the tent suddenly and as mister Damon came opposite the canvas shelter he started in surprise For on a strip of muslin which was across the tent painted in gay colors were the words THE FOGER AEROPLANE
7538_100043_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Bless my elevation rudder cried mister Damon 
7538_100043_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 Andy s here at last 
none	none	I must tell Tom 
7538_100044_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Chapter Twenty Three
none	none	 The Great Race Well remarked mister Sharp when Tom and mister Damon had called on him to state that Andy Foger s machine was now on the grounds and demanding to be allowed to view it to see if it was an infringement on the one entered by the young inventor I ll do the best I can for you I ll lay the case before the committee 
7538_100044_000003_000001	train-clean-360	It will meet at once and I ll let you know what they say 
none	none	Understand said Tom I don t want to interfere unless I am convinced that Andy is trying an underhand trick 
7538_100044_000004_000001	train-clean-360	My plans are missing and I think he took them 
none	none	If his machine is made after those plans it is obviously a steal and I want him ruled out of the meet And so he shall be exclaimed mister Sharp
7538_100044_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 Get the evidence against him and we ll act quickly enough 
none	none	The committee met in about an hour and considered the case Meanwhile Tom and mister Damon strolled past the tent with its flaring sign There was a man on guard but Andy was not in sight Then Tom was sent for and mister Sharp told him what conclusion had been arrived at It was this Under the rules of the meet said the balloonist we had to guarantee privacy to all the contestants until such time as they choose to exhibit their machines 
7538_100044_000008_000001	train-clean-360	That is they need not bring them out until just before the races he added 
none	none	This is not a handicap affair and the speediest machine or the one that goes to the greatest height according to which class it enters will win In consequence we cannot force any contestant to declare what kind of a machine he will use until he gets ready Some are going to use the familiar type of biplanes and as you can see there is no secret about them They are trying them out now This was so for several machines of this type were either in the air circling about or were being run over the ground But others continued mister Sharp will not even take the committee into their confidence until just before the race They want to keep their craft a secret We can t compel them to do otherwise I m sorry Tom but the only thing I see for you to do is to wait until the last minute Then if you find Andy has infringed on your machine lodge a protest that is unless you can get evidence against him before that time Tom well knew the uselessness of the latter plan He and mister Damon had tried several times to get a glimpse of the craft Andy had made but without success As to the other alternative that of waiting until the last moment Tom feared that too would be futile For he reasoned just before the race there will be a lot of confusion officials will be here and there scattered over the ground they will be hard to find and it will be almost useless to protest then Andy will enter the race and there is a possibility that he may win Almost any one could with a machine like the Humming Bird It s the machine almost as much as the operator in a case like this But you can protest after the race suggested mister Damon That would be little good in case Andy beat me The public would say I was a sorehead and jealous 
7538_100044_000014_000002	train-clean-360	No I ve either got to stop Andy before the race or not at all 
7538_100044_000014_000003	train-clean-360	I will try to think of a plan 
none	none	Tom did think of several but abandoned them one after the other He tried to get a glimpse inside the tent where the Foger aeroplane was housed but it was too closely guarded Andy himself was not much in evidence and Tom only had fleeting glimpses of the bully 
7538_100044_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile he and mister Damon together with their machinist were kept busy 
none	none	As Tom s craft was fully protected by patents now he had no hesitation in taking it out and it was given several severe tests around the aerial course It did even better than Tom expected of it and he had great hopes Always though there were two things that worried him One was his father s illness and the other the uneasiness he felt as to what Andy Foger might do As to the former the wireless reports indicated that mister Swift was doing as well as could be expected but his improvement was not rapid Regarding the latter worry Tom saw no way of getting rid of it I ve just got to wait that s all he thought The day before the opening of the meet Tom and mister Damon had given the Humming Bird a grueling tryout They had taken her high up so high that no prying eyes could time them and there Tom had opened the motor for all the power in it They had flashed through space at the rate of one hundred and twenty miles an hour If we can only do that in the race the ten thousand dollars is mine exulted Tom as he slanted the nose of the aeroplane toward the earth The day of the race dawned clear and beautiful Tom was up early for there remained many little things to do to get his craft in final trim for the contest Then too he wanted to be ready to act promptly as soon as Andy s machine was wheeled out and he also wanted to get a message from home The wireless arrived soon after breakfast and did not contain very cheering news Your father not so well mister Jackson sent
7538_100044_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 Poor night but doctor thinks day will show improvement 
none	none	Don t worry Don t worry 
7538_100044_000024_000001	train-clean-360	I wonder who could help it mused poor Tom 
none	none	Well I ll hope for the best and he wired back to tell the engineer in Shopton to keep in touch with him and to flash the messages to the Humming Bird in the air after the big race started Now I ll go out and see if I can catch a glimpse of what that sneak Andy has to pit against me said Tom The Foger tent was tightly closed and Tom turned back to his own place having arranged with a messenger to come and let him know as soon as Andy s craft was wheeled out All about was a scene of great activity The grand stands were filled and a big crowd stood about the field anxiously waiting for the first sight of the bird men in their wonderful machines Now and then the band blared out and cheers arose as one after another the frail craft were wheeled to the starting place Men in queer leather costumes darted here and there they were the aviators who were soon to risk life and limb for glory and gold Most of them were nervously smoking cigarettes The air was filled with guttural German or nasal French while now and then the staccato Russian was heard and occasionally the liquid tones of a Japanese For men of many nations were competing for the prizes The majority of the machines were monoplanes and biplanes though one triplane was entered and there were several freaks as the biplane and monoplane men called them craft of the helicopter or the wheel type There was also one Witzig Liore Dutilleul biplane with three planes behind Tom was familiar with most of these types but occasionally he saw a new one that excited his curiosity 
7538_100044_000030_000001	train-clean-360	However he was more interested in what Andy Foger would turn out 
none	none	Andy s machine had not been tried and Tom wondered how he dared risk flying in it without at least a preliminary tryout But Andy and those with him were evidently full of confidence News of the suspicions of Tom and what he intended to do in case these suspicions proved true had gotten around and there was quite a crowd about his own tent and another throng around that of Andy Tom and mister Damon had wheeled the Humming Bird out of her canvas nest There was a cheer as the crowd caught sight of the trim little craft The young inventor the eccentric man and the machinist were busy going over every part Meanwhile the meet had been officially opened and it was announced that the preliminary event would be some air evolutions at no great height and for no particular prize Several biplanes and monoplanes took part in this It was very interesting but the big ten thousand dollar race over a distance of a hundred miles was the principal feature of the meet and all waited anxiously for this The opening stunts passed off successfully save that a German operator in a Bleriot came to grief crashing down to the ground wrecking his machine and breaking an arm But he only laughed at that and coolly demanded another cigarette as he crawled out of the tangle of wires planes and the motor After this there was an exhibition flight by a French aviator in a Curtis biplane who raced against one in a Baby Wright It was a dead heat according to the judges 
7538_100044_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Then came a flight for height and while no records were broken the crowd was well satisfied 
none	none	Get ready for the hundred mile ten thousand dollar prize race shouted the announcer through his megaphone Tom s heart gave a bound There were seven entrants in this contest besides Tom and Andy Foger and as announced by the starter they were as follows CONTESTANT MACHINE Von Bergen Wright Biplane Alameda Antoinette Monoplane Perique Bleriot Monoplane Loi Tong Santos Dumont Monoplane Wendell Curtis Biplane De Tromp Farman Biplane Lascalle Demoiselle Monoplane Andy Foger Tom Swift Humming Bird Monoplane What is the style of the Foger machine yelled some one in the crowd as the announcer lowered his megaphone It has not been announced was the reply It will at once be wheeled out though in accordance with the conditions of the race There was a craning of necks and an uneasy movement in the crowd for Tom s story was now generally known
7538_100044_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Get ready to make your protest advised mister Damon to the young inventor 
none	none	I ll stay by the machine here until you come back Bless my radiator 
7538_100044_000042_000003	train-clean-360	I hope you beat him 
none	none	I will if it s possible murmured Tom with a grim tightening of his lips There was a movement about Andy s tent whence for the last half hour had come spasmodic noises that indicated the trying out of the motor The flaps were pulled back and a curious machine was wheeled into view Tom rushed over toward it intent on getting the first view 
7538_100044_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Would it prove to be a copy of his speedy Humming Bird 
none	none	Eagerly he looked but a curious sight met his eyes The machine was totally unlike any he had expected to see It was large and to his mind rather clumsy but it looked powerful Then as he took in the details he knew that it was the same one that had flown over his house that night it was the one from which the fire bomb had been dropped 
7538_100044_000046_000000	train-clean-360	He pushed his way through the crowd 
none	none	He saw Andy standing near the curious biplane which type of air craft it nearest resembled though it had some monoplane features On the side was painted the name SLUGGER 
7538_100044_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Andy caught sight of Tom Swift 
7538_100044_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I m going to beat you the bully boasted and I haven t a machine like yours after all 
none	none	You were wrong
7538_100044_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 So I see stammered Tom hardly knowing what to think 
none	none	What did you do with my plans then
7538_100044_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I never had them 
none	none	Andy turned away and began to assist the men he had hired to help him Like all the others his machine had two seats for in this race each operator must carry a passenger Tom turned away both glad and sorry glad that his rival was not to race him in a duplicate of the Humming Bird but sorry that he had as yet no track of the strangely missing plans I wonder where they can be mused the young inventor Then came the firing of the preliminary gun Tom rushed back to where mister Damon stood waiting for him There was a last look at the Humming Bird She was fit to race any machine on the ground mister Damon took his place Tom started the propeller The other contestants were in their seats with their passengers Their assistants stood ready to shove them off The explosions of so many motors in action were deafening
7538_100044_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 How much thrust cried Tom to his machinist 
none	none	Twenty two hundred pounds Good The report of the starting gun could not be heard 
7538_100044_000060_000001	train-clean-360	But the smoke of it leaped into the air 
none	none	It was the signal to go Tom s voice would not have carried five feet He waved his hands as a signal 
7538_100044_000061_000002	train-clean-360	His helper thrust the Humming Bird forward 
7538_100044_000061_000003	train-clean-360	Over the smooth ground it rushed 
none	none	Tom looked eagerly ahead On a line with him were the other machines including Andy Foger s Slugger Tom pulled a lever 
7538_100044_000062_000001	train-clean-360	He felt his craft soar upward 
none	none	The other machines also pointed their noses into the air The big race for the ten thousand dollar prize was under way 
7538_100045_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Chapter Twenty Four
none	none	 Won by a Length Rising upward on a steep slant for he wanted to get into the upper currents as soon as possible Tom looked down and off to his left and saw one machine going over the ground in curious leaps and bounds It was the tiny Demoiselle the smallest craft in the race and its peculiar style of starting was always thus manifested
7538_100045_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe he s going to make it thought Tom 
none	none	He was right In another moment the tiny craft after rising a short distance dove downward and was wrecked The young inventor saw the two men crawling out from the tangled planes and wings apparently uninjured One contestant less thought Tom grimly though with pity in his heart for the unfortunates 
7538_100045_000007_000000	train-clean-360	However he must think of himself and his own craft now 
none	none	He glanced at mister Damon sitting beside him That odd gentleman with never a thought of blessing anything now unless he did it silently was watching the lubricating system This was a vital part of the craft for if anything went wrong with it and the bearings overheated the race would have to be abandoned So Tom was not trusting to any automatic arrangement but had instituted almost at the last moment a duplicate hand worked system so that if one failed him he would have the other
7538_100045_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 A good start shouted mister Damon in his ear 
none	none	Tom nodded and glanced behind him On a line with the Humming Bird and at about the same elevation were the Bleriot monoplane and a Wright biplane Below were the Santos Dumont and the Antoinette
7538_100045_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s the Slugger called Tom to his friend 
none	none	mister Damon motioned upward There in the air above Tom s machine and slightly in advance was Andy Foger s craft He had gotten away in better shape than had the Humming Bird 
7538_100045_000012_000000	train-clean-360	For a moment Tom s heart misgave him 
none	none	Then he turned on more power and had the satisfaction of mounting upward and shooting onward until he was on even terms with Andy The bully gave one glance over toward his rival and pulled a lever The Slugger increased her speed but Tom was not a second behind him There was a roaring noise in the rear and up shot De Tromp in the Farman and Loi Tong the little Japanese in the Santos Dumont Truly the race was going to be a hotly contested one But the end was far off yet After the first jockeying for a start and position the race settled down into what might be termed a grind The course was a large one but so favorable was the atmosphere that day and such was the location of Eagle Park in a great valley that even on the far side of the great ellipse the contestants could be seen dimly with the naked eye but very plainly with glasses with which many of the spectators were provided Around and around they went at no very great height for it was necessary to make out the signals set up by the race officials so that the contestants would know when they were near the finish that they might use the last atom of speed So at varying heights the wonderful machines circled about the course The Humming Bird was working well and Tom felt a sense of pride as he saw the ground slipping away below him He felt sure that he would win even when Alameda the Spaniard in the Antoinette came creeping up on him and even when Andy Foger with a burst of speed placed himself and his passenger in the lead
7538_100045_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll catch him muttered Tom and he opened the throttle a trifle wider and went after Andy passing him with ease 
none	none	They had covered about thirty miles of the course when the humming and crackling of the wireless apparatus told Tom that a message was coming He snapped the receiver to his ear adjusting the outer covering to shut out the racket of the motor and listened
7538_100045_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Well asked mister Damon as Tom took off the receiver 
7538_100045_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Dad isn t quite so well answered the lad 
none	none	mister Jackson says they have sent for doctor Hendrix again 
7538_100045_000021_000003	train-clean-360	But dad is game 
7538_100045_000021_000004	train-clean-360	He sends me word to go on and win and I ll do it too only 
7538_100045_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Tom paused and choked back a sob 
none	none	Then he prepared to get more speed out of his motor
7538_100045_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course you will cried mister Damon 
none	none	Bless my But they encountered an adverse current of wind at that moment and it required the attention of both of the aviators to manage the machine It was soon on an even keel again and once more was shooting forward around the course At times Tom would be in advance and again he would have to give place to the Curtis the Farman or the Santos Dumont as these speedy machines favored by a spurt from their motors or by some current of air shot ahead But in general Tom maintained the lead and among the spectators there began a series of guesses as to how much he would win by Tom glanced at the barograph It registered a little over twelve hundred feet 
7538_100045_000026_000002	train-clean-360	He looked at the speed gage 
none	none	He was doing a trifle better than a hundred miles an hour 
7538_100045_000026_000004	train-clean-360	He looked down at the signals 
7538_100045_000026_000005	train-clean-360	There was twenty miles yet to go 
none	none	It was almost time for the spurt for which he had been holding back 
7538_100045_000026_000007	train-clean-360	Yet he would wait until five miles from the end and then he felt that he could gain and maintain a lead 
7538_100045_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Andy seems to be doing well said mister Damon 
7538_100045_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes he has a good machine conceded Tom 
none	none	Five miles more were reeled off 
7538_100045_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Then another five 
none	none	Another round of that distance and Tom would key his motor up to the highest pitch and then the Humming Bird would show what she could do 
7538_100045_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Eagerly Tom waited for the right signal 
none	none	Suddenly the wireless began buzzing again 
7538_100045_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Quickly the young inventor clamped the receiver to his ear 
7538_100045_000030_000002	train-clean-360	mister Damon saw him turn pale 
7538_100045_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 doctor Gladby says dad has a turn for the worse 
7538_100045_000031_000001	train-clean-360	There is little hope translated Tom 
7538_100045_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you are you going to quit asked mister Damon 
none	none	Tom shook his head No he cried
7538_100045_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 My father has become unconscious so mister Jackson says but his last words were to me Tell Tom to win the race And I m going to do it 
7538_100045_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Tom suddenly changed his plans 
none	none	There was to be no waiting for the signal now 
7538_100045_000035_000002	train-clean-360	He would begin his final spurt and if possible finish the hundred miles at his utmost speed win the race and then hasten to his father s side 
none	none	With a menacing roar the motor of the Humming Bird took up the additional power that Tom sent into her 
7538_100045_000036_000001	train-clean-360	She shot ahead like an eagle darting after his prey 
7538_100045_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Tom opened up a big gap between his machine and the one nearest him which at that moment was the Antoinette with the Spaniard driving her 
7538_100045_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Now to win cried Tom grimly 
none	none	Surely no race was ever flown as was that one 
7538_100045_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Tom flashed through the air so quickly that his speed was almost incredible 
none	none	The gage registered one hundred and thirty miles an hour Down below in the grand stands and on the aviation field there were yells of approval of wonder of fear 
7538_100045_000039_000001	train-clean-360	But Tom and mister Damon could not hear them 
7538_100045_000039_000002	train-clean-360	They only heard the powerful song of the motor 
7538_100045_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Faster and faster flew the Humming Bird 
7538_100045_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Tom looked down and saw the signal put up which meant that there were but three miles more to go He felt that he could do it 
7538_100045_000040_000002	train-clean-360	He was half a lap ahead of them all now But he saw Andy Foger s machine pulling away from the bunch 
7538_100045_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 He s going to try to catch me exulted Tom 
none	none	Then something happened 
7538_100045_000042_000001	train-clean-360	The motor of the Humming Bird suddenly slackened its speed it missed explosions and the trim little craft began to drop behind 
7538_100045_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 What s the matter cried mister Damon 
none	none	Three of the cylinders are out of business yelled Tom
7538_100045_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 We re done for I guess 
7538_100045_000045_000000	train-clean-360	On came the other machines Andy in the lead then the Santos Dumont then the Farman and lastly the Wright 
7538_100045_000045_000001	train-clean-360	They saw the plight of the Humming Bird and determined to beat her 
7538_100045_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Tom cast a despairing look up at the motor 
none	none	There was nothing to be done 
7538_100045_000045_000004	train-clean-360	He could not reach it in mid air 
none	none	He could only keep on crippled as he was and trust to luck Andy passed by his rival with an evil smile on his ugly face 
7538_100045_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Then the Antoinette flashed by 
none	none	In turn all the others left Tom in the rear 
7538_100045_000046_000003	train-clean-360	His heart was like lead 
7538_100045_000046_000004	train-clean-360	mister Damon gazed blankly forward 
7538_100045_000046_000005	train-clean-360	They were beaten It did not seem possible 
7538_100045_000047_000000	train-clean-360	There was but a single chance 
7538_100045_000047_000001	train-clean-360	If Tom shut off all power coasted for a moment and then ere the propeller had ceased revolving if he could start the motor on the spark the silent cylinders might pick up with the others and begin again 
7538_100045_000047_000002	train-clean-360	He would try it 
7538_100045_000047_000003	train-clean-360	They could be no worse off than they were 
7538_100045_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 A mile behind gasped Tom 
7538_100045_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 It s a long chance but I ll take it 
7538_100045_000049_000000	train-clean-360	He shut off the power 
none	none	The motor was silent the Humming Bird began to fall But ere she had gone down ten feet Tom suddenly switched on the batteries There was a moment of silence and then came the welcome roar that told of the rekindled motor 
7538_100045_000049_000004	train-clean-360	And such a roar as it was 
none	none	Every cylinder was exploding as though none of them had ever stopped
7538_100045_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 We did it yelled Tom 
none	none	Opening up at full speed he sent the sky racer on the course to overtake and pass his rivals 
7538_100045_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Slowly he crept on them 
7538_100045_000051_000001	train-clean-360	They looked back and saw him coming 
7538_100045_000051_000002	train-clean-360	They tried to put on more speed but it was impossible 
none	none	Andy Foger was in the lead He was being slowly overhauled by the Santos Dumont with the queer tail rudders
7538_100045_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll get him muttered Tom 
7538_100045_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll pass em all 
none	none	And he did With a wonderful burst of speed the little Humming Bird overtook one after another of her larger rivals and passed them 
7538_100045_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Then she crept up on Andy s Slugger 
7538_100045_000054_000000	train-clean-360	In an instant more it was done and a good length in advance of the Foger craft Tom shot over the finish line a winner richer by ten thousand dollars and not only that but he had picked up a mile that had been lost and had snatched victory from almost certain defeat 
none	none	There was a succession of thundering cheers as he shut off the motor and volplaned to earth but he paid little attention to them He brought his craft to a stop just as the wireless on it buzzed again He listened with a look of pain on his face My father is dying he said simply I must go to him mister Damon will you fill the tanks with oil and gasoline while I send off a message Oil and gasoline murmured the odd man while hundreds pressed up to congratulate Tom Swift What are you going to do I m going to my father in the Humming Bird said Tom It s the only way I can see him alive and he began to click off a message to mister Jackson stating that he had won the race and was going to fly to Shopton while mister Damon and several others replenished the fuel and oil of the aeroplane Tom Swift had won one race Could he win the other Chapter Twenty Five Home Again Conclusion mister Sharp pushed his way through the crowd The committee has the certified check ready for you Tom called the balloonist Will you come and get it Send it to me please answered the young inventor I must go to my father Huh I d have beaten him in another round boasted Andy Foger No one paid any attention to him Monsieur ezz plucky said the Frenchman Perique I am honaired to shake his hand He has broken all ze records Dot s der best machine I effer saw spoke the Dutchman De Tromp ponderously Shake hands Ver fine ver good came from the little Japanese and all the contestants congratulated Tom warmly Never before had a hundred miles been covered so speedily A man elbowed his way through the press of people Is your machine fully protected by patents he inquired earnestly It is said Tom Then as a representative of the United States Government I would like an option to purchase the exclusive right to use them said the man Can you guarantee that no one else has any plans of them It will mean a fortune to you Tom hesitated He thought of the stolen plans If he could only get possession of them He glanced at Andy Foger who was wheeling his machine back into the tent But there was no time now to have it out with the bully I will see you again said Tom to the government agent I must go to my father who is dying I can t answer you now The tanks were filled Tom gave a hasty look to his machine and bidding his new friends farewell he and mister Damon took their places aboard the Humming Bird The little craft rose in the air and soon they had left Eagle Park far behind Eagerly Tom strained his eyes for a sight of his home town though he knew it would be several hours ere he could hover over it Would he be in time Would he be in time That question came to him again and again For a time the Humming Bird skimmed along as though she delighted in the rapid motion in slipping through the air and sliding along on the billows of wind Tom with critical ears listened to the hum of the motor the puffing of the exhaust the grinding of the gear wheels and the clicking of the trips as valve after valve opened or closed to admit the mixture of air and gasoline or closed to give the compression necessary for the proper explosion Is she working all right asked mister Damon anxiously and such was the strain on him that he did not think to bless anything Is she all right Tom my lad I think so I m speeding her to the limit Faster than I ever did before but I guess she ll do She was built to stand a strain and she s got to do it now Then there was silence again as they slid along through the air like a coaster gliding down a steep descent It was a great race wasn t it asked mister Damon as he shifted to an easier position in his seat A great race Tom I didn t think you d do it one spell there Neither did I came the answer as the young inventor changed the spark lever But I made up my mind I wouldn t be beaten by Andy Foger if I could help it Though it was taking a risk to shut off the current the way I did A risk Yes it might not have started again and Tom looked down at the earth below them as if measuring the distance he would have fallen had not his sky racer kept on at the critical moment And and if the current hadn t come on again eh Tom Would we mister Damon did not finish but Tom knew what he meant It would have been all up with us he said simply I might have volplaned back to earth but at the speed we were going and at the height around a curve we might have turned turtle Bless my began mister Damon and then he stopped The thought of Tom s trouble came to him and he realized that his words might grate on the feelings of his companion On they rushed through the air with the Humming Bird speeded up faster and faster as she warmed to her task The machinery seemed to be working perfectly and as Tom listened to the hum a look of pleasure replaced the look of anxiety on his face Don t you think we ll make it asked mister Damon after another pause during which they passed over a large city the inhabitants exhibiting much excitement as they sighted the airship over their heads We ve got to make it declared Tom between his clenched teeth He turned on a little more gasoline and there was a spurt in their speed which made mister Damon grasp the upright braces near him with firm hands and his face became a little paler It s all right spoke Tom reassuringly There s no danger But Tom almost reckoned without his host for a few moments later as he was trying to get more revolutions out of the propellers he ran into an adverse current of air In an instant the Humming Bird was tilted up almost on her beams ends so to speak and had it not been that the young inventor quickly warped the wing tips to counteract the pressure on one side there might have been a different end to this story Bless my began mister Damon but he got no further for he had to bend his body as Tom did to equalize the pressure of the wind current A little farther over yelled the lad A little farther over this way mister Damon But if I come any more toward you I ll be out of my seat objected the eccentric man If you don t you ll be out of the aeroplane cried Tom grimly and his companion leaned over as far as he could until the young pilot had brought the craft to an even keel again Then Tom speeded up the motor which he had partly shut down as they passed through the danger zone and again they were racing through space They were nearing Shopton now as the lad and mister Damon could tell by the familiar landmarks which loomed up in sight Tom strained his eyes for the first view of his home Suddenly as they were skimming along there came a cessation of the hum and roar that told of the perfectly working motor It was an ominous silence What s what s wrong gasped mister Damon Something s given way answered Tom quickly I m afraid the magneto isn t sparking as it ought to Well can t we volplane back to earth asked the odd man for he had become familiar with this feat when anything happened to the motor We could answered Tom but I m not going to Why not Because we re too far from Shopton and dad I m going to keep on I ve got to if I want to be there in time But if the motor doesn t work I ll make her work Tom was desperately manipulating the various levers and handles connected with the electrical ignition system He tried in vain to get the magneto to resume the giving out of sparks and failing in that he switched on the batteries But to his horror the dry cells had given out There was no way of getting a spark unless the little electrical machine would work The propellers were still whirring around by their own momentum and if Tom could switch in the magneto in time all might yet be well They had started to fall but by quickly bringing up the head plane tips Tom sent his craft soaring upward again on a bank of air Here he cried to mister Damon Take the steering wheel and kept her on this level as long as you can What are you going to do I ve got to fix that magneto But if she dips down Throw up the head planes as I did It s our only chance I can t go down now so far from Shopton mister Damon reached over and took the wheel from Tom s hands Then the young inventor leaning forward for the magneto was within easy reach looked to see what the trouble was He found it quickly A wire had vibrated loose from a binding post In a second Tom had it in place again and ere the propellers had ceased revolving he had turned the switch The magneto took up the work in a flash Once more the spark exploded the gasoline mixture and the propellers sent the Humming Bird swiftly ahead We ll make it now declared Tom grimly We re almost there added mister Damon as he relinquished the wheel to the young pilot The craft had gone down some but Tom sent her up again Nearer and nearer home they came until at last the spires of the Shopton churches loomed into view Then he was over the village Now he was within sight of his own house Tom coasted down a bank of air and brought the Humming Bird up with a jerk of the ground brakes Before the wheels had ceased turning he had leaped out It s Massa Tom cried Eradicate as he saw Tom alight The young inventor hurried into the house He was met by the nurse who held up a warning finger Tom s heart almost stopped beating He was aware that doctor Gladby came from the room where mister Swift lay Is he is he am I too late gulped Tom Hush cautioned the nurse Tom reeled and would have fallen had not the doctor caught him for the lad was weak and worn out He is going to get well were the joyful words he heard as if in a dream and then his strength suddenly came back to him The crisis is just passed Tom went on doctor Gladby and your father will recover and be stronger than ever Your good news of winning was like a tonic to him Now let me congratulate you on the race Tom had flashed by wireless a brief message of his success Dad s news is better than all the congratulations in the world he said softly as he grasped the doctor s hand It was a week later mister Swift improved rapidly once the course of the disease was permanently checked and he was soon able to sit up Tom was with him in the room talking of the great race and how he had won He fingered the certified check for ten thousand dollars that had just come to him by mail You certainly did wonderfully well said the aged inventor softly Wonderfully well Tom I m proud of you You may well be added mister Damon Bless my shoelaces but I thought Andy Foger had us there one spell didn t you Tom Indeed I did But you helped me win mister Damon Nonsense exclaimed the odd man Yes you did You helped me a lot Well are you going to keep after more air prizes Tom or are you going to try for something else asked his father I don t believe I ll go in any more aeroplane races right away answered the young inventor For some time I ve been wanting to complete and perfect my electric rifle I think I ll begin work on that soon And go hunting asked mister Damon I think so answered Tom dreamily I don t know just where though Where he went and what he shot will be told in the next volume of this series to be called Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle or Daring Adventures in Elephant Land For a few moments after Tom s announcement no one spoke then the young inventor said It s too bad that first set of plans were stolen If I had them I could make a good deal with the Government about my little aeroplane But they don t want to take up with it as long as there is a chance of some foreign nation getting information about the secret parts and my patents won t hold abroad I wonder if there is any way of getting those plans away from Andy Foger I don t understand why he hasn t used them before this I thought sure he would make a craft like the Humming Bird to race against me What plans are those asked mister Swift Why don t you remember asked Tom The ones I showed you one day in the library when you fell asleep and some one slipped in and stole them A curious look came over mister Swift s face He passed his hand across his brow I am beginning to remember something I have been trying to recall ever since I became ill he said slowly It is coming back to me Those plans in the library I fell asleep but before I did so I hid those plans Tom You hid those plans Tom fairly shouted the words Yes I remember feeling a drowsy feeling coming on and I feared lest some one might see the drawings I got up and put them under the window in a little hollow place in the foundation wall Then I came back in through the window again and went to sleep Then on account of my illness just as I once before forgot something and thought the minister had called I lost all recollection of them I hid those plans Tom leaped to his feet He rushed to the place named by his father Soon his triumphant shout told of his success He came hurrying back into the house with a roll of papers in his hands And there were the long missing plans damp and stained by the weather but all there No enemy had them and Tom s secret was safe Now I can accept the Government offer he cried And a few weeks later he made a most advantageous deal with the United States officials for his patents doctor Gladby explained that mister Swift s queer action was due to his illness He became liable to lapses of memory and one happened just after he hid away the plans Even the hiding of them was caused by the peculiar condition of his brain He had opened the library window slipped oot with the papers and hastened in again to fall asleep in his chair during the short time Tom was gone And Andy Foger never took them at all remarked Mary Nestor when Tom was telling her about it a few days afterward No I guess I must apologize to him Which Tom did but Andy did not receive it very graciously especially as Tom accused him of trying to destroy the Humming Bird Andy denied this and denied having anything to do with the mysterious fire and as there was no way to prove him guilty Tom could not proceed against him So the matter was dropped mister Swift continued to improve and was soon himself again and able to resume his inventive work Tom received several offers to give exhibition flights at big aero meets but refused as he was busy on his new rifle mister Damon helped him Andy Foger made several successful flights in his queer aeroplane which turned out to be the product of a German genius who was supplied with money by mister Foger Andy became very proud and boasted that he and the German were going abroad to give flights in Europe I d be glad if he would said Tom when he heard of the plan He wouldn t bother me then With the money received from winning the big race and from his contracts from the Government Tom Swift was now in a fair way to become quite wealthy He was destined to have many more adventures yet come what might never would he forget the thrilling happenings that fell to his lot while flying for the ten thousand dollar prize in his
