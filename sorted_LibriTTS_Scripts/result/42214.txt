ILLUSTRATIONS Portrait The traveler at the journey s end I bade my friends farewell We consumed a half hour in the gigantic task I found the captive drinking with other jackasses We tramped tired and footsore into the village Mac could draw my luggage instead of carrying it Mac s little legs would get stuck Mac supervised the work The only time I got ahead of him I scrutinized his hat inquisitively He accused me of attempting suicide We made slow headway to the Mississippi In this way I crossed that bridge of size And I saw the streak of daylight Mac was so slow that his shadow beat him to town Over the Platte bridge after blindfolding them I killed my first rattlesnake That was the town of Korty Climbing Pike s Peak He had caught a nice mess of trout Trail through the timber Independence Pass one of the loftiest of the Continental Divide Trail to Florisant Two days of hard climbing to cross Western Pass Through thickets tangled roots and fallen trees To swim and float on Salt Lake Skull Valley desert we stopped to feed and rest The last and only drop Just finished lunch when the posse arrived Coonskin and I took shelter behind our donkeys Through Devil s Gate their panniers scraped the walls of the rocky gateway Fired their revolvers in the air Some Piute Indians who had camped close by Playing Solitaire on Damfino s broad back Began to plow snow toward Placerville The cattle passed us after we donks had broken the trail Across on the exclusive Solano I pointed toward the goal The ferry approach in Frisco was choked with a rabble PROLOGUE This is as true a story of my voyage as I am capable of writing Besides the newspaper accounts two magazine articles illustrated on this subject have been published the only ones contributed by me and they hardly outlined the trip I have left out a hundred interesting incidents and culled and edited until I am tired in order to condense this volume to convenient size On the other hand notable adventures only recalled by my photographs have been cheated of a mention because the donkey ate my notes he ate everything in sight and did not discriminate between a comic circus poster and a tragic diary Ever since completing the trip I have promised this book next month but owing to the checkered career of the MS with ninety seven publishers all of whom declared that the book should be brought out at once but they lacked the nerve to publish it I am only now able to fulfil my promises This is no romance When I did not walk with the donkey or carry him he carried me the whole four thousand and ninety six miles which includes the distance traveled when he balked and backed With my two cameras I secured six hundred pictures descriptive of the journey across eleven states through the four seasons during that long long year only by them and my diary am I brought to realize it is not a wild weird dream Now it is over I sometimes smile over things recalled which when they happened found me as serious as the donk grave in the superlative degree and thought less people and those who never even crossed the plains by train may style my experience a mere outing or picnic General Fremont and other distinguished pioneers emphasize in their writings the pleasures of their overland trips They as did the emigrants of the fortys and fiftys set out in spring time from the Missouri or the Mississippi in companies with money wagons cattle and supplies and with one third of the continent already behind them The Indians and big game of the prairies provided excitement that lent a charm to the undertaking it is dull monotony that kills I started four days before winter practically without money to support from earnings only myself and dumb partner from New York city to San Francisco It required twelve weeks to traverse the Empire State through a severe season when and where I suffered the most The delightful part of the journey was while crossing the Rockies Instead of taking the shortest cut I had to consider the towns where I might best make expenses to look for the best roads and desert trails by springs Three times when lost I traveled far out of my course once twenty miles into a mountain forest It is only five days across by rail Have you traveled it in summer How monotonous grew those seas of alkali sand rock waste cacti and sage as the hours lengthened into days Yet with comfortable beds shade meals served cool drinks and books to read at times feeling yourself speeding through the air a mile to the minute you wearied of the voyage Five days Multiply them into weeks then into months double and add five weeks forty nine weeks Fancy yourself for such a period on a slow burro which walks half your natural pace and so small that if you wear roller skates while in the saddle you may ease the animal ride one mile astride when you feel about to split ride the second mile side ways when your back feels ready to break ride the third mile Turkish fashion by this time your legs are benumbed and your feet asleep so walk a mile and carry the jackass you will thereby quiet your nerves rest your bones and make better time If ever you are tempted to ride a donkey overland REFRAIN Rather creep across backwards on your hands and knees or circumnavigate the globe in a washtub If you still persist why ride a donkey twenty miles in a pouring rain then follow your own judgment If you wish my donkey s advice I will introduce him His head is longer than his ears which was not the case when he set out with me R P W Illustration I bade my friends farewell PART one On a Donkey s Hurricane Deck CHAPTER I By this hand thou think saint me as far in the devil s book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency Let the end try the man Shakespeare A noisy curious gaping multitude was crowded about the Bartholdi Hotel New York It was just after the noon hour on Friday November twenty seven eighteen ninety six the day on which I was to start on my long and memorable journey across the continent on a donkey The corridors were filled with interested guests the reception room held about a hundred of my friends who had come to bid me God speed and less than a hundred thousand people choked Madison Square and the streets leading into it I had agreed with a friend to forfeit to him five thousand dollars in case I should fail to make a donkey trip from New York to San Francisco in three hundred and forty one days under the following conditions Start from New York City without a dollar in pocket and without begging borrowing or stealing procure a donkey and riding or leading the beast earn my way across the continent to San Francisco and register at its leading hotel within the schedule time I must cover the whole distance with a donkey by road or trail only announce in a prominent newspaper of New York my start at least twenty four hours in advance and mention the hour day and starting point Seated on a donkey I must parade on portions of Broadway Fourteenth and Twenty third Streets Fifth Madison and

none	none	End Avenues both the donkey and I must wear spectacles and I a frock coat and plug hat but the latter to be discarded at pleasure when once across the Mississippi River the coat to be worn to San Francisco I slyly suggested the two most absurd conditions believing it would be easier to earn my way in the role of a comedian than in the garb of a serious thinking imposed upon mortal I reasoned that I should have to live on sensation and notoriety and perhaps keep from starving by employing my wits These reflections I kept to myself My friend chuckled amusedly doubtless picturing in his mind the circus I was about to provide Without delay I began the preparations for the asinine journey After much troublesome searching I managed with the help of Hennessy a stable keeper and doctor Moore a veterinary surgeon to secure an option on a small donkey at James Flanagan s sale stables Macaroni was the animal s name and the price to be paid was twenty five dollars Then I got our coachman to go among his friends to see if he could get hold of a coat a Prince Albert and stove pipe hat He succeeded admirably and when I had ordered spectacles for myself and the donkey I was ready for the trip I reached the hotel on the appointed day at one o clock borrowed the donkey for my official start sent him back to the stables then went to the Reception Room Among my friends awaiting were my friend the landlord of the hotel a photographer who had taken a picture of me seated on the donkey a few days before and had come to deliver the photos and my attorney for the Chief of Police had refused me a permit to parade on the streets and threatened my arrest if I proved to be a public nuisance I borrowed a pen and bottle of ink and after bowing a greeting to my friends assembled set to work putting my autograph on the pictures which I offered for sale at twenty five cents Bless my suspenders and how they went I made up my mind that we two donkeys would many times have greater difficulty in obtaining quarters before I reached my destination For an hour the fist of Pye Pod swung a powerful quill and inscribed on each photograph a name that would go into his story Silver jingled on the table the anxious hands of the crowding patrons got mixed in the shuffle and some got two pictures and others got none the ink flew about recklessly and there were no blotters at hand my heart thumped and I was so excited that I kissed by mistake an indignant girl friend in place of my sister and finally stole my sister s lace handkerchief instead of that of a sweetheart but which however I failed to discover till six months afterward and still I lacked the requisite sum I now had twenty four dollars but I needed at least forty one Although I had made a five dollar payment to Flanagan that money came from my private purse and must be redeemed and returned besides I must pay twelve dollars to the photographer for the two hundred photos delivered to me and four dollars more to the blacksmith s representative for shoeing the donkey I will lend you all the money you want said the president of one of my clubs and my friend s ears and eyes were directed upon me I cannot beg borrow or accept gratuities I exclaimed firmly I propose to fulfill the terms of my wager to the letter and when I accomplish it be able to make a sworn statement to that effect Just then I heard a newsboy calling EXTRA ALL ABOUT THE GREAT DONKEY RIDE At once I dispatched a friend with money to purchase the papers while I followed him to the hotel exit where I stationed myself in full view of the crowd and drew from my pocket a blue lead pencil ready for a new task The papers secured and brought to me I scribbled my name on them and offered them for a dime apiece I have no time to make change so give me the amount you wish to pay I said to the eager purchasers In fifteen minutes I had enough dimes and quarters and fifty cent pieces to enable me to square my accounts and send for my donkey In the course of a half hour Macaroni was induced by sundry persuasions to invade the noisy precinct of Madison Square and come up to the hotel door and with a small surplus of cash in pocket I bade my friends farewell and got into the saddle Amid a deafening tiger from the multitude the lion of the hour majestically proceeded down Broadway to Fourteenth Street and the most sensational parade New York had ever witnessed had begun My lazy steed barely crawled he stopped every rod or two and generally in front of a car or other vehicle It was an event for the street gamins and had they not trailed close behind us through the city and given Mac occasional goads and twists of the tail I doubt if I could have reached Harlem by midnight It was a terrible ride and I often have wondered since how I escaped with my neck Passing down Fourteenth Street we turned up Fifth Avenue crossed Madison Square paraded Madison Avenue to Thirty third Street turned to the left over to Fifth Avenue and passed the Waldorf Astoria followed Forty second Street to the Boulevard and up the avenue to Seventy second Street and then up West End Avenue past my friend s residence There I was stopped by a member of the mounted police and to my surprise was tendered a Loving cup Reception by my friend s pretty daughter who with a number of our mutual friends welcomed me while her father was at his office expecting a telegram that Pye Pod had given up his trip All drank to the pilgrim s progress Wines flowers and ice cream tears and best wishes all contributed to the happy function while out of doors an incident happened that caused me to rush to my donkey s side It seems that in looking through his green glasses he mistook the iron picket screen that guarded a young and hopeful shade tree for some kind of verdant fodder and destroyed a couple of teeth The incident threw a damper on the reception so I made my adieux and resumed my fated journey with a heart still hopeful yet heavier than it ever felt before It was seven P M when Mac and I stopped at the Minot Hotel Harlem and registered for the night Among my several callers that evening was a Professor of a Riding Academy who claimed to have ridden horseback from ocean to ocean a few years previous and within several feet of his death after losing several horses and he described to me the perils of my prospective trip the boundless waterless deserts and snow covered mountains the tornadoes and tarantulas and the untamed Indians and ferocious prairie dogs and begged me to give up the journey Dear old Professor how often on that voyage on the hurricane deck of my donkey did I indulge in grievous meditation on the wisdom of your advice I simply thanked the gentleman for his tender concern about my welfare and sold him a chromo for a quarter After a bath I enjoyed a delicate sleep and next day set out in a dripping rain for Yonkers over twenty miles away with less than a dollar in pocket I had only sold enough pictures on the way to Harlem to defray my hotel bill as a stringent city ordinance prohibited it without a license and I had difficulty in avoiding the vigilant police But although fortune and the weather frowned on me I ground my teeth and headed for the Golden Gate Trailing up Seventh Avenue I gradually left the busy metropolis to my rear and entered a more open country Some urchins of the suburbs tagged behind us meddlesomely and finally a Dutch vixen hit Macaroni with a potato almost causing me to leave the saddle That paradox of asininity chased the potato and ate it He doubtlessly feared lest the missile might strike him again and decided it best to put it out of the way At two P M I had crossed McComb s Dam Bridge and at five I crossed another of the same description It was low and narrow and Mac was so afraid of the water that I had to blindfold him to get him across Shortly after occurred our first disaster On nearing a little hamlet that had reached the horse car stage of progress a counterfeit breeze sprang up which soon developed into a howling hurricane as a huge beer wagon filled with dragons or flagons of vile spirits wheeled down upon us They wanted to scare the jackass and they did The wagon wheels got into the car tracks and when the wagon turned out for us the wheels slid and hit my partner in the vicinity of his tail sprinkling us broadcast over a quarter acre of ground I carried out a friend s prediction by traveling some distance on my face I say this without vanity When I sat upright I saw Macaroni still turning headsprings My repeating rifle stuck in the soft earth erect dressed in my long tail coat and plug hat a veritable scarecrow while the soil was well sown with rifle cartridges It took us a half hour to get again under way With a degree of patience that would have overtaxed Job himself I collected my belongings dragged my beast of burden to Yonkers and anchored him in front of a hotel It was only eight I had thought it nearly morning The genial landlord received me kindly but said I had arrived at a bad season The town was financially dead the factories had shut down and a thousand stomachs were empty I corrected him there were a thousand and one and ascertaining the shortest route to the dining room I gave him proof that I was right After supper I felt in good spirits I had sold sufficient chromos on the way from Harlem to land here with five dollars in pocket and soon after my arrival one man bought all the pictures I had left seven of them for which he paid two dollars So although weary in body I retired that Saturday night with some sense of relief in knowing I possessed the funds to keep myself and partner over the Sabbath A general inspection of my donkey next morning revealed the fact that he was badly stove up and the probability that I would be detained in consequence several days If I ever had the blues I had them then A veterinary doctor Skitt was summoned he bandaged two legs covered twenty square inches of donkey with court plaster and strapped a new boot on the animal s off fore leg On returning to the hotel I notified the landlord that I should be his guest very likely several days on account of my steed s crippled condition I said I proposed to give a lecture Tuesday evening to defray my extra expense and asked him if I could have the dining room for the purpose Can you fill the hall asked the proprietor Full as a kit of mackerel But I have only a hundred chairs he apologized Hire two hundred of an undertaker I suggested and I will defray all other expenses of the funeral It was a go I then worded a handbill and hurried with it to a printer CHAPTER II I sow all sorts of seeds and get no great harvest from any of them I m cursed with susceptibility in every direction and effective faculty in none Mill on the Floss A shower of paper flakes fell upon the amazed citizens of Yonkers like an unseasonable snow storm and

Bank and Twenty nine in the pocket of the donkey traveler TICKETS twenty nine cents TICKETS TWENTY NINE CENTS YONKERS APPEAL POWER PRINT Even Macaroni lent a hoof and was led by a boy through the streets bearing a pasteboard sandwich which reached from ears to tail The residents of Mistletoe Avenue gazed at the ridiculous spectacle indignantly at first but on the return trip they crowded in open door ways and regarded the procession of beast and tagging boys as much as to say We must go and hear the donkey lecture Macaroni had quite recovered his exercise did him good My lecture promised to be a huge success The Tuesday Morning Squib and the Evening Sunrise contained alluring advertisements of the event sure to puncture an epoch in my life When the hour arrived the populace I was secretly informed with twenty nine cents in one hand and their lives in the other crowded about the hotel and called loudly for admittance My hands trembled my hair throbbed and my heart leaped in the ecstacy that comes with one s first great triumph while I stood in the butler s pantry waiting for a friend to introduce me to bid me enter the stage the first stage of lunacy When I issued forth I was so excited I could not distinguish the audience from so many chairs Having agreed to divide the receipts with my host for the use of his house my visions of wealth got confused with my words and I talked for an hour with all the eloquence and enthusiasm I could muster though I should have said less to a smaller house and with a sore throat retired to the refreshment room followed by my press agent from Brooklyn The Doctor handed me just twenty nine cents My audience had consisted of three persons the landlord the head waiter and the Dago printer whom I owed three dollars Reverses are like children s diseases If they come too late in life they go hard with us and if too early they may visit us again I was not totally bankrupt Not willing to begin a three ball business at the very outset I resolved to rise at dawn and sell enough chromos to that unappreciative community to pay my bills if I had to sell them at cost I set to work By one o clock I had visited every shop store and Chinese laundry and was talking hoarsely to a corner grocer who seated on a keg of mackerel sampling limburger cheese grinned with satisfaction at his fortified position and swore like a skipper I offered a picture for fifteen cents but the reduction in price did not disturb his physical equilibrium I vant not a peakture at any price he affirmed I lack fifteen cents of the amount of my hotel bill I urged I am in dire straits His reply was weak but the cheese was strong enough to help him out My mental magazine had but a single charge left and I fired it Isn t it worth fifteen cents to know a fool when you see one Ye e es I dink it ess answered Sweitzer Edam and eef you vill write it on the peakture I ll buy it I made the sale Then after calling on the Mayor who received me cordially swapped autographs and asked to see my partner I saddled my animal and led him to the hotel for my traps You aren t going before dinner the proprietor asked it s ready now I m flat broke can t afford to eat I returned sadly Then come in and have a meal on me said he A man who has worked as you have to square with his landlord shan t leave my hotel hungry I yielded My trip to Tarrytown was accomplished on my own legs Macaroni refused to budge unless somebody led him The whole town turned out to see us it was an event for the hotel That evening I was asked to McCarty s Show at the Theatre paying thirty five cents admission I learned that the Dutch treat was in vogue when too late for my pride to let me decline the invitation Next day at noon I set out for Sing Sing now called Ossining about seven miles away My steed that was really not half a steed seemed to be gradually recovering from the doubt that an endless journey had been mapped out for him and kept me watching and prodding him constantly On one occasion he drove through a gap in a fence on another he scraped through a hedge and relieved himself of my Winchester coat and saddle bags for which he immediately expressed regret At length he balked and I sat down by the road side a half hour before he showed readiness to go While there meditating upon my trials a pedestrian stopped and listened to my sixteen complaints He seemed much amused and suggested that if I would hang a penny before the donkey s nose he might follow the cent A practical idea at once came to mind and when soon afterward we reached a farm house I put my idea to the test I purchased some apples and suspended one from a bough secured to the saddle and reaching over the donkey s head The scheme worked admirably Mac pursued the bobbing swinging fruit at such a speed that he was nearly winded when we reached town having manipulated his short legs to the velocity of two and one third miles an hour We reached town shortly after five The village is nicely situated high on the banks of the Hudson and some of its residents have a beautiful view of the river while others see nothing more picturesque than a stone wall Sing Sing to use the more familiar name is the seat of an extensive prison patronized by sojourners from all parts of the world and heavily endowed being backed by the wealth of the State A local organization the Sing Sing Steamer Company invited me to its monthly dinner that evening and to my surprise and gratitude purchased with a sealed envelope one of our pictures for the club rooms I don t think it a good custom to buy a pig in a poke but this time the pig was fat and healthy and I found myself several dollars richer Next morning I bought a revolver for as I had to employ the larger part of the day in making sales and working my wits in a multitude of ways to keep my ship from stranding and the crew from starving I was often compelled to travel long into the night and required some more handy weapon than a rifle for defence against pirates The newspapers generally heralded my coming often greatly magnifying my successes and I felt that the hard times which the country at large was suffering made such a thing as a hold up not only possible but imminent any night Having received an invitation to visit the State Prison I set out in the forenoon to find it and a policeman a very proper person by the way guided me to that famous hostelry Macaroni also was invited but the affrighted animal declined to enter the prison gates Whether he thought he saw a drove of zebras or was repelled by a guilty conscience I know not but falling back in a sitting posture he threw his ears forward and brayed loudly On entering the office the secretary rose from his chair and seized me Professor he said you are my prisoner for an hour come this way and I will present you to the warden We left the room and walked over to that official s desk mister Warden said the secretary Allow me to introduce Professor Pythagoras Pod the illustrious donkey traveler who is eating his way across the continent Show the gentleman to the dining room and give him a plate of soup said the warden hospitably then squeezing my fingers he waived me to the chief keeper of the prison The warden noted my hesitancy in leaving and asked if there was anything in particular he could do for me Will you allow me to sit in the electric chair I asked Ye e es he replied politely but apparently startled although I consider you are already having capital punishment for your asinine undertaking and turning to the keeper he said Give him fifty thousand volts nothing less will phase a man of his nerve I thanked him With faltering step I entered the solemncholy chamber A colored prisoner was to follow me a day later Little he knew that he would sit in the same chair Pod sat in the previous day The keeper said everything was in readiness for turning on the current that has the power to drift a soul from this world to another in the twinkling of an eye The battery had been thoroughly tested and detested too In less than thirty seconds from the time an ordinary prisoner enters a door of this world he enters the door of another but Pod being a man of extraordinary nerve walked out the door he entered When I climbed into that terrible chair I held my breath The keeper said it required only a certain number of volts to kill a man that fifty thousand such as the warden had suggested for my pleasure would not so much as singe a hair of my head If I survived the first shock I would have something to boast as it would be abusing a confidence to describe the sensations of electrocution I must not do so On returning to the office the warden congratulated me and said I had earned my freedom He even presented me a plaster of Paris ornament made by a prisoner who had never seen Paris and a package of prison made tobacco which I might chew or eschew as I liked While I appreciated these gifts how much more I should have valued a battery of electrical currents to administer to my donkey Crowds assembled to view our exit from town at two o clock We reached Croton some six miles beyond about dusk As we approached the bridge crossing of the Croton River I saw a duck and thought I would test my marksmanship with a revolver My drowsy steed had nearly reached the center of the bridge when I banged at the innocent hell diver A compound disaster followed the shot as the frightened jackass shied to the left and dashed through the iron frame work tail over ears into the river scraping me out of the saddle but dropping me fortunately on the bridge I managed however to get the duck the donk got the ducking It was a marvel that he didn t drown from the way he brayed I judged he was of the same opinion Long after dark we arrived in Peekskill Throughout the day the weather was threatening and I tramped the last three miles in the rain I had donned my mackintosh and slung my overcoat across the saddle and was pacing ahead of Mac with reins in hand coaxing the stubborn beast on when suddenly he jumped I turned just in time to discover in the darkness two men one of whom was suspiciously near to the donkey I told them civilly to walk ahead as they excited my animal That s none of our business one of them remarked we ll walk where we d d please Not this time I said as I got the drop on them with my new shooting iron and I marched the ruffians into town The sneaks probably wanted my overcoat Before we were fairly in town I dismissed them and advised them thereafter to cultivate civility toward travelers It was Friday night I called upon the Mayor and engaged the Town Hall for a lecture resolved to try my luck again in that line Alas my second reverse This time it was a too impromptu affair Sunday I rested but Monday when everything augured bright for the week I was shocked to find Macaroni ill At once I summoned a doctor a dentist and a veterinary surgeon for a consultation and breathlessly awaited the verdict Your jackass has a complication of diseases said the vet among them influenza bots and hives He has the measles pronounced the doctor He is teething insisted the dentist This was too much with a troubled brow and an empty stomach I went to breakfast and left the doctors to fight it out CHAPTER III Little drops of water Little grains of dirt Make the roads so muddy Donk won t take a spurt Dogeared Doggerels Pod Never before had I encountered such a disagreeable road While I tramped over the highlands from Peekskill to Fishkill Landing Macaroni barely crawled He kept me constantly in the fear that he would lie down and roll and finally he did so selecting a mud puddle I was told donkeys fairly dote on dust and that a roll will invigorate them more than will a measure of grain But mine was different to other donkeys Before leaving Peekskill doctor Shook said Mac showed symptoms of mud fever although the tendency lay strongly toward phlebitus farcy and poll evil He even warned me that I might expect epizootic to set in any day To urge Mac on to Newburgh in one day necessitated my start at day break We reached the Fishkill ferry at half past eight covering the twenty mile journey in fifteen hours The highland road was rough where the mud had dried Steep and rocky summits stood out bold and barren save where occasional bunches of young cedars huddled among the denuded trees Finally I saw a small structure through whose open windows could be heard a chorus of youthful voices intoning The dog caught the pig by the yer It was a school house I remembered that song of my boyhood I thought it would be interesting to drop in and forthwith rapped on the door Meanwhile Mac stuck his head in the window causing a deafening chime of cries within A painful silence followed I waited patiently for admittance then I opened the door The room was deserted the exit at the opposite end wide open I crossed the floor and looked out to discover the teacher and two dozen young ones scurrying up the mountain through the scant woods I called to them but they ran the faster Wonder what they thought they saw With every mile s advance we penetrated more deeply the mountain wilderness Before long Macaroni began to slow up Again I had recourse to the scheme of suspending an apple over his head The beast increased his speed at once making a lunge at the unobtainable and chasing it with rapid stride He evidently had never read the story about the boy who pursued a rainbow and unlike that boy was stupid enough to be fooled twice A few miles beyond I answered some inquiries of a woman out driving and sold her a photo I had no sooner stopped with the article in hand than I was startled with the sound of gagging behind and turning I beheld the donkey wrenching in the throes of strangulation Having lowered the apple to the ground he had swallowed it together with the string and half the bough I withdrew the intrusions with difficulty and returned to the woman who had fainted I had no restoratives but I had once resuscitated a Jew with a novel expedient and determined to try the same plan in this case These pictures are fifteen cents each although I sometimes get twenty five for one I said somewhat forcibly don t trouble yourself madam trust me with your pocket book I will At once the woman awoke and counting out the lesser amount mentioned pulled on the reins and drove away Let me grasp the hand of that man who can beat a woman at a bargain When passing through Cold Spring I was startled by the booming of cannon at West Point just across the river I had not expected such honors So overawed was I by the salute that I forgot to count the guns but presume there were twenty one Far above and behind the group of academic buildings still frowned old Fort Putnam deploring its shameful neglect and casting envious glances at the modern Observatory below and the newer buildings lower down Every mile of the beautiful Hudson recalled to mind happy memories of my own school days which made my present ordeal doubly distressing When night lowered her sombre shades my thoughts took flight to more distant scenes My heart and brain grew weary and I forgot for a time that my bones were lame and my feet sore from walking walking walking on an endless journey with no perceptible evidence of approaching nearer to the goal At length the Albany night boat steamed past us its myriad lights dancing on the ruffled waters or revealing a jolly group of passengers on deck The air was painfully quiet and when the song Oh Where is My Wandering Boy To night floated over to me in answer to Macaroni s bray I found consolation in the thought that perhaps some of the tourists recognized my outfit in the dark and pitied me I had by this time discovered mountain climbing to be a donkey s leading card He may loiter on the flat but he will make you hump when it comes to steep ascents The night was mild for that season of the year and becoming considerably heated I doffed my overcoat and spread it over the saddle on my mackintosh When we were descending the hill on the other side I dismounted and led Mac with the bridle reins but kept a good watch on the coats After a while however I became so absorbed in thought that I neglected my duty and finally when I did turn to inspect them they were missing It gave me the worst fright I had experienced since leaving New York Staking Mac to a gooseberry bush I immediately retraced my steps a mile or more through an Egyptian darkness before I found the garments lying securely in the mud On my return to the bush I was alarmed not to find the donkey That phenomenon had eaten that prickly shrub to the roots and fled either down the road to Fishkill or through the woods I started out for town on a run Imagine my astonishment to find Mac patiently standing in front of the ferry The boat had landed her passengers and had the donkey not taken the precaution to anticipate me we should have had to remain on that side of the river for the night As it was the ferry waited for Mac s rider thanks to the considerate pilot Newburgh I recognized her by her streets at an angle of forty five degrees Mac took to the place hugely I stopped at a small combination hotel and restaurant where roast turkey and pumpkin pie decorated the windows and made arrangements for the night When about to leave I was visited by a delegation from the local militia who for a fair consideration induced us both to remain over and referee a game of basket ball that evening at the armory Mac did not accept very gracefully and had to be coerced What I knew about the game wouldn t tax a baby s mind but that didn t matter It proved to be an event for the regiment for Pod and for Macaroni Next day I found my donkey s maladies increasing They had already tripled in number since leaving Peekskill and to think I had arrived at Newburg just two days too late to secure a sound animal I pushed on to Poughkeepsie Upon arriving at that university city I was pleased to find the inhabitants not quite so slow as the appearance of the place would indicate The city has of late years become the Henley of America It is the seat of Eastman s business college as well as a very progressive college for girls Vassar The residents generally drop three letters in spelling the name of their proud city and make it Po keepsie There were four good points I liked about the place and that was one of them the other three were the Mayor the Vassar girls and a newspaper reporter who for a consideration engaged Mac and me to appear at the theatre in an amateur play It was to be a new stage in our travels The urchin who led the donkey about the streets proudly bore in one hand a standard inscribed KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE DONKEY and those who obeyed saw printed on a canvas blanket gracefully draped over Mac s back the startling announcement WILL APPEAR TO NIGHT IN HOGAN S ALLEY AT KIRCHNER S HALL I believe Mac paraded the city utterly oblivious of the interest he created I had promised to have my donkey at the Hall at five sharp There were two staircases for him to climb and I had not contemplated the enormity of the task before me We tugged on his halter we set three dogs barking at his heels but the only time he stirred was when he removed the dogs He just braced himself well against the curb and brayed until he had called the audience to the show two hours ahead of time After a while two strong policemen took a hand with me in a three handed game and turned over a jack Finally four more men assisting the beast was carried upstairs and into the theatre where he was forced to walk a plank on to the stage Then I fed and watered him and combing his fur the right way left him to the melancholy contemplation of his position When we returned an hour later he was still as immovable as a statue The stage manager directed me to ride the donkey out from behind the scenery at a given signal so I began to practice with him I cannot describe all that happened the next hour By seven o clock Mac was fairly broken and everything looked promising The house was crowded only a portion of the attendance of the fair held in connection with the play down stairs could find seats and the performance was to be repeated One part of the play however not on the program could not be reproduced Apparently no attempts had ever been made to convert Mac to religion for when the Salvation Army entered the scene banging drums and clashing cymbals the terrified jack began to back toward the footlights The stage manager fearing lest the beast might back off the stage dropped the curtain But that didn t check Mac he backed against the curtain and under it and dropped plumb into the audience making five laps in a second his best time to date One fat man over burdened crashed through his chair Fortunately nobody was seriously injured but several had spasms and more than one girl crawled over the backs of the seats in terror Such doings as a paper stated next day were never known before in this town in the annals of donkeys four legged or two legged either As soon as the excitement was over Mac was assisted on to the stage and the play was twice repeated all three performances before crowded houses While returning Mac to his stable I heard the bray of a donkey and resolved next day to look him up Then I sent a message to a young lady friend at Vassar and wrote my weekly story for the papers I frequently refer to my Vassar friends but I doubt if they ever mention me I had written one that I would polish two dozen pairs of Vassar shoes at the rate of fifty cents a pair either on or off Allowing me two minutes for each pair and half a minute for making change I believed I could polish to the queen s taste some forty eight pairs in two hours My proposal was accepted The hour set was five zero A M while the teachers would be dreaming about the binomial formula blue light and turnips And I was expected to polish the shoes on the foot Accordingly I was aroused from slumber at four and practiced on the stove legs for a full half hour to get polishing down to a science Then I took the trolley car to the hedge fence stole in through the stately gate and took the time of the huge clock above the entrance Then I took my own time I had four minutes to spare and knew Vassar girls were anything but slow The days of chivalry are not gone says George Eliot notwithstanding Burke s grand dirge over them they live still in that far off worship paid by many a youth and man to the woman of whom he never dreams that he shall touch so much as her little finger or the hem of her robe I had no sooner placed my chair at the right marble staircase than I heard the rustle of skirts immediately followed by a bevy of charming girls stealing down the steps on tip toe all a giggle and a smile balancing their supple forms with outstretched arms and enlivening the early dawn with the mischief beaming from their eyes Good morning they said as each in turn shook hands with me I was inspired to hug every one of them but dared not show the lack of polish Raising my hat I said softly Shine and number one mounted the throne soon to be daubed a queen Bless me wasn t she pretty As she gaily lifted her skirts to give my brushes a free swing a perfect pair of ankles burst into view daintily imprisoned in black silk hose and well I naturally was excited Blacking flew like the mud did when the beer wagon bumped against Mac and a brush flopped out of my hand through a colored window letting in more light for it was still quite dusky It seemed to be impossible for the young lady to keep her feet in place on the block and not until she suggested I should hold her boot in place did I begin to polish to my credit After that no girl could keep her feet stationary unless I held her foot with one hand and polished with the other Next and another winsome creature took the chair and poured fifty pennies into my hand I took it for granted that she was some copper king s daughter I worked so hard that I was soon perspiring After finishing a dozen pair when about to polish the second shoe on number thirteen someone claimed she heard a professor reading Volapuk At once there was a scurry and a rustle of skirts Number thirteen kicked over the blacking accidental and fled with one shoe unpolished but that odd shoe did just as good service as any of the rest The whole bevy of girls vanished before I had time to collect my senses my chair and my brushes and chase myself away When once started I ran to beat the cars and reached the hotel in time for breakfast the richer by six dollars and a lace handkerchief Come to think of it what an extr ordinary adventure that was for a modest and dignified traveler with a donkey I wondered as I sipped my coffee what the Principal said when she discovered so many neat looking shoes CHAPTER IV Shame on the world said I to myself Did we but love each other as this poor soul loved his ass twould be something Sentimental Journey Stearne An empty heart is like an empty barrel conveniently located nobody will dare to gamble on the first thing to be thrown into it and a full heart like a barrel of fruit must be sorted frequently lest a bit of blemish corrupt the whole My heart was as full of Macaroni from New York to Po keepsie as my stomach once had been from Milan to Naples I first fancied my donkey next admired him suddenly became conscious of a growing contempt for him and finally pity now that the time for parting with him had come Having depended entirely upon the stupid beast for companionship he really had become a pet Often he had offended and vexed me beyond seeming pardon on the other hand he had afforded me amusement during my lonesome hours often causing me to laugh outright at his antics But in order to complete my journey on time I felt I must avail myself of the first opportunity to exchange him for a livelier steed It was my Vassar friend who told me about doctor Jackson and his precocious donkey she claimed the animal often displayed human intelligence With some difficulty I found the doctor s residence when introducing myself and acquainting him with my errand he put on his hat and took me to the barn Behold the cutest little donkey I ever saw He was a sleek slender creature of blush color with an intelligent but roguish countenance and with cropped ears which gave him a semblance to a deer The doctor said the animal was hardly three years old His hoofs were very small so tiny that he might have stepped into an after dinner cup and not damaged more than your appetite for coffee What do you call the little fellow I asked Mac A Rony said the doctor The coincidence made me smile That too is my donkey s name I declared somewhat to his astonishment He then spelled his animal s name showing that there was as much difference between the names as between the donkeys between patrician and plebeian He said that Mac A Rony was the lineal descendant of an ancient and honorable family of Irish asses whereas I believed Macaroni could boast of no more distinguished heritage than that of Italian peasantry The doctor even harbored the suspicion that his donkey must be a descendant of Balaam s famous ass His bluish coat is a reflection of the blue blood in his veins observed the doctor and I was made to feel of the same opinion I coveted that donkey but had little hope of securing it as my means were so limited Imagine my astonishment when the doctor proposed that we make an even exchange of animals If your overland journey continues to be as notable as it is thus far said he I should like to possess the first donkey you used I dared not believe my ears But you have not seen my donkey I reminded him I will accept your representation of the animal he replied The bargain made we parted An hour later Macaroni was in the doctor s barn and Mac A Rony in the livery stable The greatest objection I had to my new companion was his youth The fastidious appetite of this Irish gentleman demanded bread and other table fare he actually stuck up his nose at oats and hay What would he do should we get stranded I might live a whole day on three milk punches which I could pay for with photos but experience had taught me it required many punches to keep a donkey moving When about to depart I was disconcerted to discover the doctor s boy riding his new possession down the street toward the hotel Macaroni seemed to realize we were to part forever There was a sad depressed look in his eyes his brows knitted and his nose wept as he brayed When shall we three meet again I felt a pang in my heart and turning my eyes from him headed Mac A Rony for the West Shortly afterward I was stopped by a blacksmith who recognized Mac and asked to shoe him saying he would do it for a picture seeing it was I Of course I was delighted and leaving the donkey in his custody dropped in a restaurant and lunched after which I bought Mac a loaf of graham bread The kind hearted blacksmith had several horses waiting to be shod and it was nearly night when Mac A Rony ceased to be a bare foot boy I remained in Po keepsie over night and early next day Friday set out for Kingston But that quadruped traveled so fast that he tired out after going a few miles and I had to put up at a little inn at Staatsburg for the night Had it not been that I sold next day a number of photos at princely villas on the way I should have had trouble to keep from starving No remittance had come from the papers as yet and lecturing was out of the question at that time I had written to several soap sarsaparilla tobacco and pill companies for a contract to advertise their stuffs by distributing circulars or samples or displaying a sign from my donkey s back but thus far had received no favorable replies At length the blue summits of the Catskills loomed against an azure sky in the west and I caught occasional glimpses of Kingston and Rondout the twin cities nestling in the foothills by the Hudson At three o clock we crossed the ferry and soon afterward arrived at the Mansion House Kingston The landlord received us with gracious hospitality but I having lost so much time by accident and other misfortune only tarried for the night and hastened on up the valley The days were perceptibly shorter while we traveled in the shadow of the Catskills The roads were so heavy and the recent cold I had contracted so stiff and uncomfortable that I decided at seven o clock to spend the night at a German road house Landlord Schoentag gave us soft beds in spite of his hard name and his spouse was kind enough to make me a hot brandy and a foot bath I drank the one Mac cheated me of the other I retired early under a pile of bedding as thick as it was short and soon found myself in a terrible sweat This was not due alone to the comfortables but to a party of convivial young people who thrummed on a discordant piano and sang and danced till daylight their hilarity causing Mac in the stable sundry vocal selections such as should have disturbed the spirit of Rip Van Winkle eight miles away Monday we pushed on toward Saugerties But for a delay at Soaper s Creek Bridge we should have reached Catskill before dark Mac A Rony stopped stock still at the bridge approach and neither the eloquence of gad nor gab moved him an inch I petted him and patted him I stroked his ears and I rubbed his nose and then I asked him point blank what ailed him You big fool can t you see that sign up there he retorted as he eyed me squarely It was fully sixty seconds before I realized that the animal had actually spoken then I looked up and read the sign hanging from the iron girder overhead Ten dollars fine for riding or driving over this bridge faster than a walk I must say I greatly appreciated Mac s consideration for my pocket book but his obduracy struck me as being not a little absurd since he had not yet demonstrated to me that he could go faster than a walk even on a level and unimpeded road All I could do was to sit down on a stone and like Macawber wait for something to turn up It seemed ages before a farmer came along with a ton of hay he was kind enough to slide off the load and assist me to carry the donkey across the bridge The night was spent in Catskill Smith s Hotel was swarming with busy grangers generally good hearted garrulous characters whose society lightened the tedium of two days while I nursed my cold and weaned Mac We reached Athens a village eight miles to the north Wednesday noon but being somewhat rusty in Greek I ferried the river to Hudson A light snow had fallen the wind was sharp shod and traveled forty miles an hour A small German hotel opened its doors to us and I persuaded Mac to ascend the low stoop and venture half his length indoors the landlord aided me at the helm and we managed to anchor my craft out of range of the storm though we couldn t get it across the bar Mac lay down in a heap and I called for port to find none in stock Suddenly a man in shirt sleeves hastily entered with a pitcher in hand and before he could check himself went sprawling over the frightened beast smashing the pitcher and setting Mac to braying The man hurriedly collected himself glanced at the strange looking quadruped and not stopping for beer fled in dismay When the storm had abated somewhat we started for Kinderhook Late in the afternoon we trailed into a thrifty little town where I found stock port in Stockport Here the cheery aspect of the Brookside Hotel tempted me to remain over night and doctor the severe cold in my chest This tavern the pride of the village was said to be the oldest on the old post road from New York to Albany So comfortable was the hotel that I hesitated long before accepting a cordial invitation extended to me through his coachman to be the guest of the wealthiest resident of the town I was driven over to the home of mister Van and the affable gentleman introduced me to his family before driving me to his father s residence The old gentleman was enthusiastic in his reception of the donkey traveler and after doping me with some delicious cider reluctantly allowed his son to keep me for the night After a month of roughing it my happy affiliation with those refined and cultured people acted like a healing balm to my wearied heart Many and many a time thereafter on the tiresome lonesome trail did my memory recall that pleasant evening The daughters entertained me with music and song the parents brought out refreshments and at last with a hot foot bath and a hotter mustard leaf on my chest I retired Next morning Georgie the little son rushed into my chamber calling Get up you people the pancakes are getting cold All right I answered meekly Oh the little fellow gasped with astonishment as he beheld Pod tucked neck deep in eider down I I I thought you was the girls Illustration We consumed a half hour in the gigantic task Illustration I found the captive drinking with other jackasses The boy had retired early the evening before quite ignorant of the fact that the eccentric traveler was delegated to snooze in his sisters bedroom Through the happy agency of conversation mister Van and I discovered a mutual friendship The family somewhat to my embarrassment insisted upon purchasing pictures galore and after breakfast and a little music in the glow of a blazing fireplace I donned my overcoat and made my adieux How chill and heartless that December morning was The wind blew my plug hat off to begin with and as I was driven to the Brookside Inn had the courage to try to freeze my face A half hour later Mac and Pod were marching to Kinderhook CHAPTER V Of all conceivable journeys this promised to be the most tedious I tried to tell myself it was a lovely day I tried to charm my foreboding spirit with tobacco but I had a vision ever present to me of the long long roads up hill and down dale and a pair of figures ever infinitesimally moving foot by foot a yard to the minute and like things enchanted in a nightmare approaching no nearer to the goal Travels with a Donkey R L Stevenson Kinderhook I promised myself to visit the seminary so popular in the early sixty s and commune with the spirits of those charming old fashioned girls of whom mother had often spoken After dining at the Kinderhook Hotel I looked it up and found it to be then the village academy The cold in my chest pained more than ever I began to fear pneumonia The landlord s wife said she would be a mother to me Whew If she made it as warm for her old man as she did for me I pity and congratulate him in one breath She prepared a mustard sitz bath my feet had suffered two already powerful enough she declared to force cold blisters on my hair she slapped mustard leaves on my chest and back she gave me spirits of camphor for my lips witch hazel for my eyes a pork bandage for my neck and liberal doses of aconite quinine whiskey and rum Then she innocently asked if I could think of any other place my cold when fairly on the run would be likely to settle Being unable to answer I called on a physician The landlady has fixed you up admirably said he I cannot benefit you further unless I advise you to shave off your hair when the blisters have settled on it to prevent the cold s return I expressed my gratitude for his kind assurances and to my surprise though he had an electric battery in his room he refused to charge me Without loss of time I set out and walked two miles to the old homestead of President Martin Van Buren that stood back from the road behind a group of ancient pines which sighed dolefully as I passed The family living there received me kindly and showed me the library parlors and hall the old Dutch wall paper picturing ancient hunts watch towers and pastoral scenes recalled a pleasant sojourn in Holland A Wagoner family living in the next house asked me to dinner and I et with them I once knew a Van Wagoner I said they were fine people Our family were originally of that name mister Wagoner replied They dropped the Van some time ago Mac A Rony said he had never heard of Vans being dropped from Wagoners but had often seen wagoners dropped from vans I next crossed the bridge spanning the creek just out of town where it is said Washington Irving conceived the story of the headless horseman President Van Buren gave a ball to some statesmen and Irving was invited Some wag among the guests rigged up a dummy on a horse and let the animal loose to give the author a scare Wash never lost an opportunity to make a good story and he made use of the idea Mary Ann and Lucretia Van Buren two aged spinsters were all who remained of the illustrious family I called on Mary Ann when Lucretia was absent and won her favor so quickly that she presented me with a little oil painting which had been in the family over a hundred years Close by stood the old brick house formerly a fort built with brick brought from Holland One brick was carved sixteen twenty three I saw the house where General Burgoyne is said to have dined after which I visited Van Buren s grave We slept that night in North Chatham traveling out of the direct route to give the weak kneed donkey as level a road as possible We had now been boon companions one week it seemed a month Next day we passed a rickety barn in which two horses were engaged at a huge tread wheel with the dual object of threshing corn stalks and of keeping their ears warm My ears were almost frozen whereas Mac claimed his were as warm as toast My comrade had the advantage over me in being able as he expressed it to wiggle his ears and keep the blood circulating I stopped at a shanty near and asked leave to warm myself and begged a newspaper to put in my breast A poverty stricken but hospitable man welcomed me and politely took my hat and stuck it on a pitcher of milk The humble habitation contained two rooms one store room the other the living room The latter was furnished with a square table now set for the mid day meal two beds a stove which was exerting every effort to boil some ancient pork and frozen cabbage to a state of doneness four chairs and a wash tub The housewife was washing clothes while her old man acted as cook A dog reclined on the store room floor watching a saw horse There was not such bric a brac visible a five year old calendar and two or three unframed chromos hung on the walls and when I arose to go I discovered behind me a cracked mirror and a comb that needed dentistry I was surprised when the woman handed me the desired paper I should not have accused any of them of being able to read Wall yer kin see haow all classes of folks lives eny haow the matron observed as she screwed her face out of shape in her anxiety to wring the last drop of suds out of a twisted garment Yes I returned rising and reaching for my hat but how my donkey and I can manage to live to reach Frisco interests me more And politely declining a hunk of pork rind and black bread offered me for a pocket lunch much to the gratification of the house cat I sallied forth into the biting blast knocked several icicles from Mac A Rony s whiskers and headed for the state capital Further on we tarried a few moments to exchange a word or two with an inquisitive hayseed who planted himself in the road before us and stretched forth a brawny hand for both of us to shake Yer th feller what s goin to Fran Sanfrisco hain t yer the old man questioned bracing himself against the boisterous gale Yep I replied laconically And at once Mac yielding to a mighty gust of wind dashed past the animate obstruction dragging his master with him Whar be th biggest crops this year he called after us and Mac assuming the question was put to him shouted In ostriches Some of them weigh several stone As I looked back from the hill I saw the statuesque figure still gaping at us behind a long frost colored beard The roads to fame and to the capitol are hilly Fame seemed to be more easily reached in slippery weather than the capitol in dry Albany had just experienced a heavy rain and the roads had frozen We set out Monday morning to pay our respects to the Governor the Mayor and other shining lights When half way up the ascent to the capitol Mac A Rony slipped off his feet and slid to the bottom of the hill Of course I stayed with him in a moment we had won fame The excited populace thronged about us and the reporters hauled out their paper and pencils One toboggan slide satisfied Mac and I was compelled to return him to the stable and go alone The Governor was in his chair of state when I arrived at the Executive Chamber The rumor that the odd traveler Pye Pod was in the ante chamber brought a smile to his lips which he still wore when he rose to grasp my hand relishing the humor which I had failed to taste Don t you find it pretty cold traveling these days the Governor inquired as he sat down to write in my autograph album Rather said I The Governor chuckled wished me good luck on my journey and commended me for my pluck Then I was ushered through the magnificent capitol After lunching with an aunt I visited the Mayor He like other notable men received me graciously and wished me joy prosperity and health Tuesday I hustled early and late to earn a dollar above the expenses of my sojourn in the up hill city Wednesday morning I received a small check the first remittance from the papers It was only two days before Christmas The Holiday season seemed to have absorbed all the money in circulation The snow now lay six inches deep on the level it had snowed all night and was snowing still I greatly needed a pair of felt boots with rubber overshoes but couldn t afford the outlay So I wrapped strips of gunnysacks round my shoes and trouser legs bought a pair of earlaps and saddling my donkey started for Schenectady seventeen miles away People had cautioned me that donkeys were afraid of snow I was most agreeably surprised to find Mac A Rony an exception to the rule but in another respect he puzzled me very much For five days he had not been known to drink and I concluded that like an orchid he slaked his thirst by sucking the juice out of the atmosphere When I ushered him into the snow he rubbed his nose in it and tasted it to satisfy himself that it wasn t sugar and then majestically waded through as if it were so much dust And so with less than two dollars in pocket and some fifty photos in my saddle bags I urged my donkey through the blinding gale to a road house four miles out of Albany where tethering him to a huge icicle under a low roofed shed I went into the tavern to toast my hands and feet and to warm my inner self A few moments later found us fighting the elements again And though we stopped at fully a dozen houses on that day s journey we reached Schenectady soon after dark with my face black and blue from the snowballs Mac rolled with his hoofs and slung at me he claimed unintentionally Both of us were in prime condition to appreciate a hot supper and a soft warm bed After seeing my comrade safely sheltered in the hotel barn and leaving instructions with the stable keeper to lock the door I spent a pleasant hour with the other hotel guests who gathered about to hear my story and to give me all kinds of valuable and worthless advice on traveling with a donkey What happened that night may be better understood by reading the following page from my diary It is midnight halfway between Christmas eve and Christmas morning For the last three hours I have been looking all over town for Mac I went to the stable at nine o clock to fill his stockings and lo he was missing Where he can possibly be and how he got there is beyond my power of conception I found the lock in the barn door unbroken but scratched about the keyhole as if it had been picked The landlord and the stableman are of the opinion that Union College boys have stolen the donkey and hidden him just for mischief In my rambles I failed to detect a sign of any student A squad of volunteers from among the hotel guests armed to the teeth and carrying lanterns were kind enough to go with me donkey hunting but nothing more than a few ominous traces of Mac s stubborn resistance did we discover A tuft of donkey hair and a gory human tooth were picked off the barn floor and also just outside a section of the seat of a man s trousers all of which indicates that the donkey is the unwilling prisoner of a band of wags Going down Fifth Street to Union we detected Mac s little foot prints and a college society pin Just beyond I found another lock of hair this time human indicating some football fiend had parted with a portion of his mane A torn cravat a finger of a kid glove and a piece of human flesh resembling part of a nose were noted by different members of the posse Thence on we traced with much difficulty my donkey s hoof marks a mile or more into the suburbs where we lost them It was then eleven thirty P M A concensus of opinion resulted in the verdict that at that point the animal had been put in a sleigh and drawn to some hiding place and that further search that night was useless I am now going to retire and trust to luck for Mac A Rony s safe return to morrow When I went to breakfast Christmas morning I amused myself while my order was being filled by perusing the Schenectady Daily Tantrims You may imagine my astonishment upon reading the following GRAND OPENING Of the Canal Skating Rink Greatest Social Function of the Season COLLEGE BOYS AND SOCIETY THERE A Donkey on Skates Those who were not let in to the private ball given at the new Canal Ice Rink on Christmas Eve by the Union boys who remained here over night to enjoy the Holidays missed a rare and novel entertainment It proved to be a side splitting as well as an ice breaking affair Carefully laid plans were successfully carried out and the diminutive donkey belonging to the quixotic traveler Prof Pythagoras Pod became the guest of honor at the first rink party of the season The jackass seemed to relish the sport immensely Two pairs of skates were securely buckled on his feet and declining the proffered assistance at once the precocious tyro struck out in four several directions at once coming down on the not over thick ice kothump on his Antartic pole deluging four propositions of Euclid seven principles of unnatural philosophy and three dozen young men and women All would have gone well had the jack not been so conceited He just like an ass thought he knew it all If he ever cut any ice in his life he did it then Being of a generous disposition he made ample accommodations for a crowd who like his asinine self came out for a skate and were hardly prepared for a baptism Pandemonium reigned There were several narrow escapes from drowning even Mac A Rony barely averted a sublime decease and bellowed like a freight engine However as he was the only donkey of the whole party that piloted himself to terra firma without assistance he deserves much more praise than the fools that were so unwarrantably thoughtless as to imperil a hundred precious lives in their selfishness to have a good time at the expense of an humble beast As soon as the panic had subsided a new rink was cleared further down the canal where the Christmas fete was prolonged to a late hour The terrified animal was here supported on two parallel bars held by strong men and he promised to remain upright henceforth To say the least his frantic efforts to do the pigeon wing on the star spangled firmament nearly capsized his pall bearers Guards had been posted at various points to apprise the practical jokers if the donkey s master should come uninvited on the scene but it seems that by crafty foxy methods the Professor had been led by false scent to the suburbs So the fun continued After the ball was over Mac A Rony was returned in safety to his stall The little fellow appeared to be the nimbler from his cold water plunge and was so elated over his extraordinary exploits that he brayed all the way to his quarters As soon as I heard Mac I rushed out to the barn bare headed and threw my arms round his neck I found the little fellow joyously rummaging in four huge stockings filled with corn bread molasses cake mince pie carrots and apple sauce I had a h l of a time last night was all he said CHAPTER VI Christmas day is a merry day For all good lads and lassies But dull and lorn for th fellow born To ride or drive jackasses Old Song Yuletide afforded me few pleasures How I was to bridge the gulf of penury and want of the Holiday season caused me much concern Lacking the funds to pay my hotel and stable bills I canvassed the town and sold a few pictures before church time I wished to attend Christmas service but lacked the nerve My grotesque attire might have inspired the preacher I had worn holes in all my socks and not having the price of a new pair retired to my room to darn them It was the first darning of that sort I ever did when I had finished I darned my luck the hard times and many things not down on the calendar I pictured to my mind s eye the pleasures of Christmastide of which I had cheated myself but it was no time to brood over might have beens I would start for the next town that morning I felt a constant anxiety for Mac A Rony s safety and shouldn t feel easy until we were out of the college district We reached Amsterdam in time for Christmas dinner I will not give the bill of fare it wouldn t whet your appetite The following day was almost as dull as Christmas In the morning I was fortunate enough to receive in advance two dollars for distributing calendars to the farmers on my way to the next town and employed the afternoon repairing saddle bags The snow lay deep the weather was windy and chill and my donkey slower than axle grease so I tarried over night and heard Sabbath bells Sunday evening saw us comfortably quartered in the little village of Fonda a few miles journey While supping I learned that a German newspaper reporter who claimed to be walking across the continent on a seven hundred fifty dollars wager was a guest at another hotel He came into town shortly after dark and unable to pay for a bed was permitted to sleep on a bench where my informant saw him By the terms of his bet the fellow was not allowed to beg but could accept the earth if offered him My sympathies were aroused and I called on him after supper He told his story showed me papers and a book signed by the railroad station agents on his route for he had hit the ties all the way and expressed much anxiety about covering the remaining one hundred eighty four miles to New York in six days The young man looked emaciated his shoes were literally worn out His one meal that day had been a cup of coffee and a roll He hadn t slept in a bed since leaving Detroit where he earned his last money five dollars Pod s tender heart was touched Although the more affluent donkey traveler possessed but a dollar and sixty cents he gave his brother globe trotter a dollar a hot supper and bed and would have paid for a stimulating drink had not the hotel keeper been inspired to treat the two Next morning some commercial travelers having learned of Pod s generosity purchased a pair of shoes for the pedestrian The delighted fellow departed at an early hour expressing his sanguine belief that he would win his wager I had to hustle that morning to settle accounts and it was eleven o clock before Mac and I departed I had only a nickel in pocket That day we both went without lunch It was long after dark and past supper time when we arrived in Fort Plain and a half hour later before we reached the hotel The town was illuminated with electric arc lights which always throw vivid shadows and Mac A Rony had a desperate encounter with another donkey in the snow He reared and pitched and cavorted and bolted he wound me up in the reins and then bunked into me I was in his way all the time and finally rushed down a side street dragging me after him I had to lead the rampant animal through several unlighted streets round the village to get him to the stable It was the first time I had presented myself at a strange hotel without my asinine credentials When I registered the incredulous proprietor went to the barn for Mac s own statement before believing me the famous man I claimed to be That evening a committee from the Bohemian Club invited me to a concert given under the auspices of the Fort Plain Band I went and enjoyed it At its conclusion I was asked to talk to a phonograph the invention of the president of the Club Having once addressed an audience of chairs I could not object to talk to a funnel I addressed the emptiness thereof with all the eloquence I could muster then listened while the phonograph tried to repeat my words It was simply awful Had the machine been togged out in night shirt mask and lighted candle and shot off such a lingo in a dark alley I should have thought it my own spook and fled in terror When I reached Little Falls my stock of photos was exhausted and but for a stroke of good luck I fear I could not have paid my bills Mac A Rony agreed to carry a sign extolling the virtues of a one price clothier and that brought us a few dollars which we divided It was late when we started for Herkimer a town twelve miles away The mud greatly impeded our progress and suddenly just before dark when five miles to town we came to a long covered wooden bridge Then there was trouble Mac obstinately refused to enter the dark tunnel I coaxed him with an apple to follow me I prodded him I turned him about and tried to back him through but he would not budge I went behind and pushed him and vexed beyond reason I finally whipped him all without avail What could I do I sat down and thought No sound of an approaching vehicle greeted my ear but I saw a house down the road I decided to hitch my obdurate beast to the fence and seek assistance As I approached the house the seductive aroma of frying steak told me it was supper hour In response to my knock a rural looking man came out and eyed me curiously while chewing vigorously Indoors I could hear somebody drinking out of a saucer Excuse me for interrupting I said politely but my jackass Yer what My jackass I am bound for California with one and am stuck out there by the bridge I came to ask your assistance The man swallowed In a hole eh Wall I reckon you ve come ter th right place fer help No I m not in a hole exactly that s just the trouble My animal abhors holes he refuses to enter the covered bridge Wall I swan can t yer lick him through the farmer asked As impossible said I as to lick a camel through the eye of a needle I want ter know Come in he said and turning to the hired man added John let s give th feller a lift The men donned wraps and boots and with an old wheelbarrow followed me down the slushy road to the beastly eye sore of my existence To describe our efforts to get that donkey through the bridge would tire you as much as those efforts tired me Mac squirmed and kicked and bit he would not be carried by hand so the wheelbarrow was employed He was too large for the vehicle and lapped over the edges We consumed a half hour in the gigantic task of wheeling Mac across that bridge By gum young feller exclaimed the exhausted farmer as he dropped the heavy live weight Do yer haster go through this kind of business every bridge yer come ter I explained that I usually met with difficulties at bridges but had never encountered a covered one before Then I thanked the good Samaritans for their kindness and prodded Mac to town We arrived in Herkimer late Directly after supper I canvassed the stores and worked till ten o clock selling pictures We seemed to create quite a sensation When about to retire I learned that my donkey was stolen I was told local bandits held him for ransom I was greatly provoked and rushed about the streets making inquiries until at length a street loafer whispered that he would tell me where my animal was if I would blow him to a drink I agreed Then the man in the know piloted me to a bar room several blocks away where I was astonished to find the captive drinking with several other jackasses He was the only one not disconcerted by my appearance and even had the audacity to stick his nose up at the bar keeper and bray I engaged men to assist me convey the inebriate to the stable as quickly as possible and ordered an extra padlock to be snapped on the door Next morning I found my partner in a surprisingly sober condition Resuming my pilgrimage I made brief stops at Ilion and Frankfort and arrived in Utica shortly after dark on the last day of the leap year The hotel corridors swarmed with inquisitive guests who had been apprised of my coming The jovial proprietor gave us a hearty welcome and ordering several porters to lead Mac into the office called loudly to the amusement of all Front Give the donkeys the best double room in the house Slow traveling for a LEAP year I remarked to the clerk Oh that reminds me mister Pod said he here s a letter for you just came a few minutes ago I settled my weary frame in a rocker and read it It was actually an invitation to a Leap Year Ball given under the auspices of the society girls of Manicure Hall The card was printed but on its margin were inscribed in a purely feminine hand a few choice words urging me to come in my traveling habit It struck me that it might be my only chance to get engaged for eight long years so I washed and brushed and polished and turned up at the ball room at a late but nevertheless fashionable hour Illustration We tramped tired and footsore into the village The ball was the most brilliant function it had been my pleasure to attend since the days of my freedom Caesar what charming girls Were they really charming or was it because I had been a recluse so long that most anybody wearing dresses fascinated my starved optics Before advancing a rod into the hall I received a proposal within an hour I had a dozen The dance the supper the defective lights and the kisses in the dark the midnight alarm and the New Year s bells all fulfilled their offices delightfully in turn all except the leave taking of the old year which groaned over the effects of bad salad and gave up the ghost I devoted the afternoon to a delightful nap I was worn out Saturday I called upon the genial Mayor who paid me liberally for a photo and subscribed to my donkey book Sunday I set out with Mac for Rome I was told all the roads were in bad condition and was advised to take the tow path of the Erie Canal After two hours of tramping and groping in the darkness we came to a suburban street soon after I was directed to a tavern and quartered myself for the night A number of commercial men had prophesied I would not make my expenses in Rome but I did It was an all day job however and another night was fairly upon me before I started for Oneida sixteen miles away We had not gone far when we came to an old fashioned toll gate where I expected to be made to contribute to the county s good road fund I felt loath to do so for nowhere else on my journey had we found the highway in such a disreputable condition I told Mac to keep his mouth shut and we stealthily walked through the gate hoping not to be observed but no sooner done than the keeper issued from his shanty and welcomed me back He wished to talk with me he said His boy had preceded me from town and given his father glowing accounts of the donkey traveler So interested were the toll gate keeper and his family in the welfare of Pod and Mac that they not only waived the toll but gave us a pressing invitation to remain with them over night The generosity of that man s big honest heart stood out in such happy contrast with the miserly county administration and my own penury that I gratified the man s desire in a measure and hitching Mac A Rony followed my host into his dwelling where I allowed myself to share his frugal board It was certainly such a home where either a Don Quixote or a Pythagoras Pod might feel himself a distinguished guest The wife brewed tea and spread the table with black bread and doubtfully wholesome cakes while the children climbed on my knees and heard with rapture my tales of adventure When it was time to go the keeper having learned from his son that I sold the pictures to live on begged me with tears to accept a quarter for the one I gave him saying that he had a fair sized garden besides the pittance he received for performing the duties of his humble office whereas I had to depend on Providence for the keeping of myself and comrade on our long trip round the world So Mac and I thanking the good people for their kindnesses for Mac s ever acute appetite had not been overlooked by the thoughtful hostess strode on in mud and darkness slipping spattering and mumbling unintelligible and impolite words and hoping against hope soon to arrive at some comfortable haven of rest A mile beyond we were greeted with loud applause issuing from a huge building to our left which I took to be a girl s seminary but which Mac insisted was a slaughter house To be distinguished in the dark and tendered such an ovation quite tickled my vanity but my less conceited partner only brayed and trembled in the fear of being chased by a mad pig with its throat cut When we had passed to a safe distance I met a farmer in a wagon and asked him the name of the illuminated building The Rome State Insane Asylum said the man At length a dense mist gathered then it began to sprinkle I could scarcely distinguish Mac in the darkness The road was tortuous one vast river bed of mud as untenable as quicksand We first ran against a barbed wire fence on one side and a rail fence on the other and finally I plunged over boot tops in a sluice and might have drowned had I not held the reins and been pulled out by my unintentionally heroic comrade My boots were new and didn t leak and the mud and water remained in them If ever there was a moment on that overland voyage when I felt in prime condition to give it up it was there and then Still we struggled onward and a few hundred yards ahead I discovered the faint light of a farm house where I stopped to ask the distance to the next place we could secure shelter Bout four mile I should jedge said the farmer I guessed as much but it gave me a chance to sigh Mercy None nearer Just then Mac coughed and approached Nope But wait Be you the gentleman bound fer Frisco with a mule Verily so I returned while my partner brayed indignantly at being called a mule Wall what s it wuth to take you both in fer the night and feed ye the man asked avariciously Oh about seventy five cents Come back said he I just walked from the railroad station a mile and a half in the mud and lost my overshoes and kin sympathize with ye My donkey was comfortably stabled watered and fed and I ushered into a cozy room where my host brought me dry garments and slippers and gave me a hot supper Truly I thought the darkest hour is just before dawn CHAPTER VII I pass like night from land to land I have strange power of speech So soon as e er his face I see I know the man that must hear me To him my tale I teach Rime of the Ancient Mariner Having the funds to tide over a couple of days I set out early next morning for Syracuse At eleven zero P M we tramped tired and foot sore into the village of Fayetteville having traveled twenty miles the longest day s journey yet made My donkey was fagged out The stable men could hardly get him into his stall but Mac had great recuperative power and was so frisky in the morning that we resumed the march to the Salt City It was still some distance to the city when an incident happened to mar the pleasure of our peaceful walk In passing a large dairy farm Mac s grotesque figure excited either the admiration or the contempt of an ugly looking bull which left a small bunch of cattle in the field and trotted along the dilapidated fence His actions were frightfully menacing and I urged Mac to a faster gait Suddenly the bull broke through the fence bellowing and made for us head down My first thought was to save Mac s life The leather rimmed goggles he wore placed him at a disadvantage aside from the fact that the road was icy and denied us a secure footing Then too Mac carried seventy five pounds burden including my grip the saddle and rifle I was wholly unprepared for the bull my revolver was unloaded I having made it a rule to withdraw the cartridges every morning As the brute lunged at my donkey I struck Mac with my whip and wheeled him about with the reins in time to dodge the enemy Recovering himself the enraged bull made another lunge at my spry partner and still another the third time scraping off a tuft of hair with one of his horns I could only assist Mac with the reins while striking the bull over the face with the cutting rawhide I yelled for help A quarter mile away stood a farm house and in front of it two men gawking at our circus indifferent to our peril I never was more active than during those awful moments Mac afterward said he never was so busy in all his life So rapidly did we three pirouette the bull after Mac the donkey after me and I after the bull that the two human statues in the distance must have taxed their optics to distinguish which was which So dizzy did I become that I wheeled Mac round and started in the opposite direction the enemy bellowing I calling and the donkey braying to beat a fire boat whistle Finally I heard the glad sound of approaching wheels from up the road and at a glance saw a horse and buggy As it came nearer I distinguished a woman driving and my heart sank Surely she would not have the courage to venture into our very midst she must soon turn round A man might drive to our aid Still we three kept busy until the rig wheeled down upon us the prancing horse so distracting the bull that he shied to the opposite side and forgetting us set out on a trot after the receding vehicle lowing vexatiously I held my breath Soon we collected our senses and hustled on until the enemy was lost to view There are many who would call our rescue a marvel Mac said it was just our luck but I thought it miraculous A prominent hotel in Syracuse welcomed me as its honored guest and crowds cheered us to the door I had consumed six weeks traveling from New York a distance of three hundred forty miles although by rail the mileage shrinks to three hundred three It was Friday January eight I was tendered a private box at the theatre that evening and the following day Mac and I appeared on the stage between acts at both the matinee and evening performances I receiving five dollars for each appearance Saturday I devoted to business and was invited to the Elks entertainment in the evening At noon on Monday we headed for Auburn A heavy snow accompanied a fall of the mercury Great drifts had formed during the night reaching anywhere from inches to feet and from yard to yard My spirits were low The first eight miles to Camillus were covered in four hours After a good rest and poor fodder we strode on over the white and solitary road seven more miles to Elbridge where at eight o clock I registered at a cozy hostelry and ordered that Mac be cared for and my supper at once be prepared Then I hastened to canvass the stores disposing of three photos at fifteen cents apiece My over night expenses would be a dollar and a half I lacked forty five cents of the amount But that did not disconcert me The hotel was composed of bricks and its proprietor was one of them a jovial Grand Army man who wore a big soft hat and a blue coat with brass buttons His cranium was chock full of entertaining reminiscence too At that time men were engaged with mule teams hauling stone for repairing the canal and the hotel was filled with an incongruous lot of teamsters and laborers Judging by their roguish remarks it would be wise of me to place my donkey under lock and key but when I hinted it to my host he assured me my fears were unwarranted I was assigned a large chamber on the main floor next to the dining room There was no lock to the door I complained about it Nobody will molest you said my host I soon fell to sleep Long before daylight I was awakened by the juggling of plates and cutlery and the racking of a stove It was impossible to sleep during such a hubub so I proposed to smoke Rising from bed and groping in darkness I hunted for the electric light button hanging from the ceiling but had proceeded only a few steps when suddenly I fell headlong over a huge hairy substance which moved and yawned Hamlet s ghost Was this really midwinter s night dream I sat on the floor for a moment to set my dislocated big toe on the off foot then staggered timorously to my feet found the cord and turned on the light Could I believe my eyes There lay Mac A Rony He gazed at me in mute bewilderment and blinked like an owl then presently rose to the occasion brayed and charged at the donkey in the mirror It was enough to awaken the whole village when the excited animal rushed around the room with the mirror frame for a collar vaulting chairs bed and table and exerting his best efforts to kick holes in the walls and ceiling What in damnation is the racket yelled the proprietor as he came running to my room I thought to disarm him by being the first to complain for I expected some harsh invectives to be hurled my way You said I should not be molested I said indignantly standing on a mantle shelf in my night shirt Well It s the first time my house was ever turned into a stable retorted the erstwhile jovial Grand Army man And it s the first time I ever was made to room with a jackass I returned in a rage By this time Mac had stuck a foot in the frame collar in trying to clear the stove and had fallen I quickly leaped from my perch and my now more conciliating host helped to disengage the beast from his wooden harness and give him a forcible exit Then we dressed and set to work clearing the room Of course the cook rushed in to have her say otherwise that hotel was suspiciously quiet considering what had happened When I went to breakfast the landlord met me with a smile it surprised and pleased me I concluded that the practical jokers had settled everything to his satisfaction My table mates were unusually uncommunicative their conversation hung mournfully on the weather My breakfast finished I went to my host and informed him of the state of my finances Two mule drivers were discharged last night he observed I could have got you a job if you had told me in time Right here an aged townsman came in stamping the snow off his boots unwound a great tippet from his neck and regarding the clay besmeared floor delivered his opinion to the landlord Gol blast me If I run a house a lookin like this I d close up and go out of the business the granger remarked with a critical eye to the floor and a wink at me I agree with you said I Price ought to pay a quarter to have the floor cleaned It would be worth twice that sum to me to see you clean it he returned humorously It s a bargain so saying I pulled off my coat and called for a mop and a pail of hot water The landlord seemed to regard the incident as a good joke so did Pye Pod Rolling up my trousers and shirt sleeves I fell to work The old man fled to spread the news as soon as he saw I was in earnest My first sweep with the old mop shattered it the landlord lost no time procuring a new one Then I went at it as though it were my special line of trade and so deeply absorbed was I in the novel undertaking that less than half of the population of the village filed into the room without my comment There were men and women young and old and middling and children bound for school all around backing against the walls and windows commenting laughing and joking while I just mopped and with new jokes helped make merry for I felt that was an experience of a lifetime for all of us A pretty girl snapped a kodak at me she took fifteen orders for pictures within a minute I was gratified to see all enjoy themselves Still I kept mopping and watched the clock to see how much time was left before school MY time was coming I wanted everybody to hear my story They didn t know a thing about me or Mac A Rony except through newspaper reports which are not always reliable Finally I dropped my mop and straightened up to rest my lame back Does that suit you I asked the landlord A handsomer job was never done this floor said he you have earned your money Every one evidently wished to see me paid As I received the cash I whispered to my host to hand me the key to the door expressing my purpose with a sly wink which he hardly interpreted The silver jingled with the brass in my hands and I went to the door and locked it Then walking to the desk I turned faced my audience without a blush bowed low and said Ladies and gentlemen and children of Elbridge then gave a brief account of my travels from New York My words pleased and were greeted with laughter But they had not heard my peroration We rarely appreciate anything that costs us nothing I began my conclusion In New York a show such as I have just provided would cost at least a dollar and a half for orchestra chairs and fifty cents for the family circle this seems to be the family circle Now to save the bother of printing tickets and posters we admitted you to the show without delaying you at the door in the frosty air and one and all old and young must pay me five cents before you leave this room The door is locked and I hold the key Those of you ladies who left your purses on the piano can borrow of your gentlemen friends who doubtless will be ready to help you out of your dilemma Some of you may demur and complain of hard times but said excuses will not hold with me I carry hard times with me whither I go on my long journey whereas you have yours only in one place As soon as all have paid me the door will be unlocked and not until I thank you for your unsolicited audience and trust that the next time we meet the circumstances will be as happy for us all as they have been this January morning My speech must have been forceful for the nickels poured into my hat As each individual paid I motioned him or her to the opposite side of the room to guard against humbugging The landlord had to come to the financial relief of a few but the door was opened in time for school and everybody departed with evident good feeling My host was the most astonished of all and with a hearty grip of the hand predicted that I would reach my destination Without delay I settled my account with him saddled Mac A Rony and with two dollars eighty cents to the good started for Auburn The last denizen of the village to bid me God speed was the philanthropist who unwittingly procured me my bill for the hotel show and then filled my purse for me CHAPTER VIII An attempted assassination I cried in excited tones One of the boldest ever heard of and right here too in the shadow of this palace devoted to commerce and peace A Soldier of Manhattan Soon after reaching Auburn I received a theatre manager who called to engage Mac and me to appear at the Opera House We signed with him and the first evening we made such a decided hit that we were engaged for a re appearance I received ten dollars for both performances and the privilege to sell photos at the door which netted me a considerable sum Auburn is the seat of a State Prison and a Theological Seminary Avoiding the former I set out to visit the seminary The students were cordial and showed me about the buildings among them being Willard Chapel which they called the handsomest in America I was unable to leave until just before noon Tramping without dinner went against the donkey s grain even more literally than it did mine About two o clock I was passing through Aurelius when a farmer invited me to take lunch with him I accepted and enjoyed the repast and the visit with the hospitable agriculturist and his wife He gave me a card to a California friend and hoped I would visit him and present his regards This pleasant delay upset my calculations I did not reach Cayuga until dusk The lake was frozen but the sun had somewhat melted the ice during the past two days I was cautioned not to venture across with the donkey for if he should slip both of us would go through the ice This was a great disappointment for it compelled me to follow the tow path some five miles round the edge of the lake through the dreaded Montezuma Swamp in order to reach Seneca Falls It was long after dark when we left the swamp and entered the shadow of a rocky ridge A half mile further I discerned the distant electric lights of the town To our left was the canal and to the right the rocky barrier while ahead beside the tow path shone an arc light suspended from one of several poles which extended in a line to town I was tramping along at Mac s head when suddenly a man stepped from behind the pole and ordered me to throw up my hands Although excited I still had the presence of mind to jump behind my donkey Instantly the highwayman fired at me Then I fired to show I was armed and ready to defend myself and at once a shot came from the rocks a little to my rear Turning my head I saw what appeared to be a cave where presumably the second man was hiding But just as I turned my head a second shot from the man in front knocked off my plug hat and then came a shot from the rocks Now fully realizing my peril between two fires I aimed my revolver at the man in the road some thirty feet away and fired to cripple him I apparently succeeded for the fellow cried God I m hit and fell in the snow covered road resting on one elbow and pressing his hand to his right breast Not sure however that the man was not feigning I shot into the cave from which at once issued the other footpad who ran down the tow path Then I picked up my hat and passed by the prostrate man keeping my revolver trained upon him and hurried on toward Seneca Falls A quarter of a mile beyond I came to Lock House No six My story greatly excited the quiet household Hibbard the keeper with a lantern helped me examine Mac to see if he was wounded then we were generously cared for After drinking a cup of tea and toasting my feet awhile at the fire I made my departure On reaching Seneca Falls I called on the chief of police he being absent I saw the Mayor who told me that I did only my duty by shooting in self defense Then I went back to the hotel where in the crowd of excited people anxious to hear my story were reporters eager to gather the facts of the affair Next day Hibbard reported that at two o clock in the morning he had heard a buggy pass his house toward the scene of the shooting and although he laid awake until daylight did not hear it return He said it was the first vehicle in years to traverse the tow path at such a late hour and believed the injured footpad had been rescued by his confederate and driven away After lunch I left for Waterloo where I found its main thoroughfare so choked with people to see me that I could not get Mac through They hailed me as a hero and shouted my name and Mac s until they were hoarse and purchased all my photographs at twice the regular price Finally we resumed our journey and arrived in Geneva long after dark Geneva is the seat of Hobart College One of the societies invited me to a spread at its fraternity house and while I was there Mac was stolen from the stable of which I was not informed until evening In view of the fact that a cow had recently been lodged in the college library I shouldered my Winchester and set out on the war path after breakfast accompanied by the Chief of the Fire Department We had searched the dormitories and cellars of the college buildings and were going to the gymnasium when I discovered Mac standing in the snow eating thistles It had been a cold and stormy night he was covered with snow and icicles hung from his under jaw Yet the donkey uttered no complaint merely saying The boys didn t do a thing to me last night I learned from a professor that Mac had been found in a recitation room describing impossible theorems and eating chalk and that the janitor and two professors had their hands full carrying the donkey down two staircases and out of doors Although it was biting cold and the mercury had fallen to the zero point I could not afford to tarry longer After lunch we set out in a blinding snow storm and tramped on to Phelps where we stopped for supper and an hour s rest At first Mac had shown no ill effects of his recent exposure but now he coughed Having made but eight miles that day I resolved to brave the storm four miles further and reached Clifton Springs at ten o clock There I obtained comfortable lodgings for myself and partner Next day the venerable director of the Sanitarium invited me to be his guest and kindly permitted me to lecture to the patients of his fashionable hostelry for a silver offering Of course I accepted My heart to heart talk seemed to tickle the large audience but when the porter brought back my hat with only two dollars in it I was disappointed I had expected a contribution commensurate with the encores When I paid the porter twenty five cents for his services I dropped my spectacles and broke the glasses A new pair would cost me one dollar seventy five cents That made accounts even Reminds me of the colored preacher observed the director with good humor somebody passed his hat to the congregation and returned it empty Well said the parson I m thankful to de Lawd to get my hat back The story was apt but it did not console me While at the Sanitarium I sold many photographs and judging the patients to be affluent doubled the regular price Before our departure Mac showed symptoms of rheumatism A doctor suggested that an electri thermal bath would make a new animal of him It won t cost you a cent said he I arranged for the treatment at once It required several attendants to get the fellow in the electric chair where they secured him with straps and then the doctor administered the electricity While the electric wand was rubbed over his legs and body the frightened donkey brayed and twisted and squirmed and threatened to upset the chair causing much merriment Well Mac s professional treatment made him a new donkey He traveled more quickly than ever before and almost out tramped his master Near the Springs is a farm house where resided at that time a sister of Stephen A Douglas I called to see her and was cordially received She was eighty six years of age her left arm paralyzed and her eyesight very dim Tramping on we came to Shortsville where we stopped for dinner Supper was eaten at Victor and at eight Mac and I set out for Pittsford the wind and snow blowing furiously in our faces The night was intensely dark Somewhere past ten I passed two tramps on the highway but only they and the passing trains broke the monotony of the journey It must have been eleven when the road joined another at right angles I was puzzled then whether to turn to the left or to the right I stamped my half frozen feet as we halted in the biting wind until presently through the falling snow I saw a distant light and hurried for it Farmers usually retired early but on arriving at the cozy house I found a party of young people dancing playing cards and eating refreshments A kind faced woman greeted me at the door and asked me in When I introduced myself and inquired my way the astonishment of the whole party told me plainly I was considered an honored guest transient indeed though I was Well I declare we ve read about you lots said the hostess Won t you sit down and have some ice cream and cake I smell coffee I remarked frankly if I may be treated to a little of that I shall be grateful but as for ice cream I feel it a little unseasonable this evening And as I rubbed my ears vigorously the girls laughed and said Ain t he plucky It was hard indeed to break away from this jolly party I don t know how long I should have tarried if Mac had not called to me His bray was the signal for a stampede to the porch all forgot refreshments and dancing in their eagerness to see the famous donkey They simply lionized him The girls carried cake and pie and ice cream to him and one offered him a fried egg which he declined When we said our adieux the shivering group gave us a hearty cheer and God speed then rushed indoors leaving the dejected pilgrims to the cold consolation of the snow wind and darkness of a winter s night CHAPTER IX In the first lighted house there was a woman who would not open to me Modestine was led away by a layman to the stables and I and my pack were received into our Lady of the Snows Travels with a Donkey Having been directed on the road to Pittsford a town seven miles beyond we tramped wearily on battling with the elements as best we could until midnight when almost numb with cold I resolved to seek refuge in a small hamlet we were nearing called Bushnell Basin I was told it contained a tavern which would accommodate us in an emergency But it was so dark when we reached Bushnell that I could not see the Basin Its dozen dusky looking shanties seemed to be deserted and when I saw a boy crossing the road I was too surprised to hail him Mac brayed and the lad stopped I asked him where the hotel was He directed me toward a dim light and disappeared We pushed on but the light was extinguished before we could reach the house I called loudly to the landlord to let me in I rapped on the door desperately and repeated my yells A dog in the house barked savagely then Mac began to bray and I wondered that nobody entered a protest against such a disturbance At length a squeaky female voice called from an upstairs window Who be ye A man I answered civilly What kind of a man A gentleman I said with emphasis What s that thing yer got with ye I was afraid she d catch cold in the opened window if she was in her nightdress but I replied in a voice of a siren A jackass Can t let ye in no room for shows here next town fell the frozen words on my benumbed ears Then the woman sneezed and closed the window Mac A Rony seemed to comprehend the situation but offered no remedy I would have covered the three miles to Pittsford but the donkey was fagged out and could barely drag his legs Where were we to find shelter at such a time and place Retracing our steps a short distance I caught the sound of pounding as of a hammer Soon I heard the sawing of a board and the saw s enraged voice when it struck a knot Saved I thought as I walked in the direction whence the sound emanated The snow lay ten inches deep old Boreas shook the trees and whistled round the quivering hovels and I was so chilled and vexed that if another person had dared to ask me what kind of a man I was I would have measured somebody for a coffin Finally I came to the house through whose window I discerned a lighted candle in a back room I rapped on the door The sawing continued so did my rapping Then the sawing ceased and the door was opened by a swarthy heavy bearded man who extended me a kindly Good evenin I introduced myself and pleaded my case Come in where it s warm he said and following him to the stove I explained my situation We ain t got much accommodation for ye he apologized but I can t leave ye and yer pet out in the cold This is my wife and the man introduced me Then he censured the landlady of the tavern for not admitting me saying she ought to have her license revoked If you d been a loafing vagabond and drunkard she d taken ye in quick enough said my sympathetic host but as ye was a gentleman she was embarrassed to know how to treat ye From which I gathered that he did know how and would prove it He explained that the front part of the building was a store the rear portion was divided into two small rooms a kitchen and a sleeping room The second floor was utilized as a hay loft wherein was stored Hungarian hay for his horse which he said he kept in a shed cross the road yonder Now if ye ll lend me a hand he suggested we ll make room for yer mule in the shed and my wife ll get ye something to eat Then we ll see where we kin tuck ye comfortable till mornin I pulled on my mittens and followed the man into the biting wind with a warmer and cheerier heart and acquainting Mac with the good news proceeded to assist my host to transfer a huge woodpile in order to obtain the side of a hen roost lying underneath it with which to construct a partition in the shed to preserve peace between horse and donkey By one o clock Mac was stabled and I in prime condition to enjoy any kind of a meal The good wife had fried me three eggs and brewed me a pot of tea and sawed off several slices of home made bread for which I blessed her in my heart and paid her a compliment by eating it all The repast over I chatted a while with my friends and smoked then said if they were ready to retire I was A roughly made staircase reached from the kitchen floor over the cook stove to a trap door in the ceiling and up those stairs I followed my host he with candle in hand I with a quilt which I feared the kind people had robbed from their own bed Great gaps yawned in the roof and sides of the loft through which the wind whistled coldly The hay was covered with snow in places and the thermometer must have been far below zero But I stuck my legs in the hay and pulled a woolen nightshirt over my traveling clothes and tucked the quilt round my body and put on my hat and earlaps and soon was as snug as a bug in a rug and slept soundly I arose early with the family joined them at breakfast paid my host liberally and started with Mac for Pittsford There we were welcomed by a party of young men who had expected to give us a fitting reception the evening before They claimed that had they known where we were they would have rescued us with a bob sleigh I did not tarry with them but tramped on to Rochester and arrived there at three thirty P M having covered thirty five miles since the previous morning We spent two days in the Flour City An old business acquaintance arranged for Mac A Rony to pose in the show window of a clothing store for which I received five dollars Although it was dreadfully cold and the wind blew a gale Mac attracted every pedestrian on the street I called on Rattlesnake Pete the proprietor of a well known curiosity shop who wanted to buy my bullet riddled hat but I declined to part with it at any reasonable price then I called on the Mayor He received me cordially laughed when I related my adventures and subscribed to my book Rochester is the seat of a Theological Seminary and several breweries Near by is the celebrated Genesee Falls where Sam Patch leaped to his death Many old friends called on me during my sojourn among them a physician who gave me a neat little case of medicines such as he believed would be most needed in emergency on such a journey and while being entertained at a club I was presented with a fine sombrero In spite of the frigid gale which had been raging three days and of the dire predictions of the Western Union bulletins I started with Mac for Spencerport at twelve thirty right after lunch The village lay twelve miles distant The biting wind swept across the level meadows laden with icy dust from the frozen crust of the snow and cut into our faces Five times were Mac and I welcomed into houses to warm but we reached the village an hour and a half after dark with only my ears frost bitten and soon were comfortably quartered for the night Next morning we started for Brockport eight miles further on by the tow path which we followed The wind was blowing forty miles an hour and the mercury fell below zero Every now and then we had to turn our backs to the gale to catch our breath Mac s face was literally encased in ice I rubbed my ears and cheeks constantly to prevent their freezing Only two or three sleighs were out and the drivers of these were wrapped so thoroughly in robes and mufflers that I could not distinguish male from female Still determined not to retreat to town I urged my little thoroughbred on and soon we were called into a house and permitted to thaw out On this occasion Mac to his own astonishment as well as that of the kind lady of the house stuck his frosted snoot into a pot of boiling beans on the stove for which unprecedented behavior I duly apologized Eight more times both of us were taken into hospitable homes and inns to warm before reaching Brockport at eight in the evening more dead than alive My nose and ears were now frost bitten The towns people hearing of our arrival flocked into the hotel to chat with me or went to the stable to see Mac A Rony Wednesday I resumed the journey resolved that nothing save physical incapacity should deter me now was the time to harden myself to exposure and prepare me for greater trials later on But before leaving I purchased a small hand sled and improvised rope traces by which Mac could draw my luggage instead of carrying it Besides this novel sort of vehicle would attract attention I realized that we must depend for a living more upon sensation than upon our virtues The next thing essential was a collar for the donkey and I had to make it But to make the stubborn beast understand I wished him to draw the sled that he wasn t hitched to stand was the greatest difficulty I had Finally he caught on and marched along through the streets quite respectably Beyond the town we met with some deep snowdrifts lying across the road and Mac s little legs would get stuck or he would pretend they were and I would have to dig the fellow out with my rifle Again while leading the stubborn animal in order to make better time in the opposing wind I would suddenly hear a grating scraping sound to the rear and looking around would find the sled overturned with its burden After several such upsets I cut a bough from a tree whittled a toothpick point to it and prodded Mac to proper speed while I walked behind and with a string steadied the top heavy load of freight Then this difficulty remedied Mac with seeming rascality would cross and recross the ridge of ice and snow in the center of the road as if he couldn t make up his mind which of the beaten tracks to follow or disliked the monotony of a single trail every time upsetting the sled During that long and frigid day s tramp but one human being passed me and he was in a sleigh He recognized my outfit for he called to me encouragingly Stick to it Pod you ll win yet Late in the afternoon a man hailed me from the door of a farm house Come in and warm and have a drink of cider Now if there was one thing in the world that tickled my palate it was sweet cider and I accepted a glass Wouldn t your pard have a drink asked the generous man Presume he would if you offered it I replied I never knew him to refuse any kind of a beverage though this cider is pretty hard The farmer brought out a milk pan and that donkey drained the pan Shall I give him some more asked the big hearted soul Mac stuck out his nose in mute response so I said yes provided he would not be robbing himself it would probably put new vigor in the fatigued animal and super induce more speed Got barrels of it friend barrels of it said the Good Samaritan who refilled the pan which Mac again drained Then thanking the farmer I steered my donkey on over the ice bound highway Illustration Mac could draw my luggage instead of carrying it Illustration Mac s little legs would get stuck We had not proceeded a mile when I observed that Mac did not walk as firmly as he had his course was decidedly zig zag Finally I left my station at the sled and guided him by the bit Now he staggered more than ever then it dawned on me that the cider had gone to his head In less than five minutes more I regretted having met that liberal hearted farmer possessing barrels of hard cider Suddenly the drunken donkey fell down in the snow and instead of attempting to rise he tried to stand on his head Not succeeding in that he made an effort to sit up and toppled over backwards All this time he brayed ecstatically as if in the seventh heaven Next he began to roll and tangled himself in the rope traces and tumbled the sled and gladstone bag about the snow as though it were rubbish Fearing lest he would break my rifle and cameras I tried to unbuckle them from the saddle while the scapegrace was in the throes of delirium tremens and got tangled up with him in the ropes In trying to free myself I was accidentally kicked over in the snow And in that ridiculous and awkward fix I was found by a jovial farmer who drove up in a sleigh He soon helped me out of my scrape and laughed me into good humor kindly consenting to take charge of my luggage and send a bob sleigh after the drunkard as soon as he reached his house a mile beyond There I waited for the relief committee and the wrecking sleigh to arrive To say I was the maddest of mortals doesn t half express it At length two strong men with my help succeeded in depositing Mac on the bob and he was conveyed to the barn and there placed behind the bars bedded and fed and left to sober up while I his outraged master was hospitably entertained over night by my charitable benefactor We were now at Rich s Corners some four miles from Albion My good host provided me with such warm apparel as I hadn t with me and when bed time came I was trundled into a downy bed where I dreamed all night about drunken jackasses By breakfast time I had recovered my good spirits I insisted on baking the buckwheat cakes and not until all the family were apparently filled with the flapjacks which I tossed in the air to their amusement did I sit down to the table to eat Breakfast over I joined my host in a smoke then donned my wraps for the day s journey When we men returned from the barn with the reformed donkey a number of the neighboring farmers had assembled with their families on the porch to see the overland pilgrims I snapped my camera on the group said Go on Mac to my remorseful partner and soon was plodding toward Albion CHAPTER X Strange to see what delight we married people have to see these poor fools decoyed into our condition every man and woman gazing and smiling at them Samuel Pepys Diary We did not reach Albion until noon So numerous were the snow drifts that we made only a mile an hour Old Boreas might have been a little more considerate and brushed the snow along the fences instead of piling it across our path That morning I dug Mac out of a dozen snow drifts Albion looked to be a pretty place Besides many attractive homes it possesses the celebrated Pullman Memorial Church a High School and a woman s reformatory But I did not visit those interesting places Being a high churchman the church was too low for me not being up in the classics the high school was too high for me and believing women to be terrestrial angels I did not wish to be convinced that my judgment was wrong by investigating a female reformatory I put up at a comfortable hotel where I was told that the relentless storm would likely imprison me several days and found cozy quarters for Mac A Rony The day after my arrival a neighboring farmer took me sleigh riding into the country to dine with him and his mother his fleet horse having once conveyed him and his father from Dakota to Albion sixteen hundred miles in thirty six days When I told Mac about it he turned a deaf ear lay down and groaned a groan of incredulity Ex Consul Dean Currie invited me to spend an evening with him and his family and took me to call on the Mayor who received me cordially and offered me the use of the Town Hall for a lecture I accepted and addressed a well filled house my receipts far exceeding my expenses in town The coziest place during these three stormy days I found to be an easy chair by the great stove in the hotel office where I whiled away most of my time There throughout the wintry days and evenings assembled the guests of the house and many convivial spirits from town to hear the biggest lie or to relate the most ridiculous yarn At one of those gatherings I met an interesting character Sylvenus Reynolds Although he was eighty four years old he appeared as young and agile as most men of half his years He attributed his longevity to active out of door life Judging from his talk one would have thought him to be the greatest traveler living but because he was denied the gift of a scribe he would probably die like the heroes of the country churchyard unknown to fortune and to fame He had tramped and lived by his rifle from Puget Sound to Terra Del Fuego and was the first white man to cross the Andes from Chili to Brazil Once in the jungles of India he and a lion and a tiger all met unexpectedly and while the three were determining which two should become partners the tiger made a spring at Sylvenus and just when his gun missed fire and he thought it all up with him the lion leaped in the air caught the tiger by the neck and killed it He said after that he never could be induced to take the life of a lion the kindest and gentlest of wild beasts But I must tell about his famous jump across the Lock at Lockport at that time fourteen one two feet wide The event was well advertised Temporary toll gates were established and ten cents levied on such individual passing through to the show Over eight hundred and eighty eight dollars were collected for the jumper The jump was successful and Syl got the pot The narrative closed with a discussion and another jump That wasn t such a mighty big jump remarked a listener I know several fellows who can jump to beat fourteen one two feet I ll bet a dollar with any or all the men present said I that not one of you can stand still on this floor and jump seven feet I had ten takers The money was deposited with the proprietor the house was thrown into great excitement The ten jumps were made But the judges agreed with Pod that the jumpers failed to STAND STILL and jump and so handed me the money Naturally the jumpers being in a jumping mood wanted to jump on me next but they finally conciliated and regarded me thereafter with suspicion Although the roads were reported impassable we departed for Medina on Sunday morning and the day following hastened on toward Lockport When yet two miles to town after traveling sixteen miles a boy ran after us in the darkness and persuaded me to return to his house as his Pa wished me to be his guest over night so we did not reach Lockport until eleven next morning I no sooner stabled Mac than I boarded the train for Buffalo in quest of a theatre engagement failing in that I returned to enjoy a stroke of good luck in the form of an engagement for Mac and me to appear on a vaudeville stage in Lockport which netted me a few honest dollars At six o clock Thursday morning we were off for Buffalo a twenty six mile journey Only once did we stop when I unsaddled for our mid day meal at Stormville Mammoth snow drifts were piled against the fences and across the roads which melting gave way under my donkey s weight frequently imprisoning his slim legs We reached a school house near the village of Williamsville just as the scholars were dismissed for their nooning and were immediately set upon by a laughing shouting questioning bevy of frolicsome children who made merry sport of my partner s predicament he was stuck in a snow drift If Mac had exerted himself a little he might have climbed out but he was tired unusually obstinate and naturally lazy and so preferred to await developments One precocious genius in the crowd suggested rolling the donkey into a snowball and rolling him to town That was the signal for a general hurrah I shook my head disapprovingly but on thinking it over decided to try the novel plan Come on boys I said And then with peals of merriment and youthful energy which I never saw equalled the whole lot soon packed the snow about the patient animal until only his head and tail were left exposed then I gave the word heave to and the asinine snowball began to turn slowly on its axis and made a complete revolution The donkey brayed with laughter but before he had rolled a dozen times he stopped braying and began kicking or rather made futile efforts to kick A dozen more revolutions and he complained of dizziness but the children only pushed and rolled with renewed energy Larger and larger the snowball grew until finally we had to stop and scale off sufficient snow to enable the good work to go on And presently it did go on and we rolled the asinine snowball into town amid the cheers and laughter of the children the frightful brays of protestation from the imprisoned donkey and the dumb consternation of the villagers Mac when liberated rose at once only to topple over on his head He claimed the earth was turning around which was true enough although not the way the donkey meant He was too dizzy to stand for some time each effort resulted in a comical physical collapse that set the villagers shrieking with laughter This was a good time for me to profit by Mac s generous entertainment and while telling the assembled crowd all about our travels I sold photos by the dozen The people opened their pockets liberally and before they could recover from the effects of the sensation Mac had caused we pilgrims were hurrying out of town over an easier road to Buffalo In consequence of the snowball affair and several other delays we did not reach the city until after dark Having traveled seventeen miles since lunch we were ravenously hungry Buffalo presented a beautiful sight with her myriad lights gleaming on the snow Down Main street I espied a patent night lunch wagon standing by the curb and hitching Mac to the hind axle I went in for a bite Suddenly I became conscious that the vehicle was moving and made a hasty exit to discover I had traveled several blocks in the lunch wagon The hard travel Mac had been subjected to for the past week necessitated his having a long rest before resuming the journey The morning after our arrival in Buffalo my aristocratic donkey was made the honored guest of the Palace Stables a large and handsome brick building Mac s box stall was on the third floor and could be reached either by an inclined run way or an elevator The donkey being unaccustomed to such extravaganzas as elevators chose the inclined plane and even then he put on such airs that it required the united efforts of a half dozen stablemen to escort him to his apartment Once there he was feted like a nobleman I too was lavishly entertained But of all the courtesies extended me the most interesting was the invitation to stand up with a young Italian wedding party in the City Hall where the Mayor who sent for me tied the knot His Honor did the sacred office bravely until the conclusion when he flunked completely I ll explain Casimo Mazzette and Rosino Lodico were dago peasants born in Palermo Sicily The groom was tall and proud and embarrassed although ten years the senior of his eighteen year old bride who was too coy to meet his gaze She at first took Pod for a preacher engaged to prompt the Mayor According to the custom of their native heath they simply joined hands instead of using a wedding ring a very sensible idea for hard times The pretty ceremony over the bewitching female benedict looked at the Mayor and moved toward him and raised her face but the embarrassed Mayor withdrew to the astonishment of everyone explaining that he was married to a jealous woman and asked me to kiss the bride for him He preferred to do the honors by proxy So without comment or hesitation I stepped up to the pretty dago placed my arm around her to avoid danger of making a bungle of the first kiss I ever gave a woman drew her face to mine and kissed her squarely on her ruby lips She looked so happy that I was about to repeat the act but her husband stepped between us The pair shook hands with the Mayor and his clerical looking assistant who wished them lots of luck and dagoettes and then the blushing bride fled with her devoted swain out of the hall Next day I accepted for Mac an invitation to a phonograph exhibition in the Ellicott Building We both attended and were richer for it The room was well filled with men and women who eagerly awaited the advertised show When the manager courteously asked what was the donkey s favorite style of music I explained that as he was a slow animal he probably preferred lively music At once the yellow kid held the tubes to the donkey s ears those sensitive organs indicated his delight by each alternatively flapping forward and backward but suddenly as they were thrown forward together the jackass kicked an incandescent light globe above into flying fragments Women screamed and fell into the arms of the men for protection You said the donkey was gentle said the manager angrily So he is I returned Then how do you account for such high kicking Struck a discord I presume I said What music is in that machine The clerk answered The first p p piece was the Darkey s Dream said he with slight impediment of speech but the s s second was Schneider s Band Who wouldn t kick I exclaimed Due apologies were in order and confidence was restored and an hour later we two departed with the donkey s earnings and the well wishes of all CHAPTER XI ASININE TABLE OF MEASUREMENT Nine square inches make one foot Four all around feet make one jackass One cross jackass makes three kicks Two hard kicks make one corpse Corpse kicks jackass feet How many doggies do we meet Dogeared Doggerels From which table we may safely conclude there is one dog less in the world and that estimating him by his kicks Mac is a jackass and a half If I had kept a complete record of the breeds sorts colors and conditions of the canines the pups and curs we met with on the road from New York I might have compiled a book larger than Trow s New York City Directory which still would exclude the mongrels and all unclassified wags and barks of the country sausage districts From a financial point of view I was disappointed with our four days sojourn in Buffalo but Mac and I were rested and the weather was milder The winds from Lake Erie had swept the snow off the roads against the fences where it didn t belong so that my partner had to drag the sled out of Buffalo over a dry and rutty highway There were however several places where the elements had shown a grudge against the farmers by piling huge snow drifts across the road to impede their travel and maliciously blowing the white spread from the fields of winter wheat which required its protecting warmth Directly on reaching Hamburg we were taken in charge by a mister Kopp Mac had predicted a cop would have us before long and given a warm reception On the way to Eaton s Corners six miles beyond I undertook to earn fifty cents in an extraordinary manner some might call it a hoggish manner A farmer hailed me from a barnyard and asked if he could sell me a boar Boar I exclaimed almost losing my breath and I added No sir one boar is enough Well then do yer want to make a half dollar he called Course I do more than anxious I answered Then jes help me drag this ere hog ter town most Squire Birge has bought it and I ve agreed ter deliver it or bust Let s see it I said Don t know much about hogs but I ll know more I guess when I see yours I followed the man Mac tagging close behind Behold A docile looking hog of mastodon dimensions was conveying the contents of a corn crib to its inner self I walked around the beast several times to count his good points and closed the bargain An end of a rope was fastened to the hog s hind foot and the other end wound round the pommel of the saddle Then I gave the infuriated donkey the whip A tug of war followed presently the rope snapped and donkey and hog were hurled in opposite directions both turning somersaults Luckily my rifle escaped injury The hog lost the kink in his tail he looked mad and with his vicious stares frightened Mac half to death Finally the rope was again adjusted and an exciting scene ensued The velocity of the vibrations of that hog s roped foot trying to kick loose put electricity to shame When the donkey eased up a little the boar showed its true character by starting for the barn pulling Mac after him while on the other hand when the hog stopped for wind the donkey would make a dive for town and drag him until he also had to pause for breath So those obdurate beasts worked rather than played at cross purposes for half an hour before I forfeited my contract and proceeded on over the frozen road We reached Angola by seven and Farnham at ten o clock There we were comfortably quartered Mac was rubbed with liniment fed and watered while I too late for supper retired with an empty stomach The Lake Shore road threads some thrifty looking towns The country was dotted with neatly painted barns and cozy houses surrounded by energetic windmills and inert live stock while denuded vineyards laced the frosted shores for miles about We lunched at Silver Creek where a burly denizen tried to sell me a big dog which he claimed would tear an ox into pieces The price named was five dollars Neither man nor dog made an impression on me When I finally drew rein in Dunkirk at seven thirty P M the hotel was alive with commercial men who quickly surrounded us In ten minutes I sold enough chromos to pay our expenses over night and purchase a new breast band for Mac Prior to February twelve Lincoln s Birthday I traveled so rapidly even with a donkey that events somewhat confused me following the shore of Lake Erie I visited a dozen towns or more sometimes several in a single day I had no sooner disfigured the guest register of the New Hotel Fredonia with my odd signature than I discovered the illustrious name of Geo W Cable on the line above mine It seemed a strange coincidence that two such famous men as Cable and Pod should be so unexpectedly crowded together in that little book in a little inn in that town Natural enough and pursuant to the Law of Affinities I immediately sent my card to the celebrated author who at once invited the eccentric traveler to his room mister Cable had been reclining having just arrived by train He gave me a complimentary ticket to his lecture that evening which I placed in my pocket and later gave to the hotel clerk for discounting my bill What a pretty place this must be in summer was the author s initiatory remark while twisting a yawn into a smile Yes indeed I answered and stretched my legs And how do you stand the journey Oh fairly well getting in better condition every day You are a slender man Professor but I assume very wiry like the cables The conversation continued until I felt the strain and I presently shook hands and wishing him a full house departed The author lecturer is a little under stature he wore a genial smile and frock coat his eyes were as bright as duplex burners and he shook hands just as other people do It was long after dark when we travelers ambled into Brockton and put up for the night Mac and I had passed the day in the village of Ripley The Raines Law did not seem to have a salutary effect on that section of the State I met on the road that afternoon a tall lank tipsy fellow carrying a long muzzle loader gun He stopped me and said he was a Westerner a half breed and fifty years old Been out shootin mavericks he said importantly Same gun hic had in th Rockies I m gentle though gentle as a kitten I was charmed to know he was not hostile said So long and hurried on Sunday was Valentine s Day I received a few doubtfully appropriate souvenirs but did not discover the name of a single friend in the batch Before leaving Ripley I was presented with a large and handsome dog a cross between the bloodhound and the mastiff a pup weighing ninety eight pounds which I named Donkeyota The generous donor was a mister W W Rickenbrode who accompanied me some distance to assist me in handling the huge animal in case of emergency He had no sooner bade me good bye than I feared lest I should not be able to make another mile that day The wind blew a hurricane While passing a cemetery I took a snap shot of square grave stones which photograph shows them rolling in that driving gale It was the most wonderful demonstration of the wind s power I ever witnessed Shortly afterward in descending a steep and icy road into a gully the sled with its burden ran against my donkey s heels upset him and carried him half way down the hill In my anxiety and haste to assist Mac and hold on to my hat I dropped the dog s chain and away he went kiting down hill after the sled and I needed four hands To my surprise the dog Don seemed to enjoy the entertainment and instead of fleeing back to Ripley rolled in the snow and barked in glee We reached the Half Way House Harbor Creek after dark Next morning after breakfast the landlord s little daughter came rushing into the house to impart the thrilling news that John their horse had a little colt and enthusiastically leading us to the stable she pointed to my donkey and said There see Mac A Rony turned his head and regarded the little one with a comical expression on his countenance as much as to say If I brayed you d think me a Colt s revolver Upon entering the city of Erie Pa the Transfer Company sent an invitation to Mac A Rony and Donkeyota to be its guests I sought a leading hotel and busied myself with my newspaper article Tuesday late in the day we started for Fairview twelve miles beyond We passed many jolly sleighing parties some of whom stopped to chat with me and share with me refreshments and purchase my chromos and one sleigh load promised to entertain me royally at the hotel They kept their word and after refreshments and an hour s rest we resumed the journey in the light of the full moon arriving at Girard by nine thirty Next morning the village constable arrested my attention and persuaded me to act as auctioneer at a vendue by which deal I made some money I worded the hand bill as follows AUCTION SALE Monday February fifteenth eighteen ninety seven The farm of Jeremy Shimm its buildings live stock farming utensils and implements its crops and its woodland its weals and its woes including the following named articles and belongings will be sold under hammer this day at ten a m Barns and sheds and other stable articles pens and

weathercocks swine wine harrows wheel barrows bows and arrows stoves work horses sawhorses axles and axle grease axes cider carpets tables chairs wares trees bees cheese et cetera By orders of the TOWN CONSTABLE Hank Kilheffer Pythagoras Pod Auctioneer The dodgers were speedily printed and circulated in all directions sown broadcast as it were and it being a windy day they flew like scudding snow flakes over every farm for miles around A great throng assembled to witness the extraordinary event and to take advantage of bargains with the traveler auctioneer who mounted on a pile of wood with plug hat in hand yelled at the top of his voice and finally disposed of the rubbish The art of auctioneering seemed to come to me by inspiration and the enthusiastic farmers and towns people swarmed around me eager to secure a trophy of the notable sale Three superb harrows are now to be sold and will be sold if I have to buy them myself seventy two tooth thirty six tooth and false tooth harrows harrows with wisdom teeth eye teeth and grinders will grind up the soil and corn stubble in a harrowing manner and cultivate the acquaintance of the earth better than any other kinds made How much am I offered As I yelled I felt that I had strained my voice One dollar called a granger to set the ball rolling One dollar one dollar one dollar going one dollar gone one dollar to the bow legged gentleman over there with albino eyebrows THIS WAY SIR I shouted Constable please take his name and chain him to the wood pile In this manner it didn t take me long to dispose of the farm including the soil four thousand miles deep and the air forty five miles high I finished the ordeal by noon was paid my fee and then discourteously told that I had realized several hundred dollars less from the sale than the constable himself could have done Still every purchaser admitted he was more than satisfied with my generous conduct shook my hand bought a chromo and expressed the desire to meet me again And that was a thing that does not happen always in connection with vendues CHAPTER XII I do love these ancient ruins We never tread upon them but we set Our foot upon some reverend history Duchess of Malfy I did not tarry long in Girard but spent the night in West Springfield Thursday morning I escaped from the Keystone into the Buckeye State eating dinner in Conneaut As the sleighing had disappeared I shipped my little sled home as a relic of the trip and packed my grip in the saddle as of old After a short rest in Ashtabula we climbed a hill by the South Ridge road where I got a fine view of the city and soon lost ourselves in the darkness Presently a farmer drove up in a rickety wagon and began to coax me to accept of his hospitality for the night He deftly explained that he would care for me and my animals until after breakfast for fifty cents I decided to avail myself of the invitation and Mac congratulated me on my display of good sense I too slapped myself on the shoulder I was ready to sup and go right to bed In a short time both donk and dog were comfortably stabled and I was introduced to the family The noises from the lighted kitchen had faintly intimated to me the sort of den into which I was allured It contained the noisiest lot of children that ever blessed a household Are these all yours I inquired politely Nope answered mister Cornbin Ye see this ere s sort of a half way house the man smiled and poked some cheap tobacco into his corn cob pipe There s goin to be a dance down to Plimton s to night and all our friends from around ve fetched in their babies for George Buck he s our hired man to take care of Like to dance eh Better go long fine women going ter be there here s plug if ye want a chew no That s smokin terbaccer on the table by yer We re plain folks but you re welcome to the best we ve got missus C prepared me a supper which went right to the spot She advised me to go to the dance by all means I had made up my mind to that as soon as the word dance was mentioned the kids would have driven me crazy in short order had I remained with Buck One by one the mothers of the hilarious brats came in then we all got our wraps on I expected of course we were going to ride but no the whole party walked My hostess took her own babe with her She would leave the hired man in charge of her neighbors children but was too wise to entrust her own child with him and the lamp When we reached our destination I was introduced to four grangers playing seven up and told to make myself comfortable Choose your woman Professor said mister Cornbin an show em how you kin manage yer feet on a waxed floor Sure enough the floor was waxed The garret was converted into a veritable ball room Two rows of upright scantling crossed in the center of the room and propped the snow laden roof and through these uprights some twenty inches apart glided the blue jeans and overalls calico and cambric skirts with as much energy and pride as might be squeezed out of a city cotillion The fiddlers and caller were mounted on a board platform at one end of the hall They sawed away and shouted and wore out more enthusiasm catgut and shoe leather than I ever saw wasted in the same length of time There were all sorts of dances and dancers I myself tackled the Virginia reel Lancers Quadrille Caledonia Polka Hornpipe Mazourka a Spanish dance the Irish Washwoman and several others The favorite music was Pussy in the Rainbarrel it served for a half dozen different dances I never liked the music a sort of windpipe or bagpipe which allowed no breathing spell from start to finish In my second dance I went off my feet my head caught under the sloping roof and the floor master had to knock my pins from under me to get me loose There was one pretty girl there and I tried to engage her for a dance but every time I approached her she shied away at last she got used to my odd appearance and allowed me to clasp her to my bosom in a waltz Just as we got started the dance closed and the caller shouted to choose partners for a square dance My pretty partner agreed to dance it with me I could see several of her admirers looking daggers at me Forward right and left sounded the call Lead yer partners round the outside I thought the caller meant the outside of the house and started down stairs but was soon stopped and the call explained to me Alaman left grand right and left half way and back change partners and four ladies salute balance again and swing the opposite lady That succession of calls completely demoralized me I got all mixed up and soon found myself clasping an upright instead of somebody s partner and concluded my part by violently sitting on the floor After that I contented myself with looking on Although the two prettiest features of the ball the Minuette and the saint Vitus Dance had not yet taken place I felt more than satisfied and bidding my friends good morning set out for the Cornbin domicile After a late breakfast of tea bread salt pork and fried potatoes I started for Geneva All through New York State people had supposed on seeing me that Uncle Tom s Cabin had busted and that Marks the lawyer was homeward bound with his mule In Ohio the curious countrymen inquired if I was on my way to join Maine s Circus at its winter quarters Geneva Mac as well as I was quite sensitive over these inquiries Through the driving snow storm we managed to reach a hotel where after a noon meal I led my animals on to Madison When a half mile yet to the village we passed the Old Woman s Home which I visited the following morning Sunday The man who planned it was a genius The rooms of the commodious building were fitted up to suit the whims of the most fastidious fossils of second childhood Paintings and plaster bas reliefs of old women knitting washing false teeth and sewing decorated the walls Sewing baskets crazy quilts dolls and paper soldiers were strewn about the rooms The most novel of all departments was the dental and hirsute Check Room where the old ladies checked their false teeth wigs cork legs et cetera when they happened in disuse A little brass ring containing a number is given the owner of the article to be checked so that it may be preserved in good condition and not get lost Incidents are cited where very old women during intervals of temporary aberration have got their checks mixed and tried to wear an extra set of teeth or an additional wig and it is said that once a woman with two normal legs endeavored to hook on a cork leg But when we consider the great age of the inmates such cases are quite pardonable From the next town Painesville we went to the home of President Garfield mister R who had the care of the handsome residence invited me in to rest and sup I was shown all of the beautiful and interesting rooms In the spacious hall hung a large photograph of Milan Cathedral and in the upstairs hall a portrait of Washington and an engraving of Lincoln In the General s favorite study I was permitted to sit in the large easy chairs where he had found comfort after his mental labors and inspiration for his speeches and debates and regarded the bric a brac and furniture with more awe and reverence than I had ever felt upon visiting the homes of the great Two miles beyond Mentor is Kirtland once a thriving Mormon camp It is situated at considerable distance from the direct route to Cleveland and it took us over a distressingly muddy road and through such intense darkness that I soon lost my bearings Seeing the gleam of a lamp in a window I went up to the house to inquire the way to the tavern The owner insisted on our being his guests and I felt very grateful My animals were assigned to a shed and I was invited to a hot supper which my good hostess hastily prepared I soon discovered that I was among spiritualists as well as Latter Day Saints My Host mister J was an elderly man and well informed He said much about Joseph Smith He himself was born in Kirtland some eighty years back and had often listened to the preachings of the founder of Mormonism In those days Kirtland contained about two thousand inhabitants but all that remained of the town are two stores a shop and a dozen or so little houses half of which I found to be occupied by itinerant preachers of the Latter Day Saints My host said he firmly believed in Spiritualism and dwelt at length on communication between the material and spiritual world Finally he strode to my chair and felt of my cranium Why Prof said he enthusiastically you are a medium yourself All you require is a little study of the science Spiritualism is merely the science of materialism I shivered audibly And do you mean to tell me I said that you believe honestly you can see the ghost or the spirit of the departed I know it mister J returned emphatically I have FELT the spirit of the departed One night at a seance I saw my little step daughter who had been dead many years I heard her call to me papa She put her arms round my neck and kissed me on the lips Then she disappeared Of course I know it I saw her I heard her I felt her isn t that proof enough I told my host that he was certainly convinced but I wasn t I then bade him and his wife good night and was ushered to my chamber There I pulled the clothes over my head and tried to attribute my shivers to the cold When I awoke next morning and searched in my grip for my razor and found in place of it a Toledo Blade I began to suspect some supernatural being had robbed me Before leaving Kirtland my host persuaded me to be shown the famous Temple and the house in which the Prophet Joseph Smith lived The Temple of the Latter Day Saints there standing is probably the only church of three stories in the country I climbed to the tower that surmounts it and got a fine view of the spot where once stood the house of Brigham Young The arrangement of the inner temple was quite novel At both extremities of the main hall or nave was a series of four rows of white painted seats lettered in gilt to represent the several orders of the Priests of Melchizedek Long rows of rings hung from the ceiling crossing each other in places from which were once suspended curtains to divide the nave into rooms for the sessions of the different orders and in the white square pillars might still be seen the rollers and pulleys with which the curtains were drawn Said mister J I have heard Joseph Smith shout from that pulpit and tell how the Mormons would yet build a temple still larger to answer their future needs and some day in the future another one a mile square that they were the chosen people and would send missionaries to convert all Europe after which they proposed to sweep in America to a man Soon after that proclamation he moved West with a large following There they reorganized and the new order assumed the title of The Latter Day Saints Traveling that day was most disheartening in more ways than one The roads were awful my exchequer extremely low Fortunately on the way to Willoughby a farmer offered to feed me and my partner provided we would help him saw some wood Mac supervised the work After we sawed off a section of a log the farmer handed me the axe but soon took it from me saying that I couldn t chop any better than

8098_278252_000022_000001	train-clean-100	I have tramped nearly twenty miles without stopping to warm or eat and I resolved to let the next fellow have the same dose I have been taking half hourly all day

8098_278252_000026_000001	train-clean-100	In front of two hotels a block apart stood their proprietors waving hats and arms and calling to me to be their guest 
8098_278252_000026_000002	train-clean-100	I was puzzled to know which invitation to accept 
8098_278252_000026_000003	train-clean-100	While deliberating one of the landlords approached and taking my arm led me to his comfortable hostelry where he royally entertained me and my animals 
8098_278252_000027_000000	train-clean-100	The pageant that celebrated the departure of William McKinley to the seat of Government was a fair estimate of the regard in which his fellow citizens held him

8098_278252_000027_000002	train-clean-100	I witnessed the leave taking at his house his ride to the train in the coach drawn by four greys under escort of a band and heard him deliver his farewell address from the rear platform of his private car

8098_278252_000029_000001	train-clean-100	I saw a meadow lark on the first of March this day I heard blue birds and robins singing gaily 
8098_278252_000029_000002	train-clean-100	It looked as though spring had come to stay 
8098_278252_000030_000000	train-clean-100	I expected that day to reach Dalton only eight miles distant but the mud prevented me 
8098_278252_000030_000001	train-clean-100	I put my foot in it the genuine red and yellow mixture of real Ohio clay 
8098_278252_000030_000002	train-clean-100	It was so deep and sticky and liberally diluted with thawed frost that once I was compelled to crawl along the top of a rail fence two hundred feet and more and drag my jackass 
8098_278252_000030_000003	train-clean-100	At dusk I had covered only three miles 
none	none	Then I sought lodgings 
8098_278252_000030_000005	train-clean-100	A store loomed into view shortly I was elated According to the sign over the entrance the younger generation was the ruling power 
none	none	It read Hezekiah Brimley and Father I made for Hez 
8098_278252_000030_000007	train-clean-100	He said the town hadn t reached the hotel stage of development yet but that he would gladly take me in provided I d sleep with his clerk in the garret 
8098_278252_000031_000000	train-clean-100	I found the store full of loungers who patronized the chairs soap and starch boxes mackerel kits and counter forming a silent circle round a towering stove in the center 
8098_278252_000031_000001	train-clean-100	The village treasurer wore a boiled shirt and brass collar buttons but no collar or coat 
none	none	His companions were generally attired in flannel shirts of different hues and patterns plush caps which might be formed into several shapes and styles and felt boots encased in heavy overshoes 
8098_278252_000031_000003	train-clean-100	These rural men eyed me with suspicion until I mentioned Mac A Rony 
8098_278252_000031_000004	train-clean-100	Then there was a rush to the door 
8098_278252_000031_000005	train-clean-100	As it swung open in leaped my great dog at once the crowd surged back to the stove 
none	none	Does yer dorg bite came several queries in a bunch
8098_278252_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 No I said

8098_278252_000033_000002	train-clean-100	But he doesn t bite 
none	none	My statement had a sensational effect on the assembly who one by one sneaked out of the door leaving Hez and his odd guest alone As soon as the junior member Hez s father came in Hez took my animals to the shed and fed them and told me to help myself to the best in the store Ye know what ye want I don t Hez said he was sorry he was just out of butter and bread 
8098_278252_000035_000001	train-clean-100	I was sorry too 
none	none	Wishing a light supper I selected one yeast cake warranted one hundred four per cent 
8098_278252_000035_000003	train-clean-100	pure a pint of corned oysters light weight some crackers and leaf lard to take the place of butter and a cake of bitter chocolate 
8098_278252_000035_000004	train-clean-100	I left a few things unmolested such as soap cornstarch cloves baking powder and stove polish 
8098_278252_000036_000000	train-clean-100	My assorted supper went down all right until I tackled the chocolate 
8098_278252_000036_000001	train-clean-100	Chocolate is a favorite beverage of mine besides I wanted a hot drink 
none	none	To be good chocolate must be well dissolved No pot was to be had save a flower pot with a hole in the bottom A great idea popped into my head I would drink chocolate on the instalment plan Did you ever try it 
8098_278252_000036_000005	train-clean-100	If not don t let your curiosity get the better of you 
none	none	Chocolate belongs to the bean family and the bean is a very treacherous thing chocolate bean castor oil bean pork bean and all kinds 
8098_278252_000037_000001	train-clean-100	I first ate the cake of chocolate then some sugar and drank two dippersful of hot water then shook myself 
8098_278252_000037_000002	train-clean-100	That mixture might suit my stomach I thought but it doesn t delight my palate 
none	none	I felt I had eaten a heavy meal unwittingly and sat down to digest it I hadn t sat long before I felt myself swelling 
8098_278252_000037_000005	train-clean-100	Something within was sizzling and brewing and steaming gas and steam choked me 
none	none	I was sure there was going to be a demonstration in my honor that I had not bargained for 
8098_278252_000037_000007	train-clean-100	The yeast cake came to mind then I knew the cause 
none	none	My body grew warm and finally I was so hot that I had to go to the garret and take a cold bath after which I excused myself to the clerk and went to bed and dreamed I was being cremated alive Next morning on invitation of the superintendent I visited the Pocock Coal Mine situated close by and had an enjoyable trip through its subterranean passages CHAPTER XIV This day Dame Nature seemed in love The lusty sap began to move Fresh juice did stir th embracing Vines And birds had drawn their Valentines The Complete Angler 
8388_278289_000015_000000	train-clean-360	It was noon 
none	none	when I started for Dalton three miles away and night before we arrived there The mud oozed into my overshoes and I made Mac carry me and my grip I delivered a lecture whose receipts about defrayed my expenses and was presented a pair of rubber boots by a man frank enough to admit the boots didn t fit him We spent the Sabbath in Wooster While strolling down its main street with my dog I suddenly came upon a captive coyote which defied Don who ran off in a fright That monster canine fell considerably in my estimation I wondered what he would do when our camps on the plains were surrounded with a hundred of these yelping beasts Wooster rather a pretty town is the seat of a university The word seat reminds me that I needed a pair of trousers The rainy season had set in and I wanted a reserve pair Otherwise when my only pair got soaked I must go to bed until they dried I walked into a Jewish clothier s and selecting a pair of corduroys inquired How much Two dollahs ond a hollaf said the merchant He informed me that in Mansfield the same pants would cost three dollars in Fort Wayne five dollars in Chicago seven dollars et cetera I said that according to his way of reckoning I could have purchased the same kind of trousers in Dalton for two dollars in Massillon for one dollar and in Canton for a song My argument staggered him but he soon recovered and showed me a great colored picture representing a pair of corduroys one leg chained to an elephant the other hooked to a locomotive and both powers working in opposite directions to part those wonderful trousers Just vot you vant vor riding a jockoss can t bull abart vy my dear sir it s a bargain That was a strong argument I bought the pants Passing on through Jeromeville and Mifflin we reached Mansfield the home of Senator Sherman and sixteen miles beyond Galion That lovely spring day with the birds chirping merrily in the trees my pilgrimage seemed unusually irksome Next day was my birthday and I resolved to make it a holiday I enjoyed a day of recreation so did my donkey and dog and in the evening delivered a lecture on my travels before a campaign league at its club house On Friday morning I started for the town of Marion twenty six miles away Many citizens of Galion assembled to see us off Mac and Don were impatient for the journey and amused the crowd by pulling each other s whiskers I had boasted of having trained Mac A Rony to follow me When I set out with a wave of my hat and a beckon to my partner he responded promptly and for some distance verified my boasts He never before had acted so tractable Suddenly a cheer sounded in the distance and turning I beheld that asinine rascal making back to town on a hop skip and jump How the crowd did yell It was a circus for them Mac certainly had rested too long and eaten too many oats The only time I got ahead of him was when I photographed him I did not upbraid him but when I readjusted my scattered belongings and whirled the whip over his head he moved forward with utmost humility At Caledonia I took advantage of the farmers market day and sold a large number of photos at a good price I could not appear anywhere on the street without some rural stranger stopping me to shake hands and purchase a chromo Saturday evening I lectured to a crowded house It was four thirty P M Sunday before I started to Kenton twenty seven miles beyond When nearly there I passed a small farm whose rural incumbent came to the fence to question me Goin ter show to night he inquired Nope I answered and kept Mac A Rony moving Hold a minute Be ye travelin er goin somewhere the man persisted as he leaned over the fence rail He interested me When you see people walking I returned bringing my donkey to halt you can take it for granted they are going somewhere The lonesome looking farmer was the first I had met who was neither busy at work nor whittling Gray locks fell wantonly over his ears His faded coat blue overalls and felt boots exhibited signs of a persistent conflict with farm implements hooking cows kicking horses and a rich clayey soil A cow and two hogs eyed my donkey and dog with contempt through the bars of the barnyard fence I observed that all the buildings including the house were of logs The man judging from his property didn t have a dollar in the world but had great expectations He asked if I had any books to sell I had one a copy of a volume I had published several of which I had sold on my journey at a good price I had lost fifteen valuable minutes talking with the man and resolved to get even While wondering what I could take in exchange for the book a hen cackled Certainly I have a book to sell I said How much is it Dollar and a half I d buy it said the farmer longingly but I hain t got the price Have you got any eggs I asked Dozens of em How many kin ye suck at a sittin I don t wish to suck them I want them to sell I replied How much do you ask a dozen Six cents he answered Well I said I will trade the book for ten dozen Is that a bargain It looks like a cinch for you I meant a book about yer travels t San Francisco he explained as he looked far away Well that s just what it is I returned bound to make a sale or die in the attempt Tells all about them how robbers shot at me in York State bull chased me down a well in Pennsylvania dog worried me up a tree in Illinois cowboys rescued me from Indians in the Rocky Mountains grizzly bear hugged Whew ejaculated the man Thet s what I want Ye got yer book aout purty soon Wait till I go and fetch th eggs And the apparently ignorant man disappeared soon to re appear with a paper sack full of hen fruit Fresh I inquired as I tied the fragile bundle to the saddle horn Couldn t be fresher was the positive answer Some laid terday some yisterday but most on em ter morrer Then observing my arched brows he added Yaas yer thunk I was a know nuthin and I let yer think so cause yer need couragement And I say agin most on em was laid ter morrer and th best on em is rooster eggs I delivered the book feeling the farmer had somewhat the better of me after all and came to the conclusion that because a man looks primitive and lives in primitive style he is not necessarily of primitive intellect Mac joined in a pleasant adieu to mister Bosh and we sauntered on I behind deeply absorbed in thought We hadn t proceeded a half mile however before Mac shied at a bunch of hay and ran plumb against a rail fence in a jiffy that jackass looked like an egg nog There is no word coined to express my eggs ass peration When I caught the scapegrace it required a half hour to make him and the saddle look the least respectable I stopped at the next farm house where a windmill supplied me with the water to wash the outfit and I signed a pledge never to have anything to do with shell games of any kind They always get the better of you CHAPTER XV Every one who has petted a favorite donkey will remember many traits of its mental capacities for as in the case of the domestic fool there is far more knavery than folly about the creature Wood s Natural History It was a sunny spring day when I arrived in Kenton After supper with a young physician on his invitation I retired and next day set out for Ada a village sixteen miles away Toward evening being tired and almost without funds I sat down to converse with a farmer who was husking corn He soon became interested in my trip and said if I would help him husk awhile he would feed me and my animals I gladly consented Mac A Rony and Don lent their assistance the donkey soon losing his appetite After a delicious supper with the farmer s family I hastened on reaching Ada long after dark Ada is the seat of a Normal School which is the seat of a large number of other seats Everybody seemed to be much concerned about the great fistic bout to take place in Carson City that day the seventeenth of March It was saint Patrick s Day in the morning with the weather threatening when I started for Lima My coat was decorated with cabbage and lettuce leaves and paper imitations of shamrock and I looked like an animated vegetable garden Finally it rained and the road became a mire I had just finished a heated argument on the Carson fight and began to question the story of how saint Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland when I suddenly found myself on the ground And I saw the streak of daylight Mac threatened to kick into my brain An old man tried to drive a colt past my strange looking outfit I called to him to hold his horse by the bit until I could lead my donkey into the field But no he could handle the colt or any other horse and I should mind my own business On the rig came a few yards nearer when in the twinkling of an eye the colt whirled and upset the buggy with its boastful driver The man was not hurt but somewhat dazed Several farmers soon arrived and were loud in their abuse saying Mac and I had no right on the highway It was an effort for the donkey to keep his mouth shut I replied civilly that I was sorry the thing occurred and explained how I had warned the stranger Then I whipped up my unjustly abused partner and left the old man pulling his beard thoughtfully in the midst of the sympathetic group All day I strode far in advance of my donkey and led untrained untamed and frightened horses past Next day being stormy I devoted the morning to writing my newspaper article and answering some urgent letters then failing to arrange for a lecture I left Lima for Delphos and tramped fifteen miles in mud and rain without lunch We spent Saturday night in Van Wert and Sunday afternoon resumed the journey in sunshine people crowding their front windows and doorways to see us leave town We had not proceeded far when I met an odd trio who had run half a mile across lots to speak to me One boy had a twisted foot another a hand minus five or six fingers and the third acknowledged that as soon as he caught sight of us he lost his head Considering their crippled condition I thought they deserved credit for such activity It was eight miles to Convoy There was no bottom to the road Seeking a footing along the fence I ground innumerable land crabs into the mud while the peepers in the swampy clearings piped their dismal music At dusk we waded into the village where a curious throng awaited the sensation of the day And there we spent the night The nearer I approached the Indiana border the more impoverished appeared the farms and their struggling proprietors Every other farm house was the primitive log cabin and the barns and outbuildings generally tallied with the house A thunderstorm awoke me at day break the prospect for my day s tramp was most dismal After walking six miles I stopped to talk with a party of gypsies in camp Presently a black eyed gypsy girl issued from a heap of bedding under a tree and inquired if Mac A Rony was an ostrich Her heavy jet black hair fell in a mass over her shoulders and her sparkling eyes did their level best to enchant me as she asked to tell my fortune How much I asked Her grizzled sire said fifty cents the daughter corrected him saying one dollar That was too steep for me I gave Mac the rein and proceeded some distance when the girl called to me Twenty five cents Come back This was an alluring proposition and I returned At once dismissing the bystanders she reached over the fence for my hand told me to place a quarter in it then to close and open it I no sooner obeyed than the coin disappeared and the gypsy began in a charming manner as follows That line shows you will live to a good old age You are to enjoy your best days in the future Understand me If your pocket was as big as your heart you would make many others happy Understand me She surely must mean creditors I thought Yes I answered Shows it in your face said she You have for a long time disliked your business that was no lie and want to change it Understand me You make friends easily and wherever you go you are invited to come again Understand me I nodded Shows it in your face I began to think she was reading my countenance instead of my hand Are you married she asked No but want to be I replied Shows it in your face said she A widow lady is in love with you She has written you and you will get her letter soon Her name is Sarah Understand me I do not said I I know but one woman named Sarah Heaven help me if she is after me Shut your hand now and make a wish said the girl I did as she bade and wished long and hard Now open said she Her black eyes seemed to pierce my very soul You wish to make fame and fortune Understand me True I do I said to her that s just what every man wishes I said to myself Then she continued You will make fame and fortune in the business you are now in Shows it in your face I wasn t satisfied with that prediction I preferred the fortune to be in my pocket A kiss is awaiting you from a black haired girl within two weeks time She loves you A lot of girls want you but they can t have you Understand me I confess that I don t quite I answered But I wish those poor girls did And I looked real serious Shows it in your face she repeated That fortune teller puzzled me The quarter s worth of seance at an end I plodded on toward the Hoosier country with my mute comrades wondering how much of the fortune would come true Soon afterward we got out of the mud area and came to a hard smooth broken stone road I stopped my donkey and sat down to take off my rubber boots Just when I got the first shoe on Mac began to move down the level turnpike I called Whoa Mac Huh You long eared Mephisto The jackass paid no heed but galloped on shaking his head and kicking up his heels merrily with the dog in front of him barking as if he enjoyed Mac s practical joke By this time I was speeding after the runaway a boot on one foot a shoe on the other and chased a half mile before I caught him Then I led him back for my footgear Two miles beyond we again struck mud thick and deep Observing a little mound covered with long dried grass I sat down again to change my footgear Mac turned and eyed me mischievously and wobbled his ears then nodded to Don I was so absorbed with the idea that he intended to lead me another chase that I failed to hear an ominous sound emanating from underneath my seat Not until something seemed to burn me did I rise to the occasion and light out this time stocking foot but making less speed through the black and sticky highway than on my former run Something less than a million bees swarmed about my head I ran Oh how I ran And I would be running still perhaps had not a farmer seen me and knocked down the swarm with a section of a rail fence I was quite out of breath The hero had only spared my life for future tortures Illustration I scrutinized his hat inquisitively After considerable search I found boots and shoes but failed to see either dog or donkey Putting on my boots I hung my shoes on the fence and set out on the trail of the fugitives which appeared to have gone into the brush I waded into the thicket calling Don all the time and at last was rewarded He leaped at me delightedly and barked and tugged at my trouser legs and piloted me to the terrified donkey which I found tangled in a mass of wild raspberry bushes his head tucked between his forelegs and his back doubled up like a cat at bay There were no bees on Mac That was a hot experience for a raw March day I plodded on through the mire to the house whose proprietor had come to my rescue The dooryard was filled with hives Regular bee ranch I remarked pleasantly though I burned uncomfortably Yas Right smart business the man returned You re right bees do a smart business Lived on em nigh ten years You must find them a hot diet I said I lived on a nest of them less than half a minute and nearly burned up I reckon so he replied with a chuckle I saw yer scorchin It was two thirty P M when we crossed the state line The first sight that greeted my eyes in Indiana was a flock of Ohio geese just ahead of us being driven by a hoosier Fine drove of geese you ve got there I said to the man Yaw he answered But Ohio geese is peculiar Gooses won t run with th ganders No I queried What s the reason they won t Wall jest th way they s built Won t run jest fly er waddle What most all geese do don t they I asked much amused Yaw reiterated the hoosier grinning jest fly or waddle CHAPTER XVI Get money still get money boy no matter by what means Ben Jonson Indiana swamps woodland corn fields and log cabins were not unlike those of Ohio On arriving in New Haven two hours after dark I was quite tired out and I think my companions were too We had tramped all day without dinner over a road alternately hard and muddy I would have stopped to rest at a small place called Zulu but the name sounded so cannibalistic that I looked to my firearms and hurried past Next day I registered in Fort Wayne After calling on the genial Mayor I set out to inspect the city and see what my chances were for I found the outlook for my delivering a lecture discouraging and although for several days I had barely made expenses did not attempt money making there Fort Wayne is notable for its great car shops and the Indiana School for the Feeble Minded In the morning I boarded a car and rode a mile and a half out of town to the latter The large building of brick and terra cotta viewed in its expansive setting of well groomed lawn and gay parterres presented a picture of architectural beauty The superintendent welcomed me cordially although it was not visitors day and graciously showed me through the interesting institution Its neatness the clock work regularity with which the several departments are conducted and the great variety and detail of the mode of instruction given the five hundred fifty idiotic inmates were a revelation to me Many of the advanced scholars were making and mending their clothes and bedding something I couldn t do I fear The idiots are carefully attended day and night Never before did I see a natural born bald headed person Here was one a funny looking girl and I was told she had several brothers sisters parents uncles and aunts all bald from birth a distinguished family indeed I wondered whether her disappointment was as great as that of Pye Pod who once possessed a head of hair then lost it I have heard it said people who never had money know not its value and presume its so with their heirs For mortals deprived of reason the place is surprisingly quiet The halls are tiled the floors of the rooms are waxed and all are so slippery that the inmates are unable to romp which is probably the reason for such stillness Whenever they gain sense enough to be boisterous like sane and healthy children they instantly fall on their craniums on the polished floor and are rendered insensible I was interested in a group of little girls who were being taught a game One wee child with a big head bigger than I had ever been accredited with was sitting in an invalid s chair with her head resting in an iron prop because it was too heavy for one body to support in those hard times and seated around in ordinary chairs were epileptic paralytic cross grained idiots et cetera so far advanced toward health and sanity by careful training as to play a game While the great object of this school is to provide the unfortunates with a comfortable home and prevent intermarriage a few are graduated every year and transferred to the large farm owned by the institution I heard the Feeble Minded Brass Band play its music I thought quite equal to that of many normal bands I had heard The birthdays of great men excepting that of Pythagoras Pod are celebrated and birthday parties given The superintendent drove me back to town and urged me to fetch my donkey out to entertain the idiots and invited me to dine with him So not telling Mac about the place I rode him to the Home where I found my host and his assistants ready to receive us Shylock there will assist you said the superintendent pointing to a hump backed inmate When we got Mac to the hall entrance the circus began Two attendants helped Shylock boost the donkey while I guided his head and we managed to pitch the beast headlong into the slippery hall where he landed three times in succession first on his knees and heels second on his tail and third on his back I think he imagined he was on ice for he lay perfectly still afraid to move The hall floor was cleared but a bunch of idiotic heads stuck out of every doorway and peals of hyenish laughter reverberated through the building Finally we got Mac on all fours and I rode him slowly down the hall amid the hysterical shouts and screams of the physically strong if feeble minded children and talking yelling and commanding attendants all of which so frightened my sensitive mount that he squatted down on the floor rolled over on his side and brayed Did you ever hear an ass bray in any confined space It is awful These unmanageable pupils and their overtaxed preceptors fairly went mad while Mac yelled Hell is empty and all the devils are here The hall was now a swarming uncontrollable mass of unbridled lunacy in human mould romping tumbling fainting and taxing the united strength and strategy of the surprised officials to bring order out of chaos The jackass went into a veritable fit kicked the plaster off the walls shattered an incandescent light globe nearly rolled on top of an idiot who took him for a pussy cat and brayed himself hoarse Suddenly he leaped to his feet and ran akiting down the tiled hall floor until it turned then he tried to turn and flopping off his feet came down on his vertebrae As soon as we could get him out of doors I handed him over to Shylock and went into dinner with the laughing superintendent I never want another experience like that The disappointing feature about the show was that probably not one idiot would remember it over to the next day The following morning my party set out over a black muddy road Thrifty looking farm houses many of them of brick were scattered along our route and sheep and cattle basked in the sunshine on the south side of strawstacks often attracting wistful glances from my long eared partner Arriving at Churubusco I put up at a comfortable hotel near the railroad where the noisy passing trains kept me awake most of the night and resumed the journey next day after lunch Some four miles beyond the village we came to a new iron bridge without its approaches filled in No workmen were about A single two by twelve plank was stretched from the bank to the bridge at both ends to enable people to cross but evidently quadrupeds were supposed to ford or swim the stream I tarried some moments thinking what best to do when presently a countryman happened by and helped me carry a plank from the roadside to widen the bridge approach for my donkey to walk What an ass Mac was He attempted to walk the planks sideways and consequently fell into the deep miry hole almost into the stream I feared he had broken his back but he escaped injury The farmer helped me uncinch the saddle and get Mac up the steep bank on to the road then we transferred the plank at the other end of the bridge to that end and made a three plank foot bridge Finally we got Mac on to the bridge proper and by transferring the three planks to the other end I managed to overcome the obstacle and proceeded on the journey after the loss of two hours My hat had anticipated the animal into the hole and was flattened by his weight thereafter it supported a gable roof Two hours after dark we came to a barn that looked roomy and airy and as the next town beyond Wolf Lake was so far away I concluded we might as well take possession of it for the night The barn door wasn t locked so I led my animals in and struck a match No horses were visible but a box stall contained a cow and a calf Prowling about with lighted matches I discovered a buck sheep hiding behind his wool in fear of my big dog I found a measure of grain for Mac and assigned Don to a pile of hay near the door then tucked myself in some straw and drew my mackintosh over my shoulders prepared for a night s rest I was almost asleep when the calf bawled again when on the brink of Lethe the sheep bleated Suddenly my restless donkey kicked a board off the side of the barn and set Don to barking I yelled Shut up Again the dog barked The next second he made a leap in the dark followed by a loud commotion and at once the atmosphere indicated plainly what kind of an animal the dog was after I couldn t get out of the door without running the lines which seemed perilous indeed Mac kicked and brayed as he never had before and my dog was running round the barn trying to get away from the atmosphere or something And I was as busy as the rest endeavoring to bury myself in the straw Presently the dog and the buck sheep went to settling some misunderstanding fighting like demons The cow and calf then began to bellow in a discordant duet and fearing lest any moment the cow would break the bars of her stall and enter the general fray I dug all the harder in the straw All at once amid the obscured exciting scene and above the tumult I detected an agonizing groan and suspected Don was squeezing the life out of the sheep or the calf or the nuisance but when it was all over and I heard the victim gasping in its death throes it was plain that my dog had shaken all the strength out of our unwelcomed guest It was impossible for me to go asleep in that great airy barn I crawled out of the straw and got my donkey out of doors as quickly as possible As for Don I felt indifferent about his joining our company if he proposed to be familiar On over the deserted highway we groped our way the dog sneezing coughing and rolling by the roadside the half suffocated jackass breathing hard and braying faintly for more air and I soliloquizing vociferously about the existence of useless creatures The wind blowing head on I kept some distance ahead of Mac and threw mud and stones at the dog which now seemed particularly fond of his master and continued my tirade against such obnoxious things as we had lately run against Every creature has some redeeming virtue Mac A Rony remarked after a while Above all things don t belittle the skunk he s the best financier in the world He could go into the Stock Exchange and bull the market with one scent and all the members together couldn t bear it Mac was ever doling out to me unwelcome philosophy under trying circumstances We reached Ligonier a fine little town eleven miles away the next day in time for one o clock dinner Since entering Indiana I had not made expenses and my little reserve fund was vanishing I had been told that Ligonier was a moneyed town and its people liberal so I tried to secure a hall for a lecture but failing I spoke my piece in the street Fully two hundred persons assembled to hear me and encored enthusiastically I concluded with passing my hat and collecting thirty two cents I talked again three hours later on the same spot and was rewarded with a contribution of three cents I think that collection for a lecture is a record breaker Goshen was reached next day by five P M The Scripture speaks of Goshen as the land flowing with milk and honey but as I have been told I am somewhat rusty on Biblical history At any rate I looked forward to replenish my depleted exchequer here if I had to resort to extreme measures Before retiring I made up my mind I was going to be awfully disappointed with Goshen The people of the section of country I had threaded from the Ohio boundary were incredulous superstitious penurious and suspicious and those characteristics seemed to reach their superlative in that particular town Monday dawned still and sunny an ideal day for hanging out clothes but not shingles I hung out mine nevertheless it was essential to Mac s welfare and to mine to say nothing of the dog s A drummer showed deep interest in my pilgrimage and I asked him how he made out with his business I had failed signally He said he was glad I spoke to him on the subject and drew me aside See all the thrifty looking wagon teams hitched on the two sides of the Court House Square said he See those squads of grangers standing around waiting for something to turn up Well every stranger is looked upon with suspicion If he attempts to drum up a new business among these fossils he is immediately branded a fake After I had made two unsuccessful trips to this section I vowed I would make the third one a success A fake article sold by a first class imitation drummer would just about catch these people And ever since that day I have been unloading on them and reaping a big harvest Do you see the moral I said I did and thanked him After lunch during which I was accredited extremely thoughtful I drew my friend aside and whispered I have it I ll buy some axle grease and mix it with sweet oil and sell it for eye salve The drummer eyed me as he might a wonderful character felt of my head and said I d win out At once I went to a drug store for some pill boxes blank labels and perfume and to a hardware store for axle grease and sweet oil then retired to my hotel room and mixed my Eye Elixir As soon as my magic healing wares were ready to put on the market I hunted up a sore eyed tramp I had seen on the street that day and promising him a percentage of my receipts got him to assist me to get even with the folks he too had a grudge against When I was fairly started on my eloquent talk about the virtues of Eye Elixir the tramp walked up with the quarter I had given him and asked for another box saying to the crowd he d been looking for me all over the country and was glad to find me for his eyes being almost well from using the first box began to get worse when he had no more salve which was the only thing that ever helped his sore eyes He said if he could afford it he would lay in a lot of it for future use not knowing where he could get any more Then a boy stepped up and bought a box and an old woman bought two boxes and the sales proceeded so fast when once started that I soon sold out and took in seven dollars selling twenty seven boxes of Eye Elixir besides the box I had sold to the tramp I paid him one dollar for his services with which he was delighted This left me a net profit after deducting the cost of making the salve of four dollars ninety cents paying my expenses in town and leaving me a small balance Then I cleared out of Goshen as quickly as possible Oh Shakespeare how truthfully you said What fools these mortals be I resolved that when I should return East I would go by ship around the Horn or by train across the Isthmus or else choose a trans continental route which would give that section honied and milked by Pye Pod a wide berth CHAPTER XVII Yankee Doodle came to town Riding on a pony Stuck a feather in his cap And called him Mac A Rony Old Ballad A county poor house on the road to Elkhart attracted my notice when I was about to pass it by My outfit was recognized by a man raking the front lawn and he urged me to visit the institution so thinking I might devote a quarter hour to the cause of self education I tied Mac in the yard and was shown through the dirtiest and most uninteresting building I ever inspected Old lazy looking men with empty heads in full hands lounged about on benches and several others in the hospital ward seemed to be trying harder to die than to live One wrinkled but round faced wench with a soiled bandage round her ears and forehead was smoking a well seasoned pipe in the kitchen while stirring mush I was glad to see the house prison empty Five minutes indoors sufficed me and bidding my escort a hasty adieu I piloted Mac on to Elkhart Arriving in the city I at once procured a license to sell pictures on the curb a precaution I had been timely advised to take and one that was rarely necessary on that trip Then before going to eat and to rest my tired bones I led the donkey to a prominent corner in the business center and began to sell I had disposed of two photos only when a policeman with unusual pomposity ordered me away but I continued to make sales and as he was about to take me in custody shook my license in his face causing much merriment to the crowd Soon the cheering attracted the Mayor to the scene and he to my surprise not only bought a chromo but paid me for the privilege of riding Mac A Rony The jack reluctantly consenting his Honor got into the saddle and rode down the half choked thoroughfare a block and back amid thunderous applause The profits from my sales did not meet my expenses including the cost of license so I hurried on to Mishawaka where after supper I delivered a street lecture passed my hat and collected twenty four cents I would yet be stranded in Indiana at that rate Mac advised me to leave town at once and we made for South Bend at dark reaching that city by ten o clock And there with only six dollars fifty cents in pocket I put up at a small hotel and tossed in bed half the night wondering how I should save myself The darkest hour is just before dawn and it was about that time when I recollected having received a few days before my pilgrimage began a letter from a mister Adams of Chicago extending me an invitation to be his guest should I pass through that city It was one of many letters received at the time which I had not answered I now regretted my negligence but nevertheless next morning with due apologies I wired him to expect me on a certain train and planned for a week s absence The lenient hotel proprietor agreed to take care of my animals as security for my hotel and stable bill then I purchased a return ticket for emergency and boarded the train for the Windy City trusting to a dollar and a half to my wits and to luck to carry me through As I stepped off the train in Chicago a stranger grasped my hand and gave me a most cordial greeting Laying for me eh first man I meet a confidence man I muttered inwardly But he was extremely courteous and offered to carry my saddle bags No sir I said politely I ve carried them twelve hundred miles and can carry them three thousand more Pod is your name all right the stranger continued half in inquiry half in surprise I thought as we walked out of the railroad station You bet it is I said emphatically Just because you ve plenty of wind out here you needn t think it can blow away my name Well said he cheerfully Our wind is said to be the best brewed in all this country It may not be strong enough to blow away pods but I ll wager it can blow the pease out of em so far you never can find them The man s facetiousness interested me it bespoke his nerve Tell me Mister I said after walking several blocks where are you taking me anyhow Oh just three blocks more then we take a cable said my escort as he made another futile grab for my countryfied luggage When on the car this confidence man had the confidence to introduce me to a pal as the New York gentleman and scholar Professor Pye Pod who was surveying a trans continental turnpike from the observation platform of a jackass I want to know exclaimed bunco man number two and suddenly a new light affecting to dawn on his brain he added as if to disarm my suspicions I see I see I have it now You are the journalist I ve read about said to be well fixed first visit to Chicago Not much I returned Been here dozens of times Can t say I m well fixed though with only a dollar and a half to my name At this stage of the dialogue I saw a police station Come with me I said I want to procure a license Then we ll have a smile And to my utter surprise and gratification both men stepped off the car and followed me like faithful dogs into the police station Where s the Chief of Police I inquired of a man in uniform who stepped toward me Right here before you was the answer Well arrest these bunco steerers I said dropping my odd looking luggage and laying a hand on each man s shoulder I never saw greater astonishment and embarrassment than was expressed by these two confidence men at being so easily trapped by their Uncle Rube This man met me at the train when my depot came in I continued excitedly in lapsus linguae He knew my name business and previous condition of fortune and put me on a car where he introduced this pal of his and if I hadn t been forwarned against such fellows by my Uncle Hiram and caught on to the game I would have been robbed by this time and chucked into the sewer This was enough for the Chief He seized each man by the collar Instantly the first man found his tongue and tried to explain matters and finally did so to the satisfaction of all concerned But what a surprise party for Pye Pod Well well well I exclaimed my heart thumping like a pile driver as I realized my embarrassing predicament Who would have thought it mister Adams of course My dear sir how stupid of me I have wronged you and your friend unmercifully When I telegraphed you the Chief here loosened his hold on the men I never thought you would attempt to meet me at the train let alone have time to Your address of one hundred thirty one thousand six hundred nine Wellington avenue I supposed must be near to the State line Chicago has grown so Couldn t conceive how you could reach the depot before to morrow Of course it was up to me to treat So I left my saddle bags and going to a cigar store purchased a dime s worth of cheroots and did myself nobly by the chief and the confidence men whose faces were bloated and red on my return Then my forgiving host took me to his distant home where after dinner we enjoyed a smoke of his own cigars and a hearty laugh over my exceptional initiation to Chicago life While smoking and chatting my host happened to mention a big mass meeting to be held that evening at Lincoln Turner Hall The doors were to be opened at eight o clock It was now seven thirty At once I explained my financial stress and told him that the object of my advance trip by train was to try to make enough money to continue my donkey journey Adams suggested that that being the case we should attend the meeting by all means so we hurried off Arriving at the hall my host introduced me to an officer of the league who escorted us both to seats on the platform with a number of vice presidents and their wives and mothers in law After several orators had spoken among them being Carter Harrison soon to be elected Mayor of Chicago the chairman reminded the audience of Pythagoras Pod and his celebrated donkey Mac A Rony of whom they had read saying that the meeting was honored with the Professor s presence then he introduced me after having said I needed no introduction It was five minutes before I could hear myself speak and not being there for that purpose I didn t say much But my speech seemed to tickle the audience and when I had concluded the chairman suggested that my histrionic plug hat be passed around the hall on the inside so it was and do you believe it was returned to me with more wealth than I had possessed before at any one time on my pilgrimage The two days following were busy ones I contracted for the manufacture of a quantity of buttons containing the picture of Pye Pod on his donkey and arranged for the meeting with the manager of a large patent medicine concern on my return to the city with Mac A Rony Then after a day s rest I returned Sunday evening to South Bend Ind to find my donkey and dog well and delighted to see me but myself suffering for the first with malaria I had a severe chill on reaching the hotel and all night long I rolled and tossed with a fever This was doubtless the result of my evening travels through the swamps and lowlands of the Hoosier State At midnight I sent a bell boy for quinine and by feeding on the medicine liberally for several hours I broke up the fever by morning but still my bones ached I had no appetite and was in no form to travel At noon I forced down a little soup paid my bills and set out for New Carlisle walking the whole distance fourteen miles by sunset Mac was so slow that his shadow beat him to town My muscles and joints still ached and I passed another sleepless night Next day I pushed on to La Porte fourteen miles further and went to bed feeling a wreck But as the chills and fever failed to return I enjoyed sleep My Chicago trip was a boon to me I gave no thought to money making for the present Wednesday morning feeling in better spirits I started for Valparaiso and covered the twenty two miles on foot by dark and relished a hearty supper Thus far the week had been cold and damp and cloudy The roads where they were not muddy were very sandy and Mac and I made slow headway The following night was spent in Hobart where I was entertained at an amusing though distressing cock fight and all day Friday I tramped or waded in sand six inches deep to the next town Hammond where I passed a restless night in spite of my now restored health In the morning I learned that the state line runs not only through the town but also the very house and bedroom I occupied My bed was directly on the line and somehow any position I got in brought that line across some part of my body Dull monotony and bad weather distinguished the next day s journey a rainstorm met us half way to Chicago and wet us all the way But on Palm Sunday we progressed under more genial skies I observed many pacific law abiding people with prayer books bottles and shot guns either on their way to church to a fishing stream or to the woods and we came upon a tandem bicycle party the machine broken down the young man and woman apparently broken up She sat on a stone against a telegraph pole with chin in her hands watching the gallant fellow who was at her feet on his knee caps with a monkey wrench in his hands trying to repair damages From South Chicago we passed into Stony Island Boulevard and the Midway Plaisance of the World s Fair of ninety three The remaining Art building arched its brows at my curious outfit and an endless chain of bicycles and carriages conveyed past us an inquisitive and gaping multitude many of whom altered their plans to follow us into the city proper It was six o clock when we reached Thirty fourth street and I found a suitable stable for my animals Then affectionately patting Don s head and rubbing Mac s nose I left them and sauntered up the avenue heaving a sigh of infinite relief over my hard earned triumph As I trended the streets of that wide awake metropolis toward its business center I was stopped many times by truant messenger boys and idle street gamins who seemed surprisingly solicitous about the physical condition of my hat Mister this way to a hat store If you want to buy a new hat I ll take you to a hatter This way Mister I know a place to get a hat cheap Say Mister I kin get yer a hat fer nothin Why should I wish a new hat I asked myself indignantly True mine had seen better days but it was worth more to me now than a hundred new hats Yes yes you dear old weather beaten tile I apostrophized as I strode on with a deaf ear to my inquisitors you are of royal stuff for you have triumphed over many wars and dissensions and still wear a crown The plebeian hats who calumniate you although fresh from a band box are common compared with you they are jealous of your exploits and envy you your faithful friend Vividly do I recall our desperate encounters with the mad bull the hailstorms and other warring elements and that winter s night when you forgot your personal safety and made a noble self sacrifice by receiving the assailant s bullet intended for me and again the day the awkward jackass tried to yank me off the plank foot bridge underneath him in his fall when you threw your own lean frame down on to the bank in place of me and received the weight which would have mashed me to death but which only squeezed the wind out of you Why do all the idle clerks gaze at you so longingly from the shop windows Because they covet you as a drawing card to disdaining shoppers I am proud of you Rest in peace I spent the night with friend Adams on his invitation Monday morning I kept my appointment with the patent medicine man He received me cordially evidently aware of the boon I might be to his business should I enter his employ and in order that he might better discuss my proposition and its possibilities he invited me some miles into the country for a couple of days outing at a mineral spring resort A stylish coach and four met us at the train and wheeled us over a pretty rolling country in the glow of the setting sun to the cozy hotel sanitarium which was brilliantly illuminated and whose doors were open to welcome us And in less than twenty minutes Pod made of his Apollo form a companion piece to Diana Bathing The water then sold at fifty cents a gallon and there were two hundred gallons in my tub Think of it I had read about beautiful actresses and heiresses taking milk baths and champagne baths and Rochelle salts baths but that one hundred dollars bath of mine in pure lithia water would have put all those pretty bathing women to the blush But when in my enthusiasm I so told my generous host he spoiled all my beautiful delusions at once by saying quite mechanically Oh two hundred gallons for a bath is nothing unusual it s only the overflow Next morning he asked me if I would like a magno mud bath Sir I interrogated gravely If you had dragged and pushed and carried a stubborn cantankerous donkey through four hundred miles of red and yellow Ohio mud and two hundred miles of blue and black Indiana mud not to mention some six hundred miles of New York and Pennsylvania mud of various hues and conditions the overflows of December January and February if you had bathed in mud waded in mud soaked in mud and cursed in mud for nearly five months and I were to put such a delicate question to you your sensibilities would be shocked your nerves paralyzed your reason ossified My host apologized and withdrew the invitation then with great wisdom and forethought he introduced me to the physician doctor Tanner the highest authority on fasting and renowned for his having fasted forty days I considered this the luckiest meeting of my whole journey He took quite a fancy to me and gave me valuable instructions and prescriptions for fasting any period from one to forty days but I was disappointed not to be enlightened on how to go several days without water That morning my host made me a liberal proposition to advertise his medicines he guaranteeing to pay me a regular weekly stipend during the remainder of my pilgrimage to the Golden Gate and free of all charges to provide me with all the photographs of my asinine outfit that I could sell en route I signed the contract Then we returned to Chicago CHAPTER XVIII The whole duty of man is to be a mother Jerome K Jerome One week of gamboling in sporty wide awake Chicago and of high life on the top floor of the Auditorium put me in fine fettle to resume travel My second morning at the popular hotel I indited this note to an Eastern friend Breakfasted to day on the roof got a shine in the cellar and met everybody half way For nearly five months through severe winter and early spring weather I had hustled as I never had before to make ends meet now I had swum the Hellespont to a prosperous shore the remainder of my long slow journey looked more enticing Several valuable and useful articles were presented to me by wealthy admirers in the Windy City who also dined me took me to the theatre and entertained me in other ways One evening I was pleasantly surprised to be escorted to a champagne dinner given by my friend Williams of the Union News Company of New York to several prominent business men of the West When the sumptuous repast was well under way he unpinned from the lapel of my coat a button containing a photo of Pod seated on Mac and paid me a five dollar bill for it and learning I had a stock of buttons in pocket the other guests followed suit Such wholesale generosity was as overwhelming as my gratitude The man with whom I contracted to advertise gave me a donkey which I named Cheese to go with Mac A Rony And so delighted was Mac with this new comrade to share his burdens that on my approval he agreed henceforth to contribute to the papers every other letter on our travels to the coast and so enable me to devote more time to bread winning Easter morning I found a blue hen s egg at my plate I was pleased with the remembrance and had the clerk place it in my letter box When I called at noon for my mail I was told the egg had visited most all of the letter boxes each guest in turn having disclaimed it so when at six o clock I called for the egg to take it to my room for safe keeping and was handed instead a parcel that smelled of chicken I was not surprised however upon opening it I could not conceal my astonishment mister Pod said the clerk gravely the egg was handled so much that it naturally hatched Certainly you are not surprised Not surprised that it hatched I returned to be reasonable but this is fried chicken and the egg was boiled My Easter dinner with friends on Champlain avenue made me realize somewhat the stupor a boa constrictor experiences after having swallowed an ox My friend Bob B urged me to make his home my transitory abode arguing that perhaps while at the hotel I was cheated of needed rest by yielding too much to entertainment by well meaning acquaintances He gave me a key to the house showed me my room and told me to drop in any time day or night and make myself at home Having promised to call on an elderly gentleman who had been very kind to me I spent that evening with his family Before leaving I had made great friends with his little granddaughter and promised to call again and bring her some candy I want circus candy the kind with rings around it she explained drawing imaginary circles round her finger When I reached my hotel the clerk said several gentlemen were waiting to see me I was sleepy besides I felt I had caught cold and should doctor it at once Explaining to the clerk that I was indisposed and begged to be excused to my callers I slipped out of the door and hurried to a drug store A good drink of calisaya will fix you said the drug clerk who explained it was well charged with quinine but failed to mention it was also well charged with alcohol I drank two glasses of it then boarded a car for Champlain avenue Before reaching my destination I fell asleep But the conductor was thoughtful enough to awaken me and assist me to alight I was so dizzy from sleepiness I couldn t walk straight I soon got my bearings though and reached Bob s house by experiencing sensations of treading a moving sidewalk promenading a steamer deck in a high sea and circumnavigating a crystal maze I found the door knob but not the key hole We had been having damp weather and I reasoned that perhaps the key hole had shrunk shut I searched my pockets for matches and found enough wooden toothpicks to kindle my wrath While I was fuming a policeman came to my relief Who be you young feller he interrogated Pyth hic thagoras Pod I answered civilly and offering him the key added Won t you open the hic door for me You don t live here then said the cop I know hic it I admitted Just visiting friends Are you sure you know where you are at he queried sternly Illustration He accused me of attempting suicide Illustration We made slow headway to the Mississippi No hic I m not sure I said feebly but I think I m on Champlain avenue More like champagne he returned sourly What s the number of the house I forget it I answered I know the house hic though when I see it I think you came here for business said the officer You better come with me And he locked his arm in mine Let me ring hic up the folks I pleaded They ll identify me The cop stopped hesitated and doubtlessly deeming prudence the better part of valor let When I took my thumb off the electric button the household must have thought Chicago burning again I heard Bob tumble half way down stairs and when he opened the door and identified me and saw me stagger in he took another tumble The third was taken by the disappointed cop who hurried off to his proper beat Conscious of my inebriated condition I was much embarrassed that my friend should find me in such a state at that late hour He asked me no questions and I told him no lies When he had assisted me to bed he turned out the gas which likely I should have blown out and left me to prayerful meditation My late propensity to sleep had vanished My brain was a whirling wilderness The more I thought about that temperance drink of calisaya the less respect I had for the principles of prohibition I scored temperance societies darned Salvation Armies and cursed the birth of Matthews who invented the soda fountain Before long I was in a sweat The red beverage was evidently breaking up my cold but that wasn t all It broke me up it had broken the slumbers of my host I was sure it had broken up my good reputation for sobriety I was too nervous to sleep Thinks I A hot bath will just fix me I ll get up and take one I rose and hunted for matches but couldn t find any Piece by piece I scraped several ornaments off the mantel to the floor one bronze Mozart statuette doing some effective work on my big toe that I had intended a chiropodist to do Next I fell over a center table and upset a glass vase on the floor which broke its neck then I tumbled over a rocker and wondered that I didn t break mine Still bent upon reaching the bath room I bent my nose against an opened closet door I was mad At last finding the exit of my chamber I groped my way into the hall then hesitated I thought I remembered the location of the bath room I was under the impression my bedroom was on the third floor In reaching for the balusters I almost lost my balance My head still whirling like a dancing Dervish Slowly and dizzily I felt my way down stairs until I came to a door the bath room door I supposed I opened it gently groped my way in and put my bare foot on a napkin ring which proceeded to roll away landing me flat on the floor Then the folding door swung to with a bang I feared my friends would think burglars were in the house But I found the tub all right I turned the faucets and was pleased to have both run cold water for I burned as with a fever But when I started to climb into the tub I found I had either grown shorter in stature or the tub had been raised Perhaps it was managed by automatic machinery I knew nothing about machinery so with great effort I climbed up and into the tub but found greater difficulty to get all of me in it I reasoned that the dimensions of the contracted bath tub must be all right but the expansions of my head were wrong I was intoxicated by a temperance drink and had heard that it was the worst kind to get tipsy on I made another heroic effort to jam my body into the tub but some of me would always lap over the edges I reasoned that if I were sober there would surely be room for three to swim comfortably about that bathtub Cold water ran from the faucets for some time and I was considerably cooled off when suddenly one faucet began to run hot water Instead of turning off the water in my excitement I tried to climb out of the tub but was wedged so tightly in it a hasty escape was impracticable and before I fell out on the floor my left leg was scalded There were no pillows where I dropped so the next moment the door swung open and the gleam of a lighted match shone in my face I saw my host with countenance as white as his nightshirt suddenly assume a rosy hue then I heard him giggle I was glad he saw some humor in it for I failed to In one hand he held an old army musket and I told him not to shoot Sitting on the floor I now saw plainly that it was the butler s pantry and not the bath room and that I had taken a bath in the sink Bob on gaining my room put some salve on my scald and wound my limb with the first handkerchief he came across and I was soon fast asleep Next morning I remembered my promise to buy some candy for my little friend and visited a confectioner It was a big store and three salesladies tried to wait upon me I wish the spiral striped peppermint kind of circus candy I explained It s for a little tot I am fond of I understand said the girl but we haven t it but wait a minute Before I realized what she meant she had dashed out the door presumably to the store two doors away I was sorry she took such trouble to please a poor patron Soon she reappeared with a crystal jar of the long stick candy I desired and dumping a pound of it on the scales inquired How much do you wish Oh one stick will do I said She s a delicate child I don t want to make her sick The girl almost dropped the jar Then recovering her mental equilibrium she asked while refilling the jar from the scales Will you take it with you or have it sent I blinked Take it with me I guess was my reply As she wrapped the stick of candy I reached in my pocket for the penny Then I felt weak I hadn t a cent I I I I declare I exclaimed I left all my money with the hotel clerk I ll be back directly And out I rushed into the street where there was more air By the time I got to the hotel and back I was willing to buy five pounds of candy I no sooner entered the store than the girl with a smothered smile said We sent the candy to the hotel Now I was embarrassed What hotel I inquired Why the Auditorium she giggled You re mister Pye Pod aren t you The proprietor said so and appreciating your immense purchase desired to spare you all the inconvenience possible I heard laughter in the office as I closed the door behind me I dreaded to face the hotel clerk As I strolled up street I thought what a poor mother I would make even to one little child and tried to fancy the awful strain on Washington to be such a good father to his whole country There was one thing that worried me generally when my meals were over my hat I feared I should lose it The hat boy clever as he was by mistake might give it to another Always when he handed it to me I stopped to examine it carefully to make sure it wasn t one of the stylish tiles which had presumed to associate with it on the rack It was customary for me to question the custodian of hats in this manner Is this my hat Are you sure it is When Tuesday evening my odd looking stove pipe was handed me I examined it incredulously eyed the colored man then stepping in front of a natty groomed gentleman of fifty who had just received his latest Dunlap from the custodian I scrutinized his hat inquisitively then my own and eyed him inquiringly as much as to say Are you sure our hats have not become exchanged The dignified guest did not take kindly to my manner He frowned even looked savage The darkey seemed to think it funny and laughed in his hand with back turned I accompanied the old gentleman down in the elevator to the office where we picked our teeth Then I addressed the clerk in injured tones I have a complaint to make Let s have it said the genial Harry That black blue brown hat custodian at the dining room is forever getting my tile mixed with those of other guests I hate to make a fuss but You are quite right mister Pod said the clerk seriously A first class hotel should not tolerate such inefficiency in a trusted employee I ll discharge the fellow at once I stepped away contented and lighted my cigar Then the stately gentleman addressed the clerk Who in is that fellow He s off his trolley He thought this hat of mine was his and that rusty antediluvian dilapidated specimen he wears was mine What s his name Why Professor Pythagoras Pod of course Didn t you recognize him Everybody knows him He knows his hat too and don t you forget it Offer him fifty dollars for his old tile and see how quickly he ll refuse it The outraged dignitary shrank into his clothes and with a wry glance in my direction walked away The custodian of hats kept his job but I never saw the stylish gentleman again PART TWO By PYE POD AND MAC A RONY Do you believe the whale swallowed Jonah No And don t you believe Balaam s ass spoke to him Yes I believe that Why Because so many asses speak to me every day CHAPTER XIX BY MAC A RONY Days are but the pulse beats of immortal time Sparks from Iron Shoes Mac A Rony It was the twenty tooth of April The inclement weather which had rained supreme for forty hours suddenly abdicated in favor of the presumptive sun and genial air apparent which ruled gloriously for some six hundred and nine minutes Save that it lacked the odor of new mown hay it was a day fashioned after a donkey s own heart However a yard of fresh grass painted green would have satisfied my taste better than did the golden sun rays and the transparent air At ten o clock Pye Pod D D donkey driver sauntered off to do an errand and then hastened to the stables to saddle and pack his two noble and fractious partners Cheese and myself I believe my erudite collaborator has already introduced to you my long eared comrade Such a load as we were to carry Of course I got the worst of the bargain in which I had no voice Said my master as he rubbed my nose Mac old boy since you have become hardened to the trip by reason of your thirteen hundred mile creep I nabbed at him vexedly I ll just let you shoulder the two boxes And with nerve incarnate the unbalanced Professor balanced on my back what seemed to me two one ton cases of pig iron I believed my time had come Even the unsophisticated Cheese whispered to me nervously Our coffins Mac sure as Balaam and resumed the mastication of timothy hay as if it were his last meal The pack saddles were tightly cinched to us Every time Pod pulled on the ropes under my belly I grunted as if in pain although it only tickled me and gnawed a half inch off the oaken manger in seeming agony so while he imagined he was squeezing all the breath out of me I had still enough left to inflate a balloon That s how I fooled Pod All this time he was talking to himself He vowed that he would get even with a certain officious policeman who had daily gloried in the exercise of his authority by ordering him to lead his confounded jackass away from the front portal of the hotel where crowds of curious people always gathered around us and blocked the way His soliloquy grew louder and more fiery every moment Even Cheese lifted his snoot out of the haymow and tilting his left ear whispered Say Mac our master must have some unholy motive in mind Hold on to your wind Don t let him lace those lockers on you as a squaw would bind a pappoose to her back for you may want to kick em off Pod s daft Well that suspicious jack s most grotesque foreboding was soon realized Everything went well until we were nearly opposite the great double portal of the hotel when suddenly I felt the saddle slipping round my girth Another second and I was flat on my back jerked high off my feet on top of the boxes For a moment I could not realize the undignified posture I was in Being roped securely to the boxes all I could do was to kick at the flying sparrows and bray as only a frightened donkey can Crowds quickly assembled Excitement ran high Cheese instead of raising a hoof in my defense dropped his ears and looked complacently on my animated heap like a country gawk The hotel guests rushed out bare headed some of them fresh from the cafe with tripe and ice cream in hand and wild eyed pedestrians flocked to the scene of my troubles Don barked excitedly and kept the throng back The coolest one of the outfit was Pod He stood quietly by grinning and bowing to the open air audience as if he were the bandmaster and I the band I now recollected Cheese s advice and chided myself for having expanded my lungs at the packing The thought was vexing to one in my position Immediate relief looked hopeless Scared half to death I brayed myself hoarse before a would be liberator wedged through the crowd and order Pod to clear the thoroughfare He was that pompous policeman He eyed Pod severely and glancing at my up turned face inquired What s in them there boxes Mister Pills said Pod just pills and with his usual suavity added A very dainty but effective cathartic the best remedy in the world for a morbid patrolman I know you feel out of sorts mister Cop but the contents of one of these boxes taken internally will make you imagine you are not only the chief of the Chicago police but the Mayor of the city and the President of the United States combined The Professor then handed the man a small box and proceeded to free me And do you know I choked Michigan Boulevard for an hour before I was got right side up with care We next moved on to the Columbus Statue which then stood in a barren spot between the road and the lake shore where a photographer waited to take some rare views of our outfit The bombastic policeman ordered us off the grass although there was nothing but gravel in sight Cheese was raving mad and so annoyed by the cop s impertinence that he boldly made a bluff at eating the sculptured stone wreath off the statue just to worry him Mac A Rony please keep your ears still for one moment will you said the photographer as he took hold of my flaps and pushed them forward adding Now keep them there As he let go they flew back into a natural position like blades of whalebone Next he twisted my nose almost out of shape and addressed me as if I were a lady Now smile gently there Such a grin as I gave The instant he removed the black cloth from the camera a familiar lump came up in my throat and I brayed My efforts to restrain myself joggled my ears out of gear and completely shook the smile off my face But I was took body and bra in s with the whole outfit How I shudder when I gaze upon those photographs my drooping eyes and my lazy body all taken together made a picture so perfectly asinine that one can almost detect the bray leaving my mouth I have always been ashamed of that picture of real life Like all donkeys I was disappointed because my photo did not flatter me Besides my master s eagerness to keep his contract to advertise a patent medicine led him to drape Don in a gray blanket on which Throw physic to the dogs was brilliantly embroidered words which helped make Shakespeare immortal but caused Don to blush It was a long jaunt to Illinois street Several times my burden threatened to come off And once I almost made a free distribution of pills by falling in front of an electric car which was brought to a stand only six inches from me I caused a sensation to say the least And when Cheese brayed in terror a multitude flocked to the scene The passengers were thrown out of their seats some of them pitched off the front platform on the top of me and screamed with fright Pod of course flew into a rage He accused me of attempting suicide but Cheese loyally defended me and said Such a load of medicine is enough to prostrate a herd of elephants Soon afterward on turning a corner the wind blew Pod s hat off and it went flying under the wheels of a cable car which completely ironed the curl out of the hat rim on one side and gathered a crowd on the other Managing one jackass is a difficult job but controlling two is impossible I heard Pod mutter as he slapped his plug on his bald pate Although it was only five miles to Garfield Park as the crow flies it was ten by the course we took At that place we were not overfed and soon after leaving we encountered an electric hail storm Volley after volley of round shot ripped open Pod s ill fated tile and his spleen broke loose again I m glad this day s most ended he thundered His remark seemed to solicit sympathy so I answered gravely My worthy master remember that days are but the pulse beats of immortal time You should cherish each as you do every heart throb My philosophic words silenced him for a moment Then as if I might warp the wearisome hour by a mute tongue I lay back my tail and ears till they were parallel with the road and landed my cargo in Oak Park before six There was no hotel in sight but as it was not yet dark Pod was enabled to find a barn adjoining a saloon and there he stalled us fed and watered us and said good night CHAPTER XX BY PYE POD Full in the midst the polish d table shines And the bright goblets rich with generous wines Now each partakes the feast the wine prepares Portions the food and each the portion shares Nor till the rage of thirst and hunger ceased To the high host approached the sagacious guest Homer s Odyssey I left my embryo caravan in Oak Park for the night and returned to the Auditorium Hotel The clerk greeted me with Well well grasped my outstretched hand and with a smile said I thought your picturesqueness had left us for good Then pulling a pen out of the vegetable pen stand which squinted How to do with one remaining eye he handed it to me I m a hard customer to get rid of I remarked could not get out of the city entirely this day though I ve traveled miles jacks at Oak Park saloon barn best I could find no hotel got to eat and sleep you know And having said this I walked majestically to the lift Seventh floor queried the elevator boy No dining room I corrected patting my stomach fondly Pretty late for feed guess observed the lad discouragingly as we began to rise There s a banquet on now continued the lad Great Balaam I am late I exclaimed I ve been a week saving my appetite for this dinner Let er slide kid there and I hurried to the dining room I knocked persistently against the locked doors while savory odors drifted through the keyhole and was soon admitted by the assistant head waiter I smile now as I recall that watermelon grin when the darkey yawned like a coalbin in expression of his greeting I m somewhat embarrassed Jim to appear so tardy I began I had about decided to deny myself the honor and pleasure of the event You see my friends are all togged out in their pigeon tails while just look at me Why Mistah Tagras shuah dey will be glad to Yes yes I know they would be more pleased to see me in my odd regulation clothes but no not this time Jim close your scuttle mum s the word Just let me eat in this snug corner where I can hear the strains of the orchestra out of reach of their stale jokes Fetch on the viands As I concluded I pressed a coin into the mahogany hand and took from my coat a button containing Mac s and Pod s photo and gave it to the delighted darkey There was novelty in this strange situation It was the only feast I remembered ever having attended uninvited Across the spacious hall obscured by Japanese screens sat the garrulous banqueters blissfully ignorant of my presence while I a famished and jaded nomad sat comfortably drinking in the liquid music of the serenade and inflating my gastronomical pipes with terrapin squab robin s eggs salads and other dainties galore Presently I was served with something more mellifluous than music as Jim appeared with a bottle of that familiar sparkling liquid which is proverbially wrapped in cobwebs and frost in a pail of ice and said Believe yo sayed Mumm Sah be dis yo taste Mistah Tagras My eyes eloquently expressed my sentiments Oh what a nerve tissue a donkey journey does create As I quaffed the soul stirring nectar I thought of Mac A Rony how he would have relished a quart of that sterling brand and then poured a bumper for him and drank it to his very good health When I had finished I called the waiter and said with visible effort Jim I wish hic you would tell th bandmaster here Jim poked a napkin into his mouth that a tardy guest hic heartily requests the pat patriotic hic tune Macaroni s come to town Go Jim that s a good girl And Jim went That waiter was the cleverest darkey I ever came across We all well know that one trait of a thoroughbred darkey is the faculty for invention Imagine my surprise when the fellow returned with a gentleman in full dress and introduced me I expecting to catch something different failed to catch his name My new acquaintance seemed to feel highly honored with the presentation He appeared a bit staggered though and with difficulty found my wandering hand Taking my arm he escorted and introduced me to the convivial assembly as the distinguished guest of the evening though somewhat belated nevertheless his genial presence duly appreciated When he mentioned the name of Professor Pythagoras Pod such applause issued from the unsteady occupants of the hundred chairs that I thinking it my courteous duty to join in the encore clapped my hands vigorously This seemed to provoke great merriment The laughter and clapping grew louder and louder until hands and throats were inadequate to express the jubilant spirits of the banqueters and they began to stamp their feet Finally all arose threw in the air imaginary hats broke glasses of wine and in fact I don t know what would have happened if the manager had not entered the scene Finally some one called Speech Speech A speech from mister Pod I tried to respond I didn t believe the guests knew who I was other than a pod of some sort The hotel manager did but he had gone I therefore decided not to reveal my identity I would act the invited guest I was taken to be I did not speak long What I said was ostensibly so appropriate so pointed so witty so apropos that the frequent cries of Hear Hear told me I had made a hit and it was time to stop I have no recollection of what I said on that momentous occasion but I apologized for the abruptness of my departure on the plea that I had six more banquets to attend that evening whereas I had but one stomach Wild cheers and handclapping greeted my speech When quiet was restored I offered the following toast asking all to rise with filled goblets Hic here s to the man boys here s to the man Who hic has the sagacity gall and who can Partake of the bless hics of earth though unbidden Without revealing the jack hic he has ridden Here s to hic his pocket and here s to hic his purse May Balaam shed tears when hic he rides in a hearse With a concerted Bravo all drank my health Then hat in hand I followed a very tortuous route out and to the elevator and soon afterward found the keyhole of my chamber door and retired I did not feel well in the morning but nevertheless journeyed to Oak Park at an early hour What a surprise awaited me at the barn The air was dense with the odor of beer I had hardly anticipated trouble brewing nothing was so foreign to my thoughts as the possibility of finding two asinine inebriates and a jagged canine instead of the sober company I left the evening before But there they lay both donkeys paralyzed panting and blear eyed An overturned beer keg swam in the deluge of froth that flooded the floor Mac must have pulled the bung out of the keg The fellow looked guilty enough but when I recalled my own recent dissipation I didn t have the heart to upbraid him I was perplexed What could I do To resume my pilgrimage that morning was out of the question I felt in my bones that as soon as the saloonkeeper learned of the calamity I Pythagoras Pod would have to pay damages Such I could not well afford Why not go to the man and enter a complaint against him for harboring knock out drops and consequently causing my valuable animals ruination of mind physique and moral character A capital idea No sooner thought than done The man was speechless Why I exclaimed pounding my fist hard down on the oaken bar think of it a day s delay may lose me my five thousand dollar wager THINK OF IT MAN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS I would have said more but I noticed the Hibernian was knocked completely out of the metaphorical ring by my unequivocal utterances His blanched countenance showed that his conscience smote him He paced the barroom floor like a leopard trying to get away from his spots Presently he stopped and thrusting his fingers through his goatee looked out in time to witness Mac A Rony turn a headspring from the barn door Begorry he exclaimed if Oi hod that mule Oi d ruun im for alderman of the Tinth Ward Shure and it s phure air and wather the bye s votin fer It s this Oi m sayin Misther Pod Oi ll give ye twinty foive bones fer th brute in his prisent condishun Oi will that ond call it shquare Mac certainly was acting very compromisingly But I explained to the Irishman no reasonable sum could purchase that particular donkey and furthermore that twenty five dollars would barely satisfy my claims The exclamation of Holy Mither checked me for the moment and as the man looked barnward he added elequently shaking his fists Oi m dommed if th shcapegrace ain t mixin dhrinks Here mister Rooney and I rushed out in the nick of time to prevent my crazy jack from tapping a whiskey barrel standing in the shed adjoining the barn Misther Pod a curse on me soul if Oi would ruun th bladherscat fer doorkeeper oof th pinnytinsury Here s tin dollars tear th likes oof it in two and rhuun ond buy a bhromo seltzer and sober th toper oop at wance I took the proffered note and had gone but a hundred feet when the Irishman called to me Hold on before yez lave fer th sphace of a mooment moind thet ye puts a muzzle on th asrophoid rephrobate with th bobtail ears ond shpring a toime lock on th crethur The animals having been dosed I was about to question myself What next when my host said cordially Shure ond yez will feed with us Yez may keep th change from th shinphlaster ond good luck in sthore fer yez Now coom on to grub ond lave th brutes alone They ll be afther havin their sea legs soon And Pat succeeded in conciliating me and escorted me to the house By one o clock my disgraceful donkeys answered to roll call and with touching humility submitted to be saddled With such disappointing interpositions of Fate the Golden Gate seemed to be a decade removed For a while the donks were wavering and their pedals unreliable but after the first hour they meandered along quite acceptably As Mac was slow to recuperate I rode Cheese He was surprisingly sure of foot whereas Mac swell headed drowsy eyed and swaying couldn t have walked a straight line a yard wide unless it was a yard of grass He walked with a suspicious tread like one venturing on ice which threatened his death bath any moment When the afternoon was well advanced Cheese showed symptoms of lameness in his nigh fore leg as I had feared in consequence of his late circus We passed Maywood and Elmhurst as we followed the main traveled road I was compelled to dismount and lead my cripple four miles to Lombard Such was my luck in the State of Illinois It was after dark the second day out of Chicago and still we had traveled but twenty miles To think that munificent gift Cheese was already an invalid on my hands I summoned a veterinary surgeon and listened to his diagnosis with solicitous attention Only a strain of the shoulder muscles said he must have run hop skip and jumped to get such a strain does he ever play golf Will require a full week s rest The doctor rendered his professional opinion with the air of a metropolitan specialist prescribing a trip to Europe for some delicate society belle Next morning I rode in company with a good fellow two miles into the country where I purchased a very long eared shapeless donkey of a good character and quickly rode him bare back to town Then I sold my cripple at auction in the public square The cumbersome pack boxes which the sturdy Mac A Rony had borne without a murmur I also sold to pay the doctor s bill The following day saw me in the town of Wheaton whose reputed beauty I failed to appreciate in a pouring rain I remained there over Saturday night and Sunday The clipping of Cheese II on Monday morning proved to be an exhibition well worth witnessing at a safe distance That model character turned out to have the temper of a vixen First a rope was twisted round his nose then his four legs were tied securely together and finally six strong men held him down on the floor to permit the finishing touches to his vibrating limbs while carefully avoiding the finishing touches to their lives Instantly the half dozen assistants were sent sprawling across the floor in all directions while the stable dog chased an imaginary bird into space and landed in a poultry yard The frightened donkey was mad or had a fit On the other hand Mac in the noisy excitement pumped his bronchial organs to their utmost capacity and Don joined in the chorus till any passer by might easily have mistaken the barn for a slaughter house Finally the unruly subject was got under control and in time released on bail of hay I verily believe that the electricity generated by that clipped donkey if stored could have propelled a trolley for twenty four hours During the ensuing week the villages of Geneva Elberon Maple Park and Courtland in turn greeted me with the usual curiosity and concern and I was spared to enter De Kalb on Wednesday evening after a most distressing adventure When we had proceeded about two miles beyond Courtland I unchained my dog for a short sportive recess I rode Mac and about three feet to our right ambled Cheese a chain connecting his bit with my saddlehorn My little troop was peacefully traversing the smooth country road when suddenly Don came bounding down the highway chasing a little red calf the dog barking gleefully the calf bellowing with fright Drawing my revolver I fired to distract Don s attention but without avail A few moments later as I was aiming at a flock of black birds I heard the ominous clatter of hoofs rapidly approaching us from the rear accompanied by a deep hoarse mooing which clearly emanated from a calf of mature years Imagine my feelings when turning in my seat I beheld an enraged cow racing with Don in a bee line for me the dog in the lead going a mile a minute the bovine a mile and a quarter It was the first I had known Don to flee from a foe His eye now protruded his tongue hung out a foam and his tail lay back straight like an arrow As I remember the dog passed under the chain connecting my donkeys and instantly with the force of a locomotive something alive plunged in our midst striking the chain How many double somersaults I turned I know not How many minutes we remained in the dusty road overturned in a heap I can only estimate from the distance the lucky dog must have traveled to get out of sight so soon My first mental reflection was that the cow must be the calf s mother my second thought was to save my life I managed somehow to crawl out from under the animated heap and then surveyed the situation The cow s horns were fast in the chain and one of her feet in the saddle gear and she tossed her head savagely every time lifting one donkey or the other bodily off the ground and dropping him in a heap in the dust She kicked and bellowed until finally breaking loose minus a horn she made for me head down innocent as I was I didn t stop to argue but lit out for the barbed wire fence with that outraged mother at my heels I have heard you can tell how fast a man thinks by the way he eats You could have told how fast I thought by the way I ran Over the fence I leaped leaving my long coat tail hanging from the top strand of wire The cow blinded with rage made a lunge at the piece of cloth only to lacerate her head on the barbs then she jumped the fence and took after me tail in air and foam dripping from her mouth A small tree stood by the roadside not far distant and I cleared the fence again and made for it Although not an expert at climbing I shinned aloft like a squirrel and for a moment expected the bovine to follow She reared on her haunches and pawed furiously at the swaying branches then backing several feet she charged headlong against the sapling almost dislocating every bone of my body and every hair of my head All but shaken out of the tree top I contrived to gather in my legs and to wind them round the slender trunk Then I reached for my revolvers My Colt forty four was missing but with my Smith Wesson thirty two I peppered that cow until I shot away a section of her tail and sent her off in a cloud of dust like a howling raging cyclone in the direction of her calf I waited a while before venturing down to look for my animals now conspicuous for their absence Darkness had settled on the scene Groping my way up the road I soon stumbled over a pair of boots further on a camera and a hundred yards beyond my Winchester rifle minus its holster Still no sign of donkeys or dog I stopped at a farm house and inquired Have you seen two jackasses strolling this way The agriculturist pulled his goatee as he surveyed me from foot to crown and replied No I hain t seen TWO jackasses STROLLIN this way but a WHOLE HERD of em came tearing past my barnyard a kitin about an hour ago skeerin the cattle I was a milkin into fits Why the brayin and takin s on of the wild beasts caused a stampede of my hull gol darned dairy What be ye at a pesterin round these parts with a herd of wild jackasses My response was terse and was given before the man had finished I hurried on making inquiries at other farmhouses before I found my fugitive caravan huddling together in a corral a mile beyond My dog was with them but no cows or calves Borrowing a lantern and two halters I retraced my steps down the highway my unwilling animals in tow and resaddled and packed them as best I could then I returned the loan and hastened to town Illustration In this way I crossed that bridge of size Illustration I saw the streak of daylight Illustration So slow that his shadow beat him to town CHAPTER XXI BY MAC A RONY An uneducated person seeing a picture of a donkey in a field sees only a donkey in a field however well it may be painted and I fancy very exceptional ability would be required to make any of us think a gray donkey sublime or believe an ordinary field to be one of Elysian Ideala Sarah Grand There will be many converts to the Darwinian Theory by the time I have taken Pythagoras Pod to his destination They are recruiting all along the line The Professor s street lecture in De Kalb in a mist was punctuated with effusive allusions to his obstreperous asses which epithet only strengthened our ill feeling toward him and furnished a new incentive for Cheese s rascality When Pod reached the middle of an elegant burst of rhetoric that animal true to asinine instinct pushed a hind foot against the orator s stomach and brought the speech to a finish The afflicted one was tenderly borne away I know not whither but Cheese whispered probably to a blacksmith s where a bellows could be had with which to pump wind into the vacuum The following day my master having come to it was decreed that Cheese and I be taken to a smith s to have our corns pared and our shoes repaired Whenever Pod has an idle moment thank Balaam he hasn t many he amuses himself by torturing a donkey Shoes are a nuisance especially new shoes and I would much rather go barefoot as do country boys and girls The blacksmith an expert cobbler shook hands with us with special deference to Cheese who was to have the new footgear then informed my master that if we jacks would treat him with respect he would do what was right but if not he would inflict on him what he himself had received from us I overheard Pod mutter as he departed that he was sure that villain Cheese was going to kick him by proxy When Pod returned that incorrigible donkey had both smiths in a corner and was kicking knots out of the walls Soon that shop appeared as if constructed of perforated cardboard and the two men as if they were worsted Both men were saved however by Pod who ran to a bakery for some cakes with which he completely subjugated the murderous brute and enabled the men to complete the work All next day we labored through mud which made my feet feel good but spoiled the looks of our new shoes That day the Professor bought a new donkey Sell him cheap sound as a dye said the man Perhaps this was the truth but he was the funniest donkey I ever set eyes on His face resembled a poodle dog s except that it was longer and he appeared to be a combination of crosses between South American llama Rocky Mountain sheep baby camel and muley cow with only a sprinkling of donkey blood After this freak was roped to my saddle and we had proceeded a little way I asked Excuse me friend but what stock did you descend from Why live stock said the simpleton The rest of us hid our faces but I persisted Who s your father I never had a father he returned If I did he never showed up in my lifetime As for my mother she kicked the tenderloins out of a farmer s thoroughbred pig in consequence of which I was left to shift for myself so you can t call me a shiftless fellow Well the poor fellow ain t quite as bad off as Topsy I thought she had neither father nor mother For a week back Cheese had been complaining of a weak foot which explains why Pod desired an emergency donkey The heavy roads would have taxed a dray horse But by shifting the burden from Cheese and myself to the new acquisition we were able to make better time with less effort The sun was hot and Poodle s long coat dripped with perspiration Before long we were stopped in front of a house where a man was cutting the grass with a lawn mower Hay there Mister Pod shouted will you loan me that machine a moment I ll remunerate you handsomely for the kindness The farmer just shouldered that machine and fetched it down to the roadside Then my master dismounted and whispering to the granger something I couldn t understand to my utter astonishment deliberately pushed that lawn mower almost the whole length of that donkey s back I recall the incident so vividly First sounded the noisy swish of the mower next the fragrant air was hazy with flying hair hat man and mowing machine A moment of painful silence followed when suddenly a clatter from the roof of the house indicated that the jackass had promptly returned the machine to its owner Poor Pod it looked as if he were no mower The farmer laid him gently on the grass where he finally awoke and with the aid of hard cider and a fanning machine was restored Three miles beyond he caught the refractory jack that meant only to harm the machine he said and not the man and securing a slipnoose to Poodle s tail roped him to my saddle next he tied Cheese to my tail and leaping aboard his new expedient led the way All at once Poodle espied two donkeys grazing in a field I must say a farewell to my sweethearts before leaving he protested braying and making a dash for the fence dragging me after him I often wonder if he had any feeling left in his tail after that for while it pained me to drag Cheese it must have caused Poodle more pain to tow us two by resorting to such a sensitive extreme Had not the fence been a thorn hedge I verily believe that that Samson would have dragged us across lots to his sweethearts I never saw Pod so enraged On nearer approach to Rochelle we stopped in front of a house where Pod purchased a drink of milk of a woman who was passing milk cans to a man in a wagon Neither the man nor the woman asked a question much to my surprise until we had proceeded some distance when to prevent a tragedy nature asserted herself and impelled the woman to call out Say what be them thar animiles ye ve got stranger Two are camels and one is a dromedary Pod yelled Dromedary The woman exclaimed and to the man added That s a new sort of dairy I never heered tell of Did you Hank CHAPTER XXII BY PYE POD By my faith Signor Don Quixote quoth the duchess that must not be you shall be served by four of my damsels all beautiful as roses To me answered Don Quixote they will not be as roses but even as thorns pricking me to the very soul they must in nowise enter my chamber Don Quixote From Rochelle to the Mississippi I found the people more conservative but interesting subjects for character study The topography of the country varied but little Snipe quail doves and meadow larks were prevalent The pesty pocket gophers were as shy of my fire arms as of the farmers dogs one might shoot a dozen of them only to see the spry little fellows drop dead into their home made graves I have seen hundreds of them sitting upright on as many mounds immovable as sticks but pop and they vanished Crossing this one time prairie state I recalled pictures of prairie fires in my school books and easily imagined the terror of the droves of wild horses and buffalo fleeing before the leaping flames This seemed to be a contented section and contentment is a great thing Although no woodland was visible I saw occasional clusters of pussy willows and groups of shade trees embowering a house above which the shaft of an aeromotor towered like a sentinel asserting the homestead rights When the windwheels were in motion they created a noise which only an expert linguist could distinguish from the vernacular of a guinea hen Here and there bunches of cattle browsed in the meadows behind barbed wire fences and thorn hedges and long corn cribs often full to overflowing had rewarded most every farmer About dark May first my small caravan ambled into the village of Ashton and my bugle blasts aroused the nodding inhabitants sufficiently to give me a fair audience for a lecture The Germans predominated and to them May day festivals are indispensable Boys and girls celebrate by hanging May baskets on door knobs and a few wags who resemble frogs in that a half dozen make you think they are a million shower corn sand and bird shot at windows equal to a Kansas hail storm The celebration that night seemed to be directed at my particular window The racket had almost soothed me to sleep when suddenly a rag doll loaded with shot came smashing through the blinds and landed on my bed My patience overtaxed I arose and resorted to free trade by exporting to the street a piece of crockery and a chair not to mention a few roasted invectives I would have folded my bedstead and sent it sailing after them but the disturbance of the peace and the pieces ceased together While at breakfast I wondered if any tricks had been played on my animals I was quite sure of it before reaching the stable The livery keeper came hobbling up on one foot and a crutch with his face done up in fly paper and a bandage around his head What s up I asked Jacks got the spasms You mean spavins I corrected innocently enough Guess I ought to know the difference tween spasms and spavins he returned sourly Those d mules o yourn kicked out petitions hollared and had such fits last night that they scared all the mice and rats outen the haymow What kind of petitions I asked remembering I had been tempted to issue a petition on my own account What kind d y spose Wooden petitions said he And when I crawled out o bed and went to the stalls to see what ailed em Ailed the petitions I interrupted excitedly Naw the mules something like a thousand rats and mice ran over my bare feet I thought the barn must be afire and I jumped so the lantern fell outen my hand and broke and I had to feel my way in the dark You ought to know better than to feel around strange donkeys night or day said I reprovingly It wasn t th feelin of em what broke me up so said he Twas the kindlin wood they piled up again me I did not discuss further the circumstances I was quite satisfied since we had grievances in common While settling my bill I noticed Mac gaze at the ceiling so I glanced upward too and at once saw hanging to a nail on a cross beam a circular rat trap bent almost flat and containing two dead rodents That solved the mystery On recovering the trap we found it sprinkled with donkey hair and sheep twine which was proof enough that some young villain had fastened a cage full of rats to Mac A Rony s tail he being the most amiable of the donkeys There is nothing like the mysterious to frighten a dumb brute and when that donkey heard strange noises and felt mysterious movements about his hind legs he didn t wait for an explanation Good bye rats Although the day dawned clear dark clouds began early to bank in the Southwest and before I could reach the next town I was drenched by a heavy shower But I was fortunate in selling Cheese II my weak footed jack for seven dollars to the village butcher who while in Ashton had generously fed my dog Wet to my skin I took refuge in a German tavern managed by a widow with five comely daughters All were kind and responsive to my wants and brought to my room a varied assortment of house pets literature and cheese not omitting a bottle of beer for my entertainment and refreshment while I remained in bed enveloped in comforters waiting for my only suit of clothes to dry by the kitchen fire Meanwhile I became almost asphyxiated from the gas generated by the Limburger cheese which had already smothered two hearty slices of bread The next day I spent in Dixon and the following day in Sterling situated on Rock River From my bedroom window I had a charming view of the dam falls and the iron bridge which spans the stream My sojourn in both these towns was profitable It was a hot and dusty ride to Morrison where I found a brass band serenading a leading citizen This won t do said I and making Mac bray I blew my bugle and at once turned the tide of popularity in our favor The fickle crowd soon gathered and cheered me to the hotel while the jilted band had the brass to march down the street past me blowing itself with might and main until lost to view not once thinking that distance lent enchantment to my ear Next day we made slow headway to the Mississippi As I approached the Father of Waters the land as well as my donkeys were more rolling Several times when wading through a pool of dust Cheese III alias Poodle would suddenly stop circle about kneel and roll with all the paraphernalia he was carrying Then my steed would follow suit before I could get out of the saddle Thirteen miles from Morrison lay the village of Fulton on the banks of the Mississippi and it was four thirty P M before we arrived at the big high bridge The bridge approach on each side of the river crosses a broad stretch of lowlands which at certain seasons is inundated My donkeys refused to pass the toll gate although I had paid the toll I demanded of Mac an explanation He maintained silence as did Cheese and neither of them would budge A squad of laborers amused at my plight asserted their donkey nature by imitating an ass s bray and so perfect was the imitation that my animals took them for donkeys disguised in human apparel and joined in the awful chorus Presently a timid woman following us with a terpsichorean horse called to me and gesticulated wildly I feared a runaway and was at a loss to know how to urge my contrary animals on but before long a double dray team came to my assistance The teamster roped Mac to the rear axle of his wagon cracked his whip and drove on dragging the obdurate donkey on his haunches across the bridge while Cheese crept closely behind in fear and trembling When I had crossed the Mississippi it was exactly seventeen minutes past five As we wended our way into Clinton Ia cheers greeted us from every quarter The streets were rife with people pacing restless up and down but soon all footsteps followed in one direction to the Reviere House where I took advantage of the favorable circumstances to make a speech and to dispose of a host of my chromos I had traveled thirteen hundred and sixty miles about one third of the distance by trail from New York to San Francisco and had consumed one hundred and sixty days and there was left me only one hundred and eighty one days in which to accomplish the remaining two thirds of my journey CHAPTER XXIII BY MAC A RONY Hell is paved with good intentions Samuel Johnson How the Professor ever landed that lop sided dilapidated tile of his on the west bank of the Mississippi without a bottle of fish glue is beyond me The wind gave our whole outfit a good blowing up for not crossing the bridge earlier in the day and Pod had to handle the hat as carefully as an umbrella to prevent it s turning inside out Except at such times we donks were the only ones to get a blowing the threats Pod used to coerce us across that lofty bridge and his final cruel expedient of having a double team drag me with a rope around my neck were enough to drive one to suicide We must reach Iowa to day said he You show absolutely no interest whatever in the next state but I ll convert you I protested until I was hoarse Said I When you take into consideration all the different animals that came out of the ark monkey parrot man and ass and the results of several thousand years of study and research how many believe in any other state Only one Man There are a few horses and dogs and cats and occasionally a white rat that enjoy heaven on earth but we jackasses are always catching The last word of my peroration was spilled as my master whacked me over the ears with his black snake whip and knocked all the theological and theosophical considerations out of my head Get along there Mac he shouted and quit your everlasting braying and as the horses started I got to save my neck When we reached the middle of the bridge and I was over my dizziness I slackened my neck rope and followed the wagon more willingly but my fetlocks bled from scraping on the rough planks and my rich aristocratic blood painted a faint red trail behind us It was a hot day I burned as with a fever and wanted a drink And they call this the Father of Waters my master soliloquized as he watched the sluggish current creep under the bridge What do they call the father of beer I asked facetiously for I was mad Mac said Pod you have brought me back to earth Let us hurry to town When we were on Iowa soil the Prof tied his stove pipe over my ears with a green ribbon and added insult to injury by making me parade into Clinton in that condition before all the genteel donkeys along the road We stopped at the post office and Pod read on the way to the hotel portions of two letters one informing him that his sombrero was at the express office the other casting aspersions on my race Yes I did promise to meet you at the Mississippi and accompany you across the plains the letter ran but really old man after reading your articles I have concluded that I want nothing to do with a jackass Pod seemed disappointed and handing the envelope to me said Here Mac what do you think of it I greedily devoured the contents without a murmur and the Professor galloped into the express office Do you realize that you have swallowed a postage stamp Cheese asked gravely after I had stowed away the morsels of paper Most assuredly I said smacking my lips and hereafter you can look upon me as a sort of internal revenue collector But now Pod appeared under cover of a broad brimmed hat looking frightfully cowboyish That evening the sombrero so completely unbalanced his head that he sauntered up the street armed to the teeth and attempted to hold up an Indian cigar sign to the amusement and terror of passing pedestrians Later on he became more rational and gave a street lecture Friday May seventh was a lucky day for Pod and me Friday is Pod s and the seventh of the month is mine with a few exceptions hence the Prof has on an average of four and a half to my one His first errand in Clinton was an act of courtesy He called on mister Gobble the genial Mayor and obtained one of his quills to embellish the autograph album which was destined to furnish me a delectable repast unless Pod should find a gold cure to destroy my appetite for stationery His second errand was to place an order for panniers to be made after his own designs for they would soon be needed and his third to call at the stable and superintend a tonsorial artist clip Cheese III after the devil s designs The circus had begun when he arrived There tangled in straps and ropes lay the frightened subject on the stable floor kicking while several men were performing rare feats of tumbling Pod was indignant Is it necessary to pile on the donkey in that fashion he inquired starting up a ladder to the loft I reckon so squire said the clipper rubbing his bruised arm we tied the brute t auger holes in the floor but he yanked the holes plumb out o the boards and we bored em in agin Then he brayed and strained and pulled out the holes agin What s he been livin on Indian turnips Pulled the holes out of the floor Such an astonishing statement was enough to warp a donkey s credulity But the operation was finished at last and Pod returned to the hotel to answer some letters one of which seemed to tickle him very much It was from a farmer in the neighborhood and I ll quote it word for word CORNVILLE HOLLOW IOWA May six eighteen ninety seven Prof Pithygors Pod Eskire M D Illustrious Sir My wife has give me unexpeckted opertunety ter do ye the grate onner of namin our latest and last kid after ye and if ye cum this here way ye will see a namesake ye will be prowd of Times are not so good with us of late but hope they air with you wishing you a socksessfull jurny I remane Yours fraternally CY SUMAC I did not see Pod s reply but I took him to the post office to purchase a ninety nine cent money order which he mailed to Cy and overheard him say that was all the money he had when he started and no man had a right to think he was any richer now and hoped naming children after him wasn t going to become a fad On our way to the hotel a little girl walking with her papa expressed the wish to ride on my back Pod overheard her and jumping off placed the little one in the saddle and led me down the street Pod is never safe without a chaperone He had no more than got his land legs than a monstrous colored woman whose avoirdupois was out of proportion to her energy and with shoes that made him keep his distance stepped in his way and with a grin half the width of an adult watermelon asked him if he was shully dat wonderful traveler Pye tag o rastus w at was chasin a mule roun de world For a second Pod was somewhat colored too but he laughed and said he believed he was the gentleman Then the old mammy held out a great black hand with knotted fingers looking more like an elephant s foot than anything else and asked if she might have the honor to walk a piece with him The Professor took the proffered hand and the pair sauntered on down town and were soon lost in the crowd CHAPTER XXIV BY PYE POD Why Toby s nought but a mongrel there s nought to look at in her But I says to him Why what are you yoursen but a mongrel There wasn t much pickin o YOUR feyther an mother to look at you Not but what I like a bit o breed myself but I can t abide to see one cur grinnin at another Mill on the Floss The good old black mammy who made my acquaintance on the street called upon me at the hotel to present me with a little dog I thanked her and told her that one dog was all I could take care of whereupon she argued that I should visit the Indian Reservation at Tama City and if I presented a dog to the Chief that I would be royally received A good idea I wondered it had not occurred to me I accepted the dog An hour later I came near being arrested for promoting a dog fight in defiance of the law Don was generous however and left a little of the cur for the Indian Chief but next morning the sight of a bandaged and plastered dog being dragged behind my outfit was gruesome indeed This is how I managed the dogs I chained Don to one end of an eight foot pole and the mongrel to the other so that the dogs could not get closer than four feet Then I chained Don to the saddle horn I hoped to reach the town of DeWitt before dark Everything went smoothly and I was congratulating myself on getting out of the city without a mishap when suddenly both dogs leaped to the opposite side of my donkey in the effort to reach a cat basking in the sun The pole yoke caught Mac s hind legs and upset us almost causing a runaway This and other incidents delayed me many hours On arriving at the village tavern The Farmers Home I was agreeably surprised to find the landlord not so much out of spirits as I A night cap then to bed Next day I rode sixteen miles through the beautiful farming country to Wheatland Nature was arrayed in Sabbath attire and no sermon could have inpressed me more than the pure sweet voicings of God s creation Graceful turtle doves always in pairs flitted in mid air bevies of quail whistled in the meadows and ditches flying squirrels half winged half jumped from tree to tree and coy Norwegian girls scampered indoors as my mountain canaries now and then joined in a carol Just before entering town a gay cotton tail rabbit shied at my pistol ball allowing the ball to graze a calf grazing in the field beyond to wing a pigeon on a barn further on and eventually to announce my advent to the towns folk in a most singular manner When I arrived the church bell was faintly tolling and a crowd of people were staring wild eyed at the belfry tower I inquired of a countryman what was up Blamed if I know said the sexton I was jest settin down to feed when sudden I heard a sharp clang of the church bell Sounded like it was hit with a hammer Whole hour before church and the doors are locked Now I d like to know what sot that bell to chantin Go up and find out I said Not on yer life he replied You may think us folks superstitious well we are Lots of queer things happen in this town When I reached the privacy of my room I did a good deal of thinking but whichever way I reasoned I arrived at one conclusion My pistol ball must have struck the bell after calling on the calf and the pigeon It was merely a chant s shot The landlord of the Siegmund Hotel did not venture close enough to shake hands Doos them dogs bite yes he asked from the veranda No I answered they won t bite you and me but they are very fond of each other Don looked up at me appealingly as if he thought he had been persecuted When the donkeys and the mongrel were in the barn I turned Don loose He was tickled and ran round the barn three times jumped over the hen coop upset the landlord and then chased the house cat so that it climbed to the top of the hotel chimney Most extraordinary dog no common pastime satisfied him The hilly country I was now entering made it necessary for me to walk half the time as a precaution against wearing out my animals But the air was sweet with lilac tulip violet and apple blossoms blue and red and yellow birds serenaded me as I passed all making me feel somewhat repaid for my winter hardships The main street of Mechanicsville was beautifully shaded and along the road side was a tempting pasture for ruminating animals As I rode along and admired the scenes I recalled a sentence from the Scriptures Whatsoever cheweth the cud that shall ye eat To the right in the cool shade reclined a gentle eyed cow chewing her cud to the left at the base of a magnificent tree sat a pretty bloomer girl beside her bicycle also chewing I was puzzled On reaching Mount Vernon I discovered after diligent inquiries that Washington had never been there dead or alive Cornell College for boys and girls distinguishes the place as a seat of learning and the students showed an abnormal appetite for knowledge by purchasing my books and photos A few miles west I crossed a ridge of wooded hills descended into a lovely vale crossed Cedar River and drew rein at Bertram a mountain town consisting of a railroad station side track tavern store and two to three houses From Bertram we mounted another and still higher ridge from the summit of which I could see the great verdant valley and winding about it a spiral cloud of smoke from the busy city of Cedar Rapids where I arrived at six o clock That evening after a lapse of nine years I met my old friend Steve D who once had tramped Switzerland with me After I had explained the cause of my unique pilgrimage and each had given an account of himself he planned for me a pleasant two days sojourn and suggested it was time I had a useful traveling companion As I moved westward the towns would be farther apart and I would have to camp often on the highway The services of an able and trusty man would save me much time Steve said he would try to find him Cedar Rapids contains some of the largest oatmeal factories in the country I met through my friend several pleasant people dined with his family and was tendered a spread at the Grand Hotel to which a few of his friends were invited Meanwhile I found the man I was looking for He was about twenty had been night porter in a hotel and was well recommended Twice I refused him because of his apparent inexperience in roughing it but I was won over by his persistence at the third call He said his name was Coonskin and Wisconsin the State of his nativity His attainments were something extraordinary He could sling a Saratoga trunk into a first story window had painted the highest church steeples and broken the wildest horses could skin all kinds of game and with equal facility could skin the cat in fact he had made an enviable record in athletics and had won several championships for sprints He could swim like a frog and as for shooting his comrades couldn t touch him with any kind of a gun He was never ill and had stood all kinds of exposures from hanging all night on a church steeple after his ladder had fallen to riding on the trucks of a baggage car as the result of the disbanding of a theatre troupe This Coonskin was a wonderful combination of resources he was the very man I wanted He wished to go with me for fun and experience and was perfectly satisfied if I would defray his expenses I took Coonskin at once to make the acquaintance of Mac Cheese Don and the mongrel and to be assigned to his duties At nine o clock the morning of our departure he called at the hotel with a small bundle done up in a red handkerchief and wearing a new pair of shoes What have you in that bundle I asked Everything Extra suit of clothes Yep and patches for emergency Extra shoes already broken to your feet Yep and chloride of lime and extra socks Brush and comb and tooth brush Yep and corn plasters and curry comb Extra suit of underwear and handkerchiefs Yep Pajandrums too I smiled in astonishment so small was the bundle Well done said I after this you shall do all my packing I was gratified to note Coonskin s quick perception his alertness to obey and his capacity for memorizing He did not have to be told a thing more than three times before understanding it and his lively interest in my welfare manifested itself at the start When I went to the stable at eleven o clock I found he had added to my itinerant kennel a bull terrier which took to Don as fondly as Don had taken to the mongrel I remonstrated The more dogs you offer the Indian Chief the bigger time he will give you said my valet Better keep the terrier I ll preserve harmony Glad to shift some of my responsibilities to the broad shoulders of this young genius I returned to the hotel and dressed for luncheon You may imagine how my heart was set aflutter when luncheon over my valet rapped on the door and venturing a foot in the room said with the courtliness of a Sancho Panza Your highness donkeys and dogs are at the door My guests were as much amused as I and accompanied me to the street where a crowd had assembled I shall never forget the expression on my old friend s face when he saw the dogs yoked together A second pole had been brought into use and Don and the mongrel having become reconciled the bull terrier was made a sort of pivot round which revolved the other two a mean dog between two extremes Coonskin said at first he had made the little mongrel act as the pivotal dog but he had no sooner left the animals than Don and Towser swung round and clinched in pugilistic style and had it not been for the efficacy of the stable hose with all hands at the pump the mongrel would have soon been converted into sausage It was nineteen miles to the village of Norway we did not arrive there till eleven at night Once or twice on the way Coonskin was prevailed upon to relieve me in the saddle for a couple of miles but although his new shoes were paining him as I could see from his gait he was too game to admit it and whenever I asked him to ride protested that walking wasn t a circumstance with him He would rather walk than eat We found Norway asleep After assisting Coonskin to stable the donks and secure the dogs I perused a newspaper while my young neophyte went out to smoke When he limped in I noticed his coat pocket bulged with something he would conceal I did not question him But before retiring I opened his door to give him orders for the morrow and found him dressing his feet with Indian ointment which he admitted he had procured from the village druggist He had with difficulty aroused the man from slumber in consequence of which he was made to pay double price for his cure Coonskin was somewhat embarrassed but I praised his pluck in glowing terms and put him at ease Next day he was ready to take advice by wearing his old shoes and riding most of the journey CHAPTER XXV BY MAC A RONY What made Balaam celebrated as an astronomer He found an ass to roid Old Conundrum I had heard about the chilly climate of Norway and was not surprised when we donks met with a cold reception We had plenty of hay but no grain Next morning the landlord said that he expected some oats soon after our departure Pod had walked the last three miles and warming up had strapped his vest to the saddle where I found it next morning Peaking out of a pocket was a crisp five dollar greenback Now a donkey likes anything that s green I never had eaten a vest But I determined to tackle this somewhat tough corduroy steak and made a fair breakfast on it not to speak of its garnishes of green money lead pencils and a scented lace handkerchief the one my master had long carried in the left inside pocket Save for the fact that I got a few sharp bones of a pocket comb in my teeth and a page of court plaster stuck in my throat I relished the repast But not so the Professor When he had searched some time for the vest he looked at me As luck would happen I had left sufficient circumstantial evidence on the saddle to convict most any donkey but no one in particular However I suppose I looked guilty and my past record was against me Pod was speechless a moment then he made up for lost time and said that he believed a jackass would devour a house and lot if he had the chance I don t know about a house I replied but I know I could eat a lot if it were set before me Then I caught it By nine o clock the clouds having dispersed we started for Blairstown The Iowa farms were pleasing to my eye Horses and cattle were cropping the juicy grass hogs were shelling corn or taking mud baths fowls of all kinds were engaged in athletic sports trying to add some new feather to their plumage and occasional bunches of sheep were standing in barnyards and corrals with wool pulled over their eyes not knowing what to do with themselves It looked like a Garden of Eden where donkeys were excluded Finally we met a farmer with a team of lazy horses Pod asked him if a donkey was a known quantity in those parts and was told that a man by the name of K living near the next town owned two that he had been trying to give away A mile beyond we met a man in a one horse gig who had a word to say too One donkey knows another when he meets him Your name is K Pod inquired That s the name I always went by said the black eyed black hearted man I did not like his looks I felt it in my bones that Pod was going to be done by him When a man or donkey is over anxious to acquire something he is pretty sure to make a blunder On being catechised the man said his business was hoss tradin some farmin some and various some Hear you ve got a donkey for sale Pod observed Nope said K but I ve got two of em Sell both er none I was told you have tried to give them away said Pod The hoss trader threw one leg over the other spat tobacco juice in Don s eyes so he couldn t see all that might a cur raked timothy seed out of his whiskers and inquired Who was tellin ye that The fellow didn t give his name answered Pod and I wouldn t undertake to describe his physical geography but I could locate him if I wished to If I could lay my hands on him I d dislocate him said K snapping his eyes When my master told about his travels the Iowan became interested and showed signs of weakening on his ultimatum Meanwhile I discovered the subjects of the discussion grazing in a meadow and brayed them a courteous how to do thus calling Pod s attention to them The hoss trader was sharp enough to see it and his animal instinct told him that vanity was Pod s weak point so he opened up with a little blarney Now mister Pod I m fair t say I ve sort o takin a likin to ye and I want to help ye along I ll sell both my donkeys for ten dollars er one for five and trade the other for one of your n Jest let your partner here run across the field and drive em over I want ye to see em Coonskin went and K continued They re two as fine lookin jennies as ye ll run across in many a day both healthy and strong not too young not too old often plow with em kind and gentle boy rides em everywhere fast too but no danger runnin away Why they re twice the size o your n and ll carry double the load I m more than satisfied with my donkeys very flattering to Cheese and myself Pod affirmed and only require one more If I am suited with one of your donkeys I am willing to pay five dollars for it but I will not trade one of mine nor will I purchase both of yours By this time the animals arrived They were certainly big enough and as for the danger of their running away they didn t act as if they could run ten feet if charged with a thousand volts of electricity The farmer said he was bound to make a satisfactory deal with Pod somehow and that if he wasn t convinced by the time we reached his house that both animals weren t superior to either of his an absurdity on the face of it then he would consider some other proposition When we reached the house Cheese and I were generously fed and Pod and Coonskin invited into dinner Then K chased his donks around the yard and felt them all over and finally hoodwinked my master to buy one and trade the other for Cheese I could have kicked the daylight out of that man When K was on his way to town with his five dollars Pod came to the stable My new companions were crabbed old spinsters and raised some objections to going with me Where are you bound one asked San Francisco said I but I don t know where that is any more than do you Guess it s land s end Then I told them how far I had come and that Pod said only a few days before that the journey had only begun also that he expected we donks would fall off some before long from which I inferred the fall would be gradual and the horrors of death prolonged It was enough to frighten the wits out of any old maid and it took a pitchfork two hoe handles and a crowbar to get those donkeys out of the gate Then one of them balked kicked threw Coonskin broke her halter and ran back into the yard She could run after all That was enough for Pod He rode me back into the yard and told Coonskin to fetch Cheese out of the barn And it didn t take him long to shift the blanket from that gray spinster to my old chum You just tell your dad when he returns said Pod to K s son that I don t intend to put up with any such game He grossly misrepresented that donkey it would take a week to travel a mile with her As I have paid him for the other one she belongs to me and I shall push her along with the outfit But this animal and he pointed to Cheese is mine yet awhile Good bye Do as you like K junior replied I know nothin bout yer agreement We covered the first mile in slow time Coonskin s new steed was forever stopping and straying out of the road to eat grass The young man wore himself out keeping her moving by rapping her with the flat side of a hatchet This big brown jenny was made of the right stuff but evidently lacked training and experience We were yet a half mile to Blairstown when a young woman and a child drove toward us with a skittish horse It acted as though it had never seen a donkey It pricked up its ears and snorted and so help me Balaam in a jiffy that buggy was on its side the girls on the ground and the horse running to beat a cyclone Luckily the girls escaped injury My master was as frightened as he was chivalrous and assisting the girls to their feet invited them to ride us donkeys to town which kind offer was respectfully declined On our arrival Pod took us to a blacksmith s to have the new donkey s fore feet measured for a pair of shoes The smith seemed to be much taken with me and said I had the smallest feet of all the gentlemen donks he ever met The remark so tickled my vanity that I nibbled at his coat tail whereupon he turned to me and inquired What kind of a donkey are you Chinese Not much said I indignantly My name is Irishy and I always supposed I was a thoroughbred Irish ass but I m beginning to believe I m a roamin donkey after all I could see that Pod expected trouble from some quarter but none of us knew just where the lightning would strike The next village Luzerne lay fifteen miles to the west My lady companion did not carry herself too gracefully nor her rider either She was broad and flat across the hips and as Coonskin did not possess a saddle he found it more comfortable to sit far back on her where he could get a good swing of the fence rail he substituted for a whip We were ambling peacefully along the dusty road late in the afternoon when Pod broke the silence with a word to his valet Well Coonskin said he what re you going to call your donkey Damfino said Coonskin and he added with a drawl Git ap You ought to have found a suitable name by this time I HAVE named her emphasized the young man Good shouted the Professor Let s have it then Damfino yelled Coonskin with a wild swing of the fence rail Pod s face turned on its axis with a puzzled expression as his eyes regarded the hopeful pioneer Said he See here young man I know not whether my ears deceive me or you are not up on my dialect you say you have named the donkey yet when I ask the name your answer implies a contradiction Again what is her name Coonskin drew a long breath and said loud enough to be heard a mile away Damfino As the fellow uttered the word I dropped to the joke and stopping in the road brayed till my sides ached A new light now came into the Professor s eyes and he smiled Damfino then is the lady s angelic name said he resignedly It s odd it s not inappropriate Let it stand Very well returned Coonskin I will proceed with the ceremony And letting the fence rail fall on his steed s rear quarter he added In the name of the great and only Balaam I christen thee Damfino It was an interesting event Thenceforth Cheese and I resolved to be more choice in our language and decorous in our manners in Miss Damfino s presence and we lived up to our pledge two hours before Cheese called Don and the bull terrier bad names for accidentally upsetting Miss Damfino with their yoke and I kicked the tired and panting mongrel in the neighborhood of its pants CHAPTER XXVI BY PYE POD Thou hast described A hot friend cooling Julius Caesar It was nine o clock in the evening While we were chatting with the landlord of the only tavern in Luzerne a portly smooth looking individual entered the room He was clad in a great fur ulster and top boots After a familiar hello to the landlord he eyed me searchingly and added Your name is Pod ain t it I said I believe so yours is what don t it Evidently not pleased with my expression he instantly struck an attitude or something equally hard and announced I m the sheriff of Borden County and have come for a jack belonging to mister K Jack I interrogated boot jack apple jack Just plain jack interrupted the officer Well I replied carelessly I have no jack belonging to mister K but I have the jenny he sold me for five dollars mister K imposed upon me and if he will refund the money I will be only too glad to return his hundred year old mule Here K himself entered He stormed about and said that I told only a section of the truth The sheriff gave his client a look which quelled his ire for a moment then turning to me said You talk reasonably enough mister Pod and doubtless mean right but mister K has sworn out a warrant for your arrest and if you don t want trouble and a double jointed advertisement just turn over to K the jack he claims and send your man back for the gray jenny It may not seem strange that I was converted to the officer s way of thinking Take the donkey you claim I said to K you have the advantage of me I haven t time to fight my case in the courts My black bearded adversary now calmed his temper his victory must have tasted sweet I calculated the cost of the warrant and the sheriff s services to be at least ten dollars since the officer had sacrificed angling for posse duty although he was prevented from catching fish there was a nice mess for me With reluctant equanimity the man who had wished to help me along explained that he had boasted of having acquired one of Pye Pod s noted donkeys but when he found I had outwitted him he swore vengeance On the other hand the officer had conducted himself as a gentleman Here Coonskin said the officer take this dollar and fetch us a pail of beer and turning to me added we must drown ill feeling amongst us for when you come this way again we ll show you how to catch fish By one o clock next day Coonskin weary hungry and morose had managed to steer his slow craft into Luzerne and to moor it in front of the tavern barn That closed the interesting event On our way to Tama City I was greeted by a member of assembly who tendered me an invitation from the Mayor to dine with them that day Lounging about the shop doors and strolling the streets on our arrival in Tama were many stately still proud redskins who when they espied me with the wealth of canines collected on my way shied off the scent for fire water and dogged my trail to the hotel After dinner with the Mayor and Assemblyman I escorted them to the stable to discover Mac A Rony devouring a new hair cushioned carriage seat At once the Mayor wanted to buy that donkey outright head and seat for a round sum On expressing my intention to visit the Indian Reservation some three miles away his Honor gave me letters of introduction to the Indian Teacher and the Indian Instructor in agriculture There lived the Sac and Fox tribe of the Musquaques I was told that they were one of the most primitive tribes in the States holding on to the primeval and often evil customs of feeding on dog soup indulging in various kinds of dances living in teepees or wickey ups and wearing bears teeth eagles claws scalps skins and moccasins As you know I had long hoped to be welcomed as their guest I was tired and weary of the care of my dog pack and wished to present it bodly save Don to the Chief About two o clock we saddled and packed When ready to start a diminutive bicyclist mud bespattered and perspiring from a hot century run he affirmed wheeled up to the stable and almost before catching his breath introduced himself to me My name is Barley Korker said he de champion lightest weight wheelman in de United States weighin jest sixty eight pounds I m jest troo wid a trip from New York in one month and tirty two days My bicycle was giv me by de Cormorant Club of Phil delfia De Bourbon Club of Chowchow Wheelman of Pittsburg put up five hundred dollars gainst de wall dat I couldn t go all de way to San Francisco and git dere On de way I hears of de great donkey traveler Professor Pod so I says I ll jest catch up wid him and mebbe he ll take me long wid him I at once made the little fellow a proposition which he accepted if he would wheel ahead of my caravan every day carrying a small flagstaff with a streamer containing the words Official Courier to Pye Pod I would as long as he gave satisfaction defray his traveling expenses Barley was delighted He forthwith purchased a piece of plum colored silk and a bit of white silk for letters needles and thread and having once been a tailor by trade when we went into camp that night said that he would make a beautiful streamer one I would be proud of He promised to have it completed in a couple of days I had not more than finished my business with my courier when a rustic looking boy rode up on a white donkey and called to me Want ter trade Not anxious I returned but showed no signs of a desire to flee Trade with yer if you give me five dollars to boot said the enterprising lad I recalled how I had been swindled recently in a trade and resolved to make a deal with that boy by hook or by crook Do you suppose I would think of trading this thoroughbred Irish ass that has gone around the world for your common beast just because mine is tired from fast and long traveling and yours is fresh I saw I had made an impression the lad dismounted and examined Cheese IV critically I hain t no money to day said the boy but if you ll give me two dollars to boot I ll trade Illustration I killed my first rattlesnake Illustration That was the town Illustration Over the Platte after blindfolding them What do you want the earth I exclaimed Only before dinner I paid two dollars to have this donkey shod I don t intend to pay two dollars more to shoe your animal The lad replied All right and galloped away but had only gone a short distance when I hailed him He came back without hesitation and I then concluded a bargain It was agreed that a blacksmith should take the new shoes off Cheese and put them on his donkey and that I should pay him three dollars to boot An hour later Cheese V was shod bridled and saddled and that afternoon became Coonskin s mount Damfino carrying the principal portion of our luggage and Mac A Rony his master My party reached the Reservation in time for me to meet the Indian teacher before he left school my courier having wheeled ahead to announce my coming I was greeted warmly when I presented the Mayor s letter was shown some of the lodges of the tribe and made acquainted with a few of the foremost braves of the camp The teacher was an admirable interpreter and the Indians grunted approvingly at meeting such a noted personage as Professor Pye Pod A fat old buck named Ne tah twy tuck old one on being presented extended me his hand muttering How do His grip almost mashed my fingers Much dog he observed eyeing my pack with doubtful admiration Yes too much I replied I want to visit Me tah ah qua your great chief and give him a heap of dogs The Indian grinned majestically while his teacher turned his head to control his risibles Make pleasant the redskin grunted and shook his head disapprovingly Me tah ah qua say no dog good old make tough soup And the brave pinched one of the mongrels causing such a ky eying that my interpreter feared it would put the whole camp on the war path Presently an Indian boy notified the teacher that the chief had heard of mister Pod s arrival and wished him to dine with him at his lodge I accepted and the boy departed and soon afterward Coonskin and I were escorted to the chief s wigwam taking my dog pack with me Me tah ah qua met us with a grunt rubbed my nose against his until it became lopsided and likewise greeted Coonskin Then the chief waved us into the wigwam He seated me on his right and Coonskin on his left while opposite to me he placed his disenchanting daughter of forty five summers Opposite the chief sat his first councilman Muck qua push e too young one and at my right at the entrance of the tent in full view of the host was seated our Government interpreter seemingly much amused by the event I lost no time in presenting my dogs to the chief who in broken sentences half Indian half English accepted the munificent gift in befitting words The spread consisted of a wolf skin and on it rested a large flat stone on which to stand the kettle of soup when ready For some moments the chief regarded me searchingly then said Me tah ah qua wants big donk man to live with him and marry his only daughter Ne nah too too Me tah ah qua will give him a bow and a quiver of arrows three seasoned pipes five ponies a new wicky up two red blankets a deer skin bag full of dogs teeth fifteen scalps taken by his father The chief left off abruptly as if for my answer but I shook my head thoughtfully and the chief continued If you will marry my daughter here the chief glanced at me then let his eyes dwell fondly on that aged belle of forty five summers Me tah ah qua will make you chief of his tribe before he goes to the Happy Hunting Grounds He will call your first born Chicky pow wow wake up I was never more embarrassed and eyed the damsel of forty five summers trying to persuade myself that she was beautiful and rich and still shook my head The old chief seeing his inducements were not alluring motioned to his councilman to pass the pipe of peace After we had all taken a puff at it the kettle of dog soup was set before us and we all dipped in our ladles the chief first and began to eat When I first looked into that caldron of bouillon I could see in my mind s eye all kinds and conditions of dog staring at me and almost fancied I could hear them barking The soup wasn t bad after all it reminded me of Limburger cheese in that it tasted better than it smelled But Coonskin and I and even our interpreter ate sparingly I use the word ate because there was so much meat in it I learned from the teacher that the whole kettleful of soup was extracted from one small spaniel Dog gone I sighed The feast at an end I thanked the chief for the honor conferred upon me shook hands with his daughter and departed Barley Korker Mac A Rony and the rest of the party welcomed me with glee and soon we were marching over the hill toward the house of the Indian farmer In front of a wigwam sat the chief s squaw an old wrinkled and parched woman of a hundred and five winters weaving a flat mat a little way off two Indian boys were filling pails with sand making believe they were at Coney Island and still beyond I saw two squaws carrying huge bundles of faggots for the wigwam fires round which sat the lazy bucks smoking A half mile further on we met the Indian Farmer and I presented my letter of introduction He extended me a glad hand and invited us all to supper and on the way to his house enlightened me about Indian farming and the results of our Government s efforts to civilize the savage tribes The Reservation contains twenty eight hundred acres of woodland and arable soil After supper on bread and milk with the farmer we travelers made our beds of hay and horse blankets in the barn and then followed the trail half way back to the Indian village until we came to a house where I discovered in the darkness its rustic incumbent leaning on the fence smoking There we lay down on the dry sod lit our pipes and listened for the first sound of the Indian drum beats which the farmer told us we would soon hear that was the night for an Assembly dance and the first drum beat was to assemble the tribe to its nocturnal orgie As I reclined on the grass in the starlight that mild May evening my mind recalling the harrowing tales of the early settlers of the West the first sound of the drum beat sent a thrill through my frame I mentally counted the weapons comprising the arsenal in our belts and even Don crept closer to me and rubbed his face against mine After a few moments interim the drum again beat but for a longer period sounding something like the army long roll only more weird The farmer said this was the signal for the dance to begin so we strolled leisurely down the hill trail through the woods to the grotesque scene A circular corral fenced with three or four strands of wire surrounded a pole driven slantingly in the ground and from the pole was suspended a very bright lantern Already within the enclosure could be seen the dusky forms of the Musquaques some of them grouped in a sitting posture crosslegged in the center of the corral beating a large shallow drum resting on the ground while maneuvring fantastically about them were four agile reds clad in loose fitting bright colored robes feathers moccasins and sleighbells dancing and pow wowing frightfully Finally we drew closer to the scene and then an educated Indian named Sam Lincoln welcomed us into the enclosure He said he was a graduate of the Carlisle Indian School of Pennsylvania and greeted us in the true American style but he still loved the primitive customs of his people We sat on the ground against the fence and occasionally one or another of the dancers would put a pinch of tobacco into the hand of Sam seated next to me What was that he just gave you I asked of the Indian He give pleasant of tobacco said Sam Show good feeling Indian not steal leave things around Indian no take Indian honest By that sign of distributing tobacco among his fellows the tamed savage promises fair play among his tribe The men alone danced Before long the squaws one by one came into the ring from various quarters with pappooses bound on their backs in shawls or robes and squatted in a circle just behind the drummers As the dancers became fatigued I noticed that they would exchange places with the spectators most of whom were in dancing rig Sam Lincoln after a time excused himself politely and asked me to sit on his coat reminding me should I leave before his return not to forget to leave the strap he loaned me to tie my dog to a post The weird proceedings were all too exciting for Don and it was all I could do to prevent his making mince meat out of the dancers and prowling squaws The whoops and pow wowing and yells were thrilling enough to frighten even a man tenderfoot Toward midnight speech making began The drummers stopped beating the drum and an old patriarch walked from the fence toward the center group and stood behind the squaws a moment in silence Presently he softly uttered something that sounded like a prayer to which all the dusky auditors responded feelingly at the close in a monosyllable not unlike Amen Then the drum beating and dancing was resumed continuing some moments to be followed by another prayer At last a great pipe was put through a series of mysterious calisthenics and passed around among the drummers At midnight the full round moon rose above the wooded hills and cast a broad silvery sash across the ring illuminating the weird and grotesque scene Now a squaw entered with a large earthen jar and passed it around to all the Indians the bucks first I was ignorant of its contents as it was not passed to me and my white comrades Fatigued from travel I finally rested my head on Don s warm body and went to sleep and it must have been near one o clock when Coonskin awoke me Then we three accompanied by my dog started for the barn to lay ourselves out for a few hours repose I shall never forget that night Sam Lincoln said that several members of the tribe a few weeks previous had gone to visit another branch of the tribe in Wisconsin in the absence of which a meeting dance was held every fourth night when the Indians appealed to the Great Father for their safe return Sam told me that in all their various dances a different drum was beaten there was one each respectively for the snake dance ghost dance wolf dance buffalo dance peace dance war dance meeting dance et cetera The drum for the meeting dance Sam pronounced beautiful and much nice seven dollars fifty cents worth of quarters on it all silver on drum fine drum much cost The Indians valued their drums evidently more than any other of their possessions We rested well that night in our haymow bed although the rats kept the dog busy till morning so Barley said he was the only one of us three who failed to sleep soundly We rose in good season and traveled five miles to Mountour Barley Korker wheeling on in advance to order breakfast He proved himself a good financier on this his first mission as Pod s official courier and pleasantly surprised me by having bargained for three twenty five cent breakfasts for fifty cents Before reaching Marshalltown we met with a terrific thunderstorm and rode up to the hotel at six o clock in a drenched condition CHAPTER XXVII BY MAC A RONY What the devil was the good of a she ass if she couldn t carry a sleeping bag and a few necessities Stevenson Our sojourn in Marshalltown was brief Before leaving my master purchased cooking utensils so that he would not be compelled to travel more than he ought to in a day to reach a town now he could cook his own meals After going into camp the first night Pod fetched out the cooking tools and having saved up a huge appetite went to work to get a fine supper Hello Coonskin said he what do you think We ve plenty of frying pans but nothing to fry never once thought of buying grub And three more disappointed famished individuals I never saw But when to get even they ate double their usual breakfast next morning and were charged accordingly Pod was enraged We trailed through State Center Nevada and Ames to Boone arriving at midnight May twenty twod and continued on next day to Grand Junction where a farmer invited the men to sleep in his kitchen Instead of accepting they shared with us donks the comforts of the barn where after a supper cooked at a safe distance from the hay stack Pod received a delegation of gay young chaps from town They brought all kinds of prohibition drinks and eatables the popping of corks kept me awake until a late hour And when I complained all I got was an invoice of corn on the ear The Mayor of Jefferson during our stop presented Pod with a heavy shillalah that was intended as an ornament but several times later persuaded to do business The Irishman also as a compliment to my ancestry invited us all to dinner After passing through Scranton and Glidden two or three interesting incidents occurred on the road to Carroll One night we were caught in a shower that seemed to settle down to business for the night Coonskin thought he saw a barn in a meadow so Pod sent him to investigate He came back soon and said it was only a double corn crib built so a wagon could drive between under a roof All three thought it was just the thing it was better than tramping through rain and mud So we broke through the fence and soon were unpacked and fed all the corn we could eat The men made their bed in one of the big cribs of corn the best they could with their scant blankets and went to sleep Pod told me that wasn t the first night he had spent in a crib And I shouldn t wonder if that were so I said I preferred corn on the ear to corn on the feet It was a funny sight before the men arose There happened to be several holes in the inner wall and the men had twisted and turned about so much during the night in their dreams and to get the ears comfortably filled into their backs that it resulted in Pod s head sticking out of one hole Coonskin s foot out of another and Barley s seat plugging another When Pod awoke his head was red as a beet he found his feet higher than his head Damfino having pulled the corn out of the hole during the night So much did we donks eat that before starting on the day s journey our stomachs ached and doubled us all up Then a ridiculous sort of runaway happened A fat Irishwoman tried to drive a gentle horse past our party The pet stuck up his ears and stopped a hundred feet away Pod called to the courageous driver to wait and that he would send his man to lead the horse past us But the woman yelled back that she could manage her own horse so she whipped him on To the left was a marsh deep from the heavy rains and the frightened horse made a dash through it but he hadn t run far before he stuck knee deep right beside us The horse snorted and plunged and tried to get away but it was no go He burst the traces and the frantic driver hollered so that I almost busted too Don t move your feet an inch or you ll go over Pod cautioned the woman but she took it as a personal offense and said her feet were all right Help me and Oi ll pay yez she implored So Coonskin waded in and tying the reins around the broken traces led the horse on to dry land at a safe distance Then he held out a hand for his pay Phwat do yez want ye poppinjay said the ingrate You promised to pay me if I would help you replied the valet soberly Ah gwan yez crazy loot she exclaimed Dishpose of thim hathenish jackasses ond yez will have money ond th rishpect of the community Coonskin was watersoaked up to his waist But before he could get to a hotel to change his clothes our little courier met us coming into town and inquired Hev yuse been havin a fallin out wid de crazy mule Not by a blank sight retorted the valet in ill humor He felt like scaring Barley and he did Two women met us down the road a way driving a fractious horse horse got frightened at donks ran away upset wagon both women killed expect sheriff and posse after us with shot guns You weren t in the muss and are safe Here s my mother s address To say the fellow was scared half to death doesn t express it It was his business to gather information and pace our party out of every town on the best road to the next On this occasion he took us out on the longest road to Carroll saying he had paced us on that road to elude pursuit Dey s method in my madness mister Pod said the excited fellow leaping off his wheel to better explain matters If de whole blamed country s after yuse do yuse tink I was goin to let yuse be catched if I could help it We sticks togedder we do tru t ick an thin an when de sheriff t inks he is chasin yuse one way we s chasin ourselves de udder way see And our courier looked heroic Pod said he was grateful and slyly winked to Coonskin who turned his head and grinned At Carroll Pod purchased some canvas for a sleeping bag He said he was tired of sleeping in barns and corn cribs and such and if he had a bed of his own he would be independent Barley sewed up the canvas for him to save expense and we left town with the patent bed Of course the men were anxious to put the thing into service About nine o clock the three crawled in and soon went to sleep The bagful of humanity rested on the sloping roadside where the grass was thick their heads being at the higher end their feet at the lower We donks were up bright and early the next morning eating thistles when suddenly I heard Miss Damfino giggling She nodded toward the sleeping bag and I saw a funny sight The seam at the foot of the bag had been ripped by the weight of the three bodies sliding down against it and now six legs were sticking out clear up to the knees the feet turned skyward in all directions In a lumber wagon opposite a farmer sat taking in the curious sight with a phiz that would make a monkey laugh One couldn t tell who or what was in that bag except for human legs Miss Damfino was so convulsed with merriment she just lay down and rolled Now it happened that Cheese V was a droll wag and chock full of innocent mischief so as soon as his eyes lighted on that row of awkward looking feet he quietly strolled over to the sleeping bag and commenced to lick the bare soles of those sensitive pedals In a minute the peaceful bed looked as if hit by a cyclone Such yells I had never before heard The men s heads were down so far in the bag that the terrified fellows didn t know which end to crawl out of first so tried both ends at once and slap bang me if that bag full of live things didn t begin rolling and hopping about the highway like a sackful of oats One could have heard the hollaring a mile off I laughed so hard I thought I d die and Cheese Damfino and Don were weak from the strain of their risibles long afterward The farmer almost rolled off the seat but finally he pacified his excited horse got down and caught the animated bag before it jumped the fence ripped it open and pulled out the dazed men For the life of me I thought at one time the bag would reach the creek across the field and drown the men Cheese escaped detection for his practical joke and I from the way Pod leered at me all day knew that I got all the blame CHAPTER XXVIII BY PYE POD If I know d a donkey wot wouldn t go To see missus Jarley s wax work show Do you think I d wollop him Oh no no Then run to Jarley s Old Curiosity Shop Dennison was still and peaceful when at nine in the evening we trailed up to its leading hotel after a long and tiresome day s walk for to relieve Cheese and Mac A Rony Coonskin and I had journeyed half the distance on foot But we left next day in good season for Arion taking it slowly as Cheese was noticeably lame he had stumbled in the darkness the evening before At Arion so aggravated was his injury that I tarried a whole day for I appraised him a valued animal When I resumed the pilgrimage I took it slowly and relieved the animal from any burden more than his saddle Coonskin and I took turns riding Mac who was as chipper and strong as ever He gloried in his health and vigor and found amusement in chaffing his unfortunate comrade The eve of May thirtieth was spent in camp a few miles from Woodbine The following morning when we were still two miles from town my courier who had preceded us wheeled back in company with an old white haired man leading three white Esquimaux dogs The stranger managed his sportive pets with one hand and carried a basket of apples in the other and introducing himself and shaking hands he presented me with the delicious russet fruit and welcomed me to his home in the distance as his guest for the holiday a pleasure I was compelled to deny myself for lack of time According to his own account he was a hermit and lived in the society of his canine companions as he had the greater part of his seventy five years Content to subsist on the product of his little thirty six acre farm he denied himself the use of any portion of a small fortune of fifteen thousand dollars in gold which he claimed he had buried somewhere outside of that state nobody had ever helped him to a cent and he resolved that no one should enjoy a dollar of his money I put up at the Columbia Hotel Woodbine a pretty brick hostelry and after an enjoyable lounge in the parlor we all went out to see the military and civic parade in keeping with the usual Memorial day custom The band assembled from all quarters and kinds of quarters doors windows cellars barns corn cribs hay stacks hencoops smoke houses et cetera and without delay began tuning instruments Their uniforms challenged imitation No two were dressed alike Every horn was different they tried to outvoice each other when suddenly the bass drum banged away and upset the equilibrium of the horns until the snare drums and cymbals interfered as peacemakers At last after much strain of nerve tissue the medley of musical tools settled down to a good sensible patriotic tune which held sway for fifteen minutes But the procession that followed the band beggared description The band acted as leaders the Grand Army followed as pointers then trailed the wheelers carriages filled with citizens and farmers There were democrat wagons side bar buggies buckboards carts gigs surreys hayricks baby carriages wheelbarrows goat carts and velocipedes Pedestrians then fell into line and brought up the rear To cap the climax a big fat man with inflated chest galloped past on a faded wind broken horse and exhorted the excitable celebrators to strictly obey orders Remember citizens he yelled let us take care not to have any accident to day for we are not used to em here The procession had begun slowly to move forward when suddenly the command was given to halt and the bangity bang clapity clap rip slap of wagon tongue against wagon boxes sounded like freight cars when the engine clamps on the brakes The firearms carried looked as if they had been loaned by some museum for the event They were muskets match locks flint locks and minus locks Winchesters Remingtons Ballards Floberts Sharps Springfields shot guns muzzle loaders and breach loaders blunderbusses carbines bean shooters sling shots and cross guns a most formidable looking arsenal Such a pageant When the procession arrived at the cemetery the hearse filled with flowers stopped in front of a newly made grave Then the undertaker in black clothes and red cap seated beside the driver in blue coat white trousers and stovepipe hat banged a bass drum in his lap with an Indian club as each floral piece was placed on the several soldiers graves Presently my attention was directed to a new excavation before which solemnly stood Coonskin as immovable and statuesque as a marble slab and soon I observed an aged woman approach bend toward the human statue and read the pathetic epitaph on his back Take Blank s cathartic pills and keep healthy Poor boy she exclaimed sorrowfully a pity to have died so young That was too much for Coonskin who instantly resumed consciousness and wheeled about as the frightened mourner gasped Bless my stars alive When Mac took in the situation he brayed with merriment almost shaking me out of the saddle The interesting proceedings concluded with a volley fired over a grave and at once bird shot buck shot salt pork hickory nuts marbles acorns beans and pebbles rained about us frightfully When the firing was through I assisted a quack doctor probe for a number one duck shot in Barley s shoulder and an acorn in Coonskin s leg As I mounted my terrified donkey I noticed the old woman had fainted Bending over her was a gallant fellow countryman trying to fan her back to life with his broad brimmed hat while exposing patched trousers to an admiring crowd As soon as she came to we started for the hotel congratulating ourselves on our narrow escape Next day we set out for Logan Our arrival was signaled by an assembly of townspeople headed by their Mayor who greeted me cordially and asked to ride the celebrated donkey He rode Mac up and down the central street before the cheering throng as had the Mayors of other towns we had visited Then I delivered a lecture on my travels on a corner of the business street after which Coonskin who had lately received his banjo guitar from home accompanied me with my mandolin recently purchased as we gave a short serenade of music and song that made everybody sad and wish we would depart The morrow was the first of June I welcomed summer joyfully Missouri Valley was reached in the afternoon and there with my dog chained in the cellar of a hotel and the three donkeys stabled we men retired and slept the sleep of the just The further I journeyed the more primitive and squatty were both dwelling and store in small places and the architecture reached the superlative of simplicity on the plains but I observed more of a passion for flower gardens and shrubbery evinced west of the Mississippi than east The great bluffs characterizing the banks of the Missouri now loomed up verdant and picturesque after the genial showers and sunshine of spring Every turn in the road presented a different kaleidoscopic effect to the landscape Wild roses lined the roadside as we passed in review with our hats trimmed with blossoms and songbirds caroled sweet melodies from early morn till eventide Pure springs and wells were ever within reach and the farmers treated us to brimming bowls of sweet milk and buttermilk One day after imbibing freely from a barrel of buttermilk standing against the porch where I was chatting with the housewife I was astonished to see a calf walk up to the barrel and drink After that I lost my appetite for buttermilk All through Iowa were droves or bunches of white faced cattle the predominating breed I was told that the white faced cattle make the best beef which seemed to sustain the theory early advanced by the Indians that pale faces made the best roasts During the last few days I noted a happy change in Damfino s demeanor and a marked improvement in Cheese s tender feet Damfino traveled faster and more smoothly her long ears swinging back and forth with every stride like pendulums of a clock and apparently assisting her to walk to regular time Just as we were trailing out of Crescent City a woman presented me with a large bouquet of flowers I had intended to travel ten miles that lovely June night but when some five miles from town on observing an inviting grassy lot I decided to go into camp We let our donkeys roam at will and graze and spread our sleeping bag under an apple tree then with Don on guard and with the gleaming stars beaming on us through the boughs we enjoyed a delightful sleep At dawn we were awakened by the owner of the property a short crabbed individual who lifted a dirty face above the top fence rail and called Git out to us I was awfully sleepy and dozed on luxuriously After a while he again hailed us now from the opposite quarter but still on the outside of the enclosure where I could see him eyeing disapprovingly my huge dog Finally we induced him to come into our camp on the promise that our dog wouldn t molest him and even invited him to breakfast with us When we departed he was in good spirits He said he lived over in that house yonder all alone because he couldn t afford to live together Of course we understood He informed me that we were following the old Mormon trail to Council Bluffs where Mormonism and bigamy flourished for a season before the historic band of pilgrims crossed the Missouri in eighteen forty eight Thursday June third my donkeys ambled into Council Bluffs CHAPTER XXIX

6892-278268-0005	train-other-500	Next morning Miss Damfino went shopping coming back with a brand new pair of shoes She said she saw lots of donkeys shopping and began to distribute to a stableful of equine and asinine gossips such a lot of scandal that I was ashamed of her

6892-278268-0008	train-other-500	An hour afterward I was saddled for the show I had experienced riding in a wheelbarrow before and did not like the idea but said nothing Sure enough when we arrived at the bridge there stood a wheelbarrow
6892-278268-0009	train-other-500	just brought by a wagon from the Bluffs I eyed the vehicle disdainfully That was the same kind of carriage that a man once went to London with to fetch a wife home in and now as a fitting jubilee memorial of that historic event I

6892-278268-0011	train-other-500	I saw Pod reading about it on the way At the bridge I was at once unsaddled and my luggage distributed equally between Cheese and Damfino The quilts and blankets were folded in the wheelbarrow and with the help of two men

none	none	 One of our severest crosses some folks think the ass has only one cross and that on its shoulders was experienced a few miles southwest of the city where we donks refused to walk a narrow plank over a shattered bridge and were forced to ford the stream CHAPTER XXX BY PYE POD We may live without poetry music and art We may live without conscience and live without heart We may live without friends we may live without books But civilized man cannot live without cooks Lucile It was my good fortune to obtain in Omaha a most adaptable teepee tent a triangular canvas bag as it were One man could put it up in a minute This waterproof tent had a canvas floor stoutly sewn to the sides and when the door was tied shut neither sand water nor reptile could invade its sacred precincts mosquito netting across the two small windows kept out all kinds of insects Three could sleep in it comfortably besides allowing ample room for luggage and supplies and the tent with its folding poles only weighed thirty pounds This extra baggage was added to Damfino s pack for she was large and strong and by this time in good traveling fettle I could now thoroughly enjoy the outdoor life of the West with its fresh and fragrant air after sleeping a few nights under the stars only some imperative emergency could induce me to spend a night indoors Although my two attendants were not companions of choice they were fairly good company but my courier unconsciously furnished entertainment for Coonskin and myself He had such an absurd dialect he said he had learned it in an eastern factory where Irish Germans and Swedes and other nationalities were employed and his gullibility was a constant challenge for practical jokes One day at supper an idea of putting up a game on Barley came to mind It s a pity we haven t blue beetle sauce for our quail Coonskin I said giving my valet a sly wink and he suspecting I had some joke in mind took up the argument You bet was his response Seen hundreds of beetles to day Barley eyed Coonskin then me and satisfied that we were serious queried Do yuse mean wese kin make sauce of de blue beetles what wese see in de road Why I said as with astonishment haven t you ever heard of it before Man they pay a steep price for blue beetles at Delmonico s Only the wealthy enjoy such a luxury The dandiest stuff I ever et on broiled birds of any kind seconded my valet cleverly The repast over my courier was convinced of the surpassing virtues of blue beetle sauce Next day the bettles came out thicker than ever With enthusiasm I dismounted and began to fill my emptied purse with the insects and Coonskin followed suit by filling a handkerchief exclaiming By the very old Ned Gather em all we ll have a treat for the gods Up to this Barley kept on his wheel within talking distance but now he leaped off and made a dive in the dust with his hat as if he had trapped a butterfly Remember man I called to him there should be seventeen in every family bag every one of them Here s fourteen Ise got guess dey s one family but can t see no more besides my handkerchief s full Has yus got a sock yuse kin lend me I said I had and then he came to get the sock His trousers pockets were filled with the strong smelling beetles Suddenly he dived for a whole entomological tribe almost under Mac s feet had the donkey not leaped over him we all would have been hurt We lunched in a small village where I purchased peppermint oil for flavoring the sauce That night I made a concoction that would only satisfy a Siwash appetite We had bagged two dozen quail and doves so we had plenty of game and an abundance of beetles the next thing in order was a heap of fun After frying our potatoes gun oil peppermint oil pink tooth powder butter milk lemon juice and beetles were stirred in the frying pan and when it began to sizzle and steam Barley was put in charge and cautioned to keep stirring it I thought when he looked at the repelling mess and inhaled a little of those bug aromas he would smell the joke but he didn t He kept on stirring and smacked his lips and finally said that it looked done I decided to bring the joke to an end Going to the fence ostensibly to tie more securely the donkeys Coonskin loosened Damfino s rope while I seated myself at our table and called Supper is ready At once that grinning youth chased the freed donkey plumb into our fire and so surprised was my courier that he never knew whether Damfino or Coonskin kicked over the pan and robbed us of the rarest delicacy on record I stormed about like a madman and blamed both attendants then went at the hot broiled birds inwardly delighted with the success of the joke Barley never was the wiser The following day several times he told me we were passing lots of beetles but he wasn t going to spend his time catching them to be wasted Something followed the game supper which more fully explains my courier s displeasure By oversight one of the socks of bugs was left untied the result was beetles ran the tent all night Barley claimed he found a beetle in his windpipe Coonskin spent the night lighting matches and hunting the pests I myself smothered a score of more in my pillow That experience closed my calendar for practical jokes On to Lincoln was now the watchword While still five or six miles from the city a donkey and cart hove in sight both gayly decorated with flags and bunting The driver said he had been sent from Lincoln by a prominent citizen to escort me and my party into the city Barley had been busy stirring up the populace so when I rode majestically up to the leading hotel on Mac A Rony I found a crowd of representative citizens there to give me a befitting greeting As soon as my donkeys were anchored a tall fat jovial member of the medical profession advancing with outstretched hand welcomed me to the city mister Pod said he smiling all over I m doctor E and am at your service I shall take pleasure in doing what I can to make your sojourn a pleasant memory The first thing the Doctor did was to take me to the Executive Mansion We found the Governor absent but easily traced him to a local sanitarium where my escort found him on a couch wrapped in swaddling clothes apparently secure from all intruders but the genial Doctor himself He had just finished a Turkish bath but he sent the Doctor for me at once We meet under difficulties was his Excellency s smiling greeting I m trying to knock out an attack of rheumatism True enough I acknowledged extending my hand both of us are flat on our backs Gov Holcomb then wrote some hieroglyphics in my autograph album and expressed the hope that I would not find it as hot on the desert as I did in that room Our next stop was at a soda fountain Then we visited a leading clothier where I procured a contract to direct with Mac s assistance the public s attention to alluring bargains in its show windows For this I received a five dollar note My first evening in town was pleasantly spent in the company of missus Bryan who on learning that I was in town invited me to call I remained in the last evening to rest while Coonskin and Barley took a trip to Burlington Beach a famous local watering place Wese taught yuse see said my little courier in the morning dat it was something like Coney Island so it s bein only ten cents round trip dare wese takes de trolley an goes down Well yuse oughter seen de place Before wese gets dare it begins to smell why Coney Island ain t in it fer smells Den wese gets off de cars and shuffles our feet across a long wooden bridge over on to a island where dare was a dance hall and lots of girls of all kinds and canal boats and dongolas and drinks and beers talk of beers say wese had a tank dat high fer a nickel Yuse see de beach is on a island in a counterfeit lake made of salt wells and sand but day ain t no oysters ner clams ner crabs day s nothin but bad smells but say yuse oughter seen de lobsters crawlin round wid dere

none	none	I wished day could see once Coney Island We had not journeyed far beyond Lincoln Park before we approached the State Asylum for the Acute Insane From the beginning of my pilgrimage I had kept a sharp lookout for Insane Asylums always passing them after dark but Mac argued that the public had by this time found me harmless and advised me to call So I did A patient has arrived some one called to an attendant I was startled but soon recovered my equilibrium when I observed several doctors and nurses rush out of doors to a carriage at the porch The lunatic having been safely deposited in one of the wards the Superintendent then welcomed me and persuaded me to accept his invitation to visit and inspect the institution There was only one department that interested me I had no sooner entered the kitchen than my omnivorous eye caught the pie ocine stratum of a well developed pie and my curiosity led me to inquire if it were made by a lunatic Why most certainly Professor exclaimed the Superintendent What s the matter with it As far as appearances go I think it s all right doesn t look different from any other pie I ve seen and eaten Shouldn t think a crazy man could make a decent pie though did he do it all alone without anybody watching him Oh no we employ a sane cook to supervise the cooking explained the officer much to my satisfaction Will you have a piece he asked Y y y y yes I said incredulously if you are sure there is no danger of insanity being transferred to me by such a delectable agency The head cook then butchered the great pie into quarters and the Superintendent said Help yourself boys I gathered up the juicy quarter and saying My good sir you have heard of dog eat dog you shall now witness Pye eat pie I proceeded to devour it I couldn t recollect ever having eaten better pie I was almost prompted to ask the cook to slaughter another but instead carried the remaining quarter out to Mac A Rony When we had left the asylum I could not help but remark the scrutiny with which each man regarded the other At length we went into camp near a farm house where we certainly acquitted ourselves in a manner to arouse the suspicions of any sane observer We put our sleeping bag on the ground outside of the tent built a fire close to the tent on the windward side while a strong breeze was blowing cooked creamed potatoes in the coffee pot and steeped tea in the frying pan and Coonskin tied all three donkeys and the dog to a small sapling by their tails I felt sure that insanity was breaking out in our party in an aggravated form and congratulated Cheese Damfino and Don for not having eaten infected pie Camp Lunatic as we called it was visited by the owner of the farm a hospitable German who had a large family He gave us a generous donation of corn cobs for fuel milk butter fresh eggs and water then introduced his wife and children I asked him how he came to have such a large family He explained that he had a large farm and couldn t afford hired help and he thought the best way to remedy the difficulty was to rear boys to help him He looked hopeful although he had eight girls no boys Supper over the farmer conferred on me every possible honor even letting me hold his youngest girl a child of ten months He said enthusiastically he was going to name his boy after me the wife smiled heroically To cap the climax I was asked to write my name in the big family Bible The book was in German My host opened it to a blank page and without comment I inscribed my name underneath the strangely printed heading Gestorben thus pleasing the whole family When we reached our tent Barley began to find fault with me What for did yuse want to write your name on de Gestorben page he asked seriously Dat means bad luck dat does And why I inquired puzzled Gestorben is German and means death yuse crazy loon he returned It s de lunatic pie dat s workin already wese all goin crazy Next day was hot In the afternoon my party rested three hours in the shade of a peach orchard where we were treated to ice cream by the kind lady of the house close by It was about one hundred five miles from Lincoln to Hastings and we covered it in five days Threading the villages of Exeter Crete Friend and Dorchester we arrived in Grafton where I caught my courier in a dishonest trick and discharged him The party reached Hastings Thursday June seventeen where I purchased a saddle for Coonskin Detained by a thunderstorm we passed a miserable night in close quarters Next morning Mac pranced about like a circus donkey and trailed to Kearney in a manner almost to wind his fellows Before leaving Hastings the Superintendent of the Asylum for the Chronic Insane three miles out of town telephoned me to stop and dine with him On this occasion I rode into the asylum grounds without hesitation or nervousness You must earn your grub according to contract Professor said the Superintendent when the greetings were over pointing to a wood pile in the rear of the building As soon as I fairly began to comply with the suggestion his young lady secretary the daughter of a deceased and much esteemed congressman trained a camera on me and the axe and secured a picture I was then notified I had more than earned my dinner and was escorted into the family dining room where an enjoyable repast was accorded me after which some twenty wardens and matrons purchased photos at double price Then I resumed the journey with more heartfelt blessings than had been expressed to me on similar occasions The trail was superb But an intensely hot spell followed and made all of us perspire Two days of hard travel brought us to the old Government Reservation of fort Kearney established by general Fremont on his historic overland trip to California in pioneer days The fort has long since been abandoned There the Mormons camped for a short period after leaving Council Bluffs Next evening I made my camp on the site of the notorious Dirty Woman s Ranch of early days and spent a Sunday in delightful rest and recreation in the shade of the grove of wide spreading elms and cotton woods that sighed mournfully over the deserted scene Illustration Trail through the timber Illustration He had caught a nice mess Illustration Climbing Pike s Peak We crossed the long low bridge over the Platte early in the morning It required nearly an hour and all our wits and energies to get the donkeys across even after blindfolding them And when my party ambled into Kearney that sultry dusty June day grimy with dirt and perspiring we all were in ripe condition for a swim The little city looked to be about the size of Hastings but did not show the same enterprise and thrift In fact the inhabitants ventured out in the broiling sun with an excusable lack of animation and seemer to show no more interest in their local affairs than they did in Pye Pod s pilgrimage It was here I first saw worn the Japanese straw helmet It served as a most comfortable and effective sun shade and purchasing a couple we donned them at once Kearney is said to be the half way point by rail between New York and San Francisco My diary however showed I had covered fully two thousand miles of my overland journey I had consumed two hundred twenty seven days with only one hundred and thirty four days left me the prospects of accomplishing the feat in schedule time looked dubious enough The great Watson Ranch when my donkey party arrived was experiencing its busiest season But while the male representatives were in the fields the good matron in charge of the house made us welcome and treated us to cheering bowls of bread and milk When mister Watson junior arrived he showed us about the place and enlightened me about alfalfa of which he had over a thousand acres sown fifty hired hands were busy harvesting it For a week or two we had for the most part been trailing through the perfumed prairies at an invigorating altitude ranging from two thousand to nearly three thousand feet inhaling the fresh pure air gazing on the flower carpeted earth and enjoying a constant shifting of panoramic scenes of browsing herds and bevies of birds and occasional glimpses of the winding Platte and the sand dunes beyond The cities and villages that formed knots in the thread of our travels on the plains came into view like the incoming ships from the sea At first one spied a white church steeple in the distance like a pointed stake in the earth only a mile away but soon the chimneys and roofs and finally door yard fences would come into view then what we thought a village nearby proved to be as we journeyed onward a town of much greater size seven or eight miles beyond the point of calculation The crossbars on the telegraph poles along the straight and level tracks of the Union Pacific formed in the eye s dim perspective a needle as they seemed to meet with the rails on the horizon Little bunches of trees scattered miles apart and then overtopped by the spinning wheel of an air motor indicated the site of a ranch house where we might procure water The trail ahead became lost in a sea of flowers and grasses From time to time as I dismounted to ease myself and little steed I picked from the stirrups a half dozen kinds of flowers ensnared as my feet brushed through the grasses Great beds of blood red marshmallows natural parterres of the wax like blooms of the prickly pear scattering stems of the flowery thistle with white corollas as large as tulips and wild roses and daisies of all shades and colors the white and pink and the white wild roses being the first I ever saw these with varicolored flowers of all descriptions were woven into the prairie grasses and likened the far reaching plain to a great Wilton carpet enrolled from the mesa to the river Some of the sunsets were gorgeous At times the western sky glowed like a prairie fire and the sunrises were not less magnificent Sometimes we were overtaken by severe electric storms and obliged to pitch the tent in a hurry When the lightning illuminates the plains at night the trees and the distant towns are brought into fantastic relief against the darkness like the shifting pictures of a stereopticon A flash of lightning to the right reveals a church or school house to the left a bunch of cattle chewing the cud or grazing ahead of us a ranch house and sometimes to the rear a pack of cowardly coyotes at a safe distance either following my caravan or out on a forage hunt Often as the trains swept by the engineers would salute with a deafening blast of whistles frightening the donkeys and entertaining the passengers Some of the prairie towns which look large on the map have entirely disappeared In one case I found more dead citizens in the cemetery than live ones in the village Frequently as a means of diversion I left the saddle to visit these white chimney villages of the dead Such might be considered a grave sort of amusement but really some of the gravestones contained interesting epitaphs In one instance the following caught my eye God saw best from us to sever Darling Michael whom we love He has gone from us forever To the happy realms above Imagine the shock to my sobered senses on reading these lines cut on a white washed wooden slab close by Here lays Ezekiel Dolder Who died from a jolt in the shoulder He tried to shoot snipe While lighting his pipe And now underneath his bones moulder Just below the heartrending epitaph appeared in bold letters the satisfactory statement This monument is pade fer On the lonely plains miles from habitation a single grave fenced in with barbed wire in a circular corral I discovered a mate to the preceding epitaph which illustrates the utter abandon with which the rugged dashing bronco buster regards the perils of riding a bucking wild horse Here is buried my bronco Ah Sam Beside me I don t give a damn While bucking he killed me On this spot he spilled me And now the devil s I am Sometime before parting with my courier unknown to him we pitched camp one dark night in a graveyard Barley was an early riser and as we know as superstitious as he was gullible He was the first out of the tent at dawn Suddenly he rushed back exclaiming De Resurrection has came fellows an wese de first livin on earth agin And with terror in his eyes and voice dragged Coonskin and me to see a strange sight indeed There some forty feet from the tent stood a towering crucifix with a figure of the Saviour life size looking down upon us while about us were tablets and mounds the scene was so still and solemn no wonder that my awestricken courier thought the world had come to an end On the twenty fourth of June after a hot and dusty trail across an arid waste where only occasional patches of buffalo grass and cacti matted the earth in the place of the long prairie grass and flowers we were tramping in a few days before my weary troop jaded and hungry entered the little village of Overton CHAPTER XXXI BY MAC A RONY And the ass turned out of the way and went into the field and Balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way Book of Numbers Shortly after reaching Overton I took Pod with Coonskin and Don to pay our respects to Towserville a large dog town so closely situated to Overton as to inspire a rivalry far more serious than that existing between Minneapolis and saint Paul Overtonians complained of repeated raids made by prairie dogs of Towserville on their chickens and gardens On the other hand the Towser villians repudiated the calumny then fled in confusion from the charge of shotguns and rifles As our party approached with guns trained for a complimentary salute I saw his honor the Mayor seated in his hallway The roof of his mound towered above the other habitations and was undoubtedly the City Hall Copying after New York each burrow in Towserville had a representative in the City Council I m sure we would have been welcomed cordially had not Don wanted to be first to shake the Mayor s paw his honor abruptly excused himself to avoid a scene and his fellow townsdogs likewise with the result that the above dogtown population rushed in and slammed the doors in our faces The Professor was embarrassed He had no visiting cards so decided to leave at each door a sample box of cathartic pills and a careful distribution was made Next morning as we passed Towserville his dogcellency the Mayor his alderdogs and towndogs looked regretful of their slight to us as each stood at his door or sat with his housekeeper the owl on the roof of his dwelling nodding and waving at us Others however were prostrate either from remorse or Pod s magnanimity Sometime about noon we approached the shallow current of the Platte where we were unpacked and fed We donks were almost roasted from the sun s scorching rays Close by was a deep well but no bucket in which to draw water So Coonskin hitched a syrup can to the rope and drew water for Pod and himself Soon a drove of cattle accompanied by two ranchmen and a boy came down to the river to drink with us donks just to show there was no hard feeling The lad laid down to drink from the stream Here boy come and have a drink of cold water Pod called That ain t fit to drink Fitter n that well water answered the lad Said Pod I d like to know the reason Well replied the lad approaching I dropped a dead jackrabbit in the well a week ago Somehow the men had drunk so much of that cool well water they hadn t room for dinner too cool water I guess aint good for one when heated After the dishes were washed Pod took off everything but his socks and collar button and wrote his newspaper letter while Coonskin went prospecting Pretty soon the latter returned with a sand turtle and hitching it up in a rope harness said he was going to keep it for a pet He named it Bill He said it would make a fine center piece for the table it would keep the Buffalo gnats and mosquitos and flies off the victuals and if tied at the tent door no centipede or tarantula would dare enter Pod thought it a good scheme So when we packed up Bill was put in one of my saddle bags without my knowing it All new luggage was generally tied on to Damfino I supposed the turtle was After going a couple miles I felt something mysterious crawling on my back I looked around but my master was in the way so I up and kicked with all my might determined to scatter that crawling thing to the four winds but instead threw Pod completely over my head Then I ran pell mell down the desert trail kicking and braying with that terrible something gnawing my hair and bouncing and flopping with every jump I made I ran fast and thought fast and that thing stuck fast Suddenly I stopped laid down and tried to roll on it This I couldn t do on account of the saddle horn But while I was still trying the rest of the party came up and solved the mystery by capturing the turtle Bill then they chained him on Damfino and our outfit moved on peacefully for several miles the men talking merrily Said Pod Hitting the trail on the plains in summer isn t as comfortable as driving a city ice wagon Not much Coonskin returned but the donkeys and dog have their woes too Verily so confirmed the Professor For instance there s Damfino she thinks she s awfully persecuted Being a female she doesn t have much to say But how about Mac Doesn t he do more kicking than all the rest put together Oh well Coonskin answered you see Mac regards himself a pioneer and all the others mere tenderfeet I couldn t help grinning at the simple debate The fact of the case was our caravan had been growing larger with every day s travel New articles were continually added Cheese and I generally carried the men but to our saddles were hung guns revolvers cameras and the lantern not to mention a bundle of blankets all of which added to the burden of our thoughts a nagging whip and a pair of spurs and a million and one buffalo gnats mastodon mosquitos and other kindergarten birds of prey tended to make us lose our mental equilibrium a dozen times a day In my case there was a lump of avoirdupois in the saddle ranging between one hundred fifty and one hundred sixty pounds Sometimes Pod would get out of his seat and walk a mile or two to relieve me With Cheese it was much the same But that old spinster Damfino bore a burden increasing daily She was large and strong and couldn t appreciate fine sentiments or fine stuffs either even complaining of sand in the wind and coughed and snorted continually Her sawbuck saddle corset was laced tightly around her robust bust and to this unhealthsome vesture were hung on both sides large canvas panniers packed with canned goods medicines salves ink cow bells vegetables ham and bacon vinegar old shoes toilet articles including currycomb clothes soap flour salt baking powder cheese coffee tea kerosine oil matches cooking tools ammunition folding kitchen range and two dozen et ceteras On top and lopping over the panniers were roped the tent and tent poles folding beds canteens musical instruments axe and axle grease five iron picket pins packages of photos for sale a tin wash basin two tin pails extra ropes a half dozen paper pads and a dozen more et ceteras Beneath all that burden she ambled along without a murmur swinging her ears to help her outwalk the rest except Don who kept up a dog trot A ranchman gave Pod some new potatoes one day half of which I yanked out of the tent door at night and devoured and in reply to his habitual inquiry Where ll we stow em Coonskin said On Damfino of course When some canned goods were added to the list of poisons my master was puzzled Strap em on Damfino advised Coonskin Pod bought some canteens Where ll we put these he asked Oh hang em on Damfino somewhere said the wise Sancho One day a large package of chromos came and the Professor was discouraged How the d l can we carry these he asked with bewilderment Why ejaculated the valet chuckling right on Damfino Just then that silent old maid looked at the men and I saw blood in her eye Picture if you can our party trailing along the banks of the Platte that bright June afternoon A few miles away loomed the cacti covered sand dunes and between them and the river stared the desert of glistening alkali sprinkled with cacti and sage where an occasional steer was scratching an existence and mosquito bites We came to a muddy irrigation ditch where the water had leaked out Across it was an alfalfa field and beyond that an adobe ranch house We donks thought the mud in the ditch was stiff the green field looked tempting Damfino whispered that she would make a bolt for the field if we would follow and we said we would At once she shied into the ditch and the next minute was knee deep in quicksand and still sinking Cheese and I stood riveted to the trail while the men just gaped at Damfino with open mouths Damfino thinking she would soon be out of sight brayed as she never brayed before When Pod got his senses he yelled Let s pull her out What with Every rope and strap s on Damfino said the truthful valet running around like a head with the chicken cut off Coonskin tried to reach a rope and losing his balance put a foot in the quicksand Then all excited he attempted to pull his foot out and got them both in The Professor tried to reach a bridle rein to his comrade and went sprawling across the ditch on his corduroys and whiskers his arms elbow deep in the mire This put Don in a panic Seeing his master sinking he grabbed his boots and pulled them off Then he fastened his teeth in Pod s trousers and I expected to see them come off too but s help me Balaam the dog only pulled off one trouser leg when Coonskin managed to free himself by crawling over Pod s corduroy road to dry land and saved the day At once with a bridle rein the valet roped the Professor s feet and pulled him out after which both men fastened the reins to Damfino s pack and tied the other ends to the saddles of Cheese and myself Then that she ass wet and gray as a rat with her burden was dragged out of the ditch into the trail Well that quicksand pulled all the bad nature out of her and she went a long time before she was tempted to leave the trail again The men looked grateful as they wiped the brine from their faces and Pod remarked That was a narrow escape for all of us Our donkey party came within two of going ass under sure CHAPTER XXXII BY PYE POD It has come about that now to many a Royal Society the Creation of a World is little more mysterious than the cooking of a dumpling concerning which last indeed there have been minds to whom the question How the apples were got in presented difficulties Sartor Resartus It was noon at Big Springs the last village on the Union Pacific Railroad in Nebraska when I sat down to write in my dairy I had just finished a combination breakfast and dinner warranted to kill any appetite and keep it dead for twelve hours Consequently I wrote under great pressure Since striking Camp Coyote I had shot prairie dogs owls jack rabbits and gophers innumerable but on Wednesday June thirty I killed my first rattlesnake It was not the first we had seen but the first to lie in our path I wanted to shoot it s head off but instead of it losing its head I lost mine and severed its vertebrae The snake was three feet five and possessed eight rattles and a button Cookskin suggested that the button might come in handy in many ways You know Pod you are always losing buttons These dreaded reptiles abound on the plains particularly in dogtowns where they can dine on superfluous baby dogs when families become too large Three sorts of creatures including the owl animal bird and reptile bunk together companionably but have quarrels of their own doubtless like mankind in domestic affairs At that season the South Platte was drained for irrigation in Colorado I was riding peaceably along watching its morbid current and the gray hills beyond when suddenly my valet yelled to me Look out Pod a rattler ahead Coonskin was riding Cheese who leaped to one side but my own steed blinded by his spectacle frames walked on and stepped over the coiled snake which struck at my leg Fortunately my canvas legging protected me from the reptile s fangs which glanced off letting him fall in the trail Instantly I turned in my saddle and ended its miserable existence The report of my revolver attracted some cowboys who galloped up on their rope horses and accompanied us to their adobe house a few miles beyond It was five in the afternoon the day was hot and our journey long and dusty They were a jolly lot Thir ranch was a square sod structure without a floor and sparingly furnished but cool and comfortable We ll have hot biscuit for supper said one of the cowboys So you like cooking I remarked I pride myself on the dumplings I make and my flapjacks are marvels of construction Hang together well I suppose observed the cook smiling and piling buffalo chips in the stove I haven t tasted dumplings since I visited the World s Fair said another Well declared the first speaker my tenderfoot friend your oven will soon be hot and the flour soda shortening and apples are on the shelf Anything else you need ask for it I was in a bad fix I remembered the parrot that got into trouble with the bull terrier by talking too much It requires a long time to steam dumplings it will delay supper I protested We shan t turn you out if it takes you all night but we ll shoot the enamel off your front teeth if you don t make them apple dumplings and do your best said a cowboy All right boys I ll try my luck and you can save time by helping Sure all replied Fetch me the shortening I called Right before your eyes said one Blamed if I can see it I explained The fellow put his hands on a cake of greasy looking substance That s soap I said remonstrating with a chuckle All we use for shortening apologized the cook don t see much butter or lard out on this here desert I fell to with a will Before long my dough was mixed As I rolled it out with a tin can I directed a cowboy to put in the apples and roll up the dough Soon the dumplings were in the steamer and the cook began to prepare other eatables for the meal Then my duty done I watched two fellows throw the lariat and shoot the fly specks off Coonskin s hat in midair At last five hearty eaters sat down to dinner The cook s hot biscuits potatoes bacon eggs and coffee were delicious and I devoured them greedily But in the middle of our repast I turned my head in time to detect the cook meddling with the dumplings Shouldn t take off the cover till they re done I shouted makes em heavy Didn t take it off lifted itself off explained the man regarding me first then the steamer Man alive the dumplings are as big as cabbages And tain t more n likely they ve got their growth yet said Coonskin who examined the wonders Gracious I exclaimed How many apples did you cram into each dumpling Only fifteen or twenty the cook returned awfully small you know That explains the size of them said I You ve got a half dozen whole apples in each dumpling and a peck or more in the steamer Don t you know dried fruit swells But how am I to keep the lid on the steamer asked the hungry cook wistfully eying the disappearing meal Sit on it you crazy loon suggested a companion And the fellow did Presently there was a deafening report and the cook was lifted off the steamer while dumplings flew in every direction striking the ceiling and then from heaviness dropping on the floor One broke my plate into a dozen pieces Another hot and saucy dumpling shot through the bursted side of the steamer hitting one of the cowboys in the eye Just my luck I said they would have been as light as a feather Light exclaimed the injured fellow with a handkerchief against his scalded optic It was the heaviest thing that ever hit me let me tell you and I ve been punching cattle seven years When the excitement was over and we had found sufficient grub to complete our meal all assembled in the cool outer air where Coonskin and I entertained with our musical instruments until bedtime Next morning on my suggestion a cowboy threw his lariat round my body good naturedly and pulled me over but before I could right myself Don took three bounds and pulled the fellow down by the shoulder frightening one and all I shouted so loudly to the dog that I was hoarse for a week That demonstration of Don s loyalty was a revelation to me The man was not injured although his coat was torn The lack of energy and enterprise of the town of the western plains was both surprising and amusing I expected a package of photos at Willow Island When I called for it I was informed that the railroad station had burned a few months before and that their express stopped at Cozad which I had passed through So I wrote to have the package forwarded to a station farther west Gothenburg the next town was in a decline the reaction of a boom A traveler approaching it expects to find a business center Many stores and dwellings were of brick but whole rows were vacant at the time The soothing melody of the squalling infant was only a memory to the village druggist the itinerant butcher and milkman had ceased their daily rounds and all that was left to distinguish the half deserted village from the desert was an occasional swallow that went down the parched mouth of a chimney There is another town characteristic of the plains I had a letter to post at Paxton but forgot it some miles beyond a ranchman whom we met said I would find a post office at Korty five miles further on After traveling two hours we could see no vestige of a village anywhere Don ran ahead to the top of every sand hill and stood on his hind feet to have the first peep at the mysterious town I came to the conclusion the ranchman had said twenty five miles instead of five Finally the trail approached the railroad I see the town of Korty my valet exclaimed Where I asked There Plain as day Can t you see it he asked pointing straight ahead I must confess I can t I replied Let me look over your finger Then I saw it It wasn t one hundred feet away A single white painted post stood beside the track and on it was nailed a cross bar lettered in bold type Korty underneath was a letter box That was the town There was no section house no water tank no break in the wire fence and there being of course no general delivery window in the post office I did not ask for my mail On the way to North Platte we passed the site of old fort McPherson where Buffalo Bill the celebrated scout once lived and won his fame and title by providing buffalo meat for the Government and also the site of a notorious Pawnee village now called Pawnee Springs We reached North Platte situated at the confluence of the North and South Platte rivers which form the great River Platte Saturday afternoon and spent Sunday in a manner to meet the approval of the most pious That first evening I lectured from a large dry goods box on a prominent corner Sunday afternoon an old friend and classmate drove me into the country to the famous Scout s Rest Ranch the estate of mister Cody Buffalo Bill where I saw a herd of buffalo and a cornfield of five hundred acres There is quite a contrast between your cornfield and mine I said to the manager How big a cornfield have you Just a small one I replied One acher on each big toe I see only sufficient for your own use came the response your stock in trade as it were Then the ranchman purchased a photo and we two grown up school boys drove back to town in time to escape a thunder shower The country between North Platte and Julesburg is a desolate and barren region Occasionally we could see a ranch house sometimes cattle grazing on I knew not what There was plenty of alkali grass in the bottom lands of the Platte and further back on the mesa patches of the short and nutritious buffalo grass half seared by the scorching sun The railway stations with one or two exceptions consisted of water tanks and section houses where water could be procured At Ogalala we met a train load of Christian Endeavorers and had a chance to quench our thirst CHAPTER XXXIII BY MAC A RONY What a thrice double ass Was I to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool Tempest Where and how to celebrate the Fourth of July greatly concerned Pye Pod The third was spent in Julesburg a town in Colorado two miles west of the boundary line as Sunday was the Fourth we naturally expected a lively programme for Saturday We were disappointed Everybody had gone off on an excursion and Julesburg was dead So my master realizing the long journey before us inquired as to the possibility of obtaining an extra donkey and was told of one some six miles from town He rode in a buggy to a ranch right after lunch and brought back the prettiest damsel I ever saw Her name was Skates Pod said he so named her because she ran all the way and beat his pride broken wind broken horse into town I gave Skates a loving smile but she gave me a look which said Keep your distance young feller So I did But I lost my heart to that girl then and there Pod noticed my leaning toward Skates and asked me my intentions I frankly told him But what nonsense for a youth of four years he remarked Mac be patient wait until you are of age at least Time was precious and we could not tarry That afternoon we set out for Sterling sixty miles into the desert where it was said there would be a big time on the fifth Monday dawned cloudy and threatening as is usual with celebration days The tent door was open and Skates and I were looking in I waiting for a chance to pull a bag of eatables out of the tent for her What is your programme for to day Pod asked his valet No answer The question was repeated still no response Then my master turned drowsily on his pillow and beheld Coonskin with bloodshot eyes and the only whiskey bottle clasped lovingly to his breast The valet wanted to say something but his lips refused to speak It was evident that his celebration had begun the night before Pod sat up and rubbed his eyes to make sure he was not dreaming and then asked the fellow why he drank all the emergency whiskey R r r r r r r rat schnake bite bite bited me d drank whisky t shave life stammered the youth H h h hic have shome Prof Pod looked mad He up and dressed and mixed soda and water and lemon juice and made Coonskin drink it Soon the tipsy fellow tried to dress but finally gave it up and went to sleep Two hours later he awoke quite sober and came out to where Pod was currying me for the celebration and showed him his programme I haven t space to give it in full One feature was an obstacle race the prize for the winner being a quart bottle of snake bit whiskey Coonskin said as his excuse for drinking the whiskey that he was certain of winning the race but afraid the bottle might be broken before the event Pod thought that reasonable enough and forgave him but he told me confidentially that he didn t know what he should do if he were bitten by a rattlesnake without whiskey at hand I suggested in such event he should point a revolver at Coonskin s garret where his brains ought to have been and make him suck out the poison The obstacle race began at eleven in the morning The start was made from the tent door the course and conditions were as follows Run to the fifth fence post down the trail alongside the railroad track crawl through the barbed wire fence four times between different posts on the way back to the tent without tearing clothes creep through the legs of the little portable table purchased in Julesburg without rolling off an egg resting on it run a hundred yards and unpicket one of the donkeys and ride it round the tent three times with a spoon in hand holding an egg ride the donk back to his picket pin and crawl between its hind legs without disturbing the animal s equilibrium stand in the tent door and shoot some hair off one of the donkey s tails without touching the tail proper then lead that donkey to the tent and hitch him to the turtle Bill Cheating if detected forfeited the prize Well while there were two starters there was only one finisher It seems that Coonskin shot a piece off Cheese s tail improper the donk said and in consequence man and donk disappeared over the horizon without leaving their future address or the date for their return Coonskin rode Cheese into camp after dark Then he rubbed axle grease on Cheese s sensitive part and prepared the delayed dinner Next came fire works Roman candles firecrackers and pin wheels after which both men retired fancying they had the jolliest Fourth ever witnessed by man or donkey in the history of the Colorado desert CHAPTER XXXIV BY PYE POD Sancho Panza hastened to his master s help as fast as his ass could go and when he came up he found the knight unable to stir such a shock had Rosinante given him in the fall Don Quixote The casualty which terminated our celebration on the fifth seemed to portend bad luck The metaphorical lightning first struck me We struck camp that hot July day before the sun was an hour high and a mile beyond trailed through a dog town reservation I had long been desirous of securing a prairie dog to have mounted as a rule one can pick off these shy creatures only at long rifle range This morning stealing up behind a cornfield I wounded a dog then dropping my gun ran to catch him before he could escape into his hole Crawling through a barbed wire fence without afterward appearing in dishabille is considered by a tenderfoot the feat of feats Before I reached the hole half undressed the dog had tumbled into it He must have made a mistake however for out the fellow came and made for another hole I grabbed him but instantly dropped him for he tried to bite me Then like a shot he dived into the second hole and I thrust my arm in to pull him out But my hand came out quite as fast as it went in It was bitten and at the mouth of the hole I now detected for the first time the tail of a rattlesnake That was an awful moment What should I do My whiskey was gone I had no antidote for the poison I rushed to where Coonskin was waiting with my outfit Make for the house he exclaimed A ranch house stood some two miles away but not a soul was in sight Still that seemed to be my only salvation I realized a painful death was the only alternative With a hundred other thoughts rushing into my head I ran toward the distant house Coonskin began picketing the donkeys and promised to follow While racing madly through the cacti and sage I thought of my past from three months upward Just when I had reached an episode which almost ended my reckless career at the age of ten I heard the sound of galloping hoofs and a moment later a young woman reined her steed at my side dismounted and gave me her horse Into the saddle quick man she cried Mother has turpentine and whiskey The horse will take the fence and ditch Pull leather stick to the saddle never mind the stirrups and to the horse Git home Topsy Run for your life old girl Like a flash the big mare sped forward with the velocity of the wind To pull leather in the parlance of the cowboy means to grip the saddle with the hands For a cow puncher to pull leather is deemed disgraceful for Pod it was excusable Although the mare fairly flew she did not travel half fast enough to suit me With reins round the saddle horn I gripped the saddle with my left hand and sucked the bite on my right but suddenly the mare took a hop skip and jump over the fence and ditch fell to her knees and threw me over her head When I sat up I saw a woman in the door of the house yet a half mile away no doubt wondering how a maniac happened to be on her daughter s steed The next moment Coonskin arived all out of breath and assisted me to the house Before we could fully explain the situation the good woman disappeared soon to return with a bottle of turpentine which she turned nozzle down over the snake bite while my valet poured whiskey down my throat They say it takes a long time and much whiskey to affect one bitten by a rattler but this case seemed to be an exception in a few moments my head was going round and I prostrate on a couch My kind nurse looked curiously at the turpentine and finally said it was queer it didn t turn green as it should in the case of a rattle snake bite A half hour passed and still there was no change Then when I repeated my story of how the thing happened she grinned and said she guessed it was the prairie dog and not the snake that bit me after all I was so dead drunk when the daughter came that she glanced at me and asked in a whisper Is he dead No said the mother and he ain t going to die We ve been trying to cure dog bite with snake bit and I reckon it ll take a week or more to sober the man up Then the daughter began to get a meal and Coonskin went after my outfit on the good woman s suggestion to fetch my animals to the corral It was not until morning that I was fit to sit my saddle but I made the effort and after thanking my hostesses and insisting on paying for the turpentine we said good bye Mid day travel in the Colorado desert at that season was enervating in the extreme Our straw helmets being supported by a skeleton crown allowed a free circulation of air over and about the head also a free circulation of buffalo gnats blue flies mosquitos flying ants grasshoppers and everything else that hadn t an excuse for living Everything seemed to be free in that country The sunrays beat down mercilessly on the sandy plain and every live thing seemed to be in search of shade or water Once while crossing the dry and cracked bed of a stream I saw a rabbit almost dying of thirst and I put an end to its agony with my six shooter In the narrow bars of shade cast by the fence posts along the railroad could be seen occasional birds standing on the hot sand immovable with bills wide open panting from the excessive heat We reached Sterling late that night after a twenty eight mile journey The town looked dull Everybody complained of the hottest weather for years It occurred to me that an awning would add greatly to our comfort so I bought the canvas and had one made Henceforth we would travel at night and sleep as much as possible in the day beneath the awning I also purchased a light folding chair which with our table and stove could easily be carried on Skates the new donkey We pitched camp eight miles from town near a sod house and well On the way the donkeys became obstreperous and before they were under control our only lantern was smashed This stroke of bad luck was the forerunner of other misfortunes As I fell on my hard bed expecting to have a delightful rest I voiced a righteous yell of pain and leaped out of doors I was a fair imitation of a porcupine Coonskin had carelessly pitched the tent on a bed of cacti The astonished fellow made profuse apologies and set to the task of picking the cactus spears out of me by the flare of lighted matches But for a week I suffered the sensations of sleeping on pins and needles The turtle Bill deserves some notice He was put in the center of a table at meal time to catch flies but all that stupid turtle did was to scrape them off his head by drawing it under his shell He disdained the carnivorous diet Millions of insects swarmed about the table where before only thousands had gathered attracted doubtless by Bill They literally covered our food and all we could safely eat was flapjacks Holding a fork against the mouth we could with lips and tongue draw a flapjack in through the tines by which delicate operation all flies and other insects were scraped off and in course of time a fairly good meal was conveyed to our stomachs Of course one s success depended upon the strength of the flapjacks Most of them stood the strain The afternoon of July eleven we saw Long s Peak the first spur of the Rocky Mountains in view The following evening we rode into Fort Morgan Journeying on to escape the heat of the day we came at midnight to where several trails crossed and were puzzled which to take Put the responsibility on the donkeys I finally suggested They ve great instinct Good idea commented my valet I ve often heard of horses taking lost hunters out of the woods So giving the word my caravan resumed the march in the darkness and went into camp about four in the morning When I arose about noon I was surprised to find ourselves on the outskirts of a village I called Coonskin with a feeling of suspicion dawning in my mind The blasted town looks familiar said my valet About that time a cowboy rode up and I asked him the name of the town Fort Morgan he answered Have you fellows lost anything Coonskin and I eyed each other then both gazed thoughtfully at the jackasses I was provoked about the loss of that night s journey to think of our following our donkey s ears round an imaginary race course in the desert some twenty odd miles was not conducive to a good temper Many well meaning persons had advised me to carry a compass Some day some night they said I would stray from the trail I resolved to purchase such an instrument immediately on reaching Denver We spent the afternoon enjoying the luxuries of our new awning and camp chairs I writing my article for the press Coonskin reading a thrilling dime novel This is life remarked my napping valet as he rolled over on his pillow You bet I replied we know who we are I suppose there are lots of folks who don t know Prof he returned but they ll find out before we reach Frisco But Coonskin I asked looking up from my writing do you know where we are I had no sooner put the question than a whirlwind swept down upon the camp and scattered everything broadcast Tent awning table chairs ink and writing pad packing cases and articles of all kinds not to mention dog donkeys and men chased each other over the cacti and sand the tent half inflated rolled over in the scudding wind like a balloon No I don t said Coonskin gaining a sitting posture a rod from where I stood on my head some hundred yards from our original camp What are you talking about are you wandering I asked I think the whole shooting match has been wandering some said he picking the sand out of his eyes It was long before we collected our belongings I never found my letter for the press Just before sunset we took up the march across the broad rolling plains which grew tiresome to look upon before darkness set in But occasionally a hand car with its sloop rigged sails set to the wind would speed over the rails in the distance like a cat boat before a gale and break the monotony of the scene This mode of travel appears to be characteristic of the Western plains alone We saw innumerable buffalo wallows great depressions in the sand where the vast herds of buffalo in the early days wallowed in the cool earth for salt and to escape the heat and pestering gnats In most cases these wallows are covered with cacti and other desert verdure and are apt to upset the unwary traveler after dark unless he keeps to the beaten trail At a little before sunset we arrived at the great D Horse Ranch where we watered our animals and accepted the ranchman s invitation to supper CHAPTER XXXV BY MAC A RONY That is the idea for Juliet s a dear sweet mere child of a girl you know and she don t bray like a jackass Huckleberry Finn We did not tarry at the D Horse Ranch but later on pitched camp near a sheep ranch run by a Mexican who met us with a grunt that nobody understood Gee how I wish I could speak Spanish remarked Pod facing the squatty ranchman It was comical to watch Coonskin s puzzled face I once studied Spanish but why didn t I master it Just two words can I remember porque why and manana to morrow But how can they help me To utter them would be to ask why to morrow And there would be no sense in that But it might convey the idea I interrupted that either you know more than you looked to know or appeared to know more than you do know and that would be something My master did not answer but when the Mexican came around again he said to him Porque manana The Mexican laughed who could blame him and said something about Espanola a young lady I never heard tell of and invited us all to the corral except the men who followed him to the house Nothing like Mexican hospitality when one understands the language as Pod did At first the Mexican did not comprehend that we all were thirsty The Professor asked for a drink in many varieties of expression concluding with a desperate Porque Manana at the same time pointing to the well The Mexican grinned and replied in a peculiar vernacular and handed him a huge tin cup Pod next inquired the right trail to Brighton in many artistic demonstrations of verbal inflection and gesticular design and wound up with a heroic Porque Manana The mystified sheep herder shook his head quizzically and began to pour out a whole tubful of liquid linguistics which my pedantic master drained to the dregs without discovering their meaning then he shook hands with the gracious host and gave the word to hit the trail Mighty lucky you understood Spanish mister Pod Coonskin remarked when we were some distance from the house I d give a farm to speak it like you That tickled Pod s vanity and he told his flattering valet that Spanish could not be learned in a day but perhaps sometime he would give him a few lessons just to prepare him for an emergency That night we donks were picketed to a rickety barbed wire fence and the men pitched the tent close by cooked and went to bed early Seldom had been so much care taken to prevent my getting wound up in the rope so I couldn t eat or lie down In the morning there was a surprise for everybody S help me Balaam if there wasn t a circus then I never saw one We donks were completely tangled in the dismantled wire fence and cutting up capers to beat a side show I kept my eye peeled on the tent door for an hour Finally Pod came out took in the situation at a glance and then sat down on a cactus for less than a fraction of a second to laugh I was proud of the role I played in that matinee There I was with a fence post wired to each of my legs which raised my feet off the ground walking about on veritable stilts and close behind me followed Cheese and Skates with a post yoking their necks together like oxen while Damfino was rolling over and over unmindful of the cacti as if our extraordinary sport were for her special entertainment We were quiet until Cheese suddenly opened his mouth and brayed with glee I told him to shut up Says I Pod will think we got in this fix on purpose and give us Hail Columbia Pod looked worried He said he wondered how they could dismount that giraffe meaning me no doubt without breaking his legs I didn t feel comfortable so far above the earth the atmosphere was chilly and the rarified air made me dizzy but that remark frightened me The trick was at last accomplished Coonskin held my fore stilts while Pod braced his feet and with a violent push threw me over on my side on a pile of blankets and pillows Well let me tell you my donkey friends it required two hours to free us from the fence posts and wire After that both men busied themselves like Red Cross Nurses Skates said they were cross nurses of some sort and bandaged up our cuts and scratches then after breakfast they saddled and packed us for the day s journey I never want another experience like that On Thursday night I think I ate up Pod s only calendar we again wandered from the trail and about two o clock camped near a cottonwood tree which seemed to indicate we were near water Although I was awfully dry I had to wait till morning It was pleasant to be lulled to sleep by the rustling of leaves and it was consoling to know something besides us donks had to rustle yet there we were in the boundless desert Don s barking awoke us early A ranchman rode up and said we would find plenty of water yonder at the well the only water for many miles around then he rode away There was one long row of cottonwood trees hundreds of feet apart stretching for a mile or two across the desert as if planted by birds fifty years ago Pod took us empty donks and canteens over to the well That was the novelest thing I ever saw and the water was the coolest I ever tasted An iron wheel turned in a cog and drove a piston rod down a deep well the power being furnished by a meek looking horse which walked round the pump in circus fashion thinking he was the whole show and pulled a sort of walking beam that turned the cog wheel There the ranchman and his big small boy rode every morning many miles from home to pump water for their cattle which ate they evidently had eaten everything in sight during the day and chewed their cud at night in the cottonwood shade That morning when several miles nearer our goal a stiff wind introduced itself and increased in velocity until such speed was attained that the men had to stop traveling and tie the whole outfit to the picket pins driven in the ground That gale beat the tornado on the shore of Lake Erie and the cyclone near Sterling We donks had to lie down with our backs to the wind for Damfino not thinking lay the other way at first and the wind blew into her mouth so fast she swelled up twice her natural size She was so full of air that she arose and turned around before being able to lie down again Pod said it was a good time to write his letter for the paper So he hitched his shoulders to ropes tied to picket pins about five feet apart and sat in a camp stool and facing the gale laid his writing pad on the wind and finished his article in fine style When I asked him how the wind could be so strong as to brace up both the pad and his story he said he was writing in a lighter vein than usual We were in sight of Brighton next morning when a strange accident happened to Pod We were approaching a field of grain on an irrigated ranch when suddenly he was struck on the head by a mastodon grasshopper and knocked senseless out of the saddle At once Don chased the creature and headed him off while Coonskin lassoed him and bound him on Damfino We took the wonder to Denver There Pod put the thing in a bottle of alcohol but it hadn t been there more than a half hour when it kicked out the bottom and almost upset a street car in trying to escape Again the grasshopper was captured then poisoned and skinned and the bones were expressed to the Smithsonian Museum About one o clock we left the line of the B M railroad and cut across the plain six miles to the Union Pacific which we had left on the previous week Then we began to descend into the verdant valley of the Platte Great fields of grain waved in the breeze on either hand The song of the reaper was cheering the glistening snow on the distant Rockies cooling At last our caravan ambled into Brighton It impressed me as a pretty town after crossing a two hundred mile desert I was in condition to compliment any sort of a place That night we traveled ten miles and camped near the Nine Mile House where next morning we were disappointed not to obtain breakfast Beautiful far famed Denver loomed up on the distant plain The smoke from her smelters curled on high a dusky sign of prosperity We breakfasted three miles nearer the city and at two P M our picturesque outfit strode up Seventeenth street and anchored in front of the Albany Hotel Denver at last CHAPTER XXXVI BY PYE POD At the head of the procession strode the four heralds Silently they marched in silence the populace received them The spectacle reminded very old men of the day the great Axaya was born in mournful pomp to Chapultepec The Fair God When I had taken a bird s eye view of Denver and visited many of its handsome streets and buildings and met its hospitable citizens I dubbed it one of the most attractive cities One of the first to greet me was a member of the Jacksonian Club who invited me to attend a lawn party to be given at the home of a fellow member The grounds were illuminated with Japanese lanterns and a platform was erected for speech making while indoors were served refreshments In the midst of the pleasant proceedings a gentle rain frightened everybody into the house where dancing closed the festivities Of course every pretty girl wanted to dance with Pod Sunday seemed to be the accepted day for sight seeing The Seeing Denver car electric made two twenty five mile trips a day threading the more attractive portions of the city and suburbs and giving the passengers a splendid idea of the beauties and possibilities of Denver Each car was manned by a director who clearly described all points of interest en route Finally the car was stopped on the heights overlooking Clear Creek Valley where in eighteen fifty eight Gregory a North Carolina prospector discovered gold in quartz and proved his theory that all placer ore came from a mother lode People in the East hearing that gold could be found here in quartz hurried to the spot resolved to be contented if they could only find it in pints While many were disappointed within a year one hundred and seventy quartz mills were erected and in eighteen sixty Colorado s gold output amounted to four million dollars The Colorado farmer raises everything in the fruit and vegetable line that can be produced in the East Through the system of irrigation the soil is brought to such a state of production that one farmer near Denver was reaping a revenue of five thousand dollars a year from a twenty acre plot One of our best crops is tomatoes said our guide with the view of enlightening some possible investor There you can see in the distance is one of our largest canneries It cans tomatoes only All the tomatoes they can are raised around Denver and all the tomatoes not consumed in the city are sent to this cannery to be canned They raise all they can and what they can t raise they can t can They eat all they can and all they can t eat they can Moreover all they can t can they eat and what they eat they can t can All canned tomatoes they can and cannot eat they ship to those who can t visit Denver to eat all they can If you can visit the cannery and see them can all they can and eat what they can t can and can t eat a can yourselves you then only can understand why it is they can t eat what they can and can t can what they eat Can you not When he had finished three women cried Later on the journey the car was stopped in a different quarter of the suburbs where several got off to pluck wild flowers In the course of our tour many attractive buildings were pointed out among them the Consumptive s Home erected by philanthropists of the East and the several smelting mills one of which boasts of a chimney four hundred feet in height the tallest on the continent While the ladies were gathering wild flowers I was persuaded to perpetrate a practical joke suggested by two jovial Johnny Bulls I had become quite chatty with their party They had the impression that I was a cowboy and when they discovered their error they proposed I should jostle a fellow countryman of theirs as soon as they could decoy him off the car they claiming that he still believed me a real cow puncher out for a holiday They said it was his first trip to America and that he had frequently expressed a curiosity to see one of those wild men of the plains On promises of their support in case of offense being taken I chuckled and awaited my chance Presently the man was persuaded to pick a wild rose and as he was about to pass me I backed roughly against him almost sending him off his feet When he had regained his equilibrium and was on the point of rebuking me I turned furiously upon him Say you foreign tenderfoot I said you got a preemption on the whole earth If so just fence it in Don t yer brush me that way agin or I ll show yer how we trim moustaches out in this country when our razors ain t sharp Understand As I uttered these words I put my hand on my hip pocket My sombrero was tilted and the attitude I struck would have amused any real cowboy The astonished Englishman red in the face edged away in silence and eyed me narrowly Turn your lamps the other way or I ll shoot off yer eyebrows I shouted At once the innocent butt of our ungentlemanly joke ventured to apologize for the carelessness that was not his when a peal of laughter from behind told plainly that the joke was off I turned to see everybody in a fit of laughter I now began to feel embarrassed and had not my confederate immediately explained the case and introduced me to their imposed upon comrade I certainly would have felt very awkward As it was the tourist laughed heartily at the joke complimented me on my art in acting and gave me a cordial handshake At our journey s end I was introduced to all the ladies and induced to pose for their cameras after which I departed with the well wishes of all I must not overlook an amusing incident of the trip One of the passengers was an Irishman who caused much merriment by a stroke of wit or a blunder just as the car stopped in front of the City Hall This lovely park which you see said the director has been brought to its present beautiful condition by levying a tax of one mill on all property owners The burden you see was light for each person and just to all Light was it the Emerald Islander exclaimed Begorry mills must be dom plintiful in these parts whin every mon is willin to give uup a mill for an interist in a parruk Be dad it must ha been rough on th mon that owned but one mill It was thot Whereupon our erudite guide politely dissertated on the great difference in mills to the amusement of the English party and the Hibernian s satisfaction Before leaving Denver I found it advisable to add considerable to my traveling equipment I ordered a tin canteen from my own design to hold a gallon of water and within it was fashioned a receptacle for holding two pounds of butter Its value was constantly appreciated when crossing the deserts where we were enabled to carry butter and an extra quantity of drinking water which was kept cool by wrapping the canteen with cloth and canvas and keeping them in a moist condition I also purchased a large basket covered demijohn of port wine for medicinal purposes an extra pack saddle and camp supplies Although that altitude of five thousand feet was quite invigorating the sun at that season was unusually warm and I intended to enjoy as much camp life as possible We took a southerly course towards Pike s Peak threading the villages of Littleton Castle Rock Sedalia and Monument and the city of Colorado Springs The scenic beauties of Colorado became more manifest every day Sunday afternoon I observed in the southwest a dark cloud draw a threatening hood over that giant discovery of eighteen oh six by colonel Zebulon M Pike and I decided to camp in the vicinity of a dairy ranch Anticipating a shower I rode Skates my fastest donkey to the house with canteen and pail leaving Coonskin to unpack pitch tent and build a wood pile under shelter On approaching the house I detected a pretty dairymaid in the doorway I endeavored to dismount from my asinine steed with grace but the picture so unbalanced me that I caught a foot in a stirrup and fell heels over appetite on the ground at my charmer s very feet much to my embarrassment and her amusement Can you spare me a quart of milk Miss I inquired lifting my hat She smiled Then fearing lest I might have created the impression of begging I asked can you sell some I mean to pay for it of course My words seemed to break her spell and she replied sweetly We have two kinds cream and skimmed milk And her eyes sparkled I caught my breath and gave her a chance to lose hers Per per perhaps you might mix the two safely mightn t you I now felt the crisis coming and twisted myself nervously The maid laughed It quieted my nerves But she returned you see the cream is all engaged and and I would not like to sell you the skimmed milk because because we feed that to the hogs I smiled now and tried to answer Well what is good enough for hogs ought and I hesitated feeling I was getting things twisted but she came to the rescue nobly What you mean is what is good enough for you ought to be good enough for hogs eh Thank you I said What you say goes and I handed her the pail which she accepted with a shy courtesy As she hurried to the spring house I watched her admiringly until foosteps behind caused me to turn around Behold there was another young lady tall and becomingly gowned even prettier than the other The softness of her brown lustrous eyes bespoke the tenderness in her nature Even Don interpreted this when she patted his head and observed What a nice dog you have The expression nice dog was very familiar to Don and they were no sooner uttered than the huge dog arose to the occasion by planting his fore paws against the lady s breast and attempting to steal a kiss The shock would have upset her completely if I had not caught her in my arms It was therefore under somewhat embarrassing circumstances that the dairy maid witnessed the embrace embarrassing to all save the dog Explanations will only make matters worse I thought so I took the pail and kept mum though I know I looked anything but innocent Business over we conversed until it began to sprinkle and then after accepting the ladies invitation to spend the evening with them I cantered back to camp I feared you had gone on to Frisco said Coonskin I m dying for a drink of water Indeed I had forgotten to fill the canteen all on account of those charming girls I declare Coonskin I explained I had such a time persuading the folks to sell me a little milk that I never thought of water I ll hurry back for it And not giving my companion time to anticipate me or stopping to mount a donkey I did the errand on foot That evening we passed a pleasant hour with wine women and song and departed with another invitation to a fish and game dinner next day if I would tarry and provide trout and birds Of course I tarried Coonskin accompanied me into the canyon next morning with rod and line and in the afternoon with gun and bag By five he had caught a nice mess of trout and I had shot a young jack rabbit It was a delicious repast that was served us by those New England girls We ate fish till their tails stuck out of our mouths The bread tasted like angel s food and the beans were well done in spite of the fact it required a whole day to cook beans in that altitude I smacked my lips and said to myself I ll eat heartily now for it ll be long before I ll get another dinner like this On the way to the Springs next day I suggested to Coonskin that we climb the Peak and see the sun rise Why is sunrise up there any finer than it is down here he inquired I thought he was making a mental calculation of the number of steps and labored breaths and obsolete words the ascent would require Certainly I said the reflections to be seen from that altitude are more beautiful and varied than from the plains They re more beautiful perhaps but I ve been riding a mule over three months now and my reflections are about as varied as anything could make em My donkey party reached Colorado Springs in time for dinner Illustration Independence Pass one of the loftiest of the Continental Divide Illustration Trail to Florisant Illustration Two days of hard climbing to cross Western Pass CHAPTER XXXVII BY MAC A RONY The Professor scorning to waste shoe leather and economize francs began the ascent on a mule steered by a woman holding on to the beast s tail Easter on the Riviera A curious proceeding held my rapt attention as we neared Petersburg a suburb of Denver At the terminus of a horse car line I observed a car approaching us down grade with a horse on its rear platform As soon as the car stopped at the station the horse stepped off on a platform and took his place in front of the car ready to haul it up grade again and earn another ride I did not have the chance to ask the horse how he enjoyed it but I would willingly have exchanged places with him Next morning to my surprise Coonskin was the first to rise Our camp was near Littleton on the banks of a small stream and here at early dawn that ambitious youth gathered a panful of glittering wet sand and rushed into the tent with it almost out of breath Look here Pod he called excitedly see the strike I ve made The river bottom is yellow with gold Then I heard Pod say Rich I should say Funny this placer hasn t been discovered before now Let s file a claim said Coonskin we can make a million in six months Let s the Professor exclaimed As soon as breakfast was over both tenderfeet were trying their luck at panning gold A cabin stood not far away and presently there issued from it an old man who approached the argonauts and sat on a log to watch them Your first experience at placer mining the stranger observed For an instant both men looked confused I could see that Coonskin didn t want to reveal his newly discovered fortune by the way he dumped his sand and said nothing But Pod held on to a frying pan full of sand with one hand and reached for his revolver with the other to defend his claim Well boys observed the native laughing you re goin through jest what all tenderfeet do when they first strike these parts try to wash gold dust out of mica All the streams out here re filled with them glist ning particles but recollect boys all what glitters ain t gold That you ve got s called fool s gold It was plain that Pod was disappointed but the stranger gave him some good advice and a large Colorado diamond for a keepsake then strolled away leaving two sadder but wiser men The road to Colorado Springs was a popular thoroughfare for bicyclists Saturday afternoon as we donks began the ascent of a long steep and winding incline a din of voices and a whir of wheels suddenly sounded ahead and a party of fifty or more young men and women in gala attire came speeding down toward us As quickly as possible we donks turned out to the right I think the bicyclists must have been English for they steered to the left In a minute it was all off It happened that the leader of the wheel brigade saw us donks too late and tried to save himself by turning suddenly to his right Result Tire off and man off Sequel A wild rough and tumble conglomeration of sexes as his followers mixed up with our party Bicycles donkeys men women lunch baskets packs hats petticoats and cameras were distributed in all directions The cries and shrieks of the bruised and frightened together with the confusion of the wreckage so terrified us donks that as soon as we could pick ourselves up we reared on our haunches and cavorted and brayed and so help me Balaam it was the worst mix up I was ever in When every man had assisted some one else s girl to her equilibrium a council of war assembled to adjust grievances and repair machines but the proceedings did not interest the Professor for he hustled us donks up hill and out of sight as quickly as possible The din of voices soon sounded in the distance like a swarm of yellow jackets Colorado City was a gambling resort lying between Colorado Springs and Manitou Our stop there was all too brief While Pod and Coonskin were at feed we donks stole down street to watch a play That was the time I regretted having eaten the five dollar bill back in Iowa for three times in succession the roulette ball dropped on my colors and by compounding the principal and interest each time I could have made a beautiful scoop which might have given us donks a high old time Thence onward Pike s Peak was the chief topic of discussion To begin with Pike s Peak is the largest mountain of its size in the world Cats can t live ten minutes on the summit before going crazy and dogs even lose their bark at the timber line I concurred with Pod that it would be a big feat to climb the Peak On the other hand Cheese and Skates demurred from our opinion Skates positively declined to leave the stable and Cheese backed her up by putting both fore feet in the manger Damfino stood by Pod and me She argued that when one has climbed to an elevation of fourteen thousand one hundred forty seven feet above sea level he is likely to feel a blamed sight nearer heaven than he is ever apt to be again The result was that Damfino and I alone accompanied the men on that adventuresome trip Everything went well until we struck the cog track in Engleman s Canyon It was the first experience for us donks in hitting the ties I did not fancy the route at all But Pod having seen a boy ride a native burro up the track resolved to do no less The first half mile was not steep and the men rode us donks but when we caught up with a party of men and women making the ascent an ambitious boy grabbed my tail and allowed me the privilege of dragging him a hundred yards before the Prof discovered him and dismounted How I thanked the boy for his thoughtfulness Damfino lagged behind She had changed her mind The consequence was we donks were driven ahead and Coonskin no sooner hit Damfino a whack with the butt of his six shooter then she began to pace so fast none of us could keep up with her When we came to the steep twenty five per cent grade the men were winded not so we donks The men called to us but we would not listen They threw stones at us and we quickened our gait The men couldn t run up grade to save their lives whereas mountain climbing finds a donkey in his true element Ain t this fun exclaimed Damfino Never had such a picnic I added Well Pod walked half the way from New York and prided himself on walking and Coonskin had won medals for sprinting so it looked to us a huge joke and we just brayed The next instant a locomotive bell sounded ahead and I saw a train approaching from round a bend We felt that we had the right of way and were much put out when the train refused to stop We would not get off the track it would be contrary to the nature of first class donkeys to do such a thing Say what wonderfully powerful things steam engines are We got it in our heads that we could stop the train if we didn t push it off the track You just ought to have seen us pitch headlong down the bank of the canyon into the foaming torrent It was a mighty plunge we made I can tell you Before we rose to the surface the car stopped and many of the passengers got off The banks of the pool were so steep we couldn t climb out and we had to swim and tread water to keep from drowning Damfino brayed like a lunatic I spouted like a geyser and great excitement reigned among the tourists Evidently nothing was doing for our immediate relief The engineer was loudly refreshing Pod s memory that he had no right on the railroad bed with his donkeys and the female passengers gesticulated wildly and condoled with Damfino and me for the deep predicament we were in One facetious fellow asked if we jackasses were Baptists and the Professor told him he didn t know what denomination we formerly adhered to but he believed that we were skeptics now Presently our masters began search for ropes and straps Alas all of them had been left behind I was now through with coughing but still weak and out of breath while Damfino pumped logarithms of abuse at the cog train and exhorted me to keep swimming advice entirely unnecessary Finally the car steamed down to Manitou and the sympathetic occupants called back that they would send aid Coonskin was first to come to his senses Said he I can run I ll run to the village for help and away he went to beat the cars This expedient awoke the Prof s dormant mind to an idea and he began to roll rocks into the Pool At the same time he yelled something at us but I couldn t wait to listen for I ducked under water in the nick of time to dodge a half ton boulder It came within an inch of knocking all the bad character out of Damfino s head and completely submerged us both After that Pod was more careful and instead of rolling one giant stone he sent two middle weights down the bank in a manner to make us dive I concluded Pod had gone daft For Balaam s sake what you trying to do up I brayed loudly but scarcely finished when I came within an ace of passing in my chips as a gigantic pebble of the first water whizzed between our heads Pod called back I m lifting the bottom of the pool so you two can crawl out I was astonished at such inventive faculty A wonder we donks survived to tell it Rolling stones may gather no moss but they need a lot of looking after It seemed hours before Coonskin returned By this time I had found a footing so I could rest with my head out of water Why were you gone so long Pod asked as he sat himself on a rail to rest his windpipe Well said the winded man adjusting a lariat I hunted all over Manitou before I found the superintendent of the waterworks But what on earth did you want of him I told him of the fix of our donks and asked him to change the course of the stream till we could get them out of the pool You idiot And what did he say Oh he was civil enough said he If you would like to have the mountain moved a little to one side I will have it put on jackscrews without delay Now it nettled me to listen to such nonsense while Damfino and I were refrigerating in ice water and I brayed to the jester above Say there you old fool if you had only thought to have him pump the water out of the canyon above us you might have furnished a little dry humor that we would have appreciated The lariat was found to be of little service but soon a couple of tourists arrived on the scene and assisted the two with their contract to raise the devil as well as the bed of the torrent and at length to extricate us water soaked donks from our unhappy predicament Then we were taken to the stable rubbed down and put to bed CHAPTER XXXVIII BY PYE POD It is the property of great men to rise to the height of great events Victor Hugo The city of Colorado Springs possesses many attractions and is growing in population and wealth Here is a good sized collection of pretty homes built on wide and well shaded streets where reside beside the health hunter of independent means the mining king the wealthy ranch owner the Eastern capitalist and the English tourist or speculator Friday morning we entered that picturesque Swisslike hamlet of Manitou with flying colors The summer tourists were either lounging on the broad verandas of the hotels or assembling for burro trips to the Garden of the Gods and other famous retreats in the mountains Coonskin and I rode our favorite mounts to the principal hotels Hiawatha Gardens and the iron and soda springs at which several places I delivered lectures to the amused tourists and reaped a small harvest The Garden of the Gods is some distance from town the popular drive being fourteen miles from start to finish To ride our slow steeds there would mean a sacrifice of a day s time So after much prospecting I bargained with a garrulous but genial guide to drive us with his team to the Garden and Glen Eyre for the sum of two dollars What a gay old ride that was in a cushion seated carriage I ll bet there wasn t one square inch of the seat that I didn t cover before I got back Some way I couldn t seem to get in a comfortable position The driver guide was very accommodating and offered to go back to put a saddle on the seat for me to ride in if I would but say the word The Garden of the Gods is a picturesque and grotesque natural park the rock formations of red and white sandstone resembling roughly most every bird and beast and human character imaginable In fact one old pioneer whom we met insisted that the place is the original Garden of Eden and that when Adam and Eve were caught eating the sour apple God caused the earth to cough whereupon it threw up mountains of mud and petrified many fine specimens of the menagerie The mountaineer struck me as something so unique in his make up and mental get up that I bribed him to accompany me and explain those wonderful exhibits of the earth s first zoo Now there is Punch and Judy he said most folks take them as sech I suppose you make out they are the stone mummies of Adam and Eve I interrogated showing effusive interest Our first parents sure s you are born he returned with conviction And there yender is th old washerwoman what done up Eve s laundry But I argued the Scripture says Eve didn t wear clothes so she couldn t have had any washing The man coughed Well my young man said he I ve lived a good many year and in a heap of places and seen a lot of females come inter the world or seen em soon after they did come and I never yet saw one come in dressed but yer kin bet yer last two bit piece from what I knows of women it didn t take Eve more time than she needed to catch her breath to change her mother Eve fer a mother Hubbard Then the pioneer pointed out the Kissing Camels the Seal and Bear and the Baggage room Are there any petrified elephants in this menagerie I asked I m fond of big exhibitions N n no they ain t no elifants here said he with a jerk of the head Yer see when the mud was coughed up they got so fast they left some of their trunks That s them in the Baggage room yender And he ha hahed over this poor joke As we passed successively the Buffalo s head the old Scotchman the Porcupine the Ant Eater the old man s wine cellar and the Egyptian Sphinx my guide enlightened us on geology botany and mineralogy far beyond my powers of understanding but not desiring to reveal my ignorance I listened attentively and now and then gasped Well I never I do declare Would you believe it and Gracious sakes alive The Gateway to the famous park lies between two giant towering rocks three to four hundred feet in height and further on the Balancing Rock a mammoth mass of sandstone appears to be on the verge of a fall Before leaving the park with its myriad curiosities I called upon the fat man who runs a bar restaurant curiosity shop and miniature zoo There lying in a box partially covered was a sculptured figure of a Digger Indian which some enterprising mortal must have buried unearthed and sold to the hoodwinked man for genuine petrified aboriginal meat Rainbow Falls Grand Caverns William s Canyon Cave of the Winds and Cheyenne Mountain Drive all had their peculiar attractions On Cheyenne Mountain is the original grave of Helen Hunt Jackson author of Ramona It was about midnight when with a small lunch in an improvised knapsack and revolvers in our belts Coonskin and I began the ascent of Pike s Peak the first attempt to do it having been so summarily defeated By one a m we were well up Engleman s Canyon and with the aid of a lantern we surveyed the wild and steep cog track with about the same pleasure one feels in descending a deep mine with a lighted candle Higher and higher as we rose toward the starlit heavens we found it more difficult to breathe and easier to freeze At times the grade was so steep that we had to creep on our hands and knees to prevent sliding backward to Manitou The so called beautiful Lake Moraine looked disenchantingly black and icy and the timber line still far above us seemed as elusive as a rainbow We had to stop frequently to rest our knees and to breathe for air up there was at a premium Later on we built a fire of railroad ties and ate our lunch By four o clock we overtook others striving to make the climb men women and small boys whose chief aim in life evidently was to climb Pike s Peak Some of them had started twelve hours before others had been twenty four hours climbing seven miles and from the questions they put to us were doubtless under the impression there was an error in the guide books and that they had already tramped fifty miles from Manitou The sunrise effects from the Peak are marvelous but Uncle Sol appeared to have as hard work in rising mornings as we travelers The sunrise looked as uncertain as our arrival on the summit Once we tarried to speculate on our chances of reaching the opposite side of Manitou in time to witness the event then resumed tramping and creeping puffing and blowing and snorting and venting our wrath on mister Pike for discovering the peak and made the turn to find the sun as tardy as ever with no apparent inclination to rise One old man we overtook told me he had been nigh on to twenty year climbing Pike s Peak and hadn t climbed it yet That gave me courage I wouldn t back out It looked as if there were only one more turn to make when about half way around three shivering maidens sitting on a rock asked me most pathetically if I had seen any kindling wood about My heart was touched I replied that I had not but would try to find some I built a fire and the girls were real nice to me and insisted that I share their cheese sandwiches On arriving at the summit I was just in time to see the most dazzlingly beautiful sunrise to be witnessed on earth Arriving on the board walk in front of the Summit House I saw Coonskin thawing in the sun fast asleep Inside the house a young man lay on a sofa in a swoon for want of air There is a golden opportunity for some enterprising man to transport barrels of air to an airtight building on the Peak and sell it to patrons for a dollar a pint A hundred gallons could have been sold that morning I would have bought fifty myself Wandering aimlessly and weakly as if from that tired feeling about the house and rocky looking grounds were several dozen mountain climbers shaking hands with themselves for having seen the sunrise or examining the crater of the extinct volcano or discussing the mysterious ingredients of their coffee cups in the only restaurant which small concoctions cost fifteen cents each I haven t said what was in the cups it was supposed to be coffee I bought a cup and forgetting that I had drunk it bought another and still I didn t make out what it was Then I purchased another and after I had finished four cups began to have a suspicion of coffee It cost me sixty cents After resting an hour we started back to Manitou It was two p m before the foot sore Pod and his lung sore valet managed to get to their hotel In less than an hour both became rational and agreed that the first of them to mention Pike s Peak should instantly be deprived of breath To those who boast of their ability to grow fat on beautiful scenery I heartily commend the trail through Ute Pass Divide Cripple Creek South Park Leadville and Aspen to Glenwood Springs crossing Western and Independence Passes First proceeding up Ute Canyon along the banks of the turbulent stream and in the shadow of the towering cliffs often in view and in hearing of the trains on the Colorado Midland we passed the summer retreats of Cascade and Green Mountain Falls at which places the tourists flocked from hotels cottages and tents to talk with Pod and Mac A Rony Only a brief stop was made at Divide to enable me to replenish my larder then we hustled on toward the famous mining camp Early every afternoon a thunder shower drenched our party Once or twice the thunder in advance warned us so we could pitch tent and crawl under shelter Thus our travels in that region were impeded Three miles beyond Gillette we climbed to Altman said to be the highest incorporated town in the United States some eleven thousand three hundred feet above the sea It rests literally on the summit and hangs down over the mountain sides secure enough whenever and wherever there is a prospect hole with sufficient gold in it to serve the miners a foothold and check their sliding further The high altitude of the district makes it especially undesirable for women causing nervous troubles Even the male population are more or less excitable and when prospectors think they have made a strike some of them run about like lunatics From Altman we took a tortuous trail threading Goldfield Independence Victor and Anaconda The mountains about are honeycombed with prospect holes or graves they might be properly called for many of them contain buried hopes From a distance they look like prairie dog towns but occasional shaft houses and gallows frames rise here and there to give character to the mining region while several railroad and electric car lines wind about the hills and gulches Many of the cabins in these towns are built of logs the streets look to have been surveyed by cows rather than engineers As a rule there is no symmetry to the thoroughfares up hill and down hill crooking and winding crossing and converging in a manner to puzzle a resident of a year The situation of most of the habitations seems to have been governed by the location of the claim of each house owner This great camp got its name from two circumstances occurring when the locality was known for no other virtue than a grazing place for cattle One day on the banks of the creek that trickled through the present site of Cripple Creek a man broke his leg and the following day a cowboy was thrown from his bronco and had his arm broken Some one seeing both accidents said I reckon we d better call this place Cripple Creek So the noted camp was christened CHAPTER XXXIX BY MAC A RONY You do ill to teach the child such words he teaches him to kick and to hack which they ll do fast enough of themselves and to call horum fye upon you Merry Wives of Windsor Frequently since crossing the Mississippi Pod had received letters from proud parents informing him that they had named their latest boy after him 
8098_278278_000003_000001	train-clean-100	At that time in Cripple Creek several boys ranging from a day to six weeks old whose destinies were thought to be promising were afflicted with my master s ponderous name 
8098_278278_000004_000000	train-clean-100	A little green eyed Irish girl five days old was named Pythagorina Podina Mulgarry 
8098_278278_000004_000001	train-clean-100	The happy father called personally on Pod and asked him to act as godfather at the baptismal service Sunday afternoon 
none	none	The impressive ceremony took place at the cabin of Miss Pythagorina as the aged grandmother wished to witness it Pod said he was somewhat embarrassed about attending since he had forgotten almost all his Latin but he arranged with one of the pall bearers to give him nudges and kicks when it was expected of him to make a response and so he got through fairly well better than the kid did 
8098_278278_000004_000003	train-clean-100	He said the babe was an unruly child and kicked so frantically when the priest took her in his arms that two flatirons were tied to its feet to keep them down 
none	none	It was simply nervousness because the high altitude affected the child s nerves 
8098_278278_000004_000005	train-clean-100	So when the priest was handed the tiny thing in swaddling clothes and held it over the barrel that served as the font the poor girl was frightened and squirmed and suddenly slipped out of the priest s arms into the barrel and sank out of sight 
none	none	There was great excitement and surprise because the flatirons didn t float and the undertaker or what you call em overturned the barrel of water and set everybody afloat drenching the sponsors and guests 
8098_278278_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Pod said the scene was without a parallel he was soaked to his equator the half christened half drowned Pythagorina Podina was picked up from the flood with a tablespoon and the ceremony finished then she was rolled on the barrel to get all the water out of her and put to bed with hot flatirons at her feet to prevent croup and mumps 
8098_278278_000005_000001	train-clean-100	Then the wake broke up 
8098_278278_000005_000002	train-clean-100	I don t believe the child understood a word that the priest said Pod didn t 
8098_278278_000006_000000	train-clean-100	That night he got up a fine supper and invited some old friends He bought a big porterhouse steak thick and tender and personally broiled it on his patent folding stove 
none	none	Just when everything was on the table and the guests were finding stones and tin plates to sit on Don not having had a thing to eat for an hour coolly pulled the hot steak off the platter and dropped it on the ground 
8098_278278_000006_000002	train-clean-100	Pod didn t say anything though but just forked it on to the platter and scraped off some dry grass and a sliver and a bug and carved it up and generously put it on the ladies plates 
8098_278278_000006_000003	train-clean-100	The ladies looked at the dog and then at Pod not knowing which to thank then feeling sensitive about accepting the best part of the steak insisted upon Pod s having one of their pieces and Coonskin the other and both men being kind and gallant accepted the compliment and all fell to eating 
8098_278278_000006_000004	train-clean-100	But the guests didn t eat much 
8098_278278_000006_000005	train-clean-100	They said they had just had dinner 
8098_278278_000006_000006	train-clean-100	You could see plainly from their appetites that they were telling the truth After supper Don feasted on the tougher parts of the steak and we donks were fed the scraps of potatoes and bread and tin tomato and peach cans 
8098_278278_000006_000007	train-clean-100	When the banquet was over the guests went home 
8098_278278_000007_000000	train-clean-100	Pod devoted Monday morning to business and took in a good stock of supplies and after lunch we set out on the trail to Florisant about twenty miles away 
8098_278278_000007_000001	train-clean-100	About six o clock we went into camp on the margin of a famous petrified forest 
8098_278278_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Pod objected at first because of the scarcity of fire wood 
8098_278278_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Lots of petrified wood chips lying around I remarked and they ll last 
8098_278278_000008_000001	train-clean-100	Ordinary wood burns up too fast 
none	none	Bright idea exclaimed Pod 
8098_278278_000009_000001	train-clean-100	And Coonskin went to work gathering petrified wood for the supper fire 
8098_278278_000009_000002	train-clean-100	 The only trouble will be in starting the fire said Pod 
8098_278278_000009_000003	train-clean-100	 Just as soon as it s once going it ought to burn smoothly enough might pour coal oil on the chips What do you say Coonskin 
8098_278278_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Coonskin s opinion didn t benefit Pod much 
8098_278278_000010_000001	train-clean-100	His hard wood fire wasn t very satisfactory but with some dry brush the men got the meal under way 
8098_278278_000010_000002	train-clean-100	Next morning we visited the noted petrified stump measuring upwards of forty five feet in circumference 
none	none	Several saws were imbedded in it for many futile attempts had been made to take off some slices for the Denver Exposition 
8098_278278_000010_000004	train-clean-100	It has been estimated by various ornithologists botanists and entomologists that the stump is millions of years old 
8098_278278_000010_000005	train-clean-100	I think they were guessing at it for I couldn t see the rings and even if I had seen them with a telescope a fellow couldn t live long enough to count them 
8098_278278_000011_000000	train-clean-100	We journeyed until ten at night stopping at Florisant only a few minutes to buy a crate of peaches 
8098_278278_000011_000001	train-clean-100	Several times I had a suspicion that we had been misdirected 
none	none	When we came to the end of a narrow wood road I was sure of it We went into camp and before breakfast a timberman called on us You kin trail through the timber to Pemberton said he to Pod and then cut through to Fairplay er you kin go back the way ye came
8098_278278_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 What do you say Pod inquired turning to Coonskin 
8098_278278_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 I think best to go through the woods said the valet 
none	none	So we were headed for the timber 
8098_278278_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Our tramp through the forest I cannot soon forget 
none	none	Up and down the rocky heights through thickets of quaking asp and pine tangled roots and fallen trees we climbed and panted and coughed and brayed for some four miles when we stopped to rest and realized we were lost 
8098_278278_000015_000003	train-clean-100	Coonskin said he was an experienced woodman and would blaze the trees so we would get out again 
none	none	Wonderful the amount of learning he had gleaned from dime novels 
8098_278278_000015_000005	train-clean-100	He lagged behind to do the blazing and pretty soon I smelt smoke 
8098_278278_000015_000006	train-clean-100	The Professor snuffed 
8098_278278_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Smells as if the woods were on fire somewhere hinted Pod 
none	none	Look behind you they are I exclaimed And Pod caught that erudite valet back woodsman in the act of setting a tree on fire with oil and matches 
8098_278278_000017_000002	train-clean-100	Fortunately for us the wind wasn t blowing strong but we had to change our course some and hustle faster for the blazing trail chased us 
8098_278278_000017_000003	train-clean-100	Coonskin learned a new lesson and turned down the corner of the page so he d recollect it 
8098_278278_000017_000004	train-clean-100	After Pod had explained the meaning of the word blaze in this case the fellow was more put out than the fire 
8098_278278_000018_000000	train-clean-100	At length we struck a trail which led to a couple of cabins in the canyon 
8098_278278_000018_000001	train-clean-100	A board sign informed us it was simply Turkey Creek 
8098_278278_000018_000002	train-clean-100	I couldn t see any turkeys but there was good pasturage around 
none	none	The hot trip through the timber made us all hungry 
8098_278278_000019_000000	train-clean-100	It was three o clock when we donks were picketed and allowed to graze 
8098_278278_000019_000001	train-clean-100	Then Coonskin went fishing 
8098_278278_000019_000002	train-clean-100	He said he had seen some trout in the stream by supper time he had caught a nice mess 
8098_278278_000019_000003	train-clean-100	Pod said he would fry the fish and went at it so enthusiastically that he forgot to put the bag of corn meal back in its place 
none	none	After the meal was over he began to look around for the bag It was nowhere to be found I had eaten the corn meal and bag 
8098_278278_000019_000006	train-clean-100	It was comical how those two men puzzled their brains about that missing commodity When Coonskin detected some meal stamped in the ground Pod pointed at me and said That s the thief there 
8098_278278_000020_000000	train-clean-100	Next morning Coonskin was the first to return from fishing and looked much excited 
8098_278278_000020_000001	train-clean-100	When Pod returned he told him he had seen huge bear tracks he was going bear hunting 
8098_278278_000020_000002	train-clean-100	Pod laughed at him 
none	none	Now let me tell you said the boy we aren t likely to get any big game on this trip if we are looking and gunning for it 
8098_278278_000021_000001	train-clean-100	That was my experience in the woods of Wisconsin 
none	none	The men at the saw mill said we should see bear in this forest but where are they It s my opinion if we loiter around this here canyon a day without guns we will see a bear pretty soon 
8098_278278_000021_000004	train-clean-100	A silvertip would be a boon to you Prof its skin would fetch fifty dollars or more Let s look for bear 
8098_278278_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 What would you do if you saw a bear Pod asked 
8098_278278_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Well now leave that to me said Coonskin 
none	none	In the first place it would be worth a hairbreadth escape to see one wild I ve only seen bears in circuses or traveling chained to Italians in the second place I can run I ve plenty of medals for sprinting but if I saw a real bear I could beat all records 
8098_278278_000024_000000	train-clean-100	Pod looked at me and I looked at Pod I hadn t anything to say on the subject it didn t interest me as much as it did Coonskin 
8098_278278_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Pod went fishing that afternoon with a gun and took the whole arsenal along with him including the axe 
8098_278278_000025_000000	train-clean-100	Somewhere about five o clock Pod came into camp with a good mess of trout 
none	none	After cleaning the fish he took off his guns and laid down on the grass and wondered if that crazy valet had run across any more bear tracks He wasn t there long when suddenly I heard yells issuing from the canyon down stream round the bend 
8098_278278_000025_000003	train-clean-100	The shouting sounded nearer every second and I soon distinguished Coonskin s voice 
8098_278278_000025_000004	train-clean-100	Pod got up from the ground excitedly 
8098_278278_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Coonskin s in trouble plain enough said Pod aloud to himself I must run to his aid So he started on a trot down stream to the bend and then quickly turned falling all over himself and ran toward the cabins faster than I ever saw him run before or since 
none	none	And immediately Coonskin came flying into view with the biggest bear at his heels I ever want to see That sight paralyzed me I couldn t get on to my feet for a minute or two then I broke the rope and kited up the canyon a hundred yards where behind a tree I waited to see the interesting finish CHAPTER XL BY PYE POD Who dared touch the wild bear s skin Ye slumbered on while life was in Scott How fast a man can run when he knows he s got to win a race There was one time in my life when can t was an obsolete word in my vocabulary It was when that silvertip granted Coonskin s chief desire in the field of adventure Shoot him Shoot him cried the angler as he fairly flew past me headed for the first cabin But I had neither time nor gun to shoot when I heard bruin at my heels I switched off to the left and ran three times around the second cabin before I realized the bear had taken a stronger fancy to my comrade It seems he had chased Coonskin around the cabin several times until the man dived in the door and head first out of the window Bruin followed in but remained He smelled the fragrant peaches Coonskin however under the impression that bruin was still after him ran twice around the cabin before he climbed a tree Meanwhile I having climbed a tree close to the cabin descended to the cabin roof I knew silvertips couldn t climb trees so I felt safe The sudden shuffle of my feet on the gravel covered roof disturbed the peace of the present incumbent and out he came rose on his haunches and looked about to see what was up I was immovable Back into the cabin went brother Bruin and began to break up things generally Then followed a few moments of dreadful silence Not a sound issued from Coonskin s tree he was probably trying to recover his breath and reason Night soon fell upon us it gets dark early in the canyons and the mercury falls fast I was chilly for I shivered frightfully The blankets and guns were on the ground just outside the cabin Let s flip a coin to see which of us goes down for a gun suggested Coonskin from his tree But I did not take him seriously Don t you wish you had taken the fish line off your rod he added you could fish up a blanket and keep from freezing By jingo I exclaimed I have my line and I ll try it At once I fashioned a fish pole out of a pine bough and after much patience secured the only blanket within reach Then winding it around myself I lay as snug as possible but couldn t go to sleep That was the longest night I ever experienced How long we should be kept off the earth was an unpleasant speculation Once I called to Coonskin not to go to sleep and tumble out of the tree but he answered that he was so stuck up with pitch he couldn t fall Our hopes were low when suddenly about seven o clock from the canyon below appeared a man in the rough garb of a mountaineer with a rifle across his shoulder and a hunting knife in his belt As he was about to pass I hailed him The hunter stopped looked my way approached to within a few feet of the cabin and said a cheery Good morning I responded in a mood still more cheery What you doin up there smoking Had breakfast I reckon No haven t cooked yet this morning I returned Glad t hear that haven et yet myself Got nough to go round he asked shifting a cud of tobacco from one side to the other Don t know about that I said You ll have to ask the boss he s inside As the rugged looking huntsman approached the cabin door I held my breath but I rose to my feet when I actually saw the hunter s hat rise on his uplifted hair as he looked into the cabin door With the quickness and coolness that come to one habituated to solitary life in the wilds he put his Sharp s rifle to his shoulder aimed and fired There was a second report followed by a tremendous thud and the sound of something within struggling for life and vengeance The hunter had no sooner fired than he dodged and stood ready for a second charge but that was not needed Come down he said to me with a grim smile I m boss here now I slid off the roof and Coonskin to the man s surprise appeared from his lofty perch then we introduced ourselves While I thanked the hunter for his kind offices and welcomed him to breakfast Coonskin began to prepare the meal Our guest explained that he was a bee hunter When the bear meets the bee hunter searchin for a bee tree brother Bruin says Ahem Excuse me but I m workin this ere side of the trail you just take t other side Then the bee hunter says Pardon my friend mister Bear but I m workin both sides of this particular trail just throw up your paws The bee hunter chuckled over the practical joke played on him and said as it came from a tenderfoot he d take it in good part but if it had been a backwoodsman that played such a game he d settle with the bear and the man in the same fashion His words and manner startled me The bee hunter rose from the log and drawing his knife dropped on his knee and began to skin the bear as if he thought he owned it You needn t bother about skinning it for us I said we re quite satisfied that you killed it The man eyed me This bear belongs to me if ye want to know he said How is it your bear Coonskin asked when he came to announce breakfast You shot it but in our cabin That don t make no difference and I don t intend arguing the question came the positive retort I say he s mine who says he hain t I suddenly felt a bee in my bonnet The ayes have it I said That stopped the debate but I could see blood in Coonskin s eye when he ushered us to breakfast Before we had finished my nervy valet asked our guest if he played poker Ya a as some the hunter drawled If there s money in it I ll jine ye in a game Illustration Through thickets tangled roots and fallen trees What could Coonskin have in mind to challenge this rough mountaineer to a game of cards He had often boasted of his skill at poker Now he cleared the table and brought forth the cards he had carried way from Iowa and motioning the bee hunter to a seat the two cut for the deal From my seat beside Coonskin I discovered a little round mirror hanging on the wall behind the hunter opposite it was the one my valet had purchased in Denver Where he sat he could see the hunter s hand reflected in the glass I felt if he were detected in this underhand game it would go ill with both of us so put both revolvers in my belt and kept mum That was an interesting game Lend me some change said Coonskin I threw him my bag of silver Then he added Pod you count out the matches here for chips and act as banker So I was drawn into the game The first few hands were very ordinary and caused no excitement But finally the bee hunter arched his eyebrows I knew he must have a fine hand or a bluff in store for his tenderfoot opponent He bet heavily but Coonskin raised the ante every time Suddenly what had been in Coonskin s mind all the time was revealed Lend me fifty dollars said he to me and to the bee hunter added I ll lay this roll of bills against the bear skin and call you I ll go ye said the bee hunter When both men lay down their hands I had taken down the mirror and hid it in my pocket Beaten by four jacks I be d d the outraged mountaineer exclaimed pounding his fist on the table and regarding his four ten spots with grim disfavor Coonskin grinned from ear to ear as he swept in the money Said he Mac A Rony Cheese Damfino and Skates I swear by them every time Whenever I get that hand I m billed to win So yer travelin on them jacks remarked the defeated partner No not exactly Coonskin returned as he rose from his seat The jacks I m traveling with are out doors these are their tin types The bee hunter looked chagrined enough but he took the thing as a matter of course apparently never dreaming that he had been actually buncoed by a boy tenderfoot Presently he rose and shouldering his rifle made his departure without thanking us for our hospitality I hoped sincerely he would find his bee tree and harvest a rich reward I told Coonskin he was a brick He accepted his winnings modestly and fell to finishing the task of skinning the bear It was a fine skin After salting it and wrapping it in gunnysacks I packed our luggage while Coonskin saddled the donkeys Shortly after noon we reached the road that was already familiar to us and five hours later arrived in Florisant It was sundown when we went into camp I had lost three days but I had been fully compensated by the pleasures of angling and bear hunting Next day we were off for Leadville in good season My animals seemed to be in fine traveling form by sunset we arrived in South Park It was Saturday There we enjoyed the hospitality of a deserted floorless cabin where sheltered from the wind we could eat without swallowing an inordinate amount of sand Close by was a fine spring so we resolved to remain until Sunday afternoon We were awakened at dawn by a bevy of magpies perched on the tent Coonskin was so annoyed that he crept to the door and shot the chief disturber in spite of the bad luck promised him by a popular legend South Park is one of three great preserves in Colorado There once roamed buffalo deer elk antelope and wolves while on the mountains bordering the valley were quantities of mountain sheep A few deer sheep and bear are said to be still found in that section Coyotes are heard nightly and the evening we trailed out of the Park a traveler with a prairie schooner said he had seen two gray wolves Our afternoon trip through the Park was a painful one Mosquitoes attacked us from every quarter and it was mosquito netting pennyroyal and kerosene alone that saved our lives When we consider that Mosquito Pass the highest pass of the Rockies thirteen thousand seven hundred feet was named after a mosquito we may derive some idea of the size of the insect It was late in the night when after brief stops at two sheep ranches run by Mexicans and another at a small settlement we entered the canyon It required two days of hard climbing to cross Western Pass The snow capped peaks of the range looked grand and beautiful and the noisy streams in the canyons leading from the summit on both sides were stocked with trout The morning we trailed out of the canyon into the Arkansas Valley was clear and lovely After traveling some distance up the valley the smoke of the Leadville smelters burst into view and a mile beyond the city itself could be seen nestling against the towering mountains This famous mining camp gave us royal welcome The report in the papers that Pye Pod would lecture that evening drew an enthusiastic throng applauding and crowding closely about the donkeys all eager for the chromos that Coonskin sold while I talked Next morning we crossed the valley and pitched camp on the banks of Twin Lake two lovely sheets of water at the mouth of the canyon leading to Independence Pass This pass is one of the loftiest of the Continental Divide that snowy range from which the rivers of Western America flow east or west through undisputed domains Trailing up the ascent gradually became very precipitous and the trail a severe trial Over this pass climbed the overland stages and freighting wagons with their four and eight horse teams It was in ante railroad days a popular route and the now deserted cabins of Independence once composed a lively mining camp Although the trail was kept in good order yet wagons and teams frequently toppled over the narrow trail and mules horses and passengers met their death on the rocks below We men walked to relieve our animals and arrived at the summit at sundown Looking backward for six or seven miles the view surpassed in grandeur any scene of the kind I had ever viewed The stream appeared to be spun from liquid fleece from the mountain sides and tumbled and foamed over the rocks and fallen trees in its bed until it looked like a strand of wool in a hundred snarls While resting a heavy snow squall descended and drove us on across the pass into the western canyon for shelter This canyon surpassed in grandeur and size the other Knowing our sure footed steeds would keep the trail much better than we Coonskin and I got in the saddle but more than once I nearly went over Mac s head When we had proceeded only a mile below the summit the trail became particularly narrow and rocky To the right protruded from the bank a great boulder and to the left sloped a deep and sheer precipice to which only the roots and stumps of trees could cling Here my valet dismounted I should have done likewise Mac considered a moment whether or not to descend further then made a sudden dive shying from the declivity and striking the rock on our right and was jarred off his feet falling with me over the edge of the trail Down and over we rolled toward the yawning gulf some forty feet before we caught on a stump and stopped That was a dreadful moment for me For a time I lay still not daring to excite Mac Carefully I extricated myself from my perilous position and held my donkey s head down till Coonskin got the ropes from Damfino s pack and came to my relief In time the other three donkeys pulled Mac A Rony up on to the trail We pitched camp and Sunday morning continued down the trail which soon presented difficulties still more discouraging The numerous springs had necessitated corduroy roads often hundreds of feet in extent But these had been so long in general disuse that the logs had rotted away in places Frequently Coonskin and I dismounted and repaired the corduroy breaches with fallen trees thereby losing much time By dark my outfit had made but three miles In the darkness of evening we came to the empty cabins of old Independence whose single inhabitant called to us from his doorway as we passed At last we arrived at an old time stage house It was now temporarily tenanted by fishermen from Aspen who asked us to spend the night with them I accepted soon my animals were feeding on the fresh grass bordering a spring nearby and Coonskin and I seated at the hot repast our hosts had quickly provided The house was large with a high roof and a dirt floor A great fire blazed in the center lending comfort to the cozy quarters The anglers had spread their blankets in one end of the shack and we pitched our tent in the other and soon fell to sleep while the fishermen likely continued to swap lies till a late hour The last remarks I heard almost made me cry I don t think it would do for me to go to hell pa said the lad of the party Why queried the sire Oh said the boy the light would hurt my eyes so I couldn t sleep Getting an early morning start we trailed down and out of the long canyon into Roaring Fork Valley and at four o clock arrived in Aspen a famous silver camp of early days A crowd soon gathered and I had no sooner announced a street lecture for that evening than the news began to spread all over town Here supplies must be bought some business transacted under my advertising contract and Mac shod For the first time that jackass kicked the blacksmith When I reprimanded him he claimed the man had pounded a nail in his hoof almost to the knee and added for the smith s benefit Shoe an ass with ass s shoes but set them with horse sense Which I thought sound philosophy At the appointed hour and place for my lecture the street was choked with an eager audience Coonskin had been instructed to have the donkey there saddled and packed by eight sharp They failed to appear So impetuous and enthusiastic were the crowding cheering citizens that I mounted a block and began to talk Suddenly I was interrupted by a shout The donkeys are coming and at once the crowd became so hilarious that I had to cease speaking till my outfit arrived Mac A Rony Mac A Rony Damfino Cheese echoed and re echoed as a number of boys ran to meet the donks It occurred to me that Coonskin might soon have his hands full so I hastened to his side But ere I arrived my handsome Colt s revolver was stolen from its holster buckled to Mac s saddle horn As Coonskin was riding Cheese and trailing the others he could not guard against the theft but I blamed him for not heeding my instructions always to leave the guns at my headquarters It was the only article lost by theft on my journey The four marshals on duty hoped to recover the revolver and forward it to me but I never received it When I had finished my lecture Judge S passed his hat and handed me a liberal collection And as my outfit trailed out of town toward Roaring Fork a young man wheeled up with us and gave me a silver nugget scarf pin In Aspen as in Leadville I disposed of many photos It was a fine evening I was promised a smooth trail through to Glenwood Springs We were to travel ten miles that night and hence would need to sleep late next day So I advised Coonskin to set the alarm clock just purchased for ten a m CHAPTER XLI BY MAC A RONY And riding down the bank he spurred into the water The Fair God When at the conclusion of Pod s Aspen lecture he gave the signal for our outfit to move on I breathed a sigh of relief I abhor crowds I despise shoemakers They say that an ingrown nail is painful an inpounded nail is worse Pod said he wouldn t care if I had lockjaw for then I d have to keep my mouth shut You ordered Bridget to call us at eight in the morning didn t you Pod asked of his valet when we were a mile out of town I did that Coonskin replied Who could Bridget be Surely the turtle Bill hadn t changed his name I d hate to have him pull me out of bed Have the men got a woman stowed away in their luggage queried Cheese I hear em talking of some biddy It s scandalous exclaimed Miss Damfino and Miss Skates said she thought so too These words were hardly spoken when about eight o clock we were strolling peacefully down the trail along the high bank of Roaring Fork River in the darkness something with a shrill voice suddenly began to scream and kick up a terrible racket in one of my saddle bags electrifying my whole being Was Pod bewitched Or was some demon upon me I asked both questions at once and not waiting for an answer ran through the darkness blind with terror Ears back tail out straight and legs spinning I failed to see the trail or hear my master s Whoas I only thought the devil was after me and flew through the air like a meteor Soon the trail turned to the right but I kept on straight ahead and suddenly tumbled tail over ears down the steep bank into the rushing river my master still holding on to reins and saddle horn How deep I dived I can t say The dampness poured into my ears and mouth and drowned my thoughts and just when I had begun to think of my past life I came to the surface with that demon still yelling and clinging to the saddle or to Pod Then a terrific jerk on my bit brought me to my senses and I swam to the nearest shore It was a long hard pull Pod clung to me as though I were a life buoy and when I climbed on to the bank out of breath the screaming demon chased me half way up to the trail Pod s mouth was a flame of fire but aimed more at Coonskin than at me Reckon he thought me too wet to burn The whole outfit including dog and turtle awaited us with bated breath We ve found out who Bridget is said Cheese laughing To the devil with Bridget I retorted What in the name of Balaam was that after us The new alarm clock you fool replied Cheese I was too full for utterance too full of water The Professor was a sight even in the darkness Never saw him so mad Didn t you know that if at six o clock you set the alarm for eight in the morning it would ring at eight in the evening he vociferated wildly gesticulating at his scared and speechless attendant Cautiously through the darkness we proceeded for a couple of miles Pod walking to prevent taking cold he said Then we were steered to an old cedar stump where we camped Bridget s alarming voice had made a fearful impression upon me Several times on the way to camp I imagined a demon was after me and shied into the sage Why I ve seen roosters and hens chase all over a half acre lot and jump a fence after losing their heads simply from nervousness The cedar stump was set ablaze and as soon as Pod had pitched the tent he began walking around it dressed in his only suit of clothes trying to get thoroughly dry He was not in a good mood to talk with so I kept aloof Next morning the valley and the mountains hemming it in revealed a beautiful and bountiful nature Although alfalfa seemed to be the chief crop fields of wheat and oats waved in the breeze It was August the harvest had hardly begun The vendure on the mountains was not less lavish in its rare autumnal tintings than were the internal colorings of the hills with metals copper lead silver and gold Now the trail would hug the river so closely I could hear the roaring flood and again the current would sink beyond reach of ear or eye suddenly to burst upon us later The sun grew hotter with every hour s travel the trail became more dusty the prickly sage looked more browned and withered One evening under the screen of darkness the men pitched camp conveniently near to an alfalfa field hay stack and potato cellar The sage while much seared by the sun was yet too young and green to burn so when Coonskin dropped two large boards in front of the tent Pod was elated The fellow said he had unroofed a tater cellar In view of the shady deed Pod kindled the fire on the shady side of the tent and proceeded to cook the supper We hadn t time to make our escape next morning before we heard the rattle of a wagon approaching Presently a team of horses driven by a short morose looking black whiskered farmer stopped right in front of camp Instinct told me he was the owner of the property we had squatted on and intended to make trouble Pod was seldom embarrassed but when so he appealed to Coonskin s wit and gall for the desired relief The man climbed out of the wagon and walked toward the tent until he saw Don and stopped short Coonskin winked slyly at Pod and me under his hat brim and said to our caller Walk right in sir and make yourself miserable the dog won t hurt you then Pod said a Good morning sweet and juicy The stranger s sharp eyes surveyed the remaining board and the cremation ashes of the departed and nodded sourly I was now saddled and Coonskin was buckling on his belt with revolvers and hunting knife Said he to our guest This traveling round the world on a bet ain t what it s cracked up to be Reckon not returned the stranger And he asked Big bet N o o only fifteen thousand dollars The stranger grunted as he mentally appraised the value of his lumber and then regarded the men as if he wanted to put a price on their heads Wouldn t been so bad Coonskin resumed If one of our original party hadn t got scalped by Esquimaux when crossing the Arabian Desert I want ter know the stranger exclaimed How did it happen As he spoke he sat down near the board and whittled a stick now and then eyeing Coonskin with overdue interest Well you see the valet began we were trailing on the desert at night because the sun in India is so hot when he suddenly hailed what we took to be a caravan But instead of one outfit there were three all of em enemies of each and tother Hottentots Spaniards and Solomon Islanders all at lagerheads Say weren t we in a nice mess Pears so the farmer ejaculated with wrapt phiz At once all tried to capture us Coonskin continued but pretty soon fell to fighting among themselves and that e how we escaped But Jack got shot Coonskin looked as if he had lost his last friend Poor Jack muttered Prof shaking his head sorrowfully I saw plainly the story had touched the stranger s heart Purty sad wasn t it boys he commented Didn t ye have no shootin irons along he asked Should say we did a whole battery said the valet We shot several of the black demons here waxing excited as he recalled the harrowing spectacle but what was a thousand of them compared with one Jack And Coonskin tickled me in the ribs Ner a hundred Jacks returned the farmer absentmindedly and looking thoughtful Then Pod said it was time to be going and offered to pay the farmer for the board he had much enjoyed but the latter said he didn t want no pay and after offering Pod and Coonskin his plug of tobacco clambered into his wagon and drove off Then we made for Glenwood Springs CHAPTER XLII BY PYE POD You may nail it on the pailing as a mighty risky plan To set your judgment on the clothes that cover up a man It s a risky piece of business for you ll often come across A fifty dollar saddle on a twenty dollar hoss Old Saw We reached Glenwood Springs the week of the annual races and I piloted my outfit to a prominent corner in town At once a crowd gathered After making a few remarks about my trip and promising a lecture before leaving town I inquired for the leading hotel The Colorado answered a chorus Then a man in shirtsleeves sombrero and high boots edged to my side and whispered Prof there s a dollar house t other end of town The tax is five dollars a day at the Colorado How much can I make at the dollar house I asked My informant shrank into his clothes I don t believe you can make your salt he answered I left my outfit and rode Mac to the post office I had not been indoors long before I heard loud cheers and laughter in the street I rushed out thinking somebody was making sport with my donkey and was surprised to see Don leading by the reins that incorrigible flirt Mac A Rony up street toward the post office He had strolled to the next corner to make the acquaintance of a prepossessing donk of the opposite sex and my faithful dog conscious of his responsibilities was doing his duty The town is situated on the east bank of the Grand River across some distance from the water stands the Hotel Colorado An iron bridge spans the stream and across it I led my caravan to the hotel in time for dinner As I dismounted the guests on the veranda hurried to the railing and whispered to one another I paid no heed but giving my valet instructions to care for my animals hurried in The clerk extended his hand in greeting Just on time said he Lunch is awaiting you I shall never forget the sensation I caused when I entered the dining room A sweeping glance detected every eye upon me I sat at the nearest table opposite two dudes who almost choked to death when I reached for the menu card Even the pretty waitresses stopped as if struck One of the poor girls dropped a tray of dishes Every countenance said plainly How did it drift in Several pretty girls at the next table seasonably gowned in silks and muslins whispered and giggled audibly Presently the dudes considered there wasn t room for us three at the table and changed their seats so precipitately that one of them stumbled over the legs of his chair and broke his fall by first breaking a cup As they now faced the pretty girls their prospect was more inviting if not picturesque My hair and beard were long one of my coat sleeves threatened to come off with the slightest cough or sneeze I looked like one who had experienced hardship and rough traveling This is a treat I thought as I divided my interest between the diners opposite and my menu card I was famished The waitresses kept aloof from me Suddenly my ear caught the words spoken by one of the dudes He acts as if he owned the dining room and had first bid on the hotel I smiled Just then I felt a hand on my shoulder and recognized the head waiter who a moment before had left the room probably to see the hotel clerk He was all smiles as he asked if I was being waited upon I said I was not I I I beg your humble pardon he stammered and off he danced The next minute a half dozen waitresses were assailing me for my order Finally I was lavishly served then there was dissatisfaction at the next table The dudes began to complain because that hobo received every attention while they were neglected Having received an invitation to the races I did not tarry longer than necessary I was sure things would be different when I returned for dinner And such a change as there was I was assigned to a table at which was a bevy of girls and two or three gentlemen My seat had evidently been reserved for me by request I didn t have to wait for the waitresses to pass me things the girls did that I was treated like a hero and almost embarrassed with attentions When I retired to dress for the ball given in my honor by the young women of Glenwood I fell in a chair and laughed till my sides ached What fun the study of human nature does afford The evening paper stated that the famous donkey traveler Professor Pythagoras Pod would be the guest of the evening and was expected to appear in traveling clothes spurs and belt guns And so I attired myself arriving at the hall at eight thirty and was at once introduced to one and all of the fair gathering I danced myself completely out When supper was announced I was glad Had I traveled thirty miles that day I couldn t have felt more fatigued It was almost eleven o clock when I set out for my hotel One of the attractions at the Colorado is the great out of doors natatorium between the river and the hotel I had hardly crossed the bridge when I heard Mac s bray issuing from that quarter The darkness and thick foliage obscured the view but I heard splashing of water and laughter and another wild bray and concluded some mischief was on the boards among the college students who were guests of the hotel Quickening my pace I stole through the shrubbery to the reservoir and beheld a sight to cause me fright There was a high chute beside the natatorium and a staircase for the bathers to climb to the top to shoot the chutes There almost at the top of the stairs was my misused donkey being carried to the source of the water raceway by several young men the donkey braying and kicking frantically the men struggling in the throes of smothered laughter as well as with their asinine burden By the time I had collected my senses Mac was deposited on the platform Heigh there I yelled at the top of my voice Drop that donkey you ruffians They dropped him And down he came tobogganing over the slippery watery chute over and over and landing in the pond flat on his back It didn t take long for Mac to finish his bath When he rose to the surface he snorted and brayed louder than ever and in swimming about to find a place he could climb out he chased every bather on to land One of the men got a rope and several others assisting pulled the frightened animal out Without stopping to discuss the affair I led Mac to his corral The following morning a committee persuaded me to deliver a lecture to the guests of the hotel A notice was posted announcing Pod s lecture to be delivered at two p m on the broad veranda in front of the hotel office I talked in my happiest vein The interest manifested by my fair auditors would have inspired any lecturer Illustration And floated on Salt Lake Illustration Skull Valley desert we stopped to feed and rest I concluded with these words It is very gratifying for me to know so many are interested in Mac A Rony s welfare I hope to take him through with me to the Pacific I do not like it to appear that I while a guest of the hotel am taking undue advantage of its privileges but if there are any among you who desire a souvenir of our novel trip I have a few pictures which may be procured at twenty five cents each I now formally bid you all adieu The souvenirs went like hot cakes Presently a sweet girl who had purchased three pictures with beaming eyes and a winsome smile asked Oh mister Pod won t you please put your autograph on these photos Certainly I replied but each signature will cost twenty five cents extra I said it just to see how it would take Of course I ll be glad to pay for the autographs the maid returned and handed me the photos to sign And I was kept busy signing pictures until my hand ached My last afternoon in Glenwood was a busy one I decided to heed the admonitions of many Westerners I had met to avoid the Green River desert a barren waste of shifting sands utterly devoid of water stretching a hundred and thirty miles and more and instead to trail northwesterly via Meeker White River and the Ute Reservation On the Meeker route I was promised fair grazing and ample water supply every twenty or thirty miles of the distance to the Mormon City It was five in the p m when Coonskin brought my caravan to the hotel and saluting me said Professor your donkeys are ready and packed for the journey The guests of the hotel with few exceptions were assembled to witness the start and my dog in appreciation of the compliment strode grandly among the ladies and kissed their hands and I believe bade every one an affectionate farewell I thought this a good time for once on my trip to put on stylish airs I had never called upon Coonskin to exercise the duties of a valet in the strictest sense As soon as he buckled the guns on the saddles I dropped my ragged canvas leggings at his feet put forth a foot and gave him a significant look Immediately the gallant Sancho knelt down on one knee and proceeded to lace the leggings on me creating much amusement I then made a short farewell address got into Mac A Rony s saddle and gave the word to start Such a cheer as arose from the ladies that lined the veranda I ll bet there wasn t one who would have missed the event for a five dollar note Hugging the Grand River the only hugging I had done in that section until after dark we trailed through the sage until ten o clock when discovering a fair grazing place I ordered camp My donkeys had just rested two days so next day the twenty eighth day of August I made them trail fast and far in spite of the heat It was five o clock when we pitched camp near the Scott Ranch I had observed a cow and several hens about the ranch If I couldn t get milk I might still obtain fresh eggs and vice versa Not waiting to unpack for a can I set out for the house and knocked at the back door Come in called a female voice I entered the kitchen with hat in hand and politely said How to do The sober faced housewife did not pause in her duties as she welcomed me to be seated I came to purchase some milk and eggs I said presently Ain t got no eggs er milk to spare jest now she replied cows all dried up My face reflected my disappointment Are all your hens dry also I asked as the woman deluged a big white cochin with a pan of dish water That one ain t she returned smiling at her play on a word and a hen The incident trifling as it was served to break the ice I introduced myself and explained my journey the woman was interested she had read about me She told me to make myself at home and admitting that one cow still gave milk and she could spare me a little she went to the creamery When she handed me a pail of milk I offered to pay for it and persuaded her to sell me a loaf of bread But I had hardly started for camp with my precious purchases than I was surrounded by a swarm of yellow jackets which proceeded to alight on the rim of the pail and my hand I dropped the milk instantly if not sooner The woman s exclamation of indignation embarrassed me I explained and apologized while my kind hostess tried to convince me of the docility of those yellow jackets from her account one might suppose they were merely a dwarf species of canary birds But finally she forgave my indiscretion refilled the pail and handing it to me told me the insects were perfectly harmless and were not known to sting anybody unless they were harmed I thanked the woman for her exceptional generosity and rare treatise on insectology and again started for my tent resolved to preserve that milk at any cost But I soon wavered from my resolve the pail wavered too I couldn t change it from one hand to the other fast enough to elude those docile yellow jackets Then I hit upon a new idea it looked practical enough I spilled some milk on the ground and after weaning many hornets from the pail I lifted the latter covered it with my hat and made for camp Now once in a while a babe is found hard to wean the same may be said of a yellow jacket One buzzing fellow doubtless young and feeble and being tired from long flight sat on my bald pate to rest there to die a violent death On that spot although his remains were removed was soon reared a monumental mound sacred to his memory I yelled before I remembered it was not manly to do such a thing and the good madam hastening to my aid if not relief carried the pail of milk to my tent also bringing with her a can of jam Her kind forgiving disposition mentally paralyzed me My own unprecedented conduct almost made me hang my sore head with shame We men dined on bread and milk and at seven o clock struck out for Meeker We had passed through the village of Newcastle when some fifteen miles from the Springs and there were invited into a peach orchard to delight our palates with some delicious fruit but no other village did we thread on our route to White River The last twenty miles of the journey led us across a series of divides mesas or benches variously called and between these miniature watersheds trickled occasional rivulets which either lost themselves in the parched soil or struggled on till they joined with a larger stream to reach a river As the tired eye wanders over this sun scorched wilderness strewn with what appears to be volcanic matter he imagines he sees on the black rock strewn butes the craters of long extinct volcanos which the ravages of time and the elements have almost leveled And over these charred piles and the intervening plains of white and yellow sage one sometimes sees a solitary horse or steer standing bewildered as if before impending doom or else trending by animal instinct some tortuous obscured trail to a hidden spring Meeker takes its name from a family massacred by the Indians in the seventy s Four or five hundred inhabitants to day compose this quiet and now law abiding community whose chief pursuits appear to be the pursuit of wild steers horses fish and game White River flows past the town on its picturesque way to the Grand the latter further on joining forces with the Green to form the Colorado The hills about Meeker abound with large game mountain lions bear bobcats and when the snow comes deer and elk I was informed from authentic sources that in early winter the deer are driven by the snow down the river in to Grand Junction valley in such numbers that ranchmen have had to stand guard over haystacks with guns and pitchforks One woman told me with modest candor that she had actually seen her husband catch and hold a deer in his arms After leaving Meeker the scenic views from the trail down and along White River for seventy miles are magnificent and imposing Rising sheer and bold from the west bank of this deep stream is a lofty ridge of brown and barren mountains whose mural crests of red and yellow sandstone and limestone formed in my imagination the walls and watch towers of castles of a prehistoric race while the placid river at their base appeared to be a mighty moat to protect the towering battlements from menacing foe White River City lies some twenty miles south of Meeker It has great possibilities If another house were erected there and it domiciled as many people as the one habitation then standing did the population of the place would be increased one hundred per cent Even a part of that house was converted into a post office and a general store About twenty five miles from White River City is Angora another town containing a single house We arrived at sunset The proprietor of this goat ranch invited me to pitch camp on his meadow lot where my animals could find some feed and treated me to a leg of goat He possessed a herd of about two hundred Angoras and derived his chief livelihood from their hair hides and mutton as he called it I found the meat sweet and tender it was hard to distinguish it from lamb possibly because I had forgotten how lamb tasted My host visited my camp fire and entertained me with many interesting tales of adventure Occasional gardens and fields of alfalfa are seen on the east bank all due to irrigation Great water wheels turned by the river current raise cans of water ten feet and more and empty them in troughs so conveying the water to ditches Ranchmen had cautioned me to give Rangely the next settlement a wide berth I was told it was a den of outlaws and desperate cowboys who lived by rustling cattle and rebranding them hunting mavericks unbranded calves and following other nefarious pursuits Instead of frightening me away these accounts interested me At four in the afternoon we came to a trail branching and leading to a large log house a half mile away That was Rangely and we headed for it CHAPTER XLIII BY MAC A RONY I ll say of it It tutors nature artificial strife Lives in these touches livelier than life Timon of Athens Pod was always looking for trouble The fellow who courts trouble finds it sooner or later I brayed myself hoarse trying to persuade my reckless master to give Rangely a wide berth He couldn t think of it He was anxious to meet real wild and woolly west cowboys of the old time style he didn t fear the worst of em Hit the trail there Mac he said spurring me toward the hotbed of cowboy rascality Arriving at the house saloon store city hall business headquarters of Rangely the dozen rough looking men lounging about swaggered toward us pleased like and curious Prospectin one inquired N o o o Pod drawled just traveling That was the time in Pod s life when he ought to have lied Then he explained where he was from and where he was bound but did not say that he was a darn fool The cowboys grunted or nodded or smiled some winked to each other and one of em nudged another in the ribs everything they did had a deep meaning I began to tremble for Pod Would they shoot at his heels and make him dance Or make him ride a bucking bronco Or what Better feed yer jacks Mister said one ye ll find grain in th shed yender Pod seemed to be as delighted as we donks The Prof is going to catch it soon Cheese observed Serve him right added Damfino Coonskin left us to feed and walked to the house with Pod Soon afterward they returned with a cowboy who said I had a good shape asked my weight and inquired if I was sound in body and mind then he questioned Coonskin What did you do fer yer salt fore ye jined th outfit I was night porter in a hotel was the reply What was ye doin fore that Railroading some And fore that Painting Paintin what Church steeples Golly yer jest th man we re lookin fer Coonskin didn t quite understand them but he did later Bridle this ere jack said the cowboy meaning me Coonskin bridled me and rode to the joint I didn t think anything would happen to me Several more cowboys had just come in from the range and soon every man of the gang was busy I now noticed one fellow mixing red paint three or four were making two ladders another one appeared with an armful of blankets and another with ropes and presently a cowboy climbed one of the ladders to the roof Something was doing sure Pod seemed interested but didn t say anything Coonskin looked as if he saw his finish I giggled Suddenly came a surprise One cowboy wrapped the blankets round my body while another bound them on with lariats another trimmed my tail with a pair of sheepshears Then ropes were fastened to my body and the other ends thrown to the men on the roof Next the ropes were slung round the two chimneys at both ends of the roof and thrown to the gang below At once the cowboys grabbed hold and pulled and I rose in the air until my head bunked against the eaves There I dangled and swung and kicked and brayed Never was so scared in all my life Splinters flew as I kicked holes in the house and knocked off a section of the eaves The cowboys howled they thought it so funny But the real circus began when Pod was commanded to mount a ladder with a pail of red paint and using my tail for a brush paint the name R A N G E L Y on that house Coonskin was made to climb the other ladder with another pail of paint and he being a professional painter with a real paint brush go over Pod s lettering to make a decent job of it Well I had seen Pod mad but never as mad as he was then He grabbed my tail and started to paint a big letter R when I up and kicked the pail out of his hands and sent red paint flying all over half the cowboys not satisfied with this I put a few more holes in the house and finally hit the ladder and spilled Pod on the ground The cowboys thought that was fun too some were so tickled they fired off their revolvers Here Coonskin was told to divide his paint with Pod and the painting was continued on the letter A The Prof worked as well as he could with such a nervous paint brush now and then dodging my heels I admit I didn t know what I was doing when suddenly I struck my master in the stomach and made him get down from the ladder But the sign had to be finished Up the ladder again Pod climbed like a man the cowboys pulled on the ropes dragging me along so that my tail could be brought to where the next letter should be Then Pod started on the fourth letter G By this time the men were tugging on the ropes to keep me in position for the painter s convenience Finally the men backed from the house and pulled me away from its side and Pod turned me about till I hung the other end to and began the fifth letter E Now I could see the sign It was up hill I knew it wouldn t suit those cowboys and I expected it would have to be painted over It wasn t Pod s fault it wasn t mine As I was gradually pulled along the eaves the higher I was raised because there was no pulley on the rope But now that I was turned about I was swung back some and the E had to be painted below the level of the first four letters L and Y followed each other up hill until just as the job was finished I hit the pail a crack with my right foot and sprinkled two more cowboys The crowd made sport of them and I think after all those cowboys fared worse than we three painters Then I was lowered to the earth To my surprise the cowboys liked the sign immensely One pronounced it artistic another said it was odd and people would notice it and several agreed that it was the best job of its kind they ever saw Pod didn t seem to be tickled over this flattery but Coonskin was puffed up with pride and when one fellow told him he ought to have stuck to painting he acknowledged that he should have done so When the two started down the ladders the cowboys called Hold on there we want a speech So the Prof made a speech Both men were then escorted indoors and the barkeeper mixed a high ball in a pail and sent it out to me I was loony for hours afterwards I never want another experience like that Pod said afterward it was his first and last painting He thought the cowboys might have shot a pipe out of his mouth but he hadn t thought they could condescend to such a low trick as to make him paint a sign with his donkey s tail The cowboys wanted us to spend the night with them but Pod replied that he couldn t tarry but he said he was much obliged for all their courtesies About dark we said good bye and pretending we would travel ten miles that evening pitched camp near a bridge crossing White River one or two miles from Rangely At dawn the men were out after sage hens They saw several but couldn t get a shot at the shy creatures We started early and traveled over a desolate wilderness of sage and greasewood in a torturing sun and were unpacked at one o clock for an hour s rest Sometimes the trail led through deep channels in the hard baked sand for several hundred yards where we were obscured from view These channels wound about through the desert and mesa as if they might be the beds of dried up rivers and they were often so narrow that had we met a wagon either our outfit or the vehicle would have had to turn back We came across quantities of skeletons and skulls of horses and cattle and wild animals but I failed to see any donkey s bones Don was glad when in these cuts for he managed there to keep in the shade while trailing in the open he was ever trotting ahead to hide under a bush where three fourths of him was exposed to the sun Toward the middle of the afternoon we crossed the backbone of the plateau at an altitude of seven thousand feet and met a wagon with four horses bound for Leadville with honey The driver said he was from Vernal some sixty miles to the west Pod thought honey would go well with hot cakes for supper and after some coaxing got the freighter to break a case and sell him a half dozen boxes Then the question arose how could he safely carry the honey Good idee not to put all your eggs in one basket Coonskin remarked Pod said he wouldn t He tucked one box in a saddle bag another in a roll of blankets strapped behind his valet s saddle another in a bag of supplies on Skates and the last two he packed carefully in the canvas awning The men conversed and smoked awhile when the stranger happened to mention that he sometimes dealt in hides Here was the chance the men were waiting for The bearskin Skates had carried from Turkey Creek belonged to the poker player but he promised half what he should get for it to Pod if he would let the donks carry it till disposed of The man said he was willing to give sixty dollars for a fine silvertip skin so Coonskin unpacked The stranger was more pleased with it than he would admit and hemmed and hawed some about the price but finally paid the sixty dollars and we moved on It was six o clock and the sun was sinking behind the distant plain when the buildings of the K ranch loomed in the distance The sound of galloping horses approaching us from behind caused me to look around and I beheld two Indians with guns in hand yelling and gesticulating wildly as they leaned over their ponies necks spurring hard to catch up with us When Pod and Coonskin saw the Indians after them they got ready to throw up their hands Their faces were as chalky as an alkali desert Have you seen any cattle branded U S one of the wild men inquired Pod said he hadn t Where you from questioned the half breed Pod said White River country Ah we just from there been hunting up stolen cattle the half breed replied Found them but fellows wouldn t give them up We ve done our duty the fort must deal with them now Pod asked what fort and was told Fort Duchesne some seventy miles away We learned that two companies of colored troops of the U S army were stationed there The Indians never touched us CHAPTER XLIV BY PYE POD Dost not hear the neighing of horses the blare of the trumpets the beating of the drums I hear nothing said Sancho but a great bleating of ewes and wethers And this was true for the two flocks had now come up near them Don Quixote The great K ranch welcomed us just before dark My animals were generously fed and we men soon joined the Indian policemen at supper in the house When next morning the foreman saw us pack the donkeys he expressed surprise at my traveling with such a luxurious camp outfit The folding table and chairs awning many blankets and other articles were condemned as disgraceful by this experienced plainsman so my sensibilities being shocked by such a criticism I abandoned a hundred pounds of luggage giving the table chairs and superfluous blankets to the ranchman and selling him the awning then we resumed the journey Green River was twenty five miles to the west The journey was even more monotonous than that of the previous day The powdered alkali rose in our faces and penetrated our eyes and throats compelling us almost constantly to sip from our canteens wrapped in wet cloths to keep the water cool Frequently my dog would jump at the larger canteens in the panniers and bark for a drink I loved to watch him lie down in the narrow shade of a donkey and resting his chin on the rim of the basin slowly lap the frugal measure of water I was able to spare him We reached Green River by five and waited until the ferryman awoke from his daydream to guide the flat boat across the stream for us He charged me only two dollars I thought it very decent of him as the river was too deep to be forded and he controlled the only ferry our only alternative was to swim this treacherous stream Several overland travelers with prairie schooners were in camp on the opposite shore eastward bound I paid a dollar to graze my animals in an alfalfa field for the night but when we left for Vernal next morning every donkey had the stomach ache They grunted and groaned on the march until noontime and deplored their gluttony with sundry brays that were grating on the nerves Vernal is a veritable oasis in a desert nestling in a broad and fertile valley which irrigated from the numerous springs in the mountains forming a rampart round it is a garden of vivid green Farmhouses dot the orchards and meadows everywhere and the village itself is splendidly shaded Honey is a leading industry one can see bee hives in almost every door yard After a good supper with a stranger who offered his hospitality we two strolled about the flower scented streets in the cool evening air until we retired to a downy bed in his apartment that made me wish my trip at an end Here were no mosquitoes The fruits of this valley are prolific and delicious and haven t a blemish the water is pure and the climate healthful and exhilarating surely Vernal received its name from Nature The frontier post Fort Duchesne lay twenty eight miles to the south across a desert waste A few miles beyond Vernal we entered the Uintah Indian Reservation Further on we saw the shacks and teepees of the Utes and once we passed a party of this treacherous tribe on their ponies Apparently taking us for desperadoes they veered off to some distance in the sage and gave us a wide berth The strength and humility of their little steeds was surprising Several of them carried four and five people the buck sometimes with a boy in front of him and his squaw astride behind him with a papoose strapped to her back and a boy or girl behind her When they saw Damfino with her towering pack they too perhaps did some wondering We crossed the bridge spanning the Uintah River just before sunset and reached the guardhouse of the fort just as the bugle sounded retreat parade To my surprise and delight the officer of the day Lieut Horne was adjutant and chief commissary and better still an old classmate And when after parade I saw the popular officer crossing the parade ground to meet me I wondered if the changes wrought in our appearance by the lapse of thirteen years would make us both unrecognizable Our meeting was amusing The orderly ushered me into the officer s presence and I advanced and grasped my old friend s hand in a manner to convince him that I knew him but while we shook hands vigorously and playfully punched each other in the shoulders the puzzled man could not speak my name You old fool Don t you know me I asked still shaking his hand You disgraceful old vagabond Of course I know you but blast me if I can place you he returned grinning all over Who are you for heaven s sake Where re you from and how did you get here Speak man Relieve me of suspense if you don t want to get shot by a colored regiment of United States troopers Why I asked is it possible that you do not recollect your old classmate the famous pillow fight at S s Hotel The mock fight with our old chum Mike H n in my room when you frightened the boy from West Virginia half to death with Pod Blast me if it ain t Pod exclaimed the Lieutenant Well well if this doesn t beat me Sit down and tell me about it I am glad to see you But you do look rough Prospecting Or fighting Indians Or what I explained My animals I said were waiting outside in the care of my valet Horne rose in astonishment Traveling overland with a valet he exclaimed You are a beautiful looking swell I have often read about you but blast me if I ever once suspected it was my old chum making the famous trip Show me the jackasses Forthwith I escorted the laughing Lieutenant out and presented Mac A Rony I spent two enjoyable days at Fort Duchesne as the guest of my friend One of the first to call upon me was the genial Colonel commanding He asked me to lecture to the residents of the post Accordingly I gave my talk that evening to a large audience and at its conclusion I was introduced to many ladies and officers of the post and afterwards entertained at the army club The following day at one o clock my outfit was ready to start The donkeys were in fine fettle and Don frisked about gayly eager for the journey My friend regretted I could not spend a month with him and tucked a package in my saddle bag by which to remember him and many officers and ladies joined with him in wishing me God speed Then we waved an adieu and climbed the long sage covered mesa toward Heber City a hundred and thirty mile march without a habitation in view Fort Duchesne was still in sight when a hailstorm struck us The donkeys were compelled to close their eyes and turn their backs to the fearful charges of the merciless elements while we men pulled our hats over our eyes put our hands in our pockets and crouched under our animals still we were severely bruised and our necks and arms were black and blue When the hail ceased the leaden clouds poured down a cold rain which beat in our faces and greatly impeded travel The trail was soon converted into a veritable torrent the sand or rock waste soil softened into mire many inches deep causing the stubbornly faithful burros to slip and stumble and labor as they never did before We had journeyed only sixteen miles when at eight o clock we pitched camp on the banks of the swollen Lake Fork River The night was black What a nasty predicament No bottom to the soil anywhere the mud and water reached to my boot tops Before unpacking we cut sage brush and trampled it into a large square bed two feet deep on which to place our packs Then picketing the animals we tried to kindle a fire with water soaked brush sprinkled with coal oil but failed Soon a ranchman arrived leading his horse and said he had almost lost his steed while fording the river and narrowly escaped drowning He joined us in a cold supper of canned meat and corn whiskey and water then rode away in the pouring rain Our bed that night was anything but inviting We could not pitch the tent The soaked sage and the rain saturated our canvas sleeping bag and dampened our clothing How I regretted having disposed of those superfluous blankets at the K ranch We were not only wet but cold rolled in two blankets and a quilt When I awoke in the morning I even wrung the water out of the underwear I had slept in and also my trousers and coat before I could get them on and then in the still pouring rain ate a cold breakfast saddled packed and resumed the trip That day we made twenty miles and ran as terrible a gauntlet of thunderbolts as I ever witnessed Next day it became necessary to swim Lake Fork Mac said it was his Rubicon as well as mine The current was swift and roared and foamed like a mountain torrent My donkeys brought to the water s edge reared and wheeled and rushed intractably into the willows scraping off their packs on the miry banks it required a half hour to replace and securely cinch the luggage on the beasts so that it might not be washed away Then with stout willow goads and howling invectives we drove the braying animals into the flood and followed them fording or swimming across the river Cheese was carried down stream and almost drowned Gaining the nether bank we tramped through storm and mire all day making eighteen miles and after dark camped with the party of a prairie schooner at the foot of a hill where we found seasoned cedar stumps for fuel and built a roaring fire The soil there was more solid the land gently sloping and we pitched the tent near the wagon and fire staked the donkeys and joined hands with our chance acquaintances to provide the evening meal The good woman of the party gave us a pie a can of beef and a loaf of bread these luxuries together with boiled potatoes and hot coffee put our bodies in prime condition for a sound night s sleep in wet garments and bedding My provisions were not only quite spoiled by the rain and river water but were insufficient to last us through Rising early we breakfasted in the rain and traveled only fifteen miles swimming the Duchesne River once and fording it twice that day The stream was somewhat deeper than Lake Fork but the current less swift and at every crossing my donkeys rebelled Soon after the last fording the sun broke through the clouds and gave us an opportunity to dry ourselves and freight A patch of wild meadow enabled my animals to fill their empty stomachs with grass while some giant sage brush soon dried in the broiling sun allowing us to spread our blankets and soaked apparel thereon We unpacked and cooked and when our clothes were dry enough to feel comfortable and shrunken enough hardly to be got on we resumed the march Our supplies were in a mess Our only can of coal oil was broken and the contents had seasoned every eatable not canned The forgotten boxes of honey had been smashed and everything was gummed with it every pack smelled like a bee hive The honey I rolled in our underwear diluted with the water of the several fords had permeated the raiment so thoroughly that now the heat of our bodies began to warm it up and my clothes were soon glued to my skin That night we camped on Current Creek after fording the stream A bear appeared but scampered grunting into the thicket my dog not inclined to give chase Once I was awakened by the cry of a mountain lion and Coonskin said the yelps of wolves kept the dog growling and snarling half the night through It appeared that we were experiencing the fall equinox Wearily traveling through another day of rain we camped for the night near a bunch of dwarf cedars Now the rain ceased for a couple of hours and enabled us to kindle a fire and cook before lightning played on every hand and the rain descended again Our largest canteen leaked from some accident it had received and our surprise and despair on discovering the emptied receptacle may be imagined What should we do for drinking water I had not more than asked the question than my eye discerned several small basins in the table rocks close by These basins were filled but were so shallow that only by dipping the water with a saucer could we obtain a two quart can of the precious liquid next morning we secured another frugal supply for the ensuing day s journey Our luggage was placed under two cedars for protection from the storm During the night we were awakened by the terrific crash of a thunderbolt which struck so near as to shock us In the morning I saw that one of the trees had been struck But our packs were uninjured save the whiskey bottle which was broken and its precious contents lost Thus the sympathy existing between Jersey lightning and Utah lightning Another day s tramp over a muddy trail and a night camp on another roaring stream Red Creek our supplies quite exhausted we boiled some onions and ate them with the last of our honey I felt as if I were eating diphtheria medicine Next morning we breakfasted on a turkey buzzard shot by Coonskin and that afternoon my jaded caravan crossed the summit of the plateau and descended into the beautiful Strawberry Valley in the glow of a gorgeous sunset Soon after we met two sheep herders on horseback looking for two comrades and when crossing the broad verdant valley we saw two great flocks of sheep one grazing up the valley the other down We camped near Strawberry Creek The four sheep herders rode up presently and having a wagon full of supplies said if I would lend them my tent poles they would string up a lamb and divide I gladly consented Two of the herders rode off to mill up the flocks for the night while the other two butchered a sheep built a fire and cooked If the scene of that highland camp could have been painted with true color and detail it certainly would have made the artist famous A few feet from the flaming fire stood my tent poles like a tripod and from their apex was suspended head down a fat mutton on bended knee with hunting knife in hand one of the herders was taking its woolly pelt The coffee pot and frying pan were on the fire with a kettle of boiling potatoes and while the shepherd cook was preparing bread for my Dutch oven two herders gathered sage for a reserve supply of fuel Some fifty feet way the horses were picketed and across the stream the donkeys grazed on the juicy grass untethered but none the less secure in the novel corral of twenty thousand sheep which the faithful shepherd dogs promised to keep milled round us all throughout the black chilly night The camp fire sent flashlight beams on the surrounding scene and etched weird pictures on the darkness The silhouetted heads and backs of the horses and donkeys moved fantastically against the starry sky like animated mountain peaks on the distant horizon the vast field of wool encompassing us and the bleating of its contented life seemed like the troubled waters of some highland lake imprisoning us on its one small island and away across the vale and again just above us towered the barrier of mountains against the sparkling heavens forming banks and pillows for stray clouds to sleep upon At a late hour we hungry men sat down to a tasty supper of fried mutton potatoes hot bread and coffee The air soon rang with laughter Later when we brought forth our companionable pipes and began story telling round the cozy fire I felt a delight which seemed a full compensation for the hardships we had suffered during the last week Suddenly the cry of a mountain lion set the collies barking but the report of a herder s rifle silenced the prowler and sent him back no doubt into the hills The lions and wolves are a constant menace to the flocks in that popular valley It was midnight when we retired Storm clouds had gathered and shut out the light of the stars it looked and felt like snow The shepherds learning that we travelers were short of bedding brought us two heavy woolen blankets so we rolled ourselves together and were soon asleep and in the morning awoke covered with snow an inch deep By seven o clock we were ready to resume our journey and the shepherds had saddled their mounts for their day s duties Trailing out of the valley and through Daniel s Canyon we traveled some twenty five miles down to the lowlands and at nine in the evening pitched camp near where next morning we discovered a ranchhouse and haystack Heber City lay five miles away arriving there we were royally entertained Friday we started for Provo The trail lay through a picturesque canyon along the bank of Provo River where the mountains rose sheer and barren to a great height on either hand Numerous waterfalls pour their loveliness over steep declivities patches of crimson and yellow verdure showed in the crevices of the gray summits and now and then a terraced vineyard or orchard or an irrigation ditch hugging the steep slopes indicated a habitation was hidden somewhere near in leafy bower or vine covered trellis Once we crossed the river on a new iron bridge replacing an old stone structure which avalanches had demolished Passing the night in Provo I rode Skates six miles to Springville through a beautiful verdant valley where rows of poplars lined the fields and orchards reminding one of Normandy There I was greeted by a newspaper editor and a school principal the latter inviting me to dinner Returning to Provo I found my outfit ready for trail Making a brief stop in Lehi we reached Pleasant Grove about eight and camped in a peach orchard adjoining a hotel The landlord welcomed us to a hot supper in spite of the late hour then offered us a downy bed which we declined preferring the pure crisp outer air I boarded the early morning train for Salt Lake City to attend Sunday service at the Tabernacle and hear the famous organ and choir Coonskin remained behind to care for our animals Without my donkeys to identify me my rough unkempt and most eccentric person caused a sensation at the Mormon capital I kept aloof from everybody and nobody was inquisitive enough to inquire my name errand and previous condition of servitude I strolled about the beautiful city and then went to church Illustration The last and only drop Illustration Just finished lunch when the posse arrived An usher with a charitable heart led me half way down the aisle to a pew in the midst of that fashionable congregation Every one was dressed better than Pod But I did not feel ill at ease on the contrary I felt at home A great many true churchmen and churchwomen should have kept their eyes on their hymnals instead of watching me try to chant I want to be a Mormon and with the Mormons stand Presently my sensitive nerves were irritated by successive coughing across the aisle I looked to see what kind of a mortal was suffering so and beheld a vision of loveliness Instantly I remembered a small box of cough drops in my pocket and felt it my duty as a gentleman to summon the courage to cross the aisle and offer the soothing remedy Soon with palpitating heart and crimson face I stepped with quaking limbs across the aisle and reached the box to the fair cougher I remember her look as she lifted the lid of the empty box I knew plenty of people in my lifetime who had fainted I regretted never having taken lessons from them My head reeled the Tabernacle was going round and with difficulty I retreated to the pew in front of my hat which I looked for but couldn t find I needed fresh air I wanted to go out Strange to say the lady stopped coughing It was the shock that cured her but the congregation were not aware of that Some of them saw her look into the mysterious pasteboard box and turn red beet color and cease her convulsions That was why several spoke to me and asked if I were a magician or healer as they had read of such people When I had once escaped into the airy street I wondered how that box became emptied then suddenly I recollected that before retiring the night before Coonskin asked if I had some cough drops left and helped himself After dinner I felt better I visited the Jubilee Museum where was exhibited an interesting collection of Mormon relics of pioneer days and then took a car for Fort Douglas about three miles from the city on the mountain side and was invited to tea with an officer of the post my old friend Lieut K n It was late when I reached Pleasant Grove The following day my party covered nearly twenty five miles and about two o clock on the succeeding afternoon marched into the Mormon capital There a well known pioneer made a speech and welcomed me to the city and after I had responded in fitting words he presented me to leading citizens among them bishops presidents and elders of the Mormon church The presiding bishop an affable old gentleman asked the privilege of caring for my animals at the Tithing House another prominent citizen invited me to be his guest I declined the latter kindness preferring to be a free lance and to make the most of my sojourn I was next introduced to Governor Wells That same evening Coonskin and I were invited to the theater and next day besides delivering many lectures I contracted with S Company prominent silversmiths to make a full set of silver shoes for Mac A Rony to be sent to Oakland Cal and there to be set for his triumphant entry into San Francisco CHAPTER XLV BY MAC A RONY O that he were here to write me down an ass but masters remember that I am an ass though it be not written down yet forget not that I am made an ass Much Ado About Nothing My sojourn in the famous Mormon Capital was too short for my taste I shall remember it as long as I have bra in s I am proud to say that I was initiated into the Mormon faith and took unto myself no less than eleven wives and I would have outrivaled Brigham Young in connubial conquests if Pye Pod had not bribed the Elders and put an end to my marital ambitions While a guest at the Tithing House I found it well stored with asinine and equine luxuries The Bishop and many charming lasses brought me bread cake apples and jam and some genial fellow of a convivial turn tapped a bottle of rum punches After imbibing a few balls I was quite ready to tipple Cheese Damfino and Skates and right here let me say that of all skates I ever knew or heard about the last named takes the palm as an artist in high jinks While she gave a clever exhibition of an inebriated athlete the rest of us donks lay stupidly on a bunch of hay which was one tenth of some Mormon s harvest and reveled in day dreams Skates had reached that stage of her circus where she was burlesquing a Shetland pony cavorting on two legs when Coonskin announced it was time to start None of us stirred except Skates She showed the man how superbly she could pirouette on her left legs around the corral then suddenly she toppled over in front of him and reached for the bottle lying at his feet Coonskin grabbed the bottle smelt of it eyed each one of us distrustfully flung it over the fence and prodded us all on to our feet You can bet he had a hard job to keep two of us standing let alone all four of us He looked disgusted turned on his heel and made for the gate at once When Coonskin returned he bore a pail of water in each hand Indeed the forgiving old soul I thought is going to refresh us and wash that dull brown taste out of our mouths Staggering to my feet I advanced to meet him Damfino and Cheese were almost dead to the world but Skates made for the man on a lop sided trot arriving at one pail just as I reached the other Into the liquid we dipped our nozzles and as quickly jerked them out What strange tasting water Water from a mineral spring observed Skates No it s a bromo seltzer said I Then each drank about a fourth of a pailful and would have drunk more but Coonskin snatched the pails away and it seems transposed them Again we fell to drinking But so help me Balaam soon something began to boil and sizzle inside of me I thought I had swallowed a school of swordfish but immediately a geyser raged within and like a shot spouted out of my mouth spraying Coonskin s face and almost simultaneously Skates played another fountain in the man s eyes Seidlitz powders I gasped trying to catch my breath which seemed to have left me forever And didn t that man curse the whole race of jackasses Dropping the pails he ran for a pump Presently Coonskin returned You infernal scapegraces he exclaimed as he eyed me and picked up the pails My recent experience had quite restored me to a rational donkey and remembering that a soft word turneth away wrath I said You are too eager to fix the blame on an innocent creature Master Coonskin The recent episode which was so distasteful to us three and most exasperating to you points a good moral Never become so absorbed in the virtues of a cure that you are blind to its possible effect upon your patient The man left us shaking his head and talking to himself and administered the dose to Damfino and Cheese When Coonskin first visited us it was eleven o clock Damfino did not sound eight brays to announce the sun s meridian and the hour for barley but we donks were considered sober enough to be packed by one o clock although in poor condition to travel It was an effort for me to walk an impossibility to walk straight My asinine comrades grunted and groaned from nausea and Cheese complained that we had been cheated of our mid day meal When we arrived at the Hotel Pod had just finished his luncheon Damfino looked into the hotel portal and brayed Then Pod came out got into my saddle and amid great applause from the assembled citizens piloted our caravan down the broad thoroughfare out of the lovely poplared streets and hospitable home lined avenues past orchard and field and cottage and windmill over the road to Garfield Beach on that mysterious inland sea a few miles from the city Once or twice as I wabbled across the level and luxuriant valley I turned my head for one last lingering look behind though I confess I did so timorously with a feeling intermixed with superstitious foreboding as I recalled the story of how Lot s wife turned into a pillar of salt It suggested itself to my reason that if there was one spot on earth indigenous to such a dire transformation it was right in that Salt Lake valley There above and behind us and across the majestic towers of the Temple lay Fort Douglas the gem frontier post of America its white painted fences and barns glistened like meerschaum in the sunshine with lovely drives and walks and smooth cut foliage and sleek broomed lawns of emerald and fountains not charged with seidlitz and blooming flowers And beyond towered the rugged snow crowned summits of the eternal barrier which holds the fort below and guards with loving care the Land of Promise and that so called modern Zion at their feet like a dog guards his bone when threatening elements are wagging his way We arrived at Utah s Coney Island Garfield Beach late in the middle of the afternoon This famed resort named after the martyr President who was the victim of an assassin is a very pleasant retreat on the lake shore It is accessible by railroad train horse and buggy or donkey engine although few people accept the latter mode of conveyance as Pod did I observed Pod stopped to swim and float on Salt Lake Then we went on and brought up at a delicious fresh water well in front of the Spencer Ranch house where I led my asinine quartette in the song of the Old Oaken Bucket An audience at once gathered mister S invited us all to tarry for the night and when the Prof accepted we donks gave three tigers and a kick which struck the ranch dog as being most extraordinary Landing on the other side of the fence he yelped himself into the house without further assistance CHAPTER XLVI BY PYE POD There are braying men in the world as well as braying asses for what s loud and senseless talking and swearing any other than braying Sir Roger L Estrange We set out early from Spencer ranch refreshed by a good night s sleep The weather was mild but the trail dusty and the country uninteresting I found Tooele to be a sociable town that from appearances subsisted mainly on sympathy and fruit Some of its denizens own outlying ranches or fruit farms and the remainder those who don t have sympathy for those who do There appears however betwixt these two outcropping extremes to be ample means with which to provide the more modest comforts of life wives and children for such are known to exist under any conditions all over the world No sooner had I entered the village than a gentle eyed siren coyly approached and said her papa wished me to put my jacks in his stable While I was trying to please that man a squatty youth scraped across the road in his elder brother s breeches to say that his mother would like to have me spend the night at her house Sociable people all right my valet remarked while I said to the boy Kid you run and tell your good mother that I have a man with me and if she can accommodate us both I will be glad to compensate her liberally for the hospitality But these Mormon beaux esprits while followers of the Prophet reverence old Bacchus as though he were Young As soon as my animals were provided for Coonskin and I were called to supper and greeted at the gate by mister and missus Noah and the children I was hungry and tired It occurred to me that in all probability my hosts had drawn heavily on their larder to provide a generous repast and would yet have to pluck all their drakes and ganders before they could make our beds down That evening on venturing in the street I was held up by a jolly party armed with two kegs of beer a barrel of sandwiches and a number of mandolins and guitars In front of my donkey s quarters was a spacious grass grown area where they spread their feast there I met my fete The serenade if not the banquet was in honor of the whole party biped and quadruped Although my dog whined at the harmony to frighten the performers Mac and Damfino applauded the classic selections vociferously while all four donks availed themselves of standing room only rest their chins on the top corral rail and audibly discussed the exercises As soon as my entertainers departed Coonskin and I sought our hostess It was a beautiful September night No air was astir The sky was darkly clear and the myriad stars were winking with insomnia Startled from sound sleep at early dawn by a blast from a busted fish horn I rolled out of bed in the presence of Noah instead of Gabriel as I was frightened to expect The next thing was to wash and dress A half vinegar barrel stood at the back door abrim with water I was told it was soft but I found it hard enough to wash in A few feathers floated on the surface and the soft water looked like soft soap Old Noah was one ahead of me and dipped in His wife sons and dog made their ablutions in turn while the Shanghai hens and a pet magpie had doubtless rinsed their fowl beaks in it I watched the exhibition reflectively and concluding it would not show proper respect to appear at table before taking a dip and that more than likely I should have to drink worse water before I had crossed the desert I ducked my head paddled my fins then dried them in the sun for I couldn t go that towel The scrambled pigs feet at breakfast was a new dish to this epicure though my versatile valet observed with an inflated appetite that he had often made pigs feet scramble back in Wisconsin In spite of a late start we reached Stockton before noon My first duty was to hunt up an opulent resident whom I had met at the soiree in Tooele and who had promised me a burro We at once unpacked the donkeys to give them a restful nooning and piled the luggage in front of a store It was here that my philanthropic friend found me smoking At once he sent a lad to chase up a good strong burro to make good his promise next he offered me the freedom of the town I m kind of tired my good sir I said gratefully but how how far is the town The donor of Coxey blinked his eyes and felt of his goatee then straightening back said Not fer it s right here Can t you see it all round ye Ye didn t cal luate ter find a New Yirk er New Orlins did ye This is jest plain unadulterated Stockton and it s glad ter welcome ye Now if ye re trim ter go about a piece I ll guide ye Thanks awfully I replied rising Take me to a smith the first thing I want all my donks feet examined and put in condition for the desert Then leaving an order for supplies at the store I had Coonskin ride my new burro to the blacksmith After a two and a half hour sojourn in Stockton my caravan was wending its way to the next and last town we would visit in Utah saint Johns The next after that would be one hundred and seventy five miles away Here and there along the trail a ranchman s shack stood alone the glistening window panes flashing like a lighthouse tower in that sea of sage An occasional horse or steer would loom above the brush once or twice a jackrabbit bounded across the trail or a weary buzzard careened in the air overhead as though figuring for me a fatal horoscope I was silent a long time before Coonskin reminded me that I had neglected my weekly letter to the papers Said he It s a good time to cultivate the acquaintance of Samantha Jane that typewriter you got at Salt Lake Can t you suggest something more sensible I replied How can I manage the machine while riding a jackass Easy enough said Coonskin Lash it on Damfino and seat yourself as you would to play solitaire Great idea The neglected typewriter was at once introduced to my party for the first time and secured in a comfortable position on the broad backed donkey Then I seated myself vis a vis and opened up a somewhat spirited conversation on the journey It was not with the best of grace that Samantha Jane consented to be my amanuensis She held the sheet of paper very mechanically and appeared utterly devoid of animation I first tried to date my letter I shot my finger at the S key and struck the L just as Damfino nabbed at a sage bush I ll correct the spelling afterward I thought and tried to hit the letter E but rapped A full in the face Don t joggle so I yelled at my steed and drawing a bead on P literally knocked down Z as Damfino stubbed her toe Next in vexation I shot at T quite recklessly and punched Y s face close by The effort had overtaxed me and snatching the paper from my typewriter read aloud L A Z Y Mac grinned from ear to ear and Coonskin laughed loudly The donkey remarked that practice is a good remedy for incompetence even if it does not cultivate patience Again and again I tried to write the abbreviation Sept but at length called Coonskin I m going to discharge this typewriter and stow her away till we get to Eureka Your courtship is amusing Keep it up you ll understand each other in time he replied I have my doubts brayed Mac when she won t even let him make a date with her I resolved to begin the letter anew and to write at least a paragraph date or no date This is how it looked when I had finished Talo hab getoch Tho forntnigs ate erut wsot pirowigs og owhym dyl swelboka swice bomblastnig wisj thu cleg pry wet

and distinctly English words in all that jumble of dialects I thought it a good paragraph to practice on and would have tried it over but Coonskin called to me that we were approaching town and from appearances the villagers were going to give us a hearty welcome So I stopped Damfino and hastily tucked Samantha Jane away in time to avoid a scandal CHAPTER XLVII BY MAC A RONY Very good well kissed an excellent courtesy Othello By the time our caravan reached saint Johns Pye Pod was bewailing his failure to discover the key to his typewriter s character the non production of his newspaper letter and the forfeiture of the check it would have brought him besides he was borrowing trouble by deploring his prospective desert journey ere it had begun What a sleepy old hamlet in which to bid farewell to earth he muttered dejectedly as we passed the first house I ll bet thirteen to one that there isn t a soul in the whole settlement to welcome us The great and only Pythagoras Pod D D donkey driver passeth through with his stately train and entereth the seared and thorny purgatory of the desert without the perfume of a single rose to waft to him its balm of comforting sympathy Suddenly a happy cheer greeted our ears in the distance The sound was sweetly feminine and Pod said that to his sensitive ear the angelic chimes swelled and died and softly returned like the tender notes of the nightingale in an echo vale Pod is often swelled by the divine inflatus At this time not a soul beyond our outfit was visible but soon we discovered in the foreground of a kennel shaped schoolhouse a bevy of girls all clad in white and garnished with flowers and delicate vines As we drove near the whole band of pretty maidens led by the tallest of them approached and surrounded us I knew not whether Pod was frightened or elated he fell off my back in an effort to dismount gracefully The pretty chieftess made a bow and looked at the sky and played nervously with her skirt and turned side ways and finally began to intone her Him of the Asinine Pilgrimage Noble and valorous courtier she began softly and a donk of the party brayed Speak louder we daughters of saint Johns Queen of the Desert come to greet you with kind and admiring hearts Coxey brayed boisterously Here Here We hail your brilliant achievement as the planets hail the sun What a Venus that middle one I confided to Pod Your courage your fortitude your manly sacrifice of the associations of your nativity and of the affectionate kisses of dear ones left behind you These we deem should be recognized Therefore having learned that you and your stately caravan were coming by this highway and that your trusty charger Mac A Rony was still standing faithfully by you I bowed at the compliment and your poultroon of long eared cavalry For Balaam s sake What s that she calls us I questioned my mute master She means Platoon not poultroon he explained saint Johns has befittingly chosen the flowers of her desert garden thirteen comely virgins to be presented to you on this momentous occasion And so in honor of your famous exploits continued the chieftess composedly we now come to meet the lion fearlessly in his desert haunts Here take these flowers she handed Pod a bunch and wear them They will prove a talisman to conduct you and your party in safety to the farther desert shore And with the most exalted sweet scented nerve Pod accepted the bokay He smelled of it and examined it and then disappointedly yet courageously replied I see no tulips among the flowers and I love two lips so much Indeed Well then you shall not be disappointed said the pretty speaker and s help me Balaam If that girl didn t step forward and give my surprised master her two lips And every one of the dozen others except the last one gave hers too or drown me in an alkali pond The last girl sensibly boxed his ears Pod just kissed every mouth of them from the eldest to the youngest save the one The touching ceremonies over I rather expected my master to respond eloquently in a few well chosen words but he was speechless Speech cried Cheese and every donkey of us repeated Speech Speech Then Pod found his tongue and began Beautiful and spicy sage flowers he bungled and the maidens sweet faces colored I am completely overcome with this splendid ovation As frogs dive into a crystal pool you have disturbed the morbid surface of my present feelings with radiating ripples which shall widen and cease to fade into oblivion only when I shall have reached the desert s opposite strand The honey you have left on my lips shall sweeten my ertswhile bitter hours and the milk of your human kindness will quench my thirst when the last drop in my canteen has evaporated Now I must bid you all a fond and affectionate farewell At once the silver tongued orator went down the line again kissing each and every one of the dozen he had sampled before then he got into my saddle The thirteen foolish virgins backed sorrowfully against the barbed wire fence with handkerchiefs to their eyes the blushing crimson sun hid his phiz behind the distant mountains a dumb weathercock tried to crow as he tucked himself to roost on a neighboring barn and our caravan moved on toward the desert waste A complete triumph remarked the Professor swelled with pride but for that eldest prude who slapped my face The incident points a moral I returned Don t attempt to pet every cat that purrs CHAPTER XLVIII BY PYE POD The lottery of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing Shakespeare Rocky Mountain canaries were singing their lullabys and Bridget the clock had just called eleven o clock when the house of saint Joer loomed in the darkness A hush was upon it and all the out buildings Though nobody greeted me still I knew where I was by the odd looking arch over the corral gate mister saint Joer was at the soiree in Tooele and had made me promise to tarry with him a night before braving the desert so we camped in the corral We were awakened early by the genial ranchman and escorted in to breakfast with him and a guest a young man from Salt Lake City who had just ridden horseback from Granite Mountain where he had been inspecting some lead mines It was a treat for me to sit again at a meal not cooked by myself all four of us ate with genuine relish The stranger was about thirty of light complexion tall and slender and was dressed in a nobby riding suit with leather leggings and spurs If you take the Granite Mt trail to Redding Springs suggested my host turning to the young engineer for his indorsement but no that s too risky he corrected Save forty miles and more commented the engineer I can give the Professor a diagram of the desert and all the trails to Fedora Spring in Granite Mt the trail from there to Redding is not confusing I understand I said I would take the risk to save forty miles a two days journey My first intention had been to go south of the desert by Fish Springs the route generally traveled by emigrant schooners Three hours later we were climbing the rocky summit of the range that hid the great desert beyond and threading the jagged causeway called the Devil s Gate They rose sheer and craggy high above us immutable witnesses of that sundering catastrophe of nature when the earth s mighty convulsions of a prehistoric age converted an obstacle into a convenient pass When out on the western side and I beheld the broad expanse of sun tanned desert reaching from that sage mottled slope to the parallel stretch of mesa some twenty miles away the intervening Skull Valley lost for me its legendary terrors But it was a forlorn looking prospect only two things made up the perfect picture of a despised Nature alkali and sage About noon when we had proceeded some distance into the Skull Valley desert we stopped to feed and rest an hour before resuming the march As we seemed to have abundance of water and provisions this glaring solitude with such a lugubrious name caused me no dread sensations for when supplied with the necessities of life it is difficult for one to realize the dying man s agonies of starvation or thirst By six we had crossed Skull Valley The last mile of trail wound up a slight grade to a grassy bench where stood a low roofed log shack it was the deserted Scribner s Ranch A few moment s reconnoitering resulted in our finding the spring Then we unpacked and picketed the animals excepting Mac A Rony who was usually allowed to roam at will for when tied he was forever tangling himself in a snarl that required time and patience to unravel Our tent was pitched a hundred feet from the shack whose dusky contour wrapped in the sombre veil of night on the mesa above us and against the sparkling firmament looked cold and repelling indeed Day had advanced two hours when we awoke The broad desert to the west gleamed at white heat While I cooked breakfast Coonskin saddled the animals to save time then the meal over we quickly packed and started for the scorching sands The trail was as hot and level as a fire brick floor As far as the eye could reach in three directions the blue curved dome of heaven and the glistening desert met in a gaseous haze hiding the horizon but in time far to the west as we proceeded gradually rose a bluish gray pyramid which we know to be Granite Mountain while to the rear the distant hills where stood the deserted cabin looked to be mere dust heaps at the base of Nature s architecture the towering rocks of the Cedar Mountains through which we trailed the morning before Every few minutes we had to tap our canteens the powdered alkali dust rose in our faces and swelled our eyes and tongues no amount of water would alleviate our pangs of thirst Besides the evaporation of the water in our cloth wrapped canteens and basket covered demijohn was frightfully great I feared lest the supply would not last us through to Fedora Spring I gave Don frequent drinks yet his eyes were blood shot and his tongue hung out foaming and swollen As a precaution against any sudden freak of madness on his part I held my revolver in readiness to dispatch the dear fellow should it become necessary On the other hand my donkeys strode along quietly without complaint or seeming discomfort as if in their native element Not a living thing could we see beyond our caravan No jack rabbits ventured into the desert no more would a water spaniel breast a scalding sea The only living thing we met with in that gigantic kiln was a horned toad which was existing as a hermit and was apparently content We captured it and Coonskin named it Job because the horns which covered it looked like the extinct craters of once boiling boils Our water was vanishing so rapidly by noon that I decided not to tarry for lunch and rest but to hasten to the spring but at five when the sun was nearer the horizon and evaporation less I ordered a dry camp and the donkeys were unpacked and grained with the last of the barley generously presented by saint Joer We men lunched on cold meat and crackers and canned fruit and sparing draughts of warm water after which we reclined and smoked until the sun set Then we repacked before darkness set in to confuse us How the donkeys did enjoy rolling in the alkali When they had finished their dry ablutions they looked like negroes who had been hit with a bag of flour Just before resuming the march we men poured a few drops of citric acid into our two quart canteens whose tepid water was only an aggravation of our thirst the acid made it palatable Soon afterward I discovered our great error The acid so worked on the tin that the water became in time unfit to drink fearing lest it would poison us we both had to throw the precious liquid away About mid way that afternoon I saw my first mirage It was simply magnificent wonderful A snow crowned mountain rose out of the desert and on top of it turned bottom side up rested its counterpart both phantom peaks remaining a while immovable then they appeared to crush into each other and dissolve The spectacle was bewildering Like mammoth icebergs in a glistening sea they seemed to melt and leave on the arid waste a great lake of crystal water At sundown they reappeared with still grander effect The sun threw a crimson fiery mantle over the under mountain which produced the effect of flowing lava down its snow white slope to a flame red lake on the desert while above on the upper mountain reflected and danced shadows of rose color and pink as if reflected from flames within the crater of a volcano underneath Then as the sun sank below the horizon the upper mountain gradually rose toward the zenith and opened wider like a great fan tinted with all the colors of a rainbow until it faded into radiating webs of gossamer and disappeared One other time we saw plainly the skeletons of a man and a horse glistening several hundred feet from the trail but I was too incredulous to put faith in the old proverb Seeing is believing and passed on Just before dark the huge Granite Mountain looked to be only a couple of miles away Still we traveled till midnight before we passed the edge of the dusky pile so deceiving are distances in that rarified air The evening in that cooling oven of baked sand and alkali was oppressively long dull and wearisome Every trail branching toward Granite Mountain had to be checked off my diagram for we had seen no sign board True the heavens lent a little cheer with their sparkling lights but the temperature fell from far above the one hundred degree mark to seventy degrees by eight o clock and to forty eight degrees before we pitched camp We had passed three trails not on the diagram and I began nervously to speculate whether the sign board had been taken by some overland voyager for fuel and we had passed the trail to Fedora Spring The clock pointed to one A few moments later a well beaten trail curved southward toward the towering pyramid of rock I called a halt to reason with my man on the advisability of following it We ll chance it I said and we trailed toward the mountain Narrower rockier and steeper grew the trail for two miles before I discerned the sloping sides of the canyon we were in when I ordered camp The donkeys were securely picketed to the roots of giant sage with our longest ropes to enable them to find sleeping places among the rocks I knew they must be very thirsty and would try to break away in search of water Then we made our bed in the trail and with lantern went to find the spring but we searched in vain and returned to our camp fire discouraged Evidently we had taken a wood trail into a dry canyon Only half a two quart canteen of water was left us We ate a cold lunch and drank sparingly after which I took charge of the canteen for the night Coonskin remonstrated at once saying he was thirsty I said I was too and that when I should drink he could but not otherwise We were in desperate circumstances and I must exercise my authority So we crawled into our blankets on the hard and narrow trail under the glittering canopy of heaven and were soon asleep But before lying down with a realizing sense that we were lost and without the water to keep us alive half the distance either to Skull Valley or to Redding Springs I knelt in fervent prayer to God to guide us out of that awful wilderness to water in time to save us from the death that seemed to be in store for us on the morrow The beaming planets also voyagers on a limitless sea of mystery and doubt looked down cold and unsympathetic Coonskin was first asleep when I was sure by his breathing I quietly rose and gave my faithful dog a few drops of water in the wash basin He was grateful indeed and tried to be content he seemed to realize the situation and licking my cheek lay down close to my side The sun shone over the walls of the canyon and awoke us frightfully late We stretched and yawned Now I thought if I had only taken Mac s suggestion to lay in a store of carrots and turnips the water in the vegetables would have sufficed in emergency and the donkeys had feed As my hopeful outfit tramped and slipped and tumbled down to the shining plain I almost felt I could see my finish on that sun scorched lime hued gridiron which faded away into a gaseous nothingness in three directions When we came to the main desert trail I halted my caravan to debate with my despondent valet as to what would be the wisest move Should we go east or west Flip a penny said Coonskin Heads west tails east and he at once threw the coin whirling in the air and caught it tails up West we have been traveling and west we shall continue to go I said positively and gave the command to move on adding If we fail to discover the sign board after passing beyond the mountain then we ll come back and search to the east We had proceeded a mile and a half when Coonskin went crazy or had a fit and I emptied the canteen in his mouth This revived him He had partially undressed and was trying his best to frighten me and the dog The sun beat down furiously the sky wasn t the only thing that looked blue I raised the canteen to my lips and drained it of the last and only drop My tongue hung out swollen and my palate and throat burned Another half mile and I should have despaired when suddenly a small white board nailed to a short stake loomed up ahead of us I knew intuitively it marked the branch trail to the coveted spring No two happier mortals ever lived than Coonskin and I We threw our hats in the air we shouted and hurrahed and sang and turned handsprings and somersaults on the white dusty floor of the desert An hour later my little caravan had climbed the canyon to its fountain and there we men fell on our stomachs with my dog under the heels of the five donkeys which crowded about the cool delicious waters and drank until seized by the collar and dragged away from the spring by a man and boy Near by stood prairie schooners and some yards beyond were their horses nibbling on the tops of sage brush The party was bound east and did us a kindness by preventing our drinking to excess in our condition The man was kind enough to caution me before departing to mark well the sky and the wind for should we be caught in a rain in that dreaded Red Desert whose soil is so tenacious we would pass in our chips without doubt At one o clock we struck out The afternoon s march was just as tedious and uncomfortably hot and thirst provoking as that of the previous day But with the exception of a fright we received late in the day when a few drops of rain fell from a passing cloud there was nothing to mar the serenity of the journey to Redding Springs The long traveled trail was worn to a depth of twenty inches and more for many miles We men especially I had to sit our animals Turkish fashion to avoid being drawn out of the saddles by our dragging feet The march after sunset to two in the morning was the most wearisome Finally when we were still three or four miles to Redding I heard a dog bark ahead in the darkness and thought we were almost there Yet we traveled an hour and a half before the buildings of the ranch loomed in the darkness Soon we had supped and were wrapped in slumber Redding Springs is a great oasis in the Salt Lake Desert Three springs varying from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in diameter overflow the reeded banks and irrigate a wide area of what otherwise might be an arid spot An Italian owns this cattle ranch and grows most of the necessities of life he seemingly is content though far removed from the cheerful and busy world He believed that two of the springs were bottomless and had some subterranean outlet A steer once attempted to swim across one pond and was drawn under by the suction and never seen again To prove the Italian s theory these two ponds or springs contained fish whose blindness indicates they must have lived in underground channels where eyesight was not required soon losing their optics altogether Mac A Rony observed when I had related to him the dago s story that in all probability the steer had undertaken an underground voyage to join a herd of sea cows in the Pacific Our much needed day of rest was a delightful one It was a twenty eight mile journey to Deep Creek My outfit was in readiness to start at seven a m next day The nine miles across the sage covered plain to the mountains was accomplished in a little over three hours then my animals began slowly to climb the ascent over a rough but well beaten trail By carrying out the directions given me by the Italian at ten that night my fatigued caravan was straggling along the western slope of the broad shouldered Deep Creek range The sky was clouded the air heavy with mist a shower was imminent I strained my eyes to ferret out a habitation of some sort from among the distant and faintly twinkling lights but when I had selected one for our objective point and gone a hundred yards or so it suddenly went out and I had to single out another one Again we were disappointed Evidently it was the bed time hour soon all the lights would be extinguished Presently rain began to fall I took it as a timely warning and ordered camp We pitched our tent in the trail the only place in which we could spread our bed and crawled under cover just as the rain poured down with a vengeance We had not more than closed our eyes than Don uttered a growl of warning and I heard the sound of galloping hoofs approaching I sat up Then I heard the trampling of sage to one side of the trail and looking out saw a man on horseback Hello there Who be you Travelin er goin somewhere called a voice I liked the tone the words were genial even cheery When I answered he gave us an urgent invitation to pack up and go on with him to his cabin a half mile distant as his guests until the storm abated I thought you were drunken Injuns at first said he Not common for white men to camp in the trail My horse was so frightened he nearly spilt me shying into the chaparral I laughed good naturedly and promised to arrive at his house in time for breakfast explaining that it would not be worth our while to dress and pack in the rain since we were perfectly comfortable Soon a hush fell upon the scene and the beating rain on the canvas lulled us sweetly to sleep When we arose in the morning everything was dripping and a furious gale blowing The rain appeared to be over but no sooner had we packed up than down again it came We hustled our animals up the muddy incline and soon rode into the door yard of the only cabin on the trail and commenced unpacking Soon our midnight acquaintance Murray and his chum an old man who went by the cognomen of Uncle Tom came out and welcomed us both our hosts were effusive in their hospitality One stabled and fed the donkeys and the other ushered us into the cabin where we were provided with dry raiment and a hot breakfast The fire in the stove roared in triumph and scorn at the scudding rain and wind without while I smiled in gratitude The men brought us books and tobacco and couldn t do enough for us The storm soon assumed the character of a hurricane and I tried to fancy my little party struggling in the throes of those merciless elements to make headway across the valley and up the western mesa The gale waged all day and night but on the following morning the sky was clear and the wind had died considerably It was a relief to get out of the stuffy house into the free and open air I took the axe and exercised myself with chopping wood for an hour which display of energy greatly pleased Uncle Tom who I assumed provided the fuel for the camp Murray was to start at eight on a round up so I resumed my pilgrimage at the same time Before good byes were said he presented me with a fine hair rope braided with his own hands as a souvenir of the happy occasion The place to find large hearts is out on the western plains Nine o clock saw us trampling sage in a short cut down the slope toward a small group of log houses designated as Deep Creek The frontier store was kept by an Irishman but bossed by his wife who tried to impress me with her importance Adjoining it stood another old shack and projecting from its front eves was a small signboard on which was the following startling announcement first class dentestry All kinds dun cheap Horses a specilty Wimen prefured TERMS CASH or credit I was amused at the novelty of this dentist s shingle so was Mac A Rony Poor Damfino he ejaculated presently as I rubbed his nose Can t you help her out of her suffering The poor girl has had a toothache for two days Most assuredly I will I said Why didn t you inform me before And forthwith I ferreted out the frontier tooth doctor He resurrected from his prolonged lethargy hunted up a dust covered tool chest and followed me impetuously to his asinine patient CHAPTER XLIX BY MAC A RONY Of all tales tis the saddest and more sad Because it makes us smile Byron Contrary to the old saw Misery loves company Damfino wished to be alone She said she wanted to cry but couldn t She had the sympathy of us all Only those who have suffered can appreciate the sufferings of others I never shall forget my profanity and the pain that prompted it when the too considerate Prof consented to my electric bath And now with the same kind motives oozing out of his face he introduced the sage brush dentist to Damfino doctor Arrowroot dropped his toolchest and seizing his patient by the upper jaw with his left hand and by the lower jaw with his right said Open up madam and proceeded to examine her molars Locate the claim Doc an on looker asked facetiously The doctor said he did but no sooner began to dig than he was ejected Then the tooth doctor called for volunteers to assist him every man not valuing his life responded Two Mexicans held the remote end of a long pole and pried Damfino s jaws apart while several Indians and halfbreeds braced against her sides to prevent her from kicking and falling At length Doc fastened his forceps on the ulcerated tooth and grinding his teeth and wrinkling his face yanked with all his might He might just as well have tried to pull a tree out of the ground He rested a few moments then sent for some hay wire and a lariat and after wiring the lariat to the tooth tied it to Damfino s hind feet We other donks were holding our sides I thought I would bust Then when the patient was unbound that cantankerous donkey s four legs were roped together to prevent further excavations in the local cemetery there was performed the neatest cleverest most thoroughly successful piece of dental surgery that I ever heard of That moaning Old maid just kicked the tooth clean out of her jaw And s help me Balaam the root of all that evil was three inches long Poor Damfino was the last to realize that the trick had been accomplished and kept on kicking till she threw off the lariat and slung the molar half way through the side of the store When Pod showed her the tooth she brayed for the loss of it and as evidence of her ingratitude the shrew turned to me and whispered Mac since I pulled my own tooth how can that brutal dentist have the nerve to ask pay for it He got the nerve from your tooth like as not I said You once told me that the Bible says An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and in a jiffy Damfino made for that innocent fleet footed tooth doctor before Pod could have time to settle with him Before long I was leading the troop up the sage covered mesa in step with Damfino s mutterings When we arrived at Billy Jones ranch Billy was leaning on the picket fence in front of his back door His house was once turned around hind side foremost by a cyclone He was munching pinenuts and did not budge at first taking us for prospectors When Pod introduced himself Billy almost fell to pieces with surprise Soon missus Jones came out and Pod was almost persuaded to remain over night But we did not tarry It was dark and misty rain threatened to descend any moment When darkness settled it was as black as Egypt and almost impossible for me to follow the trail After a while a light could be seen through the mist Pod said it must be the Tibbits ranchhouse where he proposed to camp Suddenly wwhile chuckling over a joke we donks walked slam bang against a barbed wire fence throwing the men into a rage Then I leading the way we followed the fence turned a corner round a barn and finally anchored at the back door of the house Pod found the doorknob and made the ranchman s acquaintance while Coonskin pitched the tent unpacked and picketed us donks then both men gathered fire wood with which to cook mister T when once assured that Pod was neither beggar nor tramp authorized us animals to be fed grain and hay but his wife said it was too late to prepare supper for the men This did not disturb Pod for he soon had one prepared My that ranchman was close fisted Pod even had to pay for his kindling wood before starting the fire The old man was a plain looking ruddy faced Englishman as snobbish as he was penurious but after a time he condescended to join the five in a post prandial smoke And not until it was pounded into his thick cranium that his strange guests were traveling like princes did he affect to be hospitable Long before dawn our donkey matin song awoke the natives as well as our masters and Pod issued from the tent half awake hardly in presentable condition to face Madam T who was splitting wood while the old man looked on He now insisted on his guests taking breakfast with him and afterwards charged for the bacon eggs coffee and bread double the sum charged by other ranchmen previously The bill for hay grain and firewood was also presented and paid by the amused Prof Coonskin was rash enough to hint to mister T that by some oversight no charge had been made for water for our party drank lots but the Briton said no he d be generous He accompanied us horseback four miles nearly to the base of the mountain where we turned to cross the pass and on the way acquaint us with the superior advantages of country life in England as compared with the disadvantages in America and admitted that while a squatter in the West he had for twenty five years declined to be naturalized The climb over the Antelope Mountains was slow and laborious Across the flat valley beyond mottled with sage and greasewood alkali and sand spots rose the summits of the Kern Mountains We trailed through straggly groves of dwarf pines laden with cones full of tiny nuts some of which the men gathered and munched unroasted Coonskin said they were a dandy invention just the thing to break the monotony of talk for they kept the jaws at work just the same and they were so hard to gather and shuck that a fellow couldn t eat too many to crowd the stomach The valley was about ten miles broad we crossed it and camped at the base of another range of mountains near the V sheep ranch The boss was away but his genial wife and son were holding down the claim They visited camp after supper listened to the Professor s marvelous tales and next morning the good woman sent her son horseback to lead us beyond the point of conflicting trails to the entrance to the pass to Schelbourne As the lad rode off we donks joined in that pathetic hymn One more mountain to cross just as a sort of parting serenade The trail was smooth but in some places almost obliterated it was the old pony express trail of ante railroad days Sometimes it was steep and we donks puffed like engines There were the charred stumps of the telegraph poles that the Injuns burned to annoy Uncle Sam and occasional ruins of stone or adobe cabins or saloons relics of those hot times of savages and fire water Every time I saw one of them I felt dry By eleven a m we had crossed the summit and were resting near the great stone barn of Schelbourne It is built strong with sheet iron doors and shutters and high enough to admit a stage coach and four When the Injuns used to get out for a little holiday sport the stage freighted with passengers mail and express used to drive in at a two forty gait and I ve heard tell how the iron doors would shut and give the coach a friendly boost in the nick of time to receive on their armor a hail of leaden bullets or a shower of poisoned arrows On reaching the plain I heard my master tell his valet we would spend that night at Green s ranch I was glad for I was hungry the savory smell of the nuts the men chewed was tantalizing Midway the plain we were stopped to enable Pod to empty a sackful of cones which Cheese had threshed by his wibble wobble motion and to refill their pockets with nuts At length we arrived at Green s a half hour after dark Here we donks were fed and watered then Coonskin proceeded to get camp ready for the night while Pod made a fashionable call on missus Green And well he will tell you what happened Illustration Coonskin and I took shelter behind our donkeys CHAPTER L BY PYE POD Here brother Sancho we may dip our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures But take note though thou seest me in the greatest danger on earth thou must not set thy hand to thy sword to defend me unless thou shouldst perceive that they who assail me are rabble and low people in which case thou canst come to my aid Don Quixote It was early evening October five at Green s ranch The somber quiet of the place seemed to indicate a deserted estate but a dim light in the window invited me to knock At once I heard feet shuffle across the floor and a bolt slide in the door Who be you called a woman distinctly I introduced myself through the key hole and was admitted missus Green extended me a left handed greeting while holding a sixshooter in her right hand It was a most interesting reception What are you going to do with that I inquired smiling The idea that a frontier woman should be so easily frightened seemed ridiculous Haven t you heard she returned Why the whole country is up in arms looking for two desperate outlaws They shot a sheep herder last night in Telegraph Canyon and after robbing the fellow of four dollars left him for dead mister Green went to Egan Canyon this afternoon for the mail and hasn t returned He ought to be back by now It is only three miles away Here the somewhat perturbed woman glanced at the clock which indicated eight zero I conversed with missus Green a few moments and she invited us men to supper and told me to feed my animals from the hay stack 
8388_278289_000000_000001	train-clean-360	I said we were well provided with food and fire arms that she might feel quite safe from the brigands 
8388_278289_000000_000002	train-clean-360	Now Coonskin called for me and said our evening meal was under way 
8388_278289_000000_000003	train-clean-360	So I bade missus Green a good night 
none	none	Coonskin whose chief literary diet had been dime novels listened to the news with rapt attention and suggested that I cook while he prepared camp for a sudden attack Gee 
8388_278289_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Wouldn t I like to capture em though he said enthusiastically 
none	none	I would like to see you try it I returned you have been spoiling for a scrap with an Indian or a desperado or some wild beast ever since we crossed the borders and I shouldn t wonder if this were your opportunity 
8388_278289_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Something tells me that we ll meet these outlaws 
8388_278289_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Supper over and dishes washed we retired 
8388_278289_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Our bed only separated from the earth by a single canvas never was more comfortable 
none	none	The night was cool and a gentle breeze was blowing but there was no sound save the braying of the donks 
8388_278289_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Suddenly I heard Don who was on guard growl then a sound of wheels and a horse s whinny 
8388_278289_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Will your dog bite mister Pod called mister Green 
8388_278289_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I rushed out barefoot and dispelled his fears and after shaking hands questioned him how he knew who I was 
8388_278289_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh he chuckled anybody would know you by your outfit besides everybody along the trail has been expecting you even two desperadoes 
8388_278289_000008_000000	train-clean-360	This was interesting 
8388_278289_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But I explained that his wife had told me all whereupon he invited us men to breakfast and was escorted by Don to a point which he considered the limit of his master s domain 
none	none	While at breakfast I learned that the Salt Lake newspapers containing illustrated accounts of my prosperity had subscribers all along the trail that the shooting at Telegraph Canyon was the first in that section for sixteen years that no pay boxes were expected at the Egan mill where a half dozen men were working and that what was of more importance than the rest it was the prevailing opinion that Pye Pod was the man the outlaws were laying for
8388_278289_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Griswold is the unfortunate man s name said Green 
8388_278289_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 The outlaws pretended to be friendly lunched with him and started off on their horses 
none	none	But Griswold had no sooner turned his back than the strangers ordered him to throw up his hands They took all his funds shot him and galloped away with his good horses leaving their jaded ones 
8388_278289_000010_000004	train-clean-360	The poor fellow regained consciousness and managed by morning to crawl six miles to a ranch 
8388_278289_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Resolute men hurriedly saddled their horses and soon thirty were after the outlaws 
8388_278289_000010_000006	train-clean-360	I hear Griswold is with them he having recovered 
8388_278289_000010_000007	train-clean-360	But they say at Egan that some of the boys this afternoon gave up the chase because it was getting too warm for them they felt pretty near the game 
8388_278289_000011_000000	train-clean-360	mister Green gave me a second handed description of the desperadoes and their outfit and directing me on my route wished us Godspeed 
none	none	I felt that my route forced me to overtake rather than to meet by chance two men who set but little value on other men s lives and even less on their own therefore having everything to gain and nothing to lose they put up the best kind of a fight 
8388_278289_000013_000000	train-clean-360	We soon arrived at Egan where we were kindly received 
8388_278289_000013_000001	train-clean-360	The men showed us about the works allowing me to take photographs and gave me a more accurate description of the outlaws and the long trail of a hundred miles to Eureka 
8388_278289_000013_000002	train-clean-360	At three points only should we find water at Nine Mile Spring Thirty Mile and Pinto Creek the latter being seventy miles away 
8388_278289_000013_000003	train-clean-360	No habitation would we see only an occasional coyote or a band of wild horses or possibly some prairie schooner or the outlaws or some of the posses 
8388_278289_000014_000000	train-clean-360	By trailing through Egan Canyon we cut the backbone of the mountain range and now at an altitude of several hundred feet above the plain were climbing higher and higher the rugged plateau until we reached Nine Mile and unpacked 
8388_278289_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The spring was in a grassy spot and Coonskin first replenished our canteens then released the donkeys 
none	none	It was noon 
8388_278289_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Accustomed as we were to travel on two meals a day I could set no regular hour for them 
8388_278289_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It was twenty one miles to Thirty Mile Spring 
8388_278289_000015_000003	train-clean-360	So we cooked here 
8388_278289_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The desperadoes formed the chief topic of discussion even Don showed the bloodhound in him and ever since leaving Egan showed unusual excitement and was more vigilant 
none	none	We must have crossed the tracks of the outlaws or were following them unwittingly Taking everything into consideration we were in a fair mood to be startled when the dog sprang to his feet and growled Then three men heavily armed galloped up and dismounted 
8388_278289_000016_000004	train-clean-360	I was relieved when I saw one of the riders wearing a bandage round his head it must be Griswold 
8388_278289_000017_000000	train-clean-360	The strangers left their steeds standing each tying a rein to a stirrup then introduced themselves 
none	none	We had just finished lunch and were smoking when the posse arrived but now Coonskin cooked for our friends while I did all the honors and gleaned all the information essential to our interests 
8388_278289_000017_000002	train-clean-360	They were affable fellows and resolute but had set out hardly equipped for the chase 
8388_278289_000017_000003	train-clean-360	One picked up a two quart canteen saying good naturedly that he reckoned he would have to rustle it 
8388_278289_000017_000004	train-clean-360	I said they were welcome to anything I could spare 
8388_278289_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Before separating on our several missions Coonskin photographed the party and Griswold repeated his description of the outlaws Couriers had been dispatched to Ely Hamilton Eureka and other points these men were bound for Hunter seven miles over the mesa 
none	none	Before leaving they asked me if I would blaze a sage brush fire that night should I reach Thirty Mile and discover any evidence of the bandits 
8388_278289_000018_000002	train-clean-360	They also admonished me to hold up and shoot without considering an instant any two mounted men of the description given else we two would never live to tell how it happened 
8388_278289_000019_000000	train-clean-360	With this parting injunction unofficial though it was the riders loped away and my nervous troop at half past two hit the trail in lively form 
8388_278289_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I was glad the country was clear and open Only an occasional dwarf cedar stood in dark relief against the sage 
none	none	About midnight the grade began perceptibly to grow steeper and in consequence of the clouds which had gathered the darkness was dense 
8388_278289_000019_000003	train-clean-360	I felt we must be near to Thirty Mile 
8388_278289_000019_000004	train-clean-360	The idea of passing the spring and having to trace our steps next morning was not to be entertained 
none	none	Seeing a bunch of cedars some distance to the right I headed for them 
8388_278289_000019_000006	train-clean-360	And there we camped 
none	none	Behind the screen of three small trees and the darkness we spread our blankets lunched on bread and cold meat and went to sleep The donkeys were picketed still another hundred yards back so as not to be seen from the trail we did not light a fire 
8388_278289_000020_000000	train-clean-360	By ten o clock next morning we had breakfasted and were trailing toward the summit of the plateau 
none	none	Three miles further on was Thirty Mile Here again I unpacked the animals for an hour s grazing on the grass by the spring 
8388_278289_000021_000000	train-clean-360	The noon hour found us weary travelers reclining on a heap of blankets 
8388_278289_000021_000001	train-clean-360	To the east some fifty feet away stood a tub obscured by pussy willows and brimming with cool water furnished by a cedar trough which reached from the bubbling spring 
none	none	The overflow streamed down a tiny gorge in the hard soil under cover of the willows and finally sank in the earth
8388_278289_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid the fellows ain t going to bother us after all said Coonskin disappointedly at length 
none	none	I d give a farm to get a whack at them He had no sooner uttered the words than he turned pale and I turned to behold two small moving dots on the horizon some two miles down the trail
8388_278289_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 Jove he added I believe the outlaws are coming 
none	none	Indeed I could make out two men mounted on a dark and a light colored horse respectively slowly approaching 
8388_278289_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Assigning to my valet the shot gun and the Smith Wesson double action revolver I loaded two extra shells with buckshot tested the locks of my Winchester and single action Colt revolver gave Coonskin explicit instructions and awaited events 
none	none	When the strange riders rode to within a half mile of us they stopped and dismounted 
8388_278289_000025_000001	train-clean-360	It was plain they were cinching their saddles probably preparing to do some rough riding 
8388_278289_000025_000002	train-clean-360	The dark horse appeared to be somewhat darker than the one described by Griswold but I was cautioned that they might exchange a horse for one on the range in order to mislead their pursuers 
none	none	They and their outfit in all other respects tallied with the description given to me My companion in arms who of late had evinced such courage now showed signs of weakening He protested that it would be better not to attempt to hold up the fellows until we were sure we were right and when I said that I proposed to get the drop on them the first opportunity offered and to shoot if necessary and should count on him to aid me he was speechless 
8388_278289_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Don seemed to understand and stationing himself some ten feet before us watched the strangers eagerly 
none	none	I assured Coonskin that if our dog allowed those horsemen to enter camp we could rest easy but if when I hailed them Don uttered a protest we could mark them as the outlaws
8388_278289_000026_000004	train-clean-360	 Don t let them corral us I cautioned if they get us between them the game is up 
8388_278289_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Those were anxious moments for me as well as for the young man who was ten years my junior 
8388_278289_000027_000001	train-clean-360	I was seated on our packs my Winchester lying across my knees cocked Coonskin sat on the ground at my right with shot gun in hand 
8388_278289_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Our revolvers were in our belts 
8388_278289_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Our bearded and sun burned faces long hair and generally rough attire added to our unfriendly attitude must have puzzled the approaching horsemen 
8388_278289_000027_000004	train-clean-360	When they had come to a hundred feet from us I called roughly Helloa boys come in You re just in time for grub 
8388_278289_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Instantly Don leaped to his feet and with tail straight out and body trembling from rage he uttered a savage growl of defiance 
8388_278289_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He identified the desperadoes 
8388_278289_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Instantly reining their steeds one of them slung some simple questions at me designed no doubt to throw us off guard 
8388_278289_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Purty nice lot of burros you ve got he began 
8388_278289_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Pretty fair I replied disinterestedly 
8388_278289_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Which way you traveling 
none	none	West Where re you bound I inquired
8388_278289_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Just lookin round 
8388_278289_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Which is the trail to Hamilton 
8388_278289_000035_000000	train-clean-360	I did not answer 
none	none	Then the man asked How far is it I don t know and I don t care a d I answered coarsely with bravado as if I considered it wasting time to talk The smiling outlaw now looked grave and turning to his comrade asked loud enough for me to hear Shall we go in and cook
8388_278289_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 No better water our horses and go on said the partner 
none	none	Then quite as I anticipated while the more slender man rode direct to the tub of water to the right of us the other guided his horse to our left to hem Coonskin and me in between them 
8388_278289_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Instantly I rose to my feet and trailing the rifle over my wrist strode eyeing him defiantly in a line at a right angle with the course of his horse but the rogue did not go far before turning his steed in the direction of the tub 
8388_278289_000040_000001	train-clean-360	There both men dismounted behind their steeds took off the bridles with spade bits that their horses might drink and regarded us tenderfeet with some respect and concern 
none	none	They handled their bridles with their left hands which left their right hands free to use the revolvers I had seen in their belts in view of which fact Coonskin and I took shelter behind our donkeys three of which were lying down after rolling and aggressive as well as defensive awaited our opportunity Illustration Through Devil s Gate their panniers scraped the walls Illustration Fired their revolvers in the air Presently the spokesman of this bandit party inquired Say fellows have you seen three armed men mounted looking for two fellows riding a grey horse bare foot and a sorrel with a bald face they claimed shot a man in Telegraph Canyon
8388_278289_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Not exactly I said with a faint smile 
none	none	Don t think I ever saw THREE armed men I waited a few seconds for my levity to produce the desired effect then added There were three determined looking fellows armed with double barreled shot guns who stopped here They were man hunting
8388_278289_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 That so queried the outlaw quite excitably 
8388_278289_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 How long ago were they here 
none	none	Where d they go
8388_278289_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh just a little while ago 
8388_278289_000046_000001	train-clean-360	They took in a few cans of water I here pointed in their direction and said They were going to cook over there behind that knoll 
8388_278289_000047_000000	train-clean-360	At once as I hoped they would the desperadoes were thrown off their guard and looked behind them 
none	none	And as they did so I raised my rifle and whispered to Coonskin to pull on them But Sancho never budged his courage had left him 
8388_278289_000047_000003	train-clean-360	The outlaws turned their eyes upon us so quickly I think they must have overheard my whispered command 
none	none	They hastily bridled mounted and rode southwesterly in the direction we were bound while turning in their saddles and watching us until they were beyond range of our guns 
8388_278289_000048_000000	train-clean-360	I was in the mood to jump Coonskin for not aiding me to hold up the outlaws 
none	none	Our one great opportunity to distinguish ourselves on the journey was lost Think of the receptions we would have had if we had captured and disarmed those desperadoes and marched them handcuffed into Ely the county seat 
8388_278289_000048_000003	train-clean-360	And think of the handsome reward I said 
8388_278289_000049_000000	train-clean-360	The thought of a forfeited reward seemed to stagger the boy 
none	none	I concluded my lecture with the emphasized mandate that henceforth I must not detect any unusual display of courage or prowess on his part unless it should be solicited by me and furthermore I did not wish to hear any expressions of desire to attack anything more formidable than a jack rabbit Our donkeys were soon packed for a twenty mile evening tramp toward Pinto Creek 
8388_278289_000050_000001	train-clean-360	I pinned a penciled message on paper to the tub before departing for the benefit of the posse and my caravan was on the move again 
8388_278289_000050_000002	train-clean-360	About midnight we made a dry camp at a discreet distance from the trail where without building a fire we made a cold lunch serve for our second meal that day and retired 
none	none	Next morning early we resumed the journey 
8388_278289_000051_000001	train-clean-360	By two o clock we had crossed the Long Valley Mountains and were on the margin of a sage covered plain still probably twenty miles to Pinto 
8388_278289_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Several times we were puzzled by forking trails and were in doubt whether we were on the right one to Eureka 
8388_278289_000052_000000	train-clean-360	I judged the valley to be ten miles wide 
none	none	On we rode the plucky animals swinging slowly along in that awkward yet amusing hip movement characteristic of the burro until I distinguished across the plain what looked to be a house 
8388_278289_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I decided to head for it 
none	none	We arrived there at five o clock to find the place temporarily deserted to discover a fine spring and plenty of hay Here we cooked our evening meal and were enjoying a smoke when two men rode up with an air of conscious proprietorship 
8388_278289_000052_000004	train-clean-360	They were mister Robinson proprietor of Newark Mines and his superintendent 
8388_278289_000052_000005	train-clean-360	Both were very hospitable 
none	none	mister Robinson invited me to help myself to anything I or my party needed regretted that we had not waited to dine with him and asked us to spend the evening at his house and breakfast with him When I told them the story of our experience with the outlaws they were greatly interested and it called forth many tales of adventure from both those frontiersmen We were treated to a heaping plate of delicious apples and it was a late hour before we sought our tents It was a relief to feel myself well beyond the outlaws domain Next day my good host directed his superintendent to guide us over Chihuahua Pass which would save us a fifteen mile journey around the extremity of the mountain by way of Pinto The climb over the pass was rich with beautiful views After rising several hundred feet and looking back the vista between the summits and the plains glistening in the sun was superb The mines were a mile or two up the canyon and to this point my kind host accompanied us after which his man on horseback led us over the roughest and most puzzling part of the trail So narrow was the passage through Devil s Gate that two animals could not walk abreast and their panniers often scraped the rough walls of the winding and rocky gate way Having once gained the summit a great oval of bench land spotted with buffalo grass we rested and grazed the donkeys while we lunched then we shook hands with the good hearted guide and trailed down the long pine covered slope to Eureka CHAPTER LI BY MAC A RONY I will feed you to bursting The Fair God Eureka is a good old mining town that saw its finish when Congress demonetized silver As have some clouds it has a silver lining the earth beneath and the surrounding hills are rich or rather poor in the white metal A few of the mines were still operating and any one could see ten horse teams drawing ore done up in bags like grain to fool any mule or donk The night we hungry donkeys arrived in town we followed a wagon filled with bags of ore a quarter of a mile out of our course before Prof discovered the mistake I observed that the populace didn t take much interest in what I had to say so I didn t say much but I thought lots and stored away plenty of grain and hay to say nothing of water The amount I drank would make a camel envious But I wasn t satisfied I hadn t tasted fruit for a long time So I got out of the corral strolled to a grocery store and helped myself to dried apples I was about to nab a bacon when I was driven away to a watering trough by a kind boy who knew a thing or two and then led to the corral I remembered having eaten less than two quarts of apples but before ten minutes were gone I easily believed I had eaten ten bushel To look at me you would have sworn I had swallowed a barrelful barrel and all Most of the day I spent rolling round the corral in pain For the first time in my life I knew what it was to be really tight The kind boy stood innocently by and a companion of his dared him to go up first Up where asked the kind boy Up in the balloon yo big idiot said the other Jest got ter tie a basket to his tail and git in and hang on Fillin fast he ll rise purty soon That mockery was more than I could stand while lying down so I rolled on to my feet and made both boys scarce And if a horse doctor hadn t stabbed me the kind boy would have needed a balloon to save himself That evening saw me well again but my cravings took a different turn I had a taste for a newspaper Finally a man threw one to me Among its contents I ran across the following squib and smiled MAC TEMPTED AND DRIVEN OUT Some vixen let out one of Pye Pod s burros it happened to be his pet jack then drove him to Pete Dago s open air lunch counter where the ass helped himself to that diet which would go farthest yet take up the least room dried apples It s a sad story but the worst is over and save a small doctor s bill and a grocer s bill and a five dollar bill and the small boy Bill who has been placed in the coop for the night no other bill figures in the case The distinguished party leave in the morning also the nigh extinguished party meaning me Adam was the first ass to be tempted to eat of forbidden fruit but not the last Adam blamed Eve Mac blames a kind boy Adam deserved some commiseration for having perhaps sampled apples too green for we know what it is to be a boy but no compassion can be tendered the narrow gage mule that is such an ass as to pack away a hundred pounds of evaporated apples gulp down a cistern and expect to fly During his sojourn Pod wrote his weekly letter discussed the desperadoes with the sheriff photographed some crippled dried up Piute Indians and doctored the sick dog for Don had on the trail imbibed too freely of alkali water We left town the morning of October eleventh and arrived at the Willows about midnight after a long forced march through a wilderness There Pod pitched camp Neighing broncos disturbed my dreams and daylight revealed a bunch of cowboys on a round up also a bale of hay which set us all braying so loudly that we awoke the men in time to start for Austin before the sun got scorching hot The cowboys were a jolly lot They gave an exhibition of rough riding which nearly frightened Damfino into epileptics and Don into hydrophobia Then the whole lot of em fired their revolvers in the air and skooted through the sage yelling like mad Our next stop was the Blackbird ranch twenty five miles further on whose hospitable proprietor showed greater interest in the novel tent than in anything else Coonskin took it down with one hand pitched it with two feet and while the wondering spectators pulled their whiskers bound up the canvas and tied the rope with his teeth The seventy five mile journey from Eureka to Austin was accomplished in three days There the Professor lectured to an immense audience Austin is another mining town that had seen more prosperous times its people like those of Eureka were cordial and generous When Pod and I led the troop out of town he was considerably enriched in pocket and mind Twelve mile ranch is twelve miles from the town Same I suppose as October thirteenth is the thirteenth of the month Here was a large stock ranch and the thrifty proprietor did his best to persuade my stubborn master to remain over night at least until the threatening storm had passed He would not tarry but hustled us on in a drizzling rain By nightfall we began to climb a canyon winding over the Shoshone Mountains I think and about midnight reached the summit in a blinding snow squall The wind blew at half a hurricane gait and the men were mad because they couldn t light a match to look at the compass and get their bearings and Damfino laid down on the dog that had lain under the donkey to get out of the ice shod wind and the men wasted twenty minutes searching for the right trail You see my biped friends that another range of mountains met the Shoshones at right angles at this point and it was dollars to nutmegs that the men would miss the trail in the dark which happened as the result two hours later our outfit slid into camp for the rest of the night some two half miles from the plain Breakfast was served at ten Menu sage brush for five We were on the north side and the wrong side of the range plain enough Pod said it was Coonskin s fault Coonskin claimed the Prof was to blame and the dispute would have ended in the blessings of the pipe of peace if Coxey and Cheese had not chewed up the only bag of tobacco while the men were feeding We were now in what was I believe the Sinkarata Valley It stretched many miles to the north and appeared to be twenty miles wide at the narrowest point No sign of habitation could we see All day long we trailed through that desolation parallel with the range until we came to a cross trail leading to the mountains Here the men examined the compass and headed for the hills It was sundown ere we began the ascent and ten o clock when we went into camp half way to the summit The air was chill and we thirsty animals were left unguarded while the men built a fire I smelt snow on the mountain peak so did my comrades My instinct told me that in a moment more we all would be picketed for the night Our mouths were parched but the men had only enough water in their canteens for themselves Self preservation is the first law of nature I reflected and to think was to act I whispered to Damfino she passed the word to Coxey and all five of us desperate donks stole away unnoticed in the darkness and followed our noses as fast as our weary legs could take us in the direction of the peak The air was so rarified I could hear the least sound and the slow kindling fire flamed more plainly instead of more dimly as we widened the breach of confidence between us and our masters Rather hard on the fellows for us to run off with their water observed Cheese stopping for breath Sure enough the men were left without supplies water or food Not a thing had been unpacked I loved the Professor for he had many times made sacrifices for me and the thought made me stop and look back The men were talking and gesticulating excitedly Presently one started up the trail and the other down and were soon lost to view They had set out on the wrong scent With some misgivings I hastened to catch up with my comrades CHAPTER LII BY PYE POD Then looking down at the great dog he cried with a kind of daft glee Up an waur them a Quharrie Up an waur them a man There s no a Dutchman i the pack That s ony guid ava man Hooch The Raiders Never before was I in such a desperate plight nor was I ever more frightened than now I knew not where but believed we were in the De Satoyta Mountains possibly on the trail to pass between Indian Peak and Mt Atry We had kindled a fire warmed our hands and were about to unpack when Coonskin exclaimed For God s sake Pod the donks are gone Often had I exercised the importance of Coonskin s picketing the beasts before leaving them but now was no time to scold I directed him to take matches and examine the ascending trail while I retraced our steps and did likewise Luckily our revolvers were in our belts and it was agreed that the first to discover traces of the deserters should shoot until hearing a shot in answer Don went with Coonskin The lighted lantern was left by the unreliable fire It was difficult in the wind to keep a match lighted long enough to be of value even when protecting it with my hat as I knelt on the hard trail or on the softer earth in the sage and strained my eyes to detect the shoe prints of my runaways Every few steps I stopped to listen for a signal shot and deplored our dire predicament without food or water I had about concluded that the only resort left us was an all night tramp over the pass perhaps to be followed by an all day hunt in the next valley for a habitation and spring when I heard the welcome signal from Coonskin Presently through the still air came the sound of Don s barking then I knew the fugitives were captured With a lighter heart I now gathered sage preparatory to cooking for we had traveled all day without a bite Our animals that night were securely roped both to the iron tent pins and the tent so that they could not slip away during the night without taking us with them When I opened my eyes next morning Mac stood with his head inside the tent door wistfully eyeing the canteen by my pillow My heart was touched but I thought Self preservation is the first law and knew that if turned loose all five donkeys would have the asinine instinct to find a spring in time to save themselves whereas a man might fall a hundred feet from a spring and die in ignorance of it One hour after sunrise the breakfast dishes had been cleaned with a rag in the absence of water and the donkeys were standing to be packed for the disheartening journey A heap of ashes smothered some fragile hot coals of sage which from all appearances were most inviting to any donkey to roll in While cinching the pack on Coxey I observed Mac to steal to the ash heap look at it wistfully a moment circle round it two or three times and kneeling down flop over on his side plumb in the middle of the warm gray ashes and still warmer coals It was his custom to roll over several times but he didn t do so this morning He didn t roll at all If he had fallen on a huge rubber ball he couldn t have bounded on to his feet with more alacrity When Mac once had his balance he shook himself vigorously and brayed then eyed the ash heap as if it were a nest of rattlesnakes The air smelled of singed hair The donkey reached around and licked his side a moment then he backed away When one donkey rolls and his fellows do not follow suit you can mark it as most significant Two hours later my caravan had crossed the summit and were marching down the western slope of the range Nevada is the home of the wild horse and now we saw bunches of these wary creatures grazing in the distance or running like deer for the hills at the sight of my outfit although five and more miles away It was two o clock when rounding a bend my searching eye discerned across the valley close to the base of the Augusta range a building or hay stack My heart leaped with joy Our canteens were empty but ere long we might slake our thirst at a ranch well and give our faithful animals a treat On we pressed until passing the stack we reached a trail leading into the canyon A few moments more and I saw a wreath of smoke ascending not far up the pass My intuition told me it was the Maestratti ranch And it was We received a hearty welcome Don poor thing was so weak from a prolonged siege of dysentery that he could scarcely creep to the house but while Coonskin and I unpacked and watered the donkeys my faithful dog was fed scalded bread and milk by our hostess who ordered a hearty meal for us men mister Maestratti invited us to a bed in his house but I declined it preferring my own blankets and now as I strode wearily to it I called affectionately to my dog Something told me I was going to lose him my devoted friend during three thousand miles and many months of travel I missed the loving pressure of his face against mine his warm tongue on the back of my hand his gay antics and playful bark when in his happier moods and anticipated the grief I should soon feel I paused at the tent door and whistled Don has stolen away to die said Coonskin feelingly That s just what dogs do Let s take the lantern and try and find him So saying the man lighted up and we began the search We found him He was lying beside a stalk of sage a hundred feet from camp uncomplaining weak and breathing irregularly The flare of the lantern aroused him and he turned his bloodshot eyes to mine as much as to say Leave me kind master I shall soon be out of misery Do not mourn Then I thought of his identification of the outlaws at Thirty Mile and of his attack on the cowboy in Nebraska who had playfully lassoed me at my request I remembered the chill nights in Iowa barns when he crept over and nestled against me in the hay that the heat from his great warm body might keep me comfortable I could not restrain my tears My best friend must not die in the brush alone We persuaded him to return with us and made him a comfortable bed in a corner of the tent patted his head and retired But soon the poor fellow stole out into the frosty night It was not the rising sun or a donkey s bray that awoke me but a woman calling Breakfast I intended first before answering the demands of my stomach to look at my dead friend s face but to my surprise and delight I saw the dog lying in the sun his head up and his tail wagging very much alive He had passed the crisis of his illness during the night I had hopes that he would soon be well A fortunate circumstance threw us in the company of a stranger journeying westward in a wagon Like everybody else he showed great interest in my travels and when he saw the condition of my dog he offered to convey him over the mountains We arrived at the summit of the pass by ten o clock There we rested an hour and fed our animals The journey down the western slope while apparently as trying to the donkeys as the ascent had been was more inviting to the convalescing dog and he on the way surprised us by leaping out of the wagon and making after a jackrabbit At two o clock Don s Good Samaritan drove away to the south and at four we arrived at the Donaldson Ranch Many courtesies were extended us here and we were half persuaded to remain over night with these hospitable people We cooked dinner early gave our animals a liberal mess of barley filled our canteens packed and departed at seven with the well wishes of all and a fifty pound bag of grain which was donated to Mac A Rony Darkness had set in Although cautioned about two diverging trails which we would reach before ascending the mountain before an hour had passed I realized we were going in the wrong direction The night was chill and pitch dark Quickly changing the saddle from Mac to my fleet footed Skates I rode back to the ranch No light shone through the windows of the house and I knew that every one had retired I could see no expedient left me other than to arouse somebody to set me straight Feeling my way to the house I shouted with all my might and soon awoke mister Donaldson junior who came good naturedly to my relief saddled a horse and insisted on guiding my party to the summit We did not arrive there until midnight The noonday saw me at Horse Creek and midnight at Sand Spring where we camped At dawn a sweeping glance from my tent door revealed the most desolate of surroundings To the west was a great barren desert while on every hand were massive sand dunes some of them towering a hundred feet A breeze had sprung up during the night After purchasing a peck of pine nuts from some Piute Indians who had camped close by for the night and were now starting out on the home trail I tied the door flaps as tightly as possible to keep out the drifting sand then went back to bed In spite of my precautions the sand forced an entrance coated our blankets an inch thick and scattered seeds of unkindness in our nostrils ears and hair When I awoke and saw the sides of the tent bended inward and half way up the walls an uneven horizon where through the canvas the sand and sunshine met I roused my companion and we dressed In a few moments more we might have been buried alive How we were to cook breakfast was a serious question On unfastening the door we were immediately blinded with sand and alkali dust and it was only with the greatest difficulty that I could find the ruins of the old restaurant of forty nine which at early dawn I had discovered only two hundred feet away The floor of this structure had long since gone to provide camp fires for many a traveler but I kicked off a piece of siding Then I tried to find the tent I groped and stumbled in the blinding storm and only by calling to Coonskin and keeping him constantly answering did I hold to my bearings and succeed in reaching camp Saturating a few sticks with coal oil I got them a blazing and then under cover of our water pail I ventured out of the tent and built a fire sufficient to boil coffee Our bread when buttered looked as if veneered with sand paper Coonskin gulping down a half cup of coffee echoed my sentiments when he remarked It takes plenty of grit to cross these plains How we ever packed and drove our half crazed animals out of that sandy hurricane is beyond my power to describe Blinded and choked with the sand themselves they could scarcely be made to walk to the well Having washed out their throats Skates was persuaded to move and the others followed reluctantly out of range of the warring elements As soon as we were clear of the sand belt we stopped and made our toilet All day long while crossing that broad desert my eyes smarted and swelled and they did not cease paining me until we reached the first habitation where I procured witch hazel Grimes ranch at seven o clock saw my whole party in better spirits I declined both the invitation to remain over night and to stop for supper mister Grimes telephoned to mister Len A n of Sinclair advising him that I was on my way there and expected to arrive by nine It was much after that time however when my outfit reached the ranch When still three miles away and a full hour s march we could see a lantern swinging and when we got within a half mile the sound of cheers and calls of welcome greeted our ears We answered the signals with our lantern and cheered so lustily that Mac A Rony paused to bray and led the donkey quintette in a heartrending chorus The day s thirty mile jaunt thus came to a happy end in marked contrast with its beginning A stalwart broad shouldered man with a smiling face half hidden by a beard streaked with gray lifted his sombrero as he grasped my hand and shook it heartily Welcome welcome my boy Now make yourself at home said Len A n Illustration Some Piute Indians who had camped close by Illustration Playing Solitaire on Damfino s broad back CHAPTER LIII BY MAC A RONY A torch for me let wantons light of heart Tickle the useless rushes with their heels For I am proverb d with a grandsire phrase I ll be a candle holder and look on Romeo and Juliet Old Len A n was a jolly old soul and a jolly old soul was he he leaped aboard in the middle of my back and hollared to me Git Haw Gee We donks had a great time at that little desert metropolis Len owned the place that is until Pod s outfit arrived then Mac A Rony owned it Pardon my seeming vanity When the nabob of Sinclair rode me to the corral the crowd cheered me three times three Hooray fer Mac A Rony Besides Len the sturdy pioneer of forty nine there were the foremen store keeper blacksmith bronco buster justice of the peace postmaster cowboys cooks and numerous wives and daughters and cousins and aunts all willing and anxious to make our party comfortable Pod was at once escorted to the house to entertain and be entertained by the ladies while Coonskin unpacked watered and fed us donks like a good fellow For once on my long journey I had my fill Finally we were left to entertain ourselves In less than a half hour I wanted a drink for when we were led to the well I refused to imbibe now I regretted it Donks are funny creatures regular Chinese puzzles When you think us thirsty we ain t and when we are we must help ourselves or go dry I discovered a rope dangling from a projecting arm of a high gatepost nabbed it and pulled the gate did the rest opened So I walked straightway to the well trough and drank then sauntered to the house to learn how Pod was faring S help me Balaam there he sat with Coonskin at a long table surrounded by men and women all talking and laughing and joshing But I noticed the travelers kept their knives and forks busy and wasted no time It made me hungry to see them eat so I returned to the corral to finish my barley but when I got there I found it already finished No use talking a jackass ain t to be trusted nohow at any time The only thing left for me to do was to go foraging Out I went nosing around hoping to discover a clothesline with some shirts and socks hanging on it or to stumble over an old gunnysack or cast off garment After a little I observed that the second largest house was the scene of considerable activity and I sneaked up and peeped in the window The ground floor was one vast room presumably the bunk house for those men not having homes of their own At one extremity a ladder reached from the floor to the loft One half of the ceiling was boarded and the other half looked white as if it were made of canvas or sheeting I suppose lumber was scarce out there in the desert Now a donkey s curiosity ain t to be sneezed at Fearing lest I might be discovered and locked up I withdrew to the rear to another window when suddenly I ran into a heap of bedding and other stuff I could arrive at only one conclusion there was to be a dance in honor of Pye Pod I had devoured half of a hay mattress before the guests began to arrive for the dance They came from the various houses and cabins clad in their finest and among them were a fiddler and a mouth organ grinder who at once pitched camp in one corner of the room and tuned up To open the dance the Prof led off with the landlord s pretty daughter in a waltz Coonskin sailed around close behind with her black eyed companion and soon that bunk house was as busy as a stock exchange After several dances had occurred the men excused themselves and came out to the table beside the luggage and commenced opening several bottles of the real article I stood stock still at some distance in the darkness but within smell of the refreshments and noted that some took it straight while others mixed it with sugar and water or milk Coonskin doted on punches of all kinds except one variety reserved for obstreperous donks milk punches rum punches whiskey punches claret punches et cetera but milk punches mostly and so this was an event for that unbridled youth He gulped down several milk punches with great glee and then followed the gang into the house and went at the dance again in earnest Later on the men came out for more refreshments At a late hour that O be joyful dance was brought to a sudden finish by a frightful incident or accident It seems that the cowboys had to rise early to hunt up stock on the range and therefore went up the ladder to bed before the dance was over As Coonskin had a cot with them he was asked to retire at the same time so as not to disturb them But that boy wanted just one more dance it was one too many When he started to climb the ladder I held my breath once he slipped through the rungs and only caught himself by his chin The rest of the dancers kept their feet as busy as ever and the fiddler had just called Balance ter corners and everybody looked to be in good spirits the best of spirits was in the men when all at once Coonskin dropped through the sheet ceiling overhead on to the floor in their midst I was glad to see he lit on his feet like a cat instead of on his head as one would suppose with such a heavy load as it must have had The frightened embarrassed fellow chased himself in his shirt tail round and round that room passing three doors at every lap yet calling Where s th door For a moment everybody looked paralyzed But by the time the first of them regained his senses Coonskin discovered a door and scooted out into the darkness and ran plumb over me Both of us went sprawling on the ground It broke up the dance and everybody there The women gathered in one corner and laughed in their sleeves and the men ran out to look for what had dropped out of the ceiling or sky they seemed sort of dazed like as if they didn t know When I got my breath I set out for the corral and brayed with laughter all the way Finally I heard a familiar voice whispering to me in the stable door and creeping up I discovered Coonskin shivering with a sheepskin about his shoulders They re after me ain t they he asked Well I reckon they are I replied How did it happen Well it was this way Coonskin explained When I went upstairs to bed I found the men had blown out the candle and left me to undress in the dark hic ness I felt round till I found my cot and undressed all but my shirt when I found my pillow missing Says I Where s my pillow One fellow says There it is over there wese had a pillow fight So I started to go for it I hadn t gone far before I sort o felt I was treading hic on velvet but I thought it was the punches and kept right on till I struck the floor downstairs That hic s all Just then the men entered the stables and finding Coonskin huddled up in wool had a laugh and brought him clothes to put on and went with him to the deserted dance hall and saw him safely to bed The more I thought of this accident the more sober I got until I thought what a miracle saved Pod s valet and wondered what he would have done without him out there in the desert Then I tangled up my legs and went to sleep Next day Coonskin was the most embarrassed fellow that ever rode a donk The good natured host could hardly persuade him to breakfast Everybody was silent at the table Pod said but finally Len began to chuckle and remarked that he d been West nigh on to fifty year but last night was the first time he had ever seen the ghost dance Coonskin said it was no ghost dance just a new kind of breakdown After breakfast Len gave Pod a look at his stock and made him stock up with all necessary provisions He wouldn t take a cent for anything only a few photographs to distribute to his retainers He even said he was sorry for the hard times he would like to give the Prof at least a hundred dollars I believed the generous old pioneer for it would be just like him Pod began the day in fine spirits He had been pleasantly surprised on being assigned to a room in Len s house to notice the furnishings arranged with distinctively feminine taste so he was not surprised when at the breakfast table he catechized Miss A n to draw from the lips of the blushing maiden the confession that she had resigned her boudoir to the distinguished donkey traveler Hence Pod had a delicious sleep in the downiest of beds And as a token of his appreciation for the courtesy he presented the young lady with a silver scarf pin which he had worn across the desert I shared some of my master s regrets on leaving The women hugged me good bye but when the ranchman s daughter put her arms round my neck Pod was so jealous that he jammed a spur in my side After a time we got started on the trail Len not only declined pay for Pod s supplies but gave me a hundred pounds of barley This my comrades offered to carry provided I would divide with them For the three days following there was little else to see besides sand and sage and basaltic rocks Ragtown still stands a squatty cabin and dilapidated shed with corral adjoining where old Ace Kenyon of questionable fame reaped a harvest from the half starved emigrants of early days by extorting from them rewards for recovering their lost cattle which he had had his retainers drive into the mountains in the night Ace would place all the blame on the innocent shoulders of the Indians He claimed that such depredations were often made by hostile tribes and that only through the courage of his desperate cowboys could he possibly retrieve them After the despondent emigrants had tarried several days and been forced to pay extravagant prices for provisions and some of them induced to throw away their rags for a suit of new clothes the cattle would be driven into camp Then the elated travelers had to open their purses again Ragtown situated as it was at the extremity of the Humboldt Desert was a sort of overland depot and we were told that thousands of emigrants used to drift in that direction from other routes when water had given out and for miles the trail was then strewn with cast off raiment abandoned wagons sometimes with oxen attached and the skeletons of cattle and men who died from thirst At times we could see the winding line of cotton woods that marked the tortuous current of the Carson in the distance and again the river would flow slowly close at hand Pod spent most of the dull hours playing solitaire on Damfino s broad back riding backwards We struck camp at the last ranch on the Carson the morning of October eighteen and tried to reach Dayton the same night Everything went well until we came to a point where three trails met Pod had been cautioned to take the best beaten one so the night being dark Coonskin left us donks in Pod s charge and ventured to examine the trails It was eleven o clock Not a thing had we had to eat or drink all day except a small measure of barley To stand waiting for that slow boy to get his bearings was more than we donks could bear and soon Damfino whispered to Cheese and me to slip away from the outfit and follow her lead The suggestion was at once acted upon Each of us took a different course to start with but we soon caught up with Damfino who led us a good pace for two hours and ran us all into Six Mile Canyon about one a m There we lay down with saddle and packs on and to our surprise discovered that faithful dog Don lying close by on guard It was not the most comfortable night I had ever passed but it was better than standing When Coonskin found us in the afternoon he caused me to change my ideas on that question but on reaching Dayton the Prof was so glad to see me that he lavishly dined us all watered us and let us roll to our heart s content So all scores were settled CHAPTER LIV BY PYE POD It means monsieur that a storm is raging at the summit a snow storm which will be upon us ere long And dame it is dangerous Tartarin on the Alps We left Dayton at two o clock Carson City lay six miles away close to the Sierra Nevadas whose towering heights on the Nevada side rise abruptly from the plain That afternoon s journey was the last we were to experience through the monotonous chaparral When we trailed into Carson the sun had gone down behind the forest covered mountains leaving me a little less than thirteen days in which to reach San Francisco The leading hotel was pointed out to me and a cheering crowd followed us there and called for a speech from me While unstrapping our traps for the porter to take we men answered inquiries about the trip then conducted our animals to a stable to be cared for I was glad to note that they were generally in good condition although Damfino s shoulders were somewhat tender from the rubbing of the pack saddle as the result of her running away doctor Benton at the stable after dressing her shoulders showed me the famous watch bequeathed to him by Hank Monk the clever stage driver of early days to whom it was presented for having driven Horace Greeley over the pass to Placerville in time to keep his lecture engagement Illustration Began to plow Snow toward Placerville Illustration The Cattle Passed Us I had just registered at the hotel and was chatting with the group of men crowded round me when a generous good natured gentleman edged through the cordon and grasped my hand I m going to take charge of you he said with a comical wink of the eye you are my guest while in town The next moment I found myself launched in an offhand lecture on my travels And I should have talked myself hoarse had not my host led me out to his carriage After telling the landlord to make Coonskin comfortable I asked who the gentleman was who had taken me in custody Why he s Sam D s you ve heard of Sam of course editor writer and humorist famous story teller the biggest josher on earth But that was enough I fled Indeed Sam s reputation was known to me long before I arrived on his stamping ground I leaped into the buggy and we drove for his country home Keep yer hand on yer pocket book shouted one of my host s intimates whereupon Sam turned to me with affected seriousness and observed Good advice But I took the precaution to leave my money and watch at the office I heard of your capture for donkey stealing back in Iowa On the drive my host recalled many happenings of the golden days of the Comstock which made me lose all reckoning of the present Soon we had reached his ranch When I met his family I was ready to believe some of his accounts of the practical jokes he claimed to have played on his fellows I was somewhat disconcerted when he introduced me to his wife as a noted road agent an old friend of his who had wavered from the path of rectitude whom he desired to feed and hide from the sheriff s posse hot on his trail But I was amused when his good wife who of all would be expected to know him best apparently took his word for granted and regarding me with nervous suspicion started to get me a quick lunch But Sam delayed her a moment Dan wants to entrust this twenty five thousand dollars with me until he has eluded the posse he said to his wife taking my weighty saddle bags and passing them to her There is no fire in the front room stove is there Might shove em in there She accepted the trust so seriously that I laughed outright and exploded the joke My hostess chuckled good naturedly and said that most any woman might take me for a bandit I did look disreputable Adjoining the ranch were a few acres owned by missus Langtry and sold to her by Sam so he said but how he made the deal is too good a story to be injured by my telling I was up early next morning In spite of my host s urgent invitation to remain another day I drove to town with Sam after breakfast There I was shown several places of interest Dark and threatening clouds hung over the mountains and alarmed me My friend cautioned me to hasten across if I would avoid the storm By two o clock my outfit left Carson and began the ascent of the steep trail over the pass to Glenbrook a lumber camp on the shore of Lake Tahoe doctor Benton advised me to telephone him from Glenbrook if it snowed so hard as to endanger us before crossing the second summit in which case he volunteered to dispatch at once a relief expedition with horses to break the trail and render me a safe conduct beyond the snow belt I shall always remember the veterinary s thoughtfulness My friend Sam must have been interested in the plan As higher we climbed the steep ascent the air became more damp and chilly and the heavy clouds looked more ominous We men were afoot for my donkeys were burdened enough Mac A Rony and Cheese were favored merely carrying the saddles and guns for Cheese seemed to be quite worn out and Mac while sound and strong was the one if it be decreed that only one should survive I wished to take through The donkeys often stopped for breathing spells and not until we neared the summit did they require urging to make the fatiguing climb By this time we were over our ankles in snow The biting wind came down over the pass in aggressive sorties and volleyed blasts of cutting snow dust in our faces nipping our ears and noses and blinding us By reason of the fast falling flakes and the darkness the donkeys often lost the trail and the snow obscured the rocks over which we all continually stumbled and slipped At length when we stood on the summit and looked back over that battle ground I think all of us took courage for the final conflict awaiting us on the next and higher pass We arrived at Glenbrook at eight o clock and found cozy quarters for all The storm having driven everybody indoors the place looked coldly uncordial for a time but as soon as its warm hearted people were apprised of my arrival they hastened to welcome me When provision had been made for the comfort of my animals I returned with Coonskin to the hotel where a hot supper had thoughtfully been provided for us And there we recounted our adventures which evidently afforded our auditors the keenest enjoyment Morning revealed a dreary prospect The snow was a foot deep and it was still falling thick and fast My friends urged me to tarry until the storm had abated but I set out after an early breakfast for Myer s Station twenty miles away There I hoped to find feed for us all and should the storm be over by that time comfortable shelter for the night The trail followed the shore of beautiful Lake Tahoe never more severely grand and picturesque than now followed it many miles before it led into the majestic white clad forest The snow fell incessantly while the rays of the sun peeping through its cold armor either melted it into slush or softened it so as to ball up the donkeys hoofs and render their tramp more difficult When we reached Myer s Station it was snowing harder than in the morning so I resolved to rest an hour and to cross the pass that night The solitary tavern first came into view through the dense snow screen not a hundred feet away It was four o clock Then a barn loomed up beyond and across the trail and I felt grateful I had great confidence in Skates Damfino and Coxey Coonskin and I had ridden but a little that day so that if Mac A Rony and Cheese could fortify themselves with plenty of grain I had hopes of getting all five over the summit Alas my hopes were soon shattered There was neither grain nor hay to be had The landlord explained that he didn t keep no cattle Even the pantry was depleted but my host would find a bite for us men and boil us some tea which would have to suffice until the expected supplies arrived They might be delayed by the storm until morning Meanwhile we shouldn t starve I didn t intend my animals should starve either but bought several loaves of bread and fed it to them Don t think I am going to stay here over night I said to the tavern keeper You don t mean to cross the summit in this storm I nodded At that moment a man stumbled in accompanied by a frigid gust of wind and walking to the stove stamped the snow off his high boots unwound a tippet from his neck and slapped his ice covered hat against his limbs Whose jackasses be them outside he inquired Mine I replied Where ye bound with them Over the pass to Placerville The man laughed then looking sober inquired Where yer from may I ask New York I said nonchalantly Not with them little burros With one of them Je ru salem I don t know but ye may cross with em he exclaimed in astonishment But I doubt it Jest fetched down my four horses left the wagon up to the hubs in snow half way up the trail snow must be three foot deep on the summit You ll leave your carcasses in the snow if ye try it I m tellin ye Said the proprietor If you will wait here till to morrow there ll be five hundred cattle cross the pass and break the trail for you I go to night said I and will break the trail for the cattle I thanked both men for their kind caution but said such impediments had stared me in the face ever since leaving New York and never yet one of them proved to be an obstacle As we moved off the men stood in the hotel door gaping in mute wonderment at my stubborn resolution Darkness gathered ere we began the ascent of the mountain Slowly the donkeys climbed the slippery trail Coonskin upon my advice walking beside Cheese and watching him with utmost concern The snow scudded against our faces although the mountain somewhat shielded us from the biting gale we had faced all day The three stronger animals carrying the packs walked ahead while close behind them struggled Cheese and Mac supporting our saddles and lighter traps we men encouraging them the while with kind words and allowing them a few moments rest every time they stopped Soon I feared lest Cheese would give out At length when about one third the summit was climbed he stopped and deliberately lay down I knew that meant his abandonment then and there We might induce him to climb a little further but we might better free him at once he would likely find his way back to the station So we took off his saddle and bridle cinched them on Mac and saying a sad farewell hid our faces in our sleeves and soon had climbed beyond his vision It was no time to indulge in sentiment Once or twice Mac Cheese s oldest comrade stopped and looked behind then with a soft bray resumed the ascent and from the distance at once came Cheese s response causing my eyes to fill with tears No two human beings could have shown more tender feelings at parting than did those two heroic little donks Finally we came to the abandoned wagon half enveloped in whiteness I had no idea of the hour but it must have been eleven o clock when my sturdy leader Skates began to stop for rest at every twenty paces An hour later we could make only ten feet headway with every undertaking I was afraid another donkey would drop at any moment Several times I thought we had reached the summit when a turn of the Z trail showed a clear space with Skates far in the lead ploughing and dragging her burden through two feet of snow Suddenly when we had all but reached the summit as we after learned Damfino fell with a groan She was so strong and hardy I had not anticipated her giving out Coonskin thought she had slipped and broken a leg We took off part of her pack and at length succeeded in getting her on to her feet but not far beyond she again fell when realizing it was from fatigue we left her with all the supplies on We had no way to carry them and I still had hopes of her resting out and trailing over after us It was now a question of life and death Could I but get Mac A Rony through even by leaving all else behind I should do so and fight to the bitter end Mac was certainly a wonder After thirty eight hundred miles of travel during a period of three hundred and thirty odd days he was chipper and nabbed at me mischievously as I kindly twisted his tail Eureka At last we stood on the summit of that high Arctic pass of the snow bound Sierras Man and beast were ensconced in snow and ice and my ears and face and hands and feet were numb but I was too happy to feel any suffering Could Cheese and Damfino have been with us then I should have been jubilant The battle was won I could now see myself in my mind s eye in company with Mac in Golden Gate Park gazing out on the balmy Pacific After a quarter hour s rest we resumed the journey through the two and a half feet of snow until after several resting spells we began gradually to descend The air at once felt milder the snow had ceased falling as if crushed with defeat the elements had retreated It must have been two in the morning when Coonskin who was in advance beside Skates to check her impetuosity shouted Helloa Pod I see a house I threw my hat in the air with delight We had expected to have to wade through snow until daylight Were we all to find a refuge in that half buried cabin CHAPTER LV BY MAC A RONY How he trots along on his mule I declare the beast s ears are not so long as his master s The Hunchback of Notre Dame The supreme moment of my life had arrove Must have come on Skates I had crossed the broad continent at last all but a little toboggan slide of one hundred and fifty miles more or less and that would be easy sailing I felt boastful now When Pod wasn t occupied in prodding me over the pass he was quoting Hannibal Crossing the Alps and other heroic adventurers imagining his little exploit of the same class Prof old boy just bear in mind that hobo Hannibal was not so fortunate as to have five gullible jackasses to help him The storm had abated As I stood waist deep in snow while the men folks were trying to waken the sleepers of an uninhabited shanty I looked back where we donks sang One More Mountain to Cross for the last time and I gave three brays with a gusto Standing in snow or water taxes my patience Coxey brayed to the men to get a move on but Skates and I amused ourselves by sucking icicles hanging from our bangs Pod s courageous valet received first orders He rode an avalanche bareback down the mountain and went through the door without knocking until he hit the other side of the shanty Don t shoot for heaven s sake folks he yelled No answer Beg thousand pardons friends but couldn t stop he added No answer Then he picked himself up and called Ain t nobody livin here Speak up I won t hurt you No answer The next thing that boy did was to find the lantern he had lost in the snow slide and explore the place The cabin s empty he called presently Any stove and fuel Pod asked Yep answered Coonskin and a hay tick and waow w w w spook Scat you and a gol blasted cat he added Folks must ve left just before the storm Then to the dog he called Here Don sick em cats and Don sicked My elated master next ordered Skates to slide down that chute to the cabin and she shooted He hinted that Coxey and I would follow but I wasn t so sure Judging from Coonskin s experiment it looked too swift for my blood But when I witnessed Skates safely descend and heard Coxey s whisper Come on Mac show your nerve I was bound to stay with it and follow suit We donks no sooner reached the door than Pod began to unpack us It was no go Knots and buckles everything was frozen stiff my saddle felt glued to my back We must fire up and thaw them out said Pod and he led us in doors Coonskin converted some shelves into kindling and soon the little stove was roaring like a coke oven When we began to thaw one by one the ropes and straps were unhitched or cut until we were all relieved of our burdens and part of our avoirdupois Although the men had tramped almost all the way from Carson in order to spare us our wrenching and twisting in climbing the slippery summits had loosened our saddles which rubbed into our shoulders until we were badly galled Our proud flesh had frozen to the icy blankets and when Pod while near the stove saw our conditions great tears melted in his eyes and he rubbed my frosted nose I suppose expecting me to purr We got thawed out by three in the morning That small apartment depicted a busy scene We donks were so cramped that we couldn t turn if we had tried While Coonskin dried the bedding the Prof found in the luggage a box of tar and gave us a good plastering Then he put us in the other room it was a two room house and fed us the hay tick and a wooden soap box for dessert and bade us good night I heard Coonskin mention something about supper but Pod told him all the grub was cached in the snow over the summit and that Damfino carried the keys there was however a possible chance of getting a bite later if he would go back for the supplies Soon after I heard both men snoring As I recall the circumstance I don t see how we three donks stood it cramped up in that small room eight long hours before the men got up First we ate the hay tick the hay went fast enough but it took time to chew the tick Then we gnawed soap box until dawn The latter was savory but rather tough and had to be eaten slowly on account of the bones nails Pod called them which would get into our teeth Coxey happened to swallow one and said he wouldn t lie down for a week for fear of puncturing himself Every time one of us gnawed on the box Don barked taking it to be mice He lay under Coxey with one eye open ready to vacate at a second s warning for that donk pretended he was going to lie down every moment We breathed the air of that cell ten times over and had begun on the eleventh course when the door opened What a magnificent pair of spectacles was open to our eyes The mountains on both sides of the canyon looked like great billows of a frozen sea while the fir trees sticking out of the snow resembled the spars of sunken wrecks with their torn sails frozen to the yardarms Coonskin was up first While dressing he happened to glance out of the window and his tell tale exclamation caused Pod to leap out of bed Well In the name of Balaam if there ain t Damfino he laughed She s a nervy dame observed the youth with satisfaction She knows the other donks are here all right Curiosity led me to stick my head out of the door and there knee deep in snow stood the old girl patiently waiting for an invite to our house party Skates had to be taken up to pilot down the half starved half frozen timid refugee Damfino slipped on the way but collected herself and the girls whispered something to each other which I could not catch and laughed I suppose it was a joke so I got off an old one to Coxey and he brayed with merriment Then I told it to Pod and he gave it to Coonskin who snorted like a colt over a horse chestnut As soon as Damfino was unloaded the men got breakfast The dishes washed and our galls redressed with tar and cotton wool our shoulders were padded for the saddles and we were packed for the journey Two o clock swung around before we got up that toboggan slide Once there we stopped for wind then began to plow snow toward Placerville It was a beautiful day but the glare of the sun on the snow made us shed tears Not a sound jarred the air except the swish swash of our pedals hewing away the snow or an occasional asinine sneeze or canine cough the result of a night s exposure At the steep and narrow turn where the stage driver nearly spilled Horace Greeley trying to take him through on pony express time I became interested and the spot where Sawlog Johnson was crushed to death by a giant tree falling on his shadow riveted my attention for some time I thought it a good place to rest the trees were bent by the heavy snow and ice and I knew lightning never struck twice in the same spot We reached Hart s shingle camp long after dark Pod and I were cordially received and entertained When about to resume travel next morning the drove of cattle which we were urged to wait for passed us They had crossed the summit in quick time of course after we donks had broken the trail Now only small patches of snow dotted the roadside and we had a muddy trail down to the Bridge house The keeper gave Pod a round reception and charged him an all round sum We left early next morning The scenery on that mountain trail was a thing to out last a donkey s memory One sheer cliff rising a thousand feet marks the site of a bold exploit It is said that once upon a time Snowshoe Thompson while out hunting above this cliff was chased by a grizzly and only escaped by leaping off the precipice and striking the frozen river on his snow shoes the momentum taking him down to Sacramento seventy miles away On that cliff was afterwards found a grizzly of twelve twenty pounds dead weight with a hunting knife in his heart It was the coroner s verdict that the bear was so astonished at the fearless hunter s brave act that he committed suicide with the knife the hunter dropped in his hurry Although it was near to November the foliage of the trees was barely colored The climate of California charmed me We were making fast time down grade in spite of our jaded condition and we did not tarry for lunch When Placerville hove in sight I was a most tickled donk Just one minute after dark we ambled into town and were escorted to the famous spot where Horace Greeley first stepped on California soil CHAPTER LVI BY PYE POD Who can tell a man from manners Who can tell him by his close Beggars often smoke Havanners Nabobs wear a bottle nose Dog eared Doggerels Placerville greeted us royally It was once one of the largest cities in California and in those lawless days was called Hangtown After describing my journey in my happiest vein the thoughtful sheriff passed his hat and presented me with about nine dollars Then amid hearty cheers for Mac A Rony we were escorted to a hotel That evening Coonskin and I were feted by the young bloods of the town The following morning a jolly party drove me to Coloma where I saw the statue of Marshall and old Sutter s Mill where he discovered gold It was a lovely autumn day The leaves were turning but the verdure of the Pacific slope is more subdued in its colorings than that of the East where the change of seasons embellishes it with scarlet My genial companions were refreshing to me after being so long a recluse but returning to Placerville I dined and wasted no time in starting for Sacramento Coonskin had shipped to San Francisco most of our luggage to relieve our animals and at two p m my little caravan drifted toward the Sacramento Valley The next stop was Folsom the seat of a state prison twenty miles away where we arrived at midnight All the inhabitants seemed to be asleep We were noisily debating about which street to follow when a man called from a chamber window and directed us to the best hotel saying he would call on me in the morning He introduced himself after breakfast as an officer of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and asked to see my donkeys I escorted him to the stable but I feared trouble I knew three of my donkeys were galled since leaving Carson and was so solicitous that I sent Coonskin to have the blankets and saddles cinched on them for the start hoping the officer would be guided by the wisdom of the proverb What the eye cannot see the heart cannot grieve for You may imagine how disconcerted I was when the officer uncinched the saddle on Skates the one most galled and lifted the blanket I am sorry to say mister Pod said he calmly I must arrest you for cruelty to animals I protested and explained that my valet and I had been as tender and solicitous for our animals health and comfort as a father could have been for a child that we had tramped across both passes from Carson and that the galls resulted from unavoidable loosening of the cinches and the shifting of the saddles We had even changed the packs from one animal to another at frequent intervals to distribute equally the general burden If he doubted my word we would show him our feet The sight of our sore and bleeding feet caused the humane officer to blush at his threat and as a sympathetic murmur ran through the crowd he said Professor I must say you men are exonerated You are as bad off as your poor donkeys but I cannot let you take this animal out of town in that condition Illustration Across on the exclusive Solano Illustration I pointed toward the goal Illustration The Ferry approach in Frisco was choked with a rabble I was grieved to part with Skates who had piloted us across the summits in that heavy storm but the law must be obeyed I sold the donkey to a son of the hotel landlord who promised to cherish her as a pet We were allowed to proceed with the rest on condition that neither of us would ride It was a long day s journey to the capital upwards of thirty miles and we got under way by nine o clock Coonskin and I could scarcely walk and as we drove our three jaded burros down the main street we were cheered on every hand After reaching the open country Mac A Rony observing me screw my face and hearing me sigh from pain seemed to say I m sorry old man but when we are out of sight of those meddling officers get in the saddle and I will carry you a way The dear fellow he could read me like a book We threaded a lovely country The orchards were denuded of fruit and verdure but the vineyards were laden with their white and pink and purple harvest and the waving alfalfa sent us whiffs from their fragrant censers all along the trail We stopped at the great Sonora Vineyard to rest and enjoy some Muscat grapes and shortly after lunch hour we rested again at a weighing station where I received a telephone message inquiring when we might be expected at the capital Handkerchiefs and hats were waving from the balconies of the Golden Eagle Hotel Sacramento and newsboys were crying the arrival of Pod and Mac A Rony as we approached While I had tramped most all of the way from Folsom I rode into the city and after a brief address at the hotel sent my animals to the stable The landlord welcomed me cordially and I was immediately assailed by reporters The next morning a newspaper man took me driving about the city I was presented to several state officials and shown through the handsomest state capitol grounds in the Union Half the day was devoted to business duties in the evening I delivered a lecture and several times I was asked to escort a party of ladies to the stable to see the donkey that enjoyed the unrivaled distinction of having made a four thousand mile journey from the Hudson to the Sacramento Next day we started for Frisco at eight a m Just five days were left us in which to travel the ninety miles to our goal There were many who advised me to go by way of Stockton a longer journey by forty miles cautioning me that my donkeys would not be allowed to cross in the Solano ferry at Benicia which was reserved strictly for people and passenger trains But we started on the shorter route Mac and I leading the way out of the beautiful city and along the banks of the Sacramento River through the toolies and hop fields towards Davisville When yet a mile to town Damfino while not even carrying a saddle staggered and showed symptoms of the colic The noble beast had done her duty on the hard trip from Iowa and being the biggest and strongest she had borne the heaviest burden She had earned her freedom I decided to leave her by the roadside Somebody would soon find her and take good care of her which I afterwards learned to be the case Next morning Coonskin and I set out early with the remaining two donkeys Mac A Rony and Coxey for Suisun some twenty five miles away we walking two thirds of the distance for the sake of our animals although augmenting our own sufferings for our feet still pained us My dog Don on the other hand was full of health and abrim with mirth Suisun welcomed us at sunset That evening a happy idea came to mind I would send Coonskin to Oakland by train Considerable business must be done there which he could attend to besides he might arrange for hotel and stable accommodations and engage a blacksmith to put on Mac A Rony the silver shoes which should be at the express office in that city There was left me three days in which to travel fifty miles but now I could ride alternately the two donks and not overtax either I was received with usual courtesies at Benicia and the hotel swarmed with townspeople and guests to hear about my trip At nine next morning a sympathetic crowd accompanied me to the ferry fully expecting to see my party refused passage You cannot board the Solano with your burros said the officer positively the boat is strictly reserved for passenger trains and people I did not show surprise but calmly explained my overland trip and emphasized the importance of my reaching Frisco with Mac by noon of November three Will you send a message to the Southern Pacific s head office at my expense I asked The officer said he would and sent it The answer soon came directing the ferrymaster to pass Pod and party across on the exclusive Solano and extend us every courtesy The officer seemed much astonished at receiving the message His obsequiousness made Mac A Rony bray When the expected train arrived and the Solano left the dock and the passengers realized that they were the first to cross in the company of four legged donkeys they treated to cigars and fruit and paid Mac A Rony exceptional homage Landing at Porte Costa I was directed on the shortest route to Oakland and amid cheers and hearty well wishes started to climb the trail over the hills which border the river from that point to some distance south It was after dark when descending the bluffs and trailing a few miles along the river I rode into the little village of San Pablo The streets were quite deserted and the few men I talked with answered my inquiries in Spanish Finally I entered a humble tavern whose Irish proprietor directed me on the right road Only a few miles now lay between me and Oakland and although tired and hungry I did not stop for supper but pushed onward over the level road now and then walking a half mile to rest my tired yet uncomplaining mounts or to ease my joints until I rode into the city at midnight Coonskin met me on the road and cheered me with the information that all the duties assigned to him were attended to then piloted me to the hotel and the animals to the stable After getting something to eat I retired Coonskin had interviewed the reporters and the morning press heralded my advent in long and sensational notices When I went to the stable everybody seemed to identify me with the traveler pictured in the papers I inwardly chuckled when I thought of my dilapidated garb and general unkempt appearance I was still lame and felt that I had walked around the world in eighty days My poor little donks were lying down when I went to their stalls The twenty eight mile tramp of the preceding day had told on them Mac rose to his feet and stuck up his nose to be rubbed You have almost earned your pension too I said But now come to the smith s to have your new shoes put on They are of pure silver and befitting one that has made such a record in the field of travel The little fellow smiled and playfully pulled the handkerchief out of my pocket while I adjusted his bridle And when he walked out of the shop in his pretty new shoes he looked as proud as any lad in his first pair of pants Coonskin and I lunched early The customary crowd followed my party to the ferry and some crossed with us on the boat to Frisco How happy I felt while drifting over San Francisco Bay I pointed toward the goal and to a bystander said During my three hundred forty days journey I have had only a vague vision of the city before me but the day I started from New York I felt as confident of reaching it as I do now Several passengers laughed incredulously nevertheless I spoke the truth The ferry approach in Frisco was choked with a rabble Upon landing Coonskin and I rode our little long eared animals up Market street to a prominent hotel a cheering throng of men and street gamins tagging behind or following by the walk on both sides of the street And when at two o clock the glass doors to its great white court were thrown open to us I was just twenty two hours ahead of schedule time The several rows of balconies were crowded with hotel guests and friends waving handkerchiefs and hats and cheer upon cheer rose to the crystal roof and descended to our ears The court was packed I called a porter Bring a rug for my silver shod donkey to stand on I ordered The darkey looked mystified and had the insolence to question my strange request but he soon brought the rug The reporters aided me to urge back the crowd to give the spectators in the balconies a view of Mac s silver shod hoofs all four of which Coonskin lifted one after the other for them to see Three cheers for Mac A Rony some one shouted from the balcony It was the signal for a general outburst of applause and Mac Coxey and Don each respectively brayed or bayed his deafening acknowledgment of the popular ovation Then I briefly reviewed my long and tempestuous voyage of four thousand ninety six miles on a donkey s hurricane deck in three hundred forty days and two hours Frequently I was interrupted with laughter or cheers as I cited some ludicrous experience and the unbridled throng many of them mere street loungers laughed and yelled and whistled until finally the incensed manager was attracted to the Court The police were unable to cope with the crowd so I was requested to remove the cause of the disturbance Indeed I was grateful for the excuse to get away from that wild scene Coonskin took the animals to the stable and I after registering immediately sought a more exclusive hotel to whose landlord I bore a letter of introduction from a distinguished gentleman friend I must have looked as if I had crossed Central Africa and had fought fifty tribes of cannibals My clothes hat and leggings were in shreds my sleeves were fastened to my coat with bale wire and blue cotton hung in view Do you take tramps at this hotel I inquired of the astonished clerk of the Occidental as I leaned on the office counter He stopped sorting letters and eyed me with curiosity but before he recovered his reason the junior proprietor appeared and said Sometimes then with a knowing smile extended his hand in greeting I believe this is mister Pod he said I nodded and handed him the letter When he had read it the affable young gentleman extended me the freedom of the hotel and three days later got up a coaching party in my honor I was soon a transformed man After a shave and hair cut and bath I dressed and appeared at the office attired as a gentleman on parade and was hardly recognized by the clerk to be the same man Coonskin too I had fitted out completely besides I gave him a sum of money and an honorable discharge In a few days he secured a situation in a hotel but later set out for a mining camp in the Sierras to dig for gold I presented one donkey to Golden Gate Park and sold the other but I retained possession of my dog Frequently afterward I called at the park to see dear old faithful Mac A Rony In conclusion let me state that I had eleven donkeys on my overland trip never more than five at one time I wore out ten pairs of boots and put one hundred and forty eight shoes on my animals at an average cost of ninety cents each and arrived at my journey s end with several hundred dollars in pocket and weighing thirty three pounds more than I did the day I set out from New York with ninety nine cents I am as free as Nature first made man Ere the base laws of servitude began When wild in the woods the noble savage ran EPILOGUE This tale will be hard to swallow because truth is stronger than fiction The trip was more healthful for Pod than for me There are four distinct distances across the American continent viz Three thousand miles as the crow flies Three thousand five hundred as the train steams Four thousand by overland trail for a man A million miles as a donkey goes The most monotonous constant companion for a long journey is a man There are more people who descend to the level of a jackass than donkeys that rise to the plane of man If Pye Pod had been killed or drowned or had died on the journey he would have been condemned and ridiculed as a fool by the same people who now applaud and envy him for his achievement If I had died on the first day of the trip the world would have called me lucky now that I lived through it I m d d lucky M A R TRANSCRIBER ENDNOTE End of line hyphens have been retained or discarded to maintain internal consistency when possible In table of contents for page two
