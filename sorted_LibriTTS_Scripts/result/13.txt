4039_184264_000006_000000	train-clean-360	PREFACE
none	none	 If and the thing is wildly possible the charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem it would be based I feel convinced on the line in p four Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes In view of this painful possibility I will not as I might appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such a deed I will not as I might point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it or to its noble teachings in Natural History I will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened 
4039_184264_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The Bellman who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished and it more than once happened when the time came for replacing it that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to 
none	none	They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman about it he would only refer to his Naval Code and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand so it generally ended in its being fastened on anyhow across the rudder 
4039_184264_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The helmsman used to stand by with tears in his eyes he knew it was all wrong but alas 
4039_184264_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Rule forty two of the Code No one shall speak to the Man at the Helm had been completed by the Bellman himself with the words and the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one So remonstrance was impossible and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day 
none	none	During these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me how to pronounce slithy toves The i in slithy is long as in writhe and toves is pronounced so as to rhyme with groves Again the first o in borogoves is pronounced like the o in borrow I have heard people try to give it the sound of the o in worry 
4039_184264_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Such is Human Perversity 
none	none	This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard works in that poem 
4039_184264_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Humpty Dumpty s theory of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau seems to me the right explanation for all 
none	none	For instance take the two words fuming and furious Make up your mind that you will say both words but leave it unsettled which you will first 
4039_184264_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Now open your mouth and speak 
none	none	If your thoughts incline ever so little towards fuming you will say fuming furious if they turn by even a hair s breadth towards furious you will say furious fuming but if you have the rarest of gifts a perfectly balanced mind you will say frumious Supposing that when Pistol uttered the well known words
4039_184264_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Under which king Bezonian 
4039_184264_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Speak or die 
none	none	Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard but had not been able to settle which so that he could not possibly say either name before the other can it be doubted that rather than die he would have gasped out Rilchiam 
4039_184264_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Fit the First
4039_184264_000018_000000	train-clean-360	THE LANDING
4039_184264_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Just the place for a Snark 
none	none	the Bellman cried As he landed his crew with care Supporting each man on the top of the tide By a finger entwined in his hair Just the place for a Snark 
4039_184264_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I have said it twice That alone should encourage the crew Just the place for a Snark 
4039_184264_000020_000002	train-clean-360	I have said it thrice What I tell you three times is true 
4039_184264_000021_000000	train-clean-360	The crew was complete it included a Boots A maker of Bonnets and Hoods A Barrister brought to arrange their disputes And a Broker to value their goods 
4039_184264_000022_000000	train-clean-360	A Billiard marker whose skill was immense Might perhaps have won more than his share But a Banker engaged at enormous expense Had the whole of their cash in his care 
4039_184264_000023_000000	train-clean-360	There was also a Beaver that paced on the deck Or would sit making lace in the bow And had often the Bellman said saved them from wreck Though none of the sailors knew how 
4039_184264_000024_000000	train-clean-360	There was one who was famed for the number of things He forgot when he entered the ship His umbrella his watch all his jewels and rings And the clothes he had bought for the trip 
4039_184264_000025_000000	train-clean-360	He had forty two boxes all carefully packed With his name painted clearly on each But since he omitted to mention the fact They were all left behind on the beach 
none	none	The loss of his clothes hardly mattered because He had seven coats on when he came With three pairs of boots but the worst of it was He had wholly forgotten his name 
4039_184264_000027_000000	train-clean-360	He would answer to Hi or to any loud cry Such as Fry me or Fritter my wig To What you may call um or What was his name But especially Thing um a jig 
4039_184264_000028_000000	train-clean-360	While for those who preferred a more forcible word He had different names from these His intimate friends called him Candle ends And his enemies Toasted cheese 
4039_184264_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 His form is ungainly his intellect small So the Bellman would often remark But his courage is perfect 
4039_184264_000029_000001	train-clean-360	And that after all Is the thing that one needs with a Snark 
none	none	He would joke with hyenas returning their stare With an impudent wag of the head And he once went a walk paw in paw with a bear Just to keep up its spirits he said 
4039_184264_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He came as a Baker but owned when too late And it drove the poor Bellman half mad He could only bake Bridecake for which I may state No materials were to be had 
4039_184264_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The last of the crew needs especial remark Though he looked an incredible dunce He had just one idea but that one being Snark The good Bellman engaged him at once 
4039_184264_000033_000000	train-clean-360	He came as a Butcher but gravely declared When the ship had been sailing a week He could only kill Beavers 
4039_184264_000033_000001	train-clean-360	The Bellman looked scared And was almost too frightened to speak 
4039_184264_000034_000000	train-clean-360	But at length he explained in a tremulous tone There was only one Beaver on board And that was a tame one he had of his own Whose death would be deeply deplored 
4039_184264_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The Beaver who happened to hear the remark Protested with tears in its eyes That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark Could atone for that dismal surprise 
4039_184264_000036_000000	train-clean-360	It strongly advised that the Butcher should be Conveyed in a separate ship But the Bellman declared that would never agree With the plans he had made for the trip 
4039_184264_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Navigation was always a difficult art Though with only one ship and one bell And he feared he must really decline for his part Undertaking another as well 
4039_184264_000038_000000	train-clean-360	The Beaver s best course was no doubt to procure A second hand dagger proof coat So the Baker advised it and next to insure Its life in some Office of note 
4039_184264_000039_000000	train-clean-360	This the Banker suggested and offered for hire On moderate terms or for sale Two excellent Policies one Against Fire And one Against Damage From Hail 
4039_184264_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Yet still ever after that sorrowful day Whenever the Butcher was by The Beaver kept looking the opposite way And appeared unaccountably shy 
4039_184264_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Fit the Second
none	none	 THE BELLMAN S SPEECH 
4039_184264_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies Such a carriage such ease and such grace Such solemnity too 
4039_184264_000043_000001	train-clean-360	One could see he was wise The moment one looked in his face 
4039_184264_000044_000000	train-clean-360	He had bought a large map representing the sea Without the least vestige of land And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be A map they could all understand 
4039_184264_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 What s the good of Mercator s North Poles and Equators Tropics Zones and Meridian Lines So the Bellman would cry and the crew would reply They are merely conventional signs 
4039_184264_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Other maps are such shapes with their islands and capes But we ve got our brave Captain to thank So the crew would protest that he s bought us the best A perfect and absolute blank 
4039_184264_000047_000000	train-clean-360	This was charming no doubt but they shortly found out That the Captain they trusted so well Had only one notion for crossing the ocean And that was to tingle his bell 
4039_184264_000048_000000	train-clean-360	He was thoughtful and grave but the orders he gave Were enough to bewilder a crew When he cried Steer to starboard but keep her head larboard What on earth was the helmsman to do 
4039_184264_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes A thing as the Bellman remarked That frequently happens in tropical climes When a vessel is so to speak snarked 
4039_184264_000050_000000	train-clean-360	But the principal failing occurred in the sailing And the Bellman perplexed and distressed Said he had hoped at least when the wind blew due East That the ship would not travel due West 
none	none	But the danger was past they had landed at last With their boxes portmanteaus and bags Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view Which consisted of chasms and crags 
4039_184264_000052_000000	train-clean-360	The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low And repeated in musical tone Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe But the crew would do nothing but groan 
4039_184264_000053_000000	train-clean-360	He served out some grog with a liberal hand And bade them sit down on the beach And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand As he stood and delivered his speech 
none	none	Friends Romans and countrymen lend me your ears They were all of them fond of quotations So they drank to his health and they gave him three cheers While he served out additional rations
4039_184264_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 We have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks Four weeks to the month you may mark But never as yet tis your Captain who speaks Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark 
4039_184264_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 We have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days Seven days to the week I allow But a Snark on the which we might lovingly gaze We have never beheld till now 
4039_184264_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Come listen my men while I tell you again The five unmistakable marks By which you may know wheresoever you go The warranted genuine Snarks 
4039_184264_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us take them in order 
4039_184264_000058_000001	train-clean-360	The first is the taste Which is meagre and hollow but crisp Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist With a flavour of Will o the wisp 
4039_184264_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Its habit of getting up late you ll agree That it carries too far when I say That it frequently breakfasts at five o clock tea And dines on the following day 
4039_184264_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 The third is its slowness in taking a jest Should you happen to venture on one It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed And it always looks grave at a pun 
none	none	The fourth is its fondness for bathing machines Which is constantly carries about And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes A sentiment open to doubt The fifth is ambition It next will be right To describe each particular batch Distinguishing those that have feathers and bite And those that have whiskers and scratch
4039_184264_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 For although common Snarks do no manner of harm Yet I feel it my duty to say Some are Boojums 
none	none	The Bellman broke off in alarm For the Baker had fainted away 
4039_184265_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Fit the Third
4039_184265_000003_000000	train-clean-360	THE BAKER S TALE
4039_184265_000004_000000	train-clean-360	They roused him with muffins they roused him with ice They roused him with mustard and cress They roused him with jam and judicious advice They set him conundrums to guess 
4039_184265_000005_000000	train-clean-360	When at length he sat up and was able to speak His sad story he offered to tell And the Bellman cried Silence 
4039_184265_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Not even a shriek And excitedly tingled his bell 
4039_184265_000006_000000	train-clean-360	There was silence supreme 
4039_184265_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Not a shriek not a scream Scarcely even a howl or a groan As the man they called Ho told his story of woe In an antediluvian tone 
4039_184265_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 My father and mother were honest though poor Skip all that cried the Bellman in haste If it once becomes dark there s no chance of a Snark We have hardly a minute to waste 
4039_184265_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I skip forty years said the Baker in tears And proceed without further remark To the day when you took me aboard of your ship To help you in hunting the Snark 
4039_184265_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 A dear uncle of mine after whom I was named Remarked when I bade him farewell Oh skip your dear uncle the Bellman exclaimed As he angrily tingled his bell 
4039_184265_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 He remarked to me then said that mildest of men If your Snark be a Snark that is right Fetch it home by all means you may serve it with greens And it s handy for striking a light 
4039_184265_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 You may seek it with thimbles and seek it with care You may hunt it with forks and hope You may threaten its life with a railway share You may charm it with smiles and soap 
4039_184265_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 That s exactly the method the Bellman bold In a hasty parenthesis cried That s exactly the way I have always been told That the capture of Snarks should be tried 
4039_184265_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 But oh beamish nephew beware of the day If your Snark be a Boojum 
none	none	For then You will softly and suddenly vanish away And never be met with again
4039_184265_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 It is this it is this 
4039_184265_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 It is this it is this that oppresses my soul When I think of my uncle s last words And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl Brimming over with quivering curds 
none	none	It is this it is this
4039_184265_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 We have had that before The Bellman indignantly said And the Baker replied Let me say it once more It is this it is this that I dread 
none	none	I engage with the Snark every night after dark In a dreamy delirious fight I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes And I use it for striking a light
4039_184265_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 But if ever I meet with a Boojum that day In a moment of this I am sure I shall softly and suddenly vanish away And the notion I cannot endure 
4039_184265_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Fit the fourth
none	none	 THE HUNTING 
4039_184265_000020_000000	train-clean-360	The Bellman looked uffish and wrinkled his brow If only you d spoken before It s excessively awkward to mention it now With the Snark so to speak at the door 
none	none	We should all of us grieve as you well may believe If you never were met with again But surely my man when the voyage began You might have suggested it then
4039_184265_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 It s excessively awkward to mention it now As I think I ve already remarked And the man they called Hi replied with a sigh I informed you the day we embarked 
4039_184265_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 You may charge me with murder or want of sense We are all of us weak at times But the slightest approach to a false pretence Was never among my crimes 
4039_184265_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I said it in Hebrew I said it in Dutch I said it in German and Greek But I wholly forgot and it vexes me much That English is what you speak 
4039_184265_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Tis a pitiful tale said the Bellman whose face Had grown longer at every word But now that you ve stated the whole of your case More debate would be simply absurd 
none	none	The rest of my speech he explained to his men You shall hear when I ve leisure to speak it But the Snark is at hand let me tell you again Tis your glorious duty to seek it
4039_184265_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 To seek it with thimbles to seek it with care To pursue it with forks and hope To threaten its life with a railway share To charm it with smiles and soap 
4039_184265_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 For the Snark s a peculiar creature that won t Be caught in a commonplace way Do all that you know and try all that you don t Not a chance must be wasted to day 
4039_184265_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 For England expects I forbear to proceed Tis a maxim tremendous but trite And you d best be unpacking the things that you need To rig yourselves out for the fight 
4039_184265_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque which he crossed And changed his loose silver for notes The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair And shook the dust out of his coats 
4039_184265_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade Each working the grindstone in turn But the Beaver went on making lace and displayed No interest in the concern 
none	none	Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride And vainly proceeded to cite A number of cases in which making laces Had been proved an infringement of right 
4039_184265_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned A novel arrangement of bows While the Billiard marker with quivering hand Was chalking the tip of his nose 
4039_184265_000034_000000	train-clean-360	But the Butcher turned nervous and dressed himself fine With yellow kid gloves and a ruff Said he felt it exactly like going to dine Which the Bellman declared was all stuff 
none	none	Introduce me now there s a good fellow he said If we happen to meet it together And the Bellman sagaciously nodding his head Said That must depend on the weather The Beaver went simply galumphing about At seeing the Butcher so shy And even the Baker though stupid and stout Made an effort to wink with one eye Be a man said the Bellman in wrath as he heard The Butcher beginning to sob Should we meet with a Jubjub that desperate bird We shall need all our strength for the job 
4039_184266_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Fit the Fifth
4039_184266_000002_000000	train-clean-360	THE BEAVER S LESSON
4039_184266_000003_000000	train-clean-360	They sought it with thimbles they sought it with care They pursued it with forks and hope They threatened its life with a railway share They charmed it with smiles and soap 
4039_184266_000034_000000	train-clean-360	They sought it with thimbles they sought it with care They pursued it with forks and hope They threatened its life with a railway share They charmed it with smiles and soap 
4039_184266_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan For making a separate sally And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man A dismal and desolate valley 
4039_184266_000005_000000	train-clean-360	But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred It had chosen the very same place Yet neither betrayed by a sign or a word The disgust that appeared in his face 
4039_184266_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Each thought he was thinking of nothing but Snark And the glorious work of the day And each tried to pretend that he did not remark That the other was going that way 
4039_184266_000007_000000	train-clean-360	But the valley grew narrow and narrower still And the evening got darker and colder Till merely from nervousness not from goodwill They marched along shoulder to shoulder 
4039_184266_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Then a scream shrill and high rent the shuddering sky And they knew that some danger was near The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail And even the Butcher felt queer 
4039_184266_000009_000000	train-clean-360	He thought of his childhood left far far behind That blissful and innocent state The sound so exactly recalled to his mind A pencil that squeaks on a slate 
4039_184266_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Tis the voice of the Jubjub he suddenly cried This man that they used to call Dunce As the Bellman would tell you he added with pride I have uttered that sentiment once 
4039_184266_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Tis the note of the Jubjub 
none	none	Keep count I entreat You will find I have told it you twice Tis the song of the Jubjub 
4039_184266_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The proof is complete If only I ve stated it thrice 
4039_184266_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care Attending to every word But it fairly lost heart and outgrabe in despair When the third repetition occurred 
4039_184266_000013_000000	train-clean-360	It felt that in spite of all possible pains It had somehow contrived to lose count And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains By reckoning up the amount 
none	none	Two added to one if that could but be done It said with one s fingers and thumbs Recollecting with tears how in earlier years It had taken no pains with its sums The thing can be done said the Butcher I think The thing must be done I am sure The thing shall be done Bring me paper and ink The best there is time to procure 
4039_184266_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The Beaver brought paper portfolio pens And ink in unfailing supplies While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens And watched them with wondering eyes 
none	none	So engrossed was the Butcher he heeded them not As he wrote with a pen in each hand And explained all the while in a popular style Which the Beaver could well understand Taking Three as the subject to reason about A convenient number to state We add Seven and Ten and then multiply out By One Thousand diminished by Eight The result we proceed to divide as you see By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two Then subtract Seventeen and the answer must be Exactly and perfectly true
4039_184266_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 The method employed I would gladly explain While I have it so clear in my head If I had but the time and you had but the brain But much yet remains to be said 
4039_184266_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 In one moment I ve seen what has hitherto been Enveloped in absolute mystery And without extra charge I will give you at large A Lesson in Natural History 
4039_184266_000022_000000	train-clean-360	In his genial way he proceeded to say Forgetting all laws of propriety And that giving instruction without introduction Would have caused quite a thrill in Society 
4039_184266_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 As to temper the Jubjub s a desperate bird Since it lives in perpetual passion Its taste in costume is entirely absurd It is ages ahead of the fashion 
4039_184266_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 But it knows any friend it has met once before It never will look at a bribe And in charity meetings it stands at the door And collects though it does not subscribe 
none	none	Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far Than mutton or oysters or eggs Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar And some in mahogany kegs
4039_184266_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 You boil it in sawdust you salt it in glue You condense it with locusts and tape Still keeping one principal object in view To preserve its symmetrical shape 
4039_184266_000027_000000	train-clean-360	The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day But he felt that the lesson must end And he wept with delight in attempting to say He considered the Beaver his friend 
4039_184266_000028_000000	train-clean-360	While the Beaver confessed with affectionate looks More eloquent even than tears It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books Would have taught it in seventy years 
none	none	They returned hand in hand and the Bellman unmanned For a moment with noble emotion Said This amply repays all the wearisome days We have spent on the billowy ocean 
4039_184266_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Such friends as the Beaver and Butcher became Have seldom if ever been known In winter or summer twas always the same You could never meet either alone 
4039_184266_000031_000000	train-clean-360	And when quarrels arose as one frequently finds Quarrels will spite of every endeavour The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds And cemented their friendship for ever 
4039_184266_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Fit the Sixth
4039_184266_000033_000000	train-clean-360	THE BARRISTER S DREAM
none	none	 They sought it with thimbles they sought it with care They pursued it with forks and hope They threatened its life with a railway share They charmed it with smiles and soap 
4039_184266_000035_000000	train-clean-360	But the Barrister weary of proving in vain That the Beaver s lace making was wrong Fell asleep and in dreams saw the creature quite plain That his fancy had dwelt on so long 
4039_184266_000036_000000	train-clean-360	He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court Where the Snark with a glass in its eye Dressed in gown bands and wig was defending a pig On the charge of deserting its sty 
4039_184266_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The Witnesses proved without error or flaw That the sty was deserted when found And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law In a soft under current of sound 
4039_184266_000038_000000	train-clean-360	The indictment had never been clearly expressed And it seemed that the Snark had begun And had spoken three hours before any one guessed What the pig was supposed to have done 
4039_184266_000039_000000	train-clean-360	The Jury had each formed a different view Long before the indictment was read And they all spoke at once so that none of them knew One word that the others had said 
4039_184266_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 You must know said the Judge but the Snark exclaimed Fudge That statute is obsolete quite Let me tell you my friends the whole question depends On an ancient manorial right 
none	none	In the matter of Treason the pig would appear To have aided but scarcely abetted While the charge of Insolvency fails it is clear If you grant the plea never indebted
4039_184266_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 The fact of Desertion I will not dispute But its guilt as I trust is removed So far as related to the costs of this suit By the Alibi which has been proved 
none	none	My poor client s fate now depends on your votes Here the speaker sat down in his place And directed the Judge to refer to his notes And briefly to sum up the case 
4039_184266_000044_000000	train-clean-360	But the Judge said he never had summed up before So the Snark undertook it instead And summed it so well that it came to far more Than the Witnesses ever had said 
4039_184266_000045_000000	train-clean-360	When the verdict was called for the Jury declined As the word was so puzzling to spell But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn t mind Undertaking that duty as well 
4039_184266_000046_000000	train-clean-360	So the Snark found the verdict although as it owned It was spent with the toils of the day When it said the word GUILTY the Jury all groaned And some of them fainted away 
4039_184266_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Then the Snark pronounced sentence the Judge being quite Too nervous to utter a word When it rose to its feet there was silence like night And the fall of a pin might be heard 
none	none	Transportation for life was the sentence it gave And then to be fined forty pound The Jury all cheered though the Judge said he feared That the phrase was not legally sound But their wild exultation was suddenly checked When the jailer informed them with tears Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect As the pig had been dead for some years 
4039_184266_000050_000000	train-clean-360	The Judge left the Court looking deeply disgusted But the Snark though a little aghast As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted Went bellowing on to the last 
none	none	Thus the Barrister dreamed while the bellowing seemed To grow every moment more clear Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell Which the Bellman rang close at his ear Fit the Seventh THE BANKER S FATE They sought it with thimbles they sought it with care They pursued it with forks and hope They threatened its life with a railway share They charmed it with smiles and soap And the Banker inspired with a courage so new It was matter for general remark Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view In his zeal to discover the Snark But while he was seeking with thimbles and care A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh And grabbed at the Banker who shrieked in despair For he knew it was useless to fly He offered large discount he offered a cheque Drawn to bearer for seven pounds ten But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck And grabbed at the Banker again Without rest or pause while those frumious jaws Went savagely snapping around He skipped and he hopped and he floundered and flopped Till fainting he fell to the ground The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared Led on by that fear stricken yell And the Bellman remarked It is just as I feared And solemnly tolled on his bell He was black in the face and they scarcely could trace The least likeness to what he had been While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white A wonderful thing to be seen To the horror of all who were present that day He uprose in full evening dress And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say What his tongue could no longer express Down he sank in a chair ran his hands through his hair And chanted in mimsiest tones Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity While he rattled a couple of bones Leave him here to his fate it is getting so late The Bellman exclaimed in a fright We have lost half the day Any further delay And we sha nt catch a Snark before night Fit the Eighth THE VANISHING They sought it with thimbles they sought it with care They pursued it with forks and hope They threatened its life with a railway share They charmed it with smiles and soap They shuddered to think that the chase might fail And the Beaver excited at last Went bounding along on the tip of its tail For the daylight was nearly past There is Thingumbob shouting the Bellman said He is shouting like mad only hark He is waving his hands he is wagging his head He has certainly found a Snark They gazed in delight while the Butcher exclaimed He was always a desperate wag They beheld him their Baker their hero unnamed On the top of a neighboring crag Erect and sublime for one moment of time In the next that wild figure they saw As if stung by a spasm plunge into a chasm While they waited and listened in awe It s a Snark was the sound that first came to their ears And seemed almost too good to be true Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers Then the ominous words It s a Boo Then silence Some fancied they heard in the air A weary and wandering sigh Then sounded like jum but the others declare It was only a breeze that went by They hunted till darkness came on but they found Not a button or feather or mark By which they could tell that they stood on the ground Where the Baker had met with the Snark In the midst of the word he was trying to say In the midst of his laughter and glee He had softly and suddenly vanished away For the Snark was a
