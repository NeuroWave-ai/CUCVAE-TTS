none	none	I will run and hide myself while you argue with him And Martha retreated in safety into her own dominions I was left alone But how was it possible for a man of my undecided turn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the Professor With this persuasion I was hurrying away to my own little retreat upstairs when the street door creaked upon its hinges heavy feet made the whole flight of stairs to shake and the master of the house passing rapidly through the dining room threw himself in haste into his own sanctum But on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into a corner his rough broadbrim upon the table and these few emphatic words at his nephew Axel follow me I had scarcely had time to move when the Professor was again shouting after me What not come yet And I rushed into my redoubtable master s study Otto Liedenbrock had no mischief in him I willingly allow that but unless he very considerably changes as he grows older at the end he will be a most original character He was professor at the Johannaeum and was delivering a series of lectures on mineralogy in the course of every one of which he broke into a passion once or twice at least Not at all that he was over anxious about the improvement of his class or about the degree of attention with which they listened to him or the success which might eventually crown his labours Such little matters of detail never troubled him much His teaching was as the German philosophy calls it subjective it was to benefit himself not others He was a learned egotist He was a well of science and the pulleys worked uneasily when you wanted to draw anything out of it In a word he was a learned miser Germany has not a few professors of this sort To his misfortune my uncle was not gifted with a sufficiently rapid utterance not to be sure when he was talking at home but certainly in his public delivery this is a want much to be deplored in a speaker The fact is that during the course of his lectures at the Johannaeum the Professor often came to a complete standstill he fought with wilful words that refused to pass his struggling lips such words as resist and distend the cheeks and at last break out into the unasked for shape of a round and most unscientific oath then his fury would gradually abate Now in mineralogy there are many half Greek and half Latin terms very hard to articulate and which would be most trying to a poet s measures I don t wish to say a word against so respectable a science far be that from me True in the august presence of rhombohedral crystals retinasphaltic resins gehlenites Fassaites molybdenites tungstates of manganese and titanite of zirconium why the most facile of tongues may make a slip now and then It therefore happened that this venial fault of my uncle s came to be pretty well understood in time and an unfair advantage was taken of it the students laid wait for him in dangerous places and when he began to stumble loud was the laughter which is not in good taste not even in Germans And if there was always a full audience to honour the Liedenbrock courses I should be sorry to conjecture how many came to make merry at my uncle s expense Nevertheless my good uncle was a man of deep learning a fact I am most anxious to assert and reassert Sometimes he might irretrievably injure a specimen by his too great ardour in handling it but still he united the genius of a true geologist with the keen eye of the mineralogist Armed with his hammer his steel pointer his magnetic needles his blowpipe and his bottle of nitric acid he was a powerful man of science He would refer any mineral to its proper place among the six hundred one elementary substances now enumerated by its fracture its appearance its hardness its fusibility its sonorousness its smell and its taste The name of Liedenbrock was honourably mentioned in colleges and learned societies Humphry Davy two Humboldt Captain Sir John Franklin General Sabine never failed to call upon him on their way through Hamburg Becquerel Ebelman Brewster Dumas Milne Edwards Saint Claire Deville frequently consulted him upon the most difficult problems in chemistry a science which was indebted to him for considerable discoveries for in eighteen fifty three there had appeared at Leipzig an imposing folio by Otto Liedenbrock entitled A Treatise upon Transcendental Chemistry with plates a work however which failed to cover its expenses To all these titles to honour let me add that my uncle was the curator of the museum of mineralogy formed by M Struve the Russian ambassador a most valuable collection the fame of which is European Such was the gentleman who addressed me in that impetuous manner Fancy a tall spare man of an iron constitution and with a fair complexion which took off a good ten years from the fifty he must own to His restless eyes were in incessant motion behind his full sized spectacles His long thin nose was like a knife blade Boys have been heard to remark that that organ was magnetised and attracted iron filings But this was merely a mischievous report it had no attraction except for snuff which it seemed to draw to itself in great quantities When I have added to complete my portrait that my uncle walked by mathematical strides of a yard and a half and that in walking he kept his fists firmly closed a sure sign of an irritable temperament I think I shall have said enough to disenchant any one who should by mistake have coveted much of his company He lived in his own little house in Koenigstrasse a structure half brick and half wood with a gable cut into steps it looked upon one of those winding canals which intersect each other in the middle of the ancient quarter of Hamburg and which the great fire of eighteen forty two had fortunately spared one Sixty three Tr two As Sir Humphry Davy died in eighteen twenty nine the translator must be pardoned for pointing out here an anachronism unless we are to assume that the learned Professor s celebrity dawned in his earliest years Tr It is true that the old house stood slightly off the perpendicular and bulged out a little towards the street its roof sloped a little to one side like the cap over the left ear of a Tugendbund student its lines wanted accuracy but after all it stood firm thanks to an old elm which buttressed it in front and which often in spring sent its young sprays through the window panes My uncle was tolerably well off for a German professor The house was his own and everything in it The living contents were his god daughter Graeuben a young Virlandaise of seventeen Martha and myself As his nephew and an orphan I became his laboratory assistant I freely confess that I was exceedingly fond of geology and all its kindred sciences the blood of a mineralogist was in my veins and in the midst of my specimens I was always happy In a word a man might live happily enough in the little old house in the Koenigstrasse in spite of the restless impatience of its master for although he was a little too excitable he was very fond of me But the man had no notion how to wait nature herself was too slow for him In April after he had planted in the terra cotta pots outside his window seedling plants of mignonette and convolvulus he would go and give them a little pull by their leaves to make them grow faster In dealing with such a strange individual there was nothing for it but prompt obedience I therefore rushed after him CHAPTER II A MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED AT ANY PRICE That study of his was a museum and nothing else Specimens of everything known in mineralogy lay there in their places in perfect order and correctly named divided into inflammable metallic and lithoid minerals How well I knew all these bits of science Many a time instead of enjoying the company of lads of my own age I had preferred dusting these graphites anthracites coals lignites and peats And there were bitumens resins organic salts to be protected from the least grain of dust and metals from iron to gold metals whose current value altogether disappeared in the presence of the republican equality of scientific specimens and stones too enough to rebuild entirely the house in Koenigstrasse even with a handsome additional room which would have suited me admirably But on entering this study now I thought of none of all these wonders my uncle alone filled my thoughts He had thrown himself into a velvet easy chair and was grasping between his hands a book over which he bent pondering with intense admiration Here s a remarkable book What a wonderful book he was exclaiming These ejaculations brought to my mind the fact that my uncle was liable to occasional fits of bibliomania but no old book had any value in his eyes unless it had the virtue of being nowhere else to be found or at any rate of being illegible Well now don t you see it yet Why I have got a priceless treasure that I found his morning in rummaging in old Hevelius s shop the Jew Magnificent I replied with a good imitation of enthusiasm What was the good of all this fuss about an old quarto bound in rough calf a yellow faded volume with a ragged seal depending from it But for all that there was no lull yet in the admiring exclamations of the Professor See he went on both asking the questions and supplying the answers Isn t it a beauty Yes splendid Did you ever see such a binding Doesn t the book open easily Yes it stops open anywhere But does it shut equally well Yes for the binding and the leaves are flush all in a straight line and no gaps or openings anywhere And look at its back after seven hundred years Why Bozerian Closs or Purgold might have been proud of such a binding While rapidly making these comments my uncle kept opening and shutting the old tome I really could do no less than ask a question about its contents although I did not feel the slightest interest And what is the title of this marvellous work 
887_123289_000040_000001	train-clean-100	I asked 
none	none	with an affected eagerness which he must have been very blind not to see through This work replied my uncle firing up with renewed enthusiasm this work is the Heims Kringla of Snorre Turlleson the most famous Icelandic author of the twelfth century It is the chronicle of the Norwegian princes who ruled in Iceland Indeed I cried keeping up wonderfully of course it is a German translation What sharply replied the Professor a translation What should I do with a translation This is the Icelandic original in the magnificent idiomatic vernacular which is both rich and simple and admits of an infinite variety of grammatical combinations and verbal modifications Like German I happily ventured Yes replied my uncle shrugging his shoulders but in addition to all this the Icelandic has three numbers like the Greek and irregular declensions of nouns proper like the Latin 
887_123290_000031_000002	train-clean-100	Ah 
none	none	said I a little moved out of my indifference and is the type good Type What do you mean by talking of type wretched Axel Type Do you take it for a printed book you ignorant fool It is a manuscript a Runic manuscript Runic Yes Do you want me to explain what that is Of course not I replied in the tone of an injured man But my uncle persevered and told me against my will of many things I cared nothing about Runic characters were in use in Iceland in former ages They were invented it is said by Odin himself Look there and wonder impious young man and admire these letters the invention of the Scandinavian god Well well not knowing what to say I was going to prostrate myself before this wonderful book a way of answering equally pleasing to gods and kings and which has the advantage of never giving them any embarrassment when a little incident happened to divert conversation into another channel This was the appearance of a dirty slip of parchment which slipped out of the volume and fell upon the floor My uncle pounced upon this shred with incredible avidity An old document enclosed an immemorial time within the folds of this old book had for him an immeasurable value What s this he cried And he laid out upon the table a piece of parchment five inches by three and along which were traced certain mysterious characters Here is the exact facsimile I think it important to let these strange signs be publicly known for they were the means of drawing on Professor Liedenbrock and his nephew to undertake the most wonderful expedition of the nineteenth century Runic glyphs occur here The Professor mused a few moments over this series of characters then raising his spectacles he pronounced These are Runic letters they are exactly like those of the manuscript of Snorre Turlleson But what on earth is their meaning Runic letters appearing to my mind to be an invention of the learned to mystify this poor world I was not sorry to see my uncle suffering the pangs of mystification At least so it seemed to me judging from his fingers which were beginning to work with terrible energy It is certainly old Icelandic he muttered between his teeth And Professor Liedenbrock must have known for he was acknowledged to be quite a polyglot Not that he could speak fluently in the two thousand languages and twelve thousand dialects which are spoken on the earth but he knew at least his share of them So he was going in the presence of this difficulty to give way to all the impetuosity of his character and I was preparing for a violent outbreak when two o clock struck by the little timepiece over the fireplace At that moment our good housekeeper Martha opened the study door saying Dinner is ready I am afraid he sent that soup to where it would boil away to nothing and Martha took to her heels for safety I followed her and hardly knowing how I got there I found myself seated in my usual place I waited a few minutes No Professor came Never within my remembrance had he missed the important ceremonial of dinner And yet what a good dinner it was There was parsley soup an omelette of ham garnished with spiced sorrel a fillet of veal with compote of prunes for dessert crystallised fruit the whole washed down with sweet Moselle All this my uncle was going to sacrifice to a bit of old parchment As an affectionate and attentive nephew I considered it my duty to eat for him as well as for myself which I did conscientiously I have never known such a thing said Martha M Liedenbrock is not at table Who could have believed it I said with my mouth full Something serious is going to happen said the servant shaking her head My opinion was that nothing more serious would happen than an awful scene when my uncle should have discovered that his dinner was devoured I had come to the last of the fruit when a very loud voice tore me away from the pleasures of my dessert With one spring I bounded out of the dining room into the study CHAPTER III THE RUNIC WRITING EXERCISES THE PROFESSOR Undoubtedly it is Runic said the Professor bending his brows but there is a secret in it and I mean to discover the key A violent gesture finished the sentence Sit there he added holding out his fist towards the table Sit there and write I was seated in a trice Now I will dictate to you every letter of our alphabet which corresponds with each of these Icelandic characters We will see what that will give us But by saint Michael if you should dare to deceive me The dictation commenced I did my best Every letter was given me one after the other with the following remarkable result mm rnlls esrevel seecIde sgtssmf vnteief niedrke kt samn atrateS saodrrn emtnaeI nvaect rrilSa Atsaar nvcrc ieaabs ccrmi eevtVl frAntv dt iac oseibo KediiI Redactor In the original version the initial letter is an m with a superscore over it It is my supposition that this is the translator s way of writing mm and I have replaced it accordingly since our typography does not allow such a character When this work was ended my uncle tore the paper from me and examined it attentively for a long time What does it all mean he kept repeating mechanically Upon my honour I could not have enlightened him Besides he did not ask me and he went on talking to himself This is what is called a cryptogram or cipher he said in which letters are purposely thrown in confusion which if properly arranged would reveal their sense Only think that under this jargon there may lie concealed the clue to some great discovery As for me I was of opinion that there was nothing at all in it though of course I took care not to say so Then the Professor took the book and the parchment and diligently compared them together These two writings are not by the same hand he said the cipher is of later date than the book an undoubted proof of which I see in a moment The first letter is a double m a letter which is not to be found in Turlleson s book and which was only added to the alphabet in the fourteenth century Therefore there are two hundred years between the manuscript and the document I admitted that this was a strictly logical conclusion I am therefore led to imagine continued my uncle that some possessor of this book wrote these mysterious letters But who was that possessor Is his name nowhere to be found in the manuscript My uncle raised his spectacles took up a strong lens and carefully examined the blank pages of the book On the front of the second the title page he noticed a sort of stain which looked like an ink blot But in looking at it very closely he thought he could distinguish some half effaced letters My uncle at once fastened upon this as the centre of interest and he laboured at that blot until by the help of his microscope he ended by making out the following Runic characters which he read without difficulty Arne Saknussemm he cried in triumph Why that is the name of another Icelander a savant of the sixteenth century a celebrated alchemist I gazed at my uncle with satisfactory admiration Those alchemists he resumed Avicenna Bacon Lully Paracelsus were the real and only savants of their time They made discoveries at which we are astonished Has not this Saknussemm concealed under his cryptogram some surprising invention It is so it must be so The Professor s imagination took fire at this hypothesis No doubt I ventured to reply but what interest would he have in thus hiding so marvellous a discovery Why Why How can I tell Did not Galileo do the same by Saturn We shall see I will get at the secret of this document and I will neither sleep nor eat until I have found it out My comment on this was a half suppressed Oh Nor you either Axel he added The deuce said I to myself then it is lucky I have eaten two dinners to day First of all we must find out the key to this cipher that cannot be difficult At these words I quickly raised my head but my uncle went on soliloquising There s nothing easier In this document there are a hundred and thirty two letters viz seventy seven consonants and fifty five vowels This is the proportion found in southern languages whilst northern tongues are much richer in consonants therefore this is in a southern language These were very fair conclusions I thought But what language is it Here I looked for a display of learning but I met instead with profound analysis This Saknussemm he went on was a very well informed man now since he was not writing in his own mother tongue he would naturally select that which was currently adopted by the choice spirits of the sixteenth century I mean Latin If I am mistaken I can but try Spanish French Italian Greek or Hebrew But the savants of the sixteenth century generally wrote in Latin I am therefore entitled to pronounce this a priori to be Latin It is Latin I jumped up in my chair My Latin memories rose in revolt against the notion that these barbarous words could belong to the sweet language of Virgil Yes it is Latin my uncle went on but it is Latin confused and in disorder pertubata seu inordinata as Euclid has it Very well thought I if you can bring order out of that confusion my dear uncle you are a clever man Let us examine carefully said he again taking up the leaf upon which I had written Here is a series of one hundred and thirty two letters in apparent disorder There are words consisting of consonants only as nrrlls others on the other hand in which vowels predominate as for instance the fifth uneeief or the last but one oseibo Now this arrangement has evidently not been premeditated it has arisen mathematically in obedience to the unknown law which has ruled in the succession of these letters It appears to me a certainty that the original sentence was written in a proper manner and afterwards distorted by a law which we have yet to discover Whoever possesses the key of this cipher will read it with fluency What is that key Axel have you got it I answered not a word and for a 
882_123267_000021_000001	train-clean-360	very good 
none	none	reason My eyes had fallen upon a charming picture suspended against the wall the portrait of Graeuben My uncle s ward was at that time at Altona staying with a relation and in her absence I was very downhearted for I may confess it to you now the pretty Virlandaise and the professor s nephew loved each other with a patience and a calmness entirely German We had become engaged unknown to my uncle who was too much taken up with geology to be able to enter into such feelings as ours Graeuben was a lovely blue eyed blonde rather given to gravity and seriousness but that did not prevent her from loving me very sincerely As for me I adored her if there is such a word in the German language Thus it happened that the picture of my pretty Virlandaise threw me in a moment out of the world of realities into that of memory and fancy There looked down upon me the faithful companion of my labours and my recreations Every day she helped me to arrange my uncle s precious specimens she and I labelled them together Mademoiselle Graeuben was an accomplished mineralogist she could have taught a few things to a savant She was fond of investigating abstruse scientific questions What pleasant hours we have spent in study and how often I envied the very stones which she handled with her charming fingers Then when our leisure hours came we used to go out together and turn into the shady avenues by the Alster and went happily side by side up to the old windmill which forms such an improvement to the landscape at the head of the lake On the road we chatted hand in hand I told her amusing tales at which she laughed heartilv Then we reached the banks of the Elbe and after having bid good bye to the swan sailing gracefully amidst the white water lilies we returned to the quay by the steamer That is just where I was in my dream when my uncle with a vehement thump on the table dragged me back to the realities of life Come said he the very first idea which would come into any one s head to confuse the letters of a sentence would be to write the words vertically instead of horizontally Indeed said I Now we must see what would be the effect of that Axel put down upon this paper any sentence you like only instead of arranging the letters in the usual way one after the other place them in succession in vertical columns so as to group them together in five or six vertical lines I caught his meaning and immediately produced the following literary wonder I y l o a u l o l w r b o u n G e v w m d r n e e y e a Good said the professor without reading them now set down those words in a horizontal line I obeyed and with this result Iyloau lolwrb ou nGe vwmdrn eeyea Excellent said my uncle taking the paper hastily out of my hands This begins to look just like an ancient document the vowels and the consonants are grouped together in equal disorder there are even capitals in the middle of words and commas too just as in Saknussemm s parchment I considered these remarks very clever Now said my uncle looking straight at me to read the sentence which you have just written and with which I am wholly unacquainted I shall only have to take the first letter of each word then the second the third and so forth And my uncle to his great astonishment and my much greater read I love you well my own dear Graeuben Hallo cried the Professor Yes indeed without knowing what I was about like an awkward and unlucky lover I had compromised myself by writing this unfortunate sentence Aha you are in love with Graeuben he said with the right look for a guardian Yes no I stammered You love Graeuben he went on once or twice dreamily Well let us apply the process I have suggested to the document in question My uncle falling back into his absorbing contemplations had already forgotten my imprudent words I merely say imprudent for the great mind of so learned a man of course had no place for love affairs and happily the grand business of the document gained me the victory Just as the moment of the supreme experiment arrived the Professor s eyes flashed right through his spectacles There was a quivering in his fingers as he grasped the old parchment He was deeply moved At last he gave a preliminary cough and with profound gravity naming in succession the first then the second letter of each word he dictated me the following mmessvnkaSenrA icefdoK segnittamvrtn ecertserrette rotaisadva ednecsedsadne lacartniiilvIsiratracSarbmvtabiledmek meretarcsilvcoIsleffenSnI I confess I felt considerably excited in coming to the end these letters named one at a time had carried no sense to my mind I therefore waited for the Professor with great pomp to unfold the magnificent but hidden Latin of this mysterious phrase But who could have foretold the result A violent thump made the furniture rattle and spilt some ink and my pen dropped from between my fingers That s not it cried my uncle there s no sense in it Then darting out like a shot bowling down stairs like an avalanche he rushed into the Koenigstrasse and fled CHAPTER IV THE ENEMY TO BE STARVED INTO SUBMISSION He is gone cried Martha running out of her kitchen at the noise of the violent slamming of doors Yes I replied completely gone Well and how about his dinner said the old servant He won t have any And his supper He won t have any What cried Martha with clasped hands No my dear Martha he will eat no more No one in the house is to eat anything at all Uncle Liedenbrock is going to make us all fast until he has succeeded in deciphering an undecipherable scrawl Oh my dear must we then all die of hunger I hardly dared to confess that with so absolute a ruler as my uncle this fate was inevitable The old servant visibly moved returned to the kitchen moaning piteously When I was alone I thought I would go and tell Graeuben all about it But how should I be able to escape from the house The Professor might return at any moment And suppose he called me And suppose he tackled me again with this logomachy which might vainly have been set before ancient Oedipus And if I did not obey his call who could answer for what might happen The wisest course was to remain where I was A mineralogist at Besancon had just sent us a collection of siliceous nodules which I had to classify so I set to work I sorted labelled and arranged in their own glass case all these hollow specimens in the cavity of each of which was a nest of little crystals But this work did not succeed in absorbing all my attention That old document kept working in my brain My head throbbed with excitement and I felt an undefined uneasiness I was possessed with a presentiment of coming evil In an hour my nodules were all arranged upon successive shelves Then I dropped down into the old velvet armchair my head thrown back and my hands joined over it I lighted my long crooked pipe with a painting on it of an idle looking naiad then I amused myself watching the process of the conversion of the tobacco into carbon which was by slow degrees making my naiad into a negress Now and then I listened to hear whether a well known step was on the stairs No Where could my uncle be at that moment I fancied him running under the noble trees which line the road to Altona gesticulating making shots with his cane thrashing the long grass cutting the heads off the thistles and disturbing the contemplative storks in their peaceful solitude Would he return in triumph or in discouragement Which would get the upper hand he or the secret I was thus asking myself questions and mechanically taking between my fingers the sheet of paper mysteriously disfigured with the incomprehensible succession of letters I had written down and I repeated to myself What does it all mean I sought to group the letters so as to form words Quite impossible When I put them together by twos threes fives or sixes nothing came of it but nonsense To be sure the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth letters made the English word ice the eighty third and two following made sir and in the midst of the document in the second and third lines I observed the words rots mutabile ira net atra Come now I thought these words seem to justify my uncle s view about the language of the document In the fourth line appeared the word luco which means a sacred wood It is true that in the third line was the word tabiled which looked like Hebrew and in the last the purely French words mer arc mere All this was enough to drive a poor fellow crazy Four different languages in this ridiculous sentence What connection could there possibly be between such words as ice sir anger cruel sacred wood changeable mother bow and sea The first and the last might have something to do with each other it was not at all surprising that in a document written in Iceland there should be mention of a sea of ice but it was quite another thing to get to the end of this cryptogram with so small a clue So I was struggling with an insurmountable difficulty my brain got heated my eyes watered over that sheet of paper its hundred and thirty two letters seemed to flutter and fly around me like those motes of mingled light and darkness which float in the air around the head when the blood is rushing upwards with undue violence I was a prey to a kind of hallucination I was stifling I wanted air Unconsciously I fanned myself with the bit of paper the back and front of which successively came before my eyes What was my surprise when in one of those rapid revolutions at the moment when the back was turned to me I thought I caught sight of the Latin words craterem terrestre and others A sudden light burst in upon me these hints alone gave me the first glimpse of the truth I had discovered the key to the cipher To read the document it would not even be necessary to read it through the paper Such as it was just such as it had been dictated to me so it might be spelt out with ease All those ingenious professorial combinations were coming right He was right as to the arrangement of the letters he was right as to the language He had been within a hair s breadth of reading this Latin document from end to end but that hair s breadth chance had given it to me You may be sure I felt stirred up My eyes were dim I could scarcely see I had laid the paper upon the table At a glance I could tell the whole secret At last I became more calm I made a wise resolve to walk twice round the room quietly and settle my nerves and then I returned into the deep gulf of the huge armchair Now I ll read it I cried after having well distended my lungs with air I leaned over the table I laid my finger successively upon every letter and without a pause without one moment s hesitation I read off the whole sentence aloud Stupefaction terror I sat overwhelmed as if with a sudden deadly blow What that which I read had actually really been done A mortal man had had the audacity to penetrate Ah I cried springing up But no no My uncle shall never know it He would insist upon doing it too He would want to know all about it Ropes could not hold him such a determined geologist as he is He would start he would in spite of everything and everybody and he would take me with him and we should never get back No never never My over excitement was beyond all description No no it shall not be I declared energetically and as it is in my power to prevent the knowledge of it coming into the mind of my tyrant I will do it By dint of turning this document round and round he too might discover the key I will destroy it There was a little fire left on the hearth I seized not only the paper but Saknussemm s parchment with a feverish hand I was about to fling it all upon the coals and utterly destroy and abolish this dangerous secret when the study door opened and my uncle appeared CHAPTER V FAMINE THEN VICTORY FOLLOWED BY DISMAY I had only just time to replace the unfortunate document upon the table Professor Liedenbrock seemed to be greatly abstracted The ruling thought gave him no rest Evidently he had gone deeply into the matter analytically and with profound scrutiny He had brought all the resources of his mind to bear upon it during his walk and he had come back to apply some new combination He sat in his armchair and pen in hand he began what looked very much like algebraic formula I followed with my eyes his trembling hands I took count of every movement Might not some unhoped for result come of it I trembled too very unnecessarily since the true key was in my hands and no other would open the secret For three long hours my uncle worked on without a word without lifting his head rubbing out beginning again then rubbing out again and so on a hundred times I knew very well that if he succeeded in setting down these letters in every possible relative position the sentence would come out But I knew also that twenty letters alone could form two quintillions four hundred and thirty two quadrillions nine hundred and two trillions eight billions a hundred and seventy six millions six hundred and forty thousand combinations Now here were a hundred and thirty two letters in this sentence and these hundred and thirty two letters would give a number of different sentences each made up of at least a hundred and thirty three figures a number which passed far beyond all calculation or conception So I felt reassured as far as regarded this heroic method of solving the difficulty But time was passing away night came on the street noises ceased my uncle bending over his task noticed nothing not even Martha half opening the door he heard not a sound not even that excellent woman saying Will not monsieur take any supper to night And poor Martha had to go away unanswered As for me after long resistance I was overcome by sleep and fell off at the end of the sofa while uncle Liedenbrock went on calculating and rubbing out his calculations When I awoke next morning that indefatigable worker was still at his post His red eyes his pale complexion his hair tangled between his feverish fingers the red spots on his cheeks revealed his desperate struggle with impossibilities and the weariness of spirit the mental wrestlings he must have undergone all through that unhappy night To tell the plain truth I pitied him In spite of the reproaches which I considered I had a right to lay upon him a certain feeling of compassion was beginning to gain upon me The poor man was so entirely taken up with his one idea that he had even forgotten how to get angry All the strength of his feelings was concentrated upon one point alone and as their usual vent was closed it was to be feared lest extreme tension should give rise to an explosion sooner or later I might with a word have loosened the screw of the steel vice that was crushing his brain but that word I would not speak Yet I was not an ill natured fellow Why was I dumb at such a crisis Why so insensible to my uncle s interests No no I repeated I shall not speak He would insist upon going nothing on earth could stop him His imagination is a volcano and to do that which other geologists have never done he would risk his life I will preserve silence I will keep the secret which mere chance has revealed to me To discover it would be to kill Professor Liedenbrock Let him find it out himself if he can I will never have it laid to my door that I led him to his destruction Having formed this resolution I folded my arms and waited But I had not reckoned upon one little incident which turned up a few hours after When our good Martha wanted to go to Market she found the door locked The big key was gone Who could have taken it out Assuredly it was my uncle when he returned the night before from his hurried walk Was this done on purpose Or was it a mistake Did he want to reduce us by famine This seemed like going rather too far What should Martha and I be victims of a position of things in which we had not the smallest interest It was a fact that a few years before this whilst my uncle was working at his great classification of minerals he was forty eight hours without eating and all his household were obliged to share in this scientific fast As for me what I remember is that I got severe cramps in my stomach which hardly suited the constitution of a hungry growing lad Now it appeared to me as if breakfast was going to be wanting just as supper had been the night before Yet I resolved to be a hero and not to be conquered by the pangs of hunger Martha took it very seriously and poor woman was very much distressed As for me the impossibility of leaving the house distressed me a good deal more and for a very good reason A caged lover s feelings may easily be imagined My uncle went on working his imagination went off rambling into the ideal world of combinations he was far away from earth and really far away from earthly wants About noon hunger began to stimulate me severely Martha had without thinking any harm cleared out the larder the night before so that now there was nothing left in the house Still I held out I made it a point of honour Two o clock struck This was becoming ridiculous worse than that unbearable I began to say to myself that I was exaggerating the importance of the document that my uncle would surely not believe in it that he would set it down as a mere puzzle that if it came to the worst we should lay violent hands on him and keep him at home if he thought on venturing on the expedition that after all he might himself discover the key of the cipher and that then I should be clear at the mere expense of my involuntary abstinence These reasons seemed excellent to me though on the night before I should have rejected them with indignation I even went so far as to condemn myself for my absurdity in having waited so long and I finally resolved to let it all out I was therefore meditating a proper introduction to the matter so as not to seem too abrupt when the Professor jumped up clapped on his hat and prepared to go out Surely he was not going out to shut us in again no never Uncle I cried He seemed not to hear me Uncle Liedenbrock I cried lifting up my voice Ay he answered like a man suddenly waking Uncle that key What key The door key No no I cried The key of the document The Professor stared at me over his spectacles no doubt he saw something unusual in the expression of my countenance for he laid hold of my arm and speechlessly questioned me with his eyes Yes never was a question more forcibly put I nodded my head up and down He shook his pityingly as if he was dealing with a lunatic I gave a more affirmative gesture His eyes glistened and sparkled with live fire his hand was shaken threateningly This mute conversation at such a momentous crisis would have riveted the attention of the most indifferent And the fact really was that I dared not speak now so intense was the excitement for fear lest my uncle should smother me in his first joyful embraces But he became so urgent that I was at last compelled to answer Yes that key chance What is that you are saying he shouted with indescribable emotion There read that I said presenting a sheet of paper on which I had written But there is nothing in this he answered crumpling up the paper No nothing until you proceed to read from the end to the beginning I had not finished my sentence when the Professor broke out into a cry nay a roar A new revelation burst in upon him He was transformed Aha clever Saknussemm he cried You had first written out your sentence the wrong way And darting upon the paper with eyes bedimmed and voice choked with emotion he read the whole document from the last letter to the first It was conceived in the following terms In Sneffels Joculis craterem quem delibat Umbra

none	none	And yours replied the indefatigable Professor entering the dining room CHAPTER VI EXCITING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT AN UNPARALLELED ENTERPRISE At these words a cold shiver ran through me Yet I controlled myself I even resolved to put a good face upon it Scientific arguments alone could have any weight with Professor Liedenbrock Now there were good ones against the practicability of such a journey Penetrate to the centre of the earth What nonsense But I kept my dialectic battery in reserve for a suitable opportunity and I interested myself in the prospect of my dinner which was not yet forthcoming It is no use to tell of the rage and imprecations of my uncle before the empty table Explanations were given Martha was set at liberty ran off to the market and did her part so well that in an hour afterwards my hunger was appeased and I was able to return to the contemplation of the gravity of the situation During all dinner time my uncle was almost merry he indulged in some of those learned jokes which never do anybody any harm Dessert over he beckoned me into his study I obeyed he sat at one end of his table I at the other Axel said he very mildly you are a very ingenious young man you have done me a splendid service at a moment when wearied out with the struggle I was going to abandon the contest Where should I have lost myself None can tell Never my lad shall I forget it and you shall have your share in the glory to which your discovery will lead Oh come thought I he is in a good way Now is the time for discussing that same glory Before all things my uncle resumed I enjoin you to preserve the most inviolable secrecy you understand There are not a few in the scientific world who envy my success and many would be ready to undertake this enterprise to whom our return should be the first news of it Do you really think there are many people bold enough said I Certainly who would hesitate to acquire such renown If that document were divulged a whole army of geologists would be ready to rush into the footsteps of Arne Saknussemm I don t feel so very sure of that uncle I replied for we have no proof of the authenticity of this document What not of the book inside which we have discovered it Granted I admit that Saknussemm may have written these lines But does it follow that he has really accomplished such a journey And may it not be that this old parchment is intended to mislead I almost regretted having uttered this last word which dropped from me in an unguarded moment The Professor bent his shaggy brows and I feared I had seriously compromised my own safety Happily no great harm came of it A smile flitted across the lip of my severe companion and he answered That is what we shall see Ah said I rather put out But do let me exhaust all the possible objections against this document Speak my boy don t be afraid You are quite at liberty to express your opinions You are no longer my nephew only but my colleague Pray go on Well in the first place I wish to ask what are this Jokul this Sneffels and this Scartaris names which I have never heard before Nothing easier I received not long ago a map from my friend Augustus Petermann at Liepzig Nothing could be more apropos Take down the third atlas in the second shelf in the large bookcase series Z plate four I rose and with the help of such precise instructions could not fail to find the required atlas My uncle opened it and said Here is one of the best maps of Iceland that of Handersen and I believe this will solve the worst of our difficulties I bent over the map You see this volcanic island said the Professor observe that all the volcanoes are called jokuls a word which means glacier in Icelandic and under the high latitude of Iceland nearly all the active volcanoes discharge through beds of ice Hence this term of jokul is applied to all the eruptive mountains in Iceland Very good said I but what of Sneffels I was hoping that this question would be unanswerable 
882_123267_000024_000002	train-clean-360	but I was mistaken 
none	none	My uncle replied Follow my finger along the west coast of Iceland Do you see Rejkiavik the capital You do Well ascend the innumerable fiords that indent those sea beaten shores and stop at the sixty fifth degree of latitude What do you see there I see a peninsula looking like a thigh bone with the knee bone at the end of it A very fair comparison my lad Now do you see anything upon that knee bone Yes a mountain rising out of the sea Right That is Snaefell That Snaefell It is It is a mountain five thousand feet high one of the most remarkable in the world if its crater leads down to the centre of the earth But that is impossible I said shrugging my shoulders and disgusted at such a ridiculous supposition Impossible said the Professor severely and why pray Because this crater is evidently filled with lava and burning rocks and therefore But suppose it is an extinct volcano Extinct Yes the number of active volcanoes on the surface of the globe is at the present time only about three hundred But there is a very much larger number of extinct ones Now Snaefell is one of these Since historic times there has been but one eruption of this mountain that of twelve nineteen from that time it has quieted down more and more and now it is no longer reckoned among active volcanoes To such positive statements I could make no reply I therefore took refuge in other dark passages of the document What is the meaning of this word Scartaris and what have the kalends of July to do with it My uncle took a few minutes to consider For one short moment I felt a ray of hope speedily to be extinguished For he soon answered thus What is darkness to you is light to me This proves the ingenious care with which Saknussemm guarded and defined his discovery Sneffels or Snaefell has several craters It was therefore necessary to point out which of these leads to the centre of the globe What did the Icelandic sage do He observed that at the approach of the kalends of July that is to say in the last days of June one of the peaks called Scartaris flung its shadow down the mouth of that particular crater and he committed that fact to his document Could there possibly have been a more exact guide As soon as we have arrived at the summit of Snaefell we shall have no hesitation as to the proper road to take Decidedly my uncle had answered every one of my objections I saw that his position on the old parchment was impregnable I therefore ceased to press him upon that part of the subject and as above all things he must be convinced I passed on to scientific objections which in my opinion were far more serious Well then I said I am forced to admit that Saknussemm s sentence is clear and leaves no room for doubt I will even allow that the document bears every mark and evidence of authenticity That learned philosopher did get to the bottom of Sneffels he has seen the shadow of Scartaris touch the edge of the crater before the kalends of July he may even have heard the legendary stories told in his day about that crater reaching to the centre of the world but as for reaching it himself as for performing the journey and

none	none	if he ever went I say no he never never did that Now for your reason said my uncle ironically All the theories of science demonstrate such a feat to be impracticable The theories say that do they replied the Professor in the tone of a meek disciple Oh unpleasant theories How the theories will hinder us won t they I saw that he was only laughing at me but I went on all the same Yes it is perfectly well known that the internal temperature rises one degree for every seventy feet in depth now admitting this proportion to be constant and the radius of the earth being fifteen hundred leagues there must be a temperature of three hundred sixty thousand thirty two degrees at the centre of the earth Therefore all the substances that compose the body of this earth must exist there in a state of incandescent gas for the metals that most resist the action of heat gold and platinum and the hardest rocks can never be either solid or liquid under such a temperature I have therefore good reason for asking if it is possible to penetrate through such a medium So Axel it is the heat that troubles you Of course it is Were we to reach a depth of thirty miles we should have arrived at the limit of the terrestrial crust for there the temperature will be more than twenty three seventy two degrees Are you afraid of being put into a state of fusion I will leave you to decide that question I answered rather sullenly This is my decision replied Professor Liedenbrock putting on one of his grandest airs Neither you nor anybody else knows with any certainty what is going on in the interior of this globe since not the twelve thousandth part of its radius is known science is eminently perfectible and every new theory is soon routed by a newer Was it not always believed until Fourier that the temperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually and is it not known at the present time that the greatest cold of the ethereal regions is never lower than forty degrees below zero Fahr Why should it not be the same with the internal heat Why should it not at a certain depth attain an impassable limit instead of rising to such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals As my uncle was now taking his stand upon hypotheses of course there was nothing to be said Well I will tell you that true savants amongst them Poisson have demonstrated that if a heat of three hundred sixty thousand degrees one existed in the interior of the globe the fiery gases arising from the fused matter would acquire an elastic force which the crust of the earth would be unable to resist and that it would explode like the plates of a bursting boiler That is Poisson s opinion my uncle nothing more Granted But it is likewise the creed adopted by other distinguished geologists that the interior of the globe is neither gas nor water nor any of the heaviest minerals known for in none of these cases would the earth weigh what it does Oh with figures you may prove anything But is it the same with facts Is it not known that the number of volcanoes has diminished since the first days of creation and if there is central heat may we not thence conclude that it is in process of diminution My good uncle if you will enter into the legion of speculation I can discuss the matter no longer But I have to tell you that the highest names have come to the support of my views Do you remember a visit paid to me by the celebrated chemist Humphry Davy in eighteen twenty five Not at all for I was not born until nineteen years afterwards Well Humphry Davy did call upon me on his way through Hamburg We were long engaged in discussing amongst other problems the hypothesis of the liquid structure of the terrestrial nucleus We were agreed that it could not be in a liquid state for a reason which science has never been able to confute one The degrees of temperature are given by Jules Verne according to the centigrade system for which we will in each case substitute the Fahrenheit measurement Tr What is that reason I said rather astonished Because this liquid mass would be subject like the ocean to the lunar attraction and therefore twice every day there would be internal tides which upheaving the terrestrial crust would cause periodical earthquakes Yet it is evident that the surface of the globe has been subject to the action of fire I replied and it is quite reasonable to suppose that the external crust cooled down first whilst the heat took refuge down to the centre Quite a mistake my uncle answered The earth has been heated by combustion on its surface that is all Its surface was composed of a great number of metals such as potassium and sodium which have the peculiar property of igniting at the mere contact with air and water these metals kindled when the atmospheric vapours fell in rain upon the soil and by and by when the waters penetrated into the fissures of the crust of the earth they broke out into fresh combustion with explosions and eruptions Such was the cause of the numerous volcanoes at the origin of the earth Upon my word this is a very clever hypothesis I exclaimed in spite rather of myself And which Humphry Davy demonstrated to me by a simple experiment He formed a small ball of the metals which I have named and which was a very fair representation of our globe whenever he caused a fine dew of rain to fall upon its surface it heaved up into little monticules it became oxydized and formed miniature mountains a crater broke open at one of its summits the eruption took place and communicated to the whole of the ball such a heat that it could not be held in the hand In truth I was beginning to be shaken by the Professor s arguments besides which he gave additional weight to them by his usual ardour and fervent enthusiasm You see Axel he added the condition of the terrestrial nucleus has given rise to various hypotheses among geologists there is no proof at all for this internal heat my opinion is that there is no such thing it cannot be besides we shall see for ourselves and like Arne Saknussemm we shall know exactly what to hold as truth concerning this grand question Very well we shall see I replied feeling myself carried off by his contagious enthusiasm Yes we shall see that is if it is possible to see anything there And
724_123284_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 why not 
none	none	May we not depend upon electric phenomena to give us light May we not even expect light from the atmosphere the pressure of which may render it luminous as we approach the centre Yes yes said I that is possible too It is certain exclaimed my uncle in a tone of triumph But silence do you hear me silence upon the whole subject and let no one get before us in this design of discovering the centre of the earth CHAPTER VII A WOMAN S COURAGE Thus ended this memorable seance That conversation threw me into a fever I came out of my uncle s study as if I had been stunned and as if there was not air enough in all the streets of Hamburg to put me right again I therefore made for the banks of the Elbe where the steamer lands her passengers which forms the communication between the city and the Hamburg railway Was I convinced of the truth of what I had heard Had I not bent under the iron rule of the Professor Liedenbrock Was I to believe him in earnest in his intention to penetrate to the centre of this massive globe Had I been listening to the mad speculations of a lunatic or to the scientific conclusions of a lofty genius Where did truth stop Where did error begin I was all adrift amongst a thousand contradictory hypotheses but I could not lay hold of one Yet I remembered that I had been convinced although now my enthusiasm was beginning to cool down but I felt a desire to start at once and not to lose time and courage by calm reflection I had at that moment quite courage enough to strap my knapsack to my shoulders and start But I must confess that in another hour this unnatural excitement abated my nerves became unstrung and from the depths of the abysses of this earth I ascended to its surface again It is quite absurd I cried there is no sense about it No sensible young man should for a moment entertain such a proposal The whole thing is non existent I have had a bad night I have been dreaming of horrors But I had followed the banks of the Elbe and passed the town After passing the port too I had reached the Altona road I was led by a presentiment soon to be realised for shortly I espied my little Graeuben bravely returning with her light step to Hamburg Graeuben I cried from afar off The young girl stopped rather frightened perhaps to hear her name called after her on the high road Ten yards more and I had joined her Axel she cried surprised What have you come to meet me Is this why you are here sir But when she had looked upon me Graeuben could not fail to see the uneasiness and distress of my mind What is the matter she said holding out her hand What is the matter Graeuben I cried In a couple of minutes my pretty Virlandaise was fully informed of the position of affairs For a time she was silent Did her heart palpitate as mine did I don t know about that but I know that her hand did not tremble in mine We went on a hundred yards without speaking At last she said Axel My dear Graeuben That will be a splendid journey I gave a bound at these words Yes Axel a journey worthy of the nephew of a savant it is a good thing for a man to be distinguished by some great enterprise What Graeuben won t you dissuade me from such an undertaking No my dear Axel and I would willingly go with you but that a poor girl would only be in your way Is that quite true It is true Ah women and young girls how incomprehensible are your feminine hearts When you are not the timidest you are the bravest of creatures Reason has nothing to do with your actions What did this child encourage me in such an expedition Would she not be afraid to join it herself And she was driving me to it one whom she loved I was disconcerted and if I must tell the whole truth I was ashamed Graeuben we will see whether you will say the same thing to morrow To morrow dear Axel I will say what I say to day Graeuben and I hand in hand but in silence pursued our way The emotions of that day were breaking my heart After all I thought the kalends of July are a long way off and between this and then many things may take place which will cure my uncle of his desire to travel underground It was night when we arrived at the house in Koenigstrasse I expected to find all quiet there my uncle in bed as was his custom and Martha giving her last touches with the feather brush But I had not taken into account the Professor s impatience I found him shouting and working himself up amidst a crowd of porters and messengers who were all depositing various loads in the passage Our old servant was at her wits end Come Axel come you miserable wretch my uncle cried from as far off as he could see me Your boxes are not packed and my papers are not arranged where s the key of my carpet bag and what have you done with my gaiters I stood thunderstruck My voice failed Scarcely could my lips utter the words Are we really going Of course you unhappy boy Could I have dreamed that you would have gone out for a walk instead of hurrying your preparations forward Are we to go I asked again with sinking hopes Yes the day after to morrow early I could hear no more I fled for refuge into my own little room All hope was now at an end My uncle had been all the morning making purchases of a part of the tools and apparatus required for this desperate undertaking The passage was encumbered with rope ladders knotted cords torches flasks grappling irons alpenstocks pickaxes iron shod sticks enough to load ten men I spent an awful night Next morning I was called early I had quite decided I would not open the door But how was I to resist the sweet voice which was always music to my ears saying My dear Axel I came out of my room I thought my pale countenance and my red and sleepless eyes would work upon Graeuben s sympathies and change her mind Ah my dear Axel she said I see you are better A night s rest has done you good Done me good I exclaimed I rushed to the glass Well in fact I did look better than I had expected I could hardly believe my own eyes Axel she said I have had a long talk with my guardian He is a bold philosopher a man of immense courage and you must remember that his blood flows in your veins He has confided to me his plans his hopes and why and how he hopes to attain his object He will no doubt succeed My dear Axel it is a grand thing to devote yourself to science What honour will fall upon Herr Liedenbrock and so be reflected upon his companion When you return Axel you will be a man his equal free to speak and to act independently and free to The dear girl only finished this sentence by blushing Her words revived me Yet I refused to believe we should start I drew Graeuben into the Professor s study Uncle is it true that we are to go Why do you doubt Well I don t doubt I said not to vex him but I ask what need is there to hurry Time time flying with irreparable rapidity But it is only the sixteenth May and until the end of June What you monument of ignorance do you think you can get to Iceland in a couple of days If you had not deserted me like a fool I should have taken you to the Copenhagen office to Liffender company and you would have learned then that there is only one trip every month from Copenhagen to Rejkiavik on the twenty second Well Well if we waited for the twenty second June we should be too late to see the shadow of Scartaris touch the crater of Sneffels Therefore we must get to Copenhagen as fast as we can to secure our passage Go and pack up There was no reply to this I went up to my room Graeuben followed me She undertook to pack up all things necessary for my voyage She was no more moved than if I had been starting for a little trip to Luebeck or Heligoland Her little hands moved without haste She talked quietly She supplied me with sensible reasons for our expedition She delighted me and yet I was angry with her Now and then I felt I ought to break out into a passion but she took no notice and went on her way as methodically as ever Finally the last strap was buckled I came downstairs All that day the philosophical instrument makers and the electricians kept coming and going Martha was distracted Is master mad she asked I nodded my head And is he going to take you with him I nodded again Where to I pointed with my finger downward Down into the cellar cried the old servant No I said Lower down than that Night came But I knew nothing about the lapse of time To morrow morning at six precisely my uncle decreed we start At ten o clock I fell upon my bed a dead lump of inert matter All through the night terror had hold of me I spent it dreaming of abysses I was a prey to delirium I felt myself grasped by the Professor s sinewy hand dragged along hurled down shattered into little bits I dropped down unfathomable precipices with the accelerating velocity of bodies falling through space My life had become an endless fall I awoke at five with shattered nerves trembling and weary I came downstairs My uncle was at table devouring his breakfast I stared at him with horror and disgust But dear Graeuben was there so I said nothing and could eat nothing At half past five there was a rattle of wheels outside A large carriage was there to take us to the Altona railway station It was soon piled up with my uncle s multifarious preparations Where s your box he cried It is ready I replied with faltering voice Then make haste down or we shall lose the train It was now manifestly impossible to maintain the struggle against destiny I went up again to my room and rolling my portmanteaus downstairs I darted after him At that moment my uncle was solemnly investing Graeuben with the reins of government My pretty Virlandaise was as calm and collected as was her wont She kissed her guardian but could not restrain a tear in touching my cheek with her gentle lips Graeuben I murmured Go my dear Axel go I am now your betrothed and when you come back I will be your wife I pressed her in my arms and took my place in the carriage Martha and the young girl standing at the door waved their last farewell Then the horses roused by the driver s whistling darted off at a gallop on the road to Altona CHAPTER VIII SERIOUS PREPARATIONS FOR VERTICAL DESCENT Altona which is but a suburb of Hamburg is the terminus of the Kiel railway which was to carry us to the Belts In twenty minutes we were in Holstein At half past six the carriage stopped at the station my uncle s numerous packages his voluminous impedimenta were unloaded removed labelled weighed put into the luggage vans and at seven we were seated face to face in our compartment The whistle sounded the engine started we were off Was I resigned No not yet Yet the cool morning air and the scenes on the road rapidly changed by the swiftness of the train drew me away somewhat from my sad reflections As for the Professor s reflections they went far in advance of the swiftest express We were alone in the carriage but we sat in silence My uncle examined all his pockets and his travelling bag with the minutest care I saw that he had not forgotten the smallest matter of detail Amongst other documents a sheet of paper carefully folded bore the heading of the Danish consulate with the signature of W Christiensen consul at Hamburg and the Professor s friend With this we possessed the proper introductions to the Governor of Iceland I also observed the famous document most carefully laid up in a secret pocket in his portfolio I bestowed a malediction upon it and then proceeded to examine the country It was a very long succession of uninteresting loamy and fertile flats a very easy country for the construction of railways and propitious for the laying down of these direct level lines so dear to railway companies I had no time to get tired of the monotony for in three hours we stopped at Kiel close to the sea The luggage being labelled for Copenhagen we had no occasion to look after it Yet the Professor watched every article with jealous vigilance until all were safe on board There they disappeared in the hold My uncle notwithstanding his hurry had so well calculated the relations between the train and the steamer that we had a whole day to spare The steamer Ellenora did not start until night Thence sprang a feverish state of excitement in which the impatient irascible traveller devoted to perdition the railway directors and the steamboat companies and the governments which allowed such intolerable slowness I was obliged to act chorus to him when he attacked the captain of the Ellenora upon this subject The captain disposed of us summarily At Kiel as elsewhere we must do something to while away the time What with walking on the verdant shores of the bay within which nestles the little town exploring the thick woods which make it look like a nest embowered amongst thick foliage admiring the villas each provided with a little bathing house and moving about and grumbling at last ten o clock came The heavy coils of smoke from the Ellenora s funnel unrolled in the sky the bridge shook with the quivering of the struggling steam we were on board and owners for the time of two berths one over the other in the only saloon cabin on board At a quarter past the moorings were loosed and the throbbing steamer pursued her way over the dark waters of the Great Belt The night was dark there was a sharp breeze and a rough sea a few lights appeared on shore through the thick darkness later on I cannot tell when a dazzling light from some lighthouse threw a bright stream of fire along the waves and this is all I can remember of this first portion of our sail At seven in the morning we landed at Korsor a small town on the west coast of Zealand There we were transferred from the boat to another line of railway which took us by just as flat a country as the plain of Holstein Three hours travelling brought us to the capital of Denmark My uncle had not shut his eyes all night In his impatience I believe he was trying to accelerate the train with his feet At last he discerned a stretch of sea The Sound he cried At our left was a huge building that looked like a hospital That s a lunatic asylum said one of or travelling companions Very good thought I just the place we want to end our days in and great as it is that asylum is not big enough to contain all Professor Liedenbrock s madness At ten in the morning at last we set our feet in Copenhagen the luggage was put upon a carriage and taken with ourselves to the Phoenix Hotel in Breda Gate This took half an hour for the station is out of the town Then my uncle after a hasty toilet dragged me after him The porter at the hotel could speak German and English but the Professor as a polyglot questioned him in good Danish and it was in the same language that that personage directed him to the Museum of Northern Antiquities The curator of this curious establishment in which wonders are gathered together out of which the ancient history of the country might be reconstructed by means of its stone weapons its cups and its jewels was a learned savant the friend of the Danish consul at Hamburg Professor Thomsen My uncle had a cordial letter of introduction to him As a general rule one savant greets another with coolness But here the case was different M Thomsen like a good friend gave the Professor Liedenbrock a cordial greeting and he even vouchsafed the same kindness to his nephew It is hardly necessary to say the secret was sacredly kept from the excellent curator we were simply disinterested travellers visiting Iceland out of harmless curiosity M Thomsen placed his services at our disposal and we visited the quays with the object of finding out the next vessel to sail I was yet in hopes that there would be no means of getting to Iceland But there was no such luck A small Danish schooner the Valkyria was to set sail for Rejkiavik on the second of June The captain M Bjarne was on board His intending passenger was so joyful that he almost squeezed his hands till they ached That good man was rather surprised at his energy To him it seemed a very simple thing to go to Iceland as that was his business but to my uncle it was sublime The worthy captain took advantage of his enthusiasm to charge double fares but we did not trouble ourselves about mere trifles You must be on board on Tuesday at seven in the morning said Captain Bjarne after having pocketed more dollars than were his due Then we thanked M Thomsen for his kindness and we returned to the Phoenix Hotel It s all right it s all right my uncle repeated How fortunate we are to have found this boat ready for sailing Now let us have some breakfast and go about the town We went first to Kongens nye Torw an irregular square in which are two innocent looking guns which need not alarm any one Close by at No five there was a French restaurant kept by a cook of the name of Vincent where we had an ample breakfast for four marks each two s four d Then I took a childish pleasure in exploring the city my uncle let me take him with me but he took notice of nothing neither the insignificant king s palace nor the pretty seventeenth century bridge which spans the canal before the museum nor that immense cenotaph of Thorwaldsen s adorned with horrible mural painting and containing within it a collection of the sculptor s works nor in a fine park the toylike chateau of Rosenberg nor the beautiful renaissance edifice of the Exchange nor its spire composed of the twisted tails of four bronze dragons nor the great windmill on the ramparts whose huge arms dilated in the sea breeze like the sails of a ship What delicious walks we should have had together my pretty Virlandaise and I along the harbour where the two deckers and the frigate slept peaceably by the red roofing of the warehouse by the green banks of the strait through the deep shades of the trees amongst which the fort is half concealed where the guns are thrusting out their black throats between branches of alder and willow But alas Graeuben was far away and I never hoped to see her again But if my uncle felt no attraction towards these romantic scenes he was very much struck with the aspect of a certain church spire situated in the island of Amak which forms the south west quarter of Copenhagen I was ordered to direct my feet that way I embarked on a small steamer which plies on the canals and in a few minutes she touched the quay of the dockyard After crossing a few narrow streets where some convicts in trousers half yellow and half grey were at work under the orders of the gangers we arrived at the Vor Frelsers Kirk There was nothing remarkable about the church but there was a reason why its tall spire had attracted the Professor s attention Starting from the top of the tower an external staircase wound around the spire the spirals circling up into the sky Let us get to the top said my uncle I shall be dizzy I said The more reason why we should go up we must get used to it But Come I tell you don t waste our time I had to obey A keeper who lived at the other end of the street handed us the key and the ascent began My uncle went ahead with a light step I followed him not without alarm for my head was very apt to feel dizzy I possessed neither the equilibrium of an eagle nor his fearless nature As long as we were protected on the inside of the winding staircase up the tower all was well enough but after toiling up a hundred and fifty steps the fresh air came to salute my face and we were on the leads of the tower There the aerial staircase began its gyrations only guarded by a thin iron rail and the narrowing steps seemed to ascend into infinite space Never shall I be able to do it I said Don t be a coward come up sir said my uncle with the coldest cruelty I had to follow clutching at every step The keen air made me giddy I felt the spire rocking with every gust of wind my knees began to fail soon I was crawling on my knees then creeping on my stomach I closed my eyes I seemed to be lost in space At last I reached the apex with the assistance of my uncle dragging me up by the collar Look down he cried Look down well You must take a lesson in abysses I opened my eyes I saw houses squashed flat as if they had all fallen down from the skies a smoke fog seemed to drown them Over my head ragged clouds were drifting past and by an optical inversion they seemed stationary while the steeple the ball and I were all spinning along with fantastic speed Far away on one side was the green country on the other the sea sparkled bathed in sunlight The Sound stretched away to Elsinore dotted with a few white sails like sea gulls wings and in the misty east and away to the north east lay outstretched the faintly shadowed shores of Sweden All this immensity of space whirled and wavered fluctuating beneath my eyes But I was compelled to rise to stand up to look My first lesson in dizziness lasted an hour When I got permission to come down and feel the solid street pavements I was afflicted with severe lumbago To morrow we will do it again said the Professor And it was so for five days in succession I was obliged to undergo this anti vertiginous exercise and whether I would or not I made some improvement in the art of lofty contemplations CHAPTER IX ICELAND BUT WHAT NEXT The day for our departure arrived The day before it our kind friend M Thomsen brought us letters of introduction to Count Trampe the Governor of Iceland M Picturssen the bishop s suffragan and M Finsen mayor of Rejkiavik My uncle expressed his gratitude by tremendous compressions of both his hands On the second at six in the evening all our precious baggage being safely on board the Valkyria the captain took us into a very narrow cabin Is the wind favourable my uncle asked Excellent replied Captain Bjarne a sou easter We shall pass down the Sound full speed with all sails set In a few minutes the schooner under her mizen brigantine topsail and topgallant sail loosed from her moorings and made full sail through the straits In an hour the capital of Denmark seemed to sink below the distant waves and the Valkyria was skirting the coast by Elsinore In my nervous frame of mind I expected to see the ghost of Hamlet wandering on the legendary castle terrace Sublime madman I said no doubt you would approve of our expedition Perhaps you would keep us company to the centre of the globe to find the solution of your eternal doubts But there was no ghostly shape upon the ancient walls Indeed the castle is much younger than the heroic prince of Denmark It now answers the purpose of a sumptuous lodge for the doorkeeper of the straits of the Sound before which every year there pass fifteen thousand ships of all nations The castle of Kronsberg soon disappeared in the mist as well as the tower of Helsingborg built on the Swedish coast and the schooner passed lightly on her way urged by the breezes of the Cattegat The Valkyria was a splendid sailer but on a sailing vessel you can place no dependence She was taking to Rejkiavik coal household goods earthenware woollen clothing and a cargo of wheat The crew consisted of five men all Danes How long will the passage take my uncle asked Ten days the captain replied if we don t meet a nor wester in passing the Faroes But are you not subject to considerable delays No M Liedenbrock don t be uneasy we shall get there in very good time At evening the schooner doubled the Skaw at the northern point of Denmark in the night passed the Skager Rack skirted Norway by Cape Lindness and entered the North Sea In two days more we sighted the coast of Scotland near Peterhead and the Valkyria turned her lead towards the Faroe Islands passing between the Orkneys and Shetlands Soon the schooner encountered the great Atlantic swell she had to tack against the north wind and reached the Faroes only with some difficulty On the eighth the captain made out Myganness the southernmost of these islands and from that moment took a straight course for Cape Portland the most southerly point of Iceland The passage was marked by nothing unusual I bore the troubles of the sea pretty well my uncle to his own intense disgust and his greater shame was ill all through the voyage He therefore was unable to converse with the captain about Snaefell the way to get to it the facilities for transport he was obliged to put off these inquiries until his arrival and spent all his time at full length in his cabin of which the timbers creaked and shook with every pitch she took It must be confessed he was not undeserving of his punishment On the eleventh we reached Cape Portland The clear open weather gave us a good view of Myrdals jokul which overhangs it The cape is merely a low hill with steep sides standing lonely by the beach The Valkyria kept at some distance from the coast taking a westerly course amidst great shoals of whales and sharks Soon we came in sight of an enormous perforated rock through which the sea dashed furiously The Westman islets seemed to rise out of the ocean like a group of rocks in a liquid plain From that time the schooner took a wide berth and swept at a great distance round Cape Rejkianess which forms the western point of Iceland The rough sea prevented my uncle from coming on deck to admire these shattered and surf beaten coasts Forty eight hours after coming out of a storm which forced the schooner to scud under bare poles we sighted east of us the beacon on Cape Skagen where dangerous rocks extend far away seaward An Icelandic pilot came on board and in three hours the Valkyria dropped her anchor before Rejkiavik in Faxa Bay The Professor at last emerged from his cabin rather pale and wretched looking but still full of enthusiasm and with ardent satisfaction shining in his eyes The population of the town wonderfully interested in the arrival of a vessel from which every one expected something formed in groups upon the quay My uncle left in haste his floating prison or rather hospital But before quitting the deck of the schooner he dragged me forward and pointing with outstretched finger north of the bay at a distant mountain terminating in a double peak a pair of cones covered with perpetual snow he cried Snaefell Snaefell Then recommending me by an impressive gesture to keep silence he went into the boat which awaited him I followed and presently we were treading the soil of Iceland The first man we saw was a good looking fellow enough in a general s uniform Yet he was not a general but a magistrate the Governor of the island M le Baron Trampe himself The Professor was soon aware of the presence he was in He delivered him his letters from Copenhagen and then followed a short conversation in the Danish language the purport of which I was quite ignorant of and for a very good reason But the result of this first conversation was that Baron Trampe placed himself entirely at the service of Professor Liedenbrock My uncle was just as courteously received by the mayor M Finsen whose appearance was as military and disposition and office as pacific as the Governor s As for the bishop s suffragan M Picturssen he was at that moment engaged on an episcopal visitation in the north For the time we must be resigned to wait for the honour of being presented to him But M Fridrikssen professor of natural sciences at the school of Rejkiavik was a delightful man and his friendship became very precious to me This modest philosopher spoke only Danish and Latin He came to proffer me his good offices in the language of Horace and I felt that we were made to understand each other In fact he was the only person in Iceland with whom I could converse at all This good natured gentleman made over to us two of the three rooms which his house contained and we were soon installed in it with all our luggage the abundance of which rather astonished the good people of Rejkiavik Well Axel said my uncle we are getting on and now the worst is over The worst I said astonished To be sure now we have nothing to do but go down Oh if that is all you are quite right but after all when we have gone down we shall have to get up again I suppose Oh I don t trouble myself about that Come there s no time to lose I am going to the library Perhaps there is some manuscript of Saknussemm s there and I should be glad to consult it Well while you are there I will go into the town Won t you Oh that is very uninteresting to me It is not what is upon this island but what is underneath that interests me I went out and wandered wherever chance took me It would not be easy to lose your way in Rejkiavik I was therefore under no necessity to inquire the road which exposes one to mistakes when the only medium of intercourse is gesture The town extends along a low and marshy level between two hills An immense bed of lava bounds it on one side and falls gently towards the sea On the other extends the vast bay of Faxa shut in at the north by the enormous glacier of the Snaefell and of which the Valkyria was for the time the only occupant Usually the English and French conservators of fisheries moor in this bay but just then they were cruising about the western coasts of the island The longest of the only two streets that Rejkiavik possesses was parallel with the beach Here live the merchants and traders in wooden cabins made of red planks set horizontally the other street running west ends at the little lake between the house of the bishop and other non commercial people I had soon explored these melancholy ways here and there I got a glimpse of faded turf looking like a worn out bit of carpet or some appearance of a kitchen garden the sparse vegetables of which potatoes cabbages and lettuces would have figured appropriately upon a Lilliputian table A few sickly wallflowers were trying to enjoy the air and sunshine About the middle of the tin commercial street I found the public cemetery inclosed with a mud wall and where there seemed plenty of room Then a few steps brought me to the Governor s house a but compared with the town hall of Hamburg a palace in comparison with the cabins of the Icelandic population Between the little lake and the town the church is built in the Protestant style of calcined stones extracted out of the volcanoes by their own labour and at their own expense in high westerly winds it was manifest that the red tiles of the roof would be scattered in the air to the great danger of the faithful worshippers On a neighbouring hill I perceived the national school where as I was informed later by our host were taught Hebrew English French and Danish four languages of which with shame I confess it I don t know a single word after an examination I should have had to stand last of the forty scholars educated at this little college and I should have been held unworthy to sleep along with them in one of those little double closets where more delicate youths would have died of suffocation the very first night In three hours I had seen not only the town but its environs The general aspect was wonderfully dull No trees and scarcely any vegetation Everywhere bare rocks signs of volcanic action The Icelandic huts are made of earth and turf and the walls slope inward they rather resemble roofs placed on the ground But then these roofs are meadows of comparative fertility Thanks to the internal heat the grass grows on them to some degree of perfection It is carefully mown in the hay season if it were not the horses would come to pasture on these green abodes In my excursion I met but few people On returning to the main street I found the greater part of the population busied in drying salting and putting on board codfish their chief export The men looked like robust but heavy blond Germans with pensive eyes conscious of being far removed from their fellow creatures poor exiles relegated to this land of ice poor creatures who should have been Esquimaux since nature had condemned them to live only just outside the arctic circle In vain did I try to detect a smile upon their lips sometimes by a spasmodic and involuntary contraction of the muscles they seemed to laugh but they never smiled Their costume consisted of a coarse jacket of black woollen cloth called in Scandinavian lands a vadmel a hat with a very broad brim trousers with a narrow edge of red and a bit of leather rolled round the foot for shoes The women looked as sad and as resigned as the men their faces were agreeable but expressionless and they wore gowns and petticoats of dark vadmel as maidens they wore over their braided hair a little knitted brown cap when married they put around their heads a coloured handkerchief crowned with a peak of white linen After a good walk I returned to M Fridrikssen s house where I found my uncle already in his host s company CHAPTER X INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH ICELANDIC SAVANTS Dinner was ready Professor Liedenbrock devoured his portion voraciously for his compulsory fast on board had converted his stomach into a vast unfathomable gulf There was nothing remarkable in the meal itself but the hospitality of our host more Danish than Icelandic reminded me of the heroes of old It was evident that we were more at home than he was himself The conversation was carried on in the vernacular tongue which my uncle mixed with German and M Fridrikssen with Latin for my benefit It turned upon scientific questions as befits philosophers but Professor Liedenbrock was excessively reserved and at every sentence spoke to me with his eyes enjoining the most absolute silence upon our plans In the first place M Fridrikssen wanted to know what success my uncle had had at the library Your library why there is nothing but a few tattered books upon almost deserted shelves Indeed replied M Fridrikssen why we possess eight thousand volumes many of them valuable and scarce works in the old Scandinavian language and we have all the novelties that Copenhagen sends us every year Where do you keep your eight thousand volumes For my part Oh M Liedenbrock they are all over the country In this icy region we are fond of study There is not a farmer nor a fisherman that cannot read and does not read Our principle is that books instead of growing mouldy behind an iron grating should be worn out under the eyes of many readers Therefore these volumes are passed from one to another read over and over referred to again and again and it often happens that they find their way back to their shelves only after an absence of a year or two And in the meantime said my uncle rather spitefully strangers Well what would you have Foreigners have their libraries at home and the first essential for labouring people is that they should be educated I repeat to you the love of reading runs in Icelandic blood In eighteen sixteen we founded a prosperous literary society learned strangers think themselves honoured in becoming members of it It publishes books which educate our fellow countrymen and do the country great service If you will consent to be a corresponding member Herr Liedenbrock you will be giving us great pleasure My uncle who had already joined about a hundred learned societies accepted with a grace which evidently touched M Fridrikssen Now said he will you be kind enough to tell me what books you hoped to find in our library and I may perhaps enable you to consult them My uncle s eyes and mine met He hesitated This direct question went to the root of the matter But after a moment s reflection he decided on speaking Monsieur Fridrikssen I wished to know if amongst your ancient books you possessed any of the works of Arne Saknussemm Arne Saknussemm replied the Rejkiavik professor You mean that learned sixteenth century savant a naturalist a chemist and a traveller Just so One of the glories of Icelandic literature and science That s the man An illustrious man anywhere Quite so And whose courage was equal to his genius I see that you know him well My uncle was bathed in delight at hearing his hero thus described He feasted his eyes upon M Fridrikssen s face Well he cried where are his works His works we have them not What not in Iceland They are neither in Iceland nor anywhere else Why is that Because Arne Saknussemm was persecuted for heresy and in fifteen seventy three his books were burned by the hands of the common hangman Very good Excellent cried my uncle to the great scandal of the professor of natural history What he cried Yes yes now it is all clear now it is all unravelled and I see why Saknussemm put into the Index Expurgatorius and compelled to hide the discoveries made by his genius was obliged to bury in an incomprehensible cryptogram the secret What secret asked M Fridrikssen starting Oh just a secret which my uncle stammered Have you some private document in your possession asked our host No I was only supposing a case Oh very well answered M Fridrikssen who was kind enough not to pursue the subject when he had noticed the embarrassment of his friend I hope you will not leave our island until you have seen some of its mineralogical wealth Certainly replied my uncle but I am rather late or have not others been here before me Yes Herr Liedenbrock the labours of MM Olafsen and Povelsen pursued by order of the king the researches of Troil the scientific mission of MM Gaimard and Robert on the French corvette La Recherche one and lately the observations of scientific men who came in the Reine Hortense have added materially to our knowledge of Iceland But I assure you there is plenty left Do you think so said my uncle pretending to look very modest and trying to hide the curiosity was flashing out of his eyes Oh yes how many mountains glaciers and volcanoes there are to study which are as yet but imperfectly known Then without going any further that mountain in the horizon That is Snaefell Ah said my uncle as coolly as he was able is that Snaefell Yes one of the most curious volcanoes and the crater of which has scarcely ever been visited Is it extinct Oh yes more than five hundred years Well replied my uncle who was frantically locking his legs together to keep himself from jumping up in the air that is where I mean to begin my geological studies there on that Seffel Fessel what do you call it Snaefell replied the excellent M Fridrikssen This part of the conversation was in Latin I had understood every word of it and I could hardly conceal my amusement at seeing my uncle trying to keep down the excitement and satisfaction which were brimming over in every limb and every feature He tried hard to put on an innocent little expression of simplicity but it looked like a diabolical grin one Recherche was sent out in eighteen thirty five by Admiral Duperre to learn the fate of the lost expedition of M de Blosseville in the Lilloise which has never been heard of Yes said he your words decide me We will try to scale that Snaefell perhaps even we may pursue our studies in its crater I am very sorry said M Fridrikssen that my engagements will not allow me to absent myself or I would have accompanied you myself with both pleasure and profit Oh no no replied my uncle with great animation we would not disturb any one for the world M Fridrikssen Still I thank you with all my heart the company of such a talented man would have been very serviceable but the duties of your profession I am glad to think that our host in the innocence of his Icelandic soul was blind to the transparent artifices of my uncle I very much approve of your beginning with that volcano M Liedenbrock You will gather a harvest of interesting observations But tell me how do you expect to get to the peninsula of Snaefell By sea crossing the bay That s the most direct way No doubt but it is impossible Why Because we don t possess a single boat at Rejkiavik You don t mean to say so You will have to go by land following the shore It will be longer but more interesting Very well then and now I shall have to see about a guide I have one to offer you A safe intelligent man Yes an inhabitant of that peninsula He is an eider down hunter and very clever He speaks Danish perfectly When can I see him To morrow if you like Why not to day Because he won t be here till to morrow To morrow then added my uncle with a sigh This momentous conversation ended in a few minutes with warm acknowledgments paid by the German to the Icelandic Professor At this dinner my uncle had just elicited important facts amongst others the history of Saknussemm the reason of the mysterious document that his host would not accompany him in his expedition and that the very next day a guide would be waiting upon him CHAPTER XI A GUIDE FOUND TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH In the evening I took a short walk on the beach and returned at night to my plank bed where I slept soundly all night When I awoke I heard my uncle talking at a great rate in the next room I immediately dressed and joined him He was conversing in the Danish language with a tall man of robust build This fine fellow must have been possessed of great strength His eyes set in a large and ingenuous face seemed to me very intelligent they were of a dreamy sea blue Long hair which would have been called red even in England fell in long meshes upon his broad shoulders The movements of this native were lithe and supple but he made little use of his arms in speaking like a man who knew nothing or cared nothing about the language of gestures His whole appearance bespoke perfect calmness and self possession not indolence but tranquillity It was felt at once that he would be beholden to nobody that he worked for his own convenience and that nothing in this world could astonish or disturb his philosophic calmness I caught the shades of this Icelander s character by the way in which he listened to the impassioned flow of words which fell from the Professor He stood with arms crossed perfectly unmoved by my uncle s incessant gesticulations A negative was expressed by a slow movement of the head from left to right an affirmative by a slight bend so slight that his long hair scarcely moved He carried economy of motion even to parsimony Certainly I should never have dreamt in looking at this man that he was a hunter he did not look likely to frighten his game nor did he seem as if he would even get near it But the mystery was explained when M Fridrikssen informed me that this tranquil personage was only a hunter of the eider duck whose under plumage constitutes the chief wealth of the island This is the celebrated eider down and it requires no great rapidity of movement to get it Early in summer the female a very pretty bird goes to build her nest among the rocks of the fiords with which the coast is fringed After building the nest she feathers it with down plucked from her own breast Immediately the hunter or rather the trader comes and robs the nest and the female recommences her work This goes on as long as she has any down left When she has stripped herself bare the male takes his turn to pluck himself But as the coarse and hard plumage of the male has no commercial value the hunter does not take the trouble to rob the nest of this the female therefore lays her eggs in the spoils of her mate the young are hatched and next year the harvest begins again Now as the eider duck does not select steep cliffs for her nest but rather the smooth terraced rocks which slope to the sea the Icelandic hunter might exercise his calling without any inconvenient exertion He was a farmer who was not obliged either to sow or reap his harvest but merely to gather it in This grave phlegmatic and silent individual was called Hans Bjelke and he came recommended by M Fridrikssen He was our future guide His manners were a singular contrast with my uncle s Nevertheless they soon came to understand each other Neither looked at the amount of the payment the one was ready to accept whatever was offered the other was ready to give whatever was demanded Never was bargain more readily concluded The result of the treaty was that Hans engaged on his part to conduct us to the village of Stapi on the south shore of the Snaefell peninsula at the very foot of the volcano By land this would be about twenty two miles to be done said my uncle in two days But when he learnt that the Danish mile was twenty four thousand feet long he was obliged to modify his calculations and allow seven or eight days for the march Four horses were to be placed at our disposal two to carry him and me two for the baggage Hams as was his custom would go on foot He knew all that part of the coast perfectly and promised to take us the shortest way His engagement was not to terminate with our arrival at Stapi he was to continue in my uncle s service for the whole period of his scientific researches for the remuneration of three rixdales a week about twelve shillings but it was an express article of the covenant that his wages should be counted out to him every Saturday at six o clock in the evening which according to him was one indispensable part of the engagement The start was fixed for the sixteenth of June My uncle wanted to pay the hunter a portion in advance but he refused with one word Efter said he After said the Professor for my edification The treaty concluded Hans silently withdrew A famous fellow cried my uncle but he little thinks of the marvellous part he has to play in the future So he is to go with us as far as As far as the centre of the earth Axel Forty eight hours were left before our departure to my great regret I had to employ them in preparations for all our ingenuity was required to pack every article to the best advantage instruments here arms there tools in this package provisions in that four sets of packages in all The instruments were one An Eigel s centigrade thermometer graduated up to one hundred fifty degrees three hundred two degrees Fahr which seemed to me too much or too little Too much if the internal heat was to rise so high for in this case we should be baked not enough to measure the temperature of springs or any matter in a state of fusion two An aneroid barometer to indicate extreme pressures of the atmosphere An ordinary barometer would not have answered the purpose as the pressure would increase during our descent to a point which the mercurial barometer one would not register three A chronometer made by Boissonnas jun of Geneva accurately set to the meridian of Hamburg four Two compasses viz a common compass and a dipping needle five A night glass six Two of Ruhmkorff s apparatus which by means of an electric current supplied a safe and handy portable light two The arms consisted of two of Purdy s rifles and two brace of pistols But what did we want arms for We had neither savages nor wild beasts to fear I supposed But my uncle seemed to believe in his arsenal as in his instruments and more especially in a considerable quantity of gun cotton which is unaffected by moisture and the explosive force of which exceeds that of gunpowder one In M Verne s book a manometer is the instrument used of which very little is known In a complete list of philosophical instruments the translator cannot find the name As he is assured by a first rate instrument maker Chadburn of Liverpool that an aneroid can be constructed to measure any depth he has thought it best to furnish the adventurous professor with this more familiar instrument The manometer is generally known as a pressure gauge TRANS two Ruhmkorff s apparatus consists of a Bunsen pile worked with bichromate of potash which makes no smell an induction coil carries the electricity generated by the pile into communication with a lantern of peculiar construction in this lantern there is a spiral glass tube from which the air has been excluded and in which remains only a residuum of carbonic acid gas or of nitrogen When the apparatus is put in action this gas becomes luminous producing a white steady light The pile and coil are placed in a leathern bag which the traveller carries over his shoulders the lantern outside of the bag throws sufficient light into deep darkness it enables one to venture without fear of explosions into the midst of the most inflammable gases and is not extinguished even in the deepest waters M Ruhmkorff is a learned and most ingenious man of science his great discovery is his induction coil which produces a powerful stream of electricity He obtained in eighteen sixty four the quinquennial prize of fifty thousand franc reserved by the French government for the most ingenious application of electricity The tools comprised two pickaxes two spades a silk ropeladder three iron tipped sticks a hatchet a hammer a dozen wedges and iron spikes and a long knotted rope Now this was a large load for the ladder was three hundred feet long And there were provisions too this was not a large parcel but it was comforting to know that of essence of beef and biscuits there were six months consumption Spirits were the only liquid and of water we took none but we had flasks and my uncle depended on springs from which to fill them Whatever objections I hazarded as to their quality temperature and even absence remained ineffectual To complete the exact inventory of all our travelling accompaniments I must not forget a pocket medicine chest containing blunt scissors splints for broken limbs a piece of tape of unbleached linen bandages and compresses lint a lancet for bleeding all dreadful articles to take with one Then there was a row of phials containing dextrine alcoholic ether liquid acetate of lead vinegar and ammonia drugs which afforded me no comfort Finally all the articles needful to supply Ruhmkorff s apparatus My uncle did not forget a supply of tobacco coarse grained powder and amadou nor a leathern belt in which he carried a sufficient quantity of gold silver and paper money Six pairs of boots and shoes made waterproof with a composition of indiarubber and naphtha were packed amongst the tools Clothed shod and equipped like this said my uncle there is no telling how far we may go The fourteenth was wholly spent in arranging all our different articles In the evening we dined with Baron Tramps the mayor of Rejkiavik and doctor Hyaltalin the first medical man of the place being of the party M Fridrikssen was not there I learned afterwards that he and the Governor disagreed upon some question of administration and did not speak to each other I therefore knew not a single word of all that was said at this semi official dinner but I could not help noticing that my uncle talked the whole time On the fifteenth our preparations were all made Our host gave the Professor very great pleasure by presenting him with a map of Iceland far more complete than that of Hendersen It was the map of M Olaf Nikolas Olsen in the proportion of one to four hundred eighty thousand of the actual size of the island and published by the Icelandic Literary Society It was a precious document for a mineralogist Our last evening was spent in intimate conversation with M Fridrikssen with whom I felt the liveliest sympathy then after the talk succeeded for me at any rate a disturbed and restless night At five in the morning I was awoke by the neighing and pawing of four horses under my window I dressed hastily and came down into the street Hans was finishing our packing almost as it were without moving a limb and yet he did his work cleverly My uncle made more noise than execution and the guide seemed to pay very little attention to his energetic directions At six o clock our preparations were over M Fridrikssen shook hands with us My uncle thanked him heartily for his extreme kindness I constructed a few fine Latin sentences to express my cordial farewell Then we bestrode our steeds and with his last adieu M Fridrikssen treated me to a line of Virgil eminently applicable to such uncertain wanderers as we were likely to be Et quacumque viam dedent fortuna sequamur Therever fortune clears a way Thither our ready footsteps stray CHAPTER XII A BARREN LAND We had started under a sky overcast but calm There was no fear of heat none of disastrous rain It was just the weather for tourists The pleasure of riding on horseback over an unknown country made me easy to be pleased at our first start I threw myself wholly into the pleasure of the trip and enjoyed the feeling of freedom and satisfied desire I was beginning to take a real share in the enterprise Besides I said to myself where s the risk Here we are travelling all through a most interesting country We are about to climb a very remarkable mountain at the worst we are going to scramble down an extinct crater It is evident that Saknussemm did nothing more than this As for a passage leading to the centre of the globe it is mere rubbish perfectly impossible Very well then let us get all the good we can out of this expedition and don t let us haggle about the chances This reasoning having settled my mind we got out of Rejkiavik Hans moved steadily on keeping ahead of us at an even smooth and rapid pace The baggage horses followed him without giving any trouble Then came my uncle and myself looking not so very ill mounted on our small but hardy animals Iceland is one of the largest islands in Europe Its surface is fourteen thousand square miles and it contains but sixteen thousand inhabitants Geographers have divided it into four quarters and we were crossing diagonally the south west quarter called the Sudvester Fjordungr On leaving Rejkiavik Hans took us by the seashore We passed lean pastures which were trying very hard but in vain to look green yellow came out best The rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks presented faint outlines on the eastern horizon at times a few patches of snow concentrating the vague light glittered upon the slopes of the distant mountains certain peaks boldly uprising passed through the grey clouds and reappeared above the moving mists like breakers emerging in the heavens Often these chains of barren rocks made a dip towards the sea and encroached upon the scanty pasturage but there was always enough room to pass Besides our horses instinctively chose the easiest places without ever slackening their pace My uncle was refused even the satisfaction of stirring up his beast with whip or voice He had no excuse for being impatient I could not help smiling to see so tall a man on so small a pony and as his long legs nearly touched the ground he looked like a six legged centaur Good horse good horse he kept saying You will see Axel that there is no more sagacious animal than the Icelandic horse He is stopped by neither snow nor storm nor impassable roads nor rocks glaciers or anything He is courageous sober and surefooted He never makes a false step never shies If there is a river or fiord to cross and we shall meet with many you will see him plunge in at once just as if he were amphibious and gain the opposite bank But we must not hurry him we must let him have his way and we shall get on at the rate of thirty miles a day We may but how about our guide Oh never mind him People like him get over the ground without a thought There is so little action in this man that he will never get tired and besides if he wants it he shall have my horse I shall get cramped if I don t have a little action The arms are all right but the legs want exercise We were advancing at a rapid pace The country was already almost a desert Here and there was a lonely farm called a boer built either of wood or of sods or of pieces of lava looking like a poor beggar by the wayside These ruinous huts seemed to solicit charity from passers by and on very small provocation we should have given alms for the relief of the poor inmates In this country there were no roads and paths and the poor vegetation however slow would soon efface the rare travellers footsteps Yet this part of the province at a very small distance from the capital is reckoned among the inhabited and cultivated portions of Iceland What then must other tracts be more desert than this desert In the first half mile we had not seen one farmer standing before his cabin door nor one shepherd tending a flock less wild than himself nothing but a few cows and sheep left to themselves What then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were advancing regions subject to the dire phenomena of eruptions the offspring of volcanic explosions and subterranean convulsions We were to know them before long but on consulting Olsen s map I saw that they would be avoided by winding along the seashore In fact the great plutonic action is confined to the central portion of the island there rocks of the trappean and volcanic class including trachyte basalt and tuffs and agglomerates associated with streams of lava have made this a land of supernatural horrors I had no idea of the spectacle which was awaiting us in the peninsula of Snaefell where these ruins of a fiery nature have formed a frightful chaos In two hours from Rejkiavik we arrived at the burgh of Gufunes called Aolkirkja or principal church There was nothing remarkable here but a few houses scarcely enough for a German hamlet Hans stopped here half an hour He shared with us our frugal breakfast answering my uncle s questions about the road and our resting place that night with merely yes or no except when he said Gardaer I consulted the map to see where Gardaer was I saw there was a small town of that name on the banks of the Hvalfiord four miles from Rejkiavik I showed it to my uncle Four miles only he exclaimed four miles out of twenty eight What a nice little walk He was about to make an observation to the guide who without answering resumed his place at the head and went on his way Three hours later still treading on the colourless grass of the pasture land we had to work round the Kolla fiord a longer way but an easier one than across that inlet We soon entered into a pingstaoer or parish called Ejulberg from whose steeple twelve o clock would have struck if Icelandic churches were rich enough to possess clocks But they are like the parishioners who have no watches and do without There our horses were baited then taking the narrow path to left between a chain of hills and the sea they carried us to our next stage the aolkirkja of Brantaer and one mile farther on to Saurboer Annexia a chapel of ease built on the south shore of the Hvalfiord It was now four o clock and we had gone four Icelandic miles or twenty four English miles In that place the fiord was at least three English miles wide the waves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharp pointed rocks this inlet was confined between walls of rock precipices crowned by sharp peaks two thousand feet high and remarkable for the brown strata which separated the beds of reddish tuff However much I might respect the intelligence of our quadrupeds I hardly cared to put it to the test by trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea If they are as intelligent as they are said to be I thought they won t try it In any case I will tax my intelligence to direct theirs But my uncle would not wait He spurred on to the edge His steed lowered his head to examine the nearest waves and stopped My uncle who had an instinct of his own too applied pressure and was again refused by the animal significantly shaking his head Then followed strong language and the whip but the brute answered these arguments with kicks and endeavours to throw his rider At last the clever little pony with a bend of his knees started from under the Professor s legs and left him standing upon two boulders on the shore just like the colossus of Rhodes Confounded brute cried the unhorsed horseman suddenly degraded into a pedestrian just as ashamed as a cavalry officer degraded to a foot soldier Faerja said the guide touching his shoulder What a boat Der replied Hans pointing to one Yes I cried there is a boat Why did not you say so then Well let us go on Tidvatten said the guide What is he saying He says tide said my uncle translating the Danish word No doubt we must wait for the tide Foerbida said my uncle Ja replied Hans My uncle stamped with his foot while the horses went on to the boat I perfectly understood the necessity of abiding a particular moment of the tide to undertake the crossing of the fiord when the sea having reached its greatest height it should be slack water Then the ebb and flow have no sensible effect and the boat does not risk being carried either to the bottom or out to sea That favourable moment arrived only with six o clock when my uncle myself the guide two other passengers and the four horses trusted ourselves to a somewhat fragile raft Accustomed as I was to the swift and sure steamers on the Elbe I found the oars of the rowers rather a slow means of propulsion It took us more than an hour to cross the fiord but the passage was effected without any mishap In another half hour we had reached the aolkirkja of Gardaer

none	none	HOSPITALITY UNDER THE ARCTIC CIRCLE It ought to have been night time but under the sixty fifth parallel there was nothing surprising in the nocturnal polar light In Iceland during the months of June and July the sun does not set 
882_123266_000005_000000	train-clean-360	But the temperature was much lower 
882_123266_000005_000001	train-clean-360	I was cold and more hungry than cold 
none	none	Welcome was the sight of the boer which was hospitably opened to receive us 
882_123266_000006_000000	train-clean-360	It was a peasant s house but in point of hospitality it was equal to a king s 
none	none	On our arrival the master came with outstretched hands and without more ceremony he beckoned us to follow him To accompany him down the long narrow dark passage would have been impossible 
882_123266_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore we followed as he bid us 
none	none	The building was constructed of roughly squared timbers with rooms on both sides four in number all opening out into the one passage these were the kitchen the weaving shop the badstofa or family sleeping room and the visitors room which was the best of all My uncle whose height had not been thought of in building the house of course hit his head several times against the beams that projected from the ceilings We were introduced into our apartment a large room with a floor of earth stamped hard down and lighted by a window the panes of which were formed of sheep s bladder not admitting too much light The sleeping accommodation consisted of dry litter thrown into two wooden frames painted red and ornamented with Icelandic sentences 
882_123266_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I was hardly expecting so much comfort the only discomfort proceeded from the strong odour of dried fish hung meat and sour milk of which my nose made bitter complaints 
none	none	When we had laid aside our travelling wraps the voice of the host was heard inviting us to the kitchen the only room where a fire was lighted even in the severest cold 
882_123266_000010_000000	train-clean-360	My uncle lost no time in obeying the friendly call nor was I slack in following 
none	none	The kitchen chimney was constructed on the ancient pattern in the middle of the room was a stone for a hearth over it in the roof a hole to let the smoke escape The kitchen was also a dining room At our entrance the host as if he had never seen us greeted us with the word Saellvertu which means be happy and came and kissed us on the cheek 
882_123266_000013_000000	train-clean-360	After him his wife pronounced the same words accompanied with the same ceremonial then the two placing their hands upon their hearts inclined profoundly before us 
none	none	I hasten to inform the reader that this Icelandic lady was the mother of nineteen children all big and little swarming in the midst of the dense wreaths of smoke with which the fire on the hearth filled the chamber Every moment I noticed a fair haired and rather melancholy face peeping out of the rolling volumes of smoke they were a perfect cluster of unwashed angels 
882_123266_000015_000000	train-clean-360	My uncle and I treated this little tribe with kindness and in a very short time we each had three or four of these brats on our shoulders as many on our laps and the rest between our knees 
none	none	Those who could speak kept repeating Saellvertu in every conceivable tone those that could not speak made up for that want by shrill cries 
882_123266_000016_000000	train-clean-360	This concert was brought to a close by the announcement of dinner 
none	none	At that moment our hunter returned who had been seeing his horses provided for that is to say he had economically let them loose in the fields where the poor beasts had to content themselves with the scanty moss they could pull off the rocks and a few meagre sea weeds and the next day they would not fail to come of themselves and resume the labours of the previous day Saellvertu said Hans 
882_123266_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Then calmly automatically and dispassionately he kissed the host the hostess and their nineteen children 
none	none	This ceremony over we sat at table twenty four in number and therefore one upon another 
882_123266_000019_000001	train-clean-360	The luckiest had only two urchins upon their knees 
none	none	But silence reigned in all this little world at the arrival of the soup and the national taciturnity resumed its empire even over the children The host served out to us a soup made of lichen and by no means unpleasant then an immense piece of dried fish floating in butter rancid with twenty years keeping and therefore according to Icelandic gastronomy much preferable to fresh butter Along with this we had skye a sort of clotted milk with biscuits and a liquid prepared from juniper berries for beverage we had a thin milk mixed with water called in this country blanda It is not for me to decide whether this diet is wholesome or not all I can say is that I was desperately hungry and that at dessert I swallowed to the very last gulp of a thick broth made from buckwheat As soon as the meal was over the children disappeared and their elders gathered round the peat fire which also burnt such miscellaneous fuel as briars cow dung and fishbones 
882_123266_000021_000001	train-clean-360	After this little pinch of warmth the different groups retired to their respective rooms 
none	none	Our hostess hospitably offered us her assistance in undressing according to Icelandic usage but on our gracefully declining she insisted no longer and I was able at last to curl myself up in my mossy bed 
882_123266_000022_000000	train-clean-360	At five next morning we bade our host farewell my uncle with difficulty persuading him to accept a proper remuneration and Hans signalled the start 
none	none	At a hundred yards from Gardaer the soil began to change its aspect it became boggy and less favourable to progress 
882_123266_000023_000001	train-clean-360	On our right the chain of mountains was indefinitely prolonged like an immense system of natural fortifications of which we were following the counter scarp or lesser steep often we were met by streams which we had to ford with great care not to wet our packages 
none	none	The desert became wider and more hideous yet from time to time we seemed to descry a human figure that fled at our approach sometimes a sharp turn would bring us suddenly within a short distance of one of these spectres and I was filled with loathing at the sight of a huge deformed head the skin shining and hairless and repulsive sores visible through the gaps in the poor creature s wretched rags The unhappy being forbore to approach us and offer his misshapen hand He fled away but not before Hans had saluted him with the customary Saellvertu Spetelsk said he A leper my uncle repeated 
882_123266_000028_000000	train-clean-360	This word produced a repulsive effect 
882_123266_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The horrible disease of leprosy is too common in Iceland it is not contagious but hereditary and lepers are forbidden to marry 
none	none	These apparitions were not cheerful and did not throw any charm over the less and less attractive landscapes 
882_123266_000029_000001	train-clean-360	The last tufts of grass had disappeared from beneath our feet 
882_123266_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Not a tree was to be seen unless we except a few dwarf birches as low as brushwood 
none	none	Not an animal but a few wandering ponies that their owners would not feed 
882_123266_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Sometimes we could see a hawk balancing himself on his wings under the grey cloud and then darting away south with rapid flight 
none	none	I felt melancholy under this savage aspect of nature and my thoughts went away to the cheerful scenes I had left in the far south 
882_123266_000030_000000	train-clean-360	We had to cross a few narrow fiords and at last quite a wide gulf the tide then high allowed us to pass over without delay and to reach the hamlet of Alftanes one mile beyond 
none	none	That evening after having forded two rivers full of trout and pike called Alfa and Heta we were obliged to spend the night in a deserted building worthy to be haunted by all the elfins of Scandinavia 
882_123266_000031_000001	train-clean-360	The ice king certainly held court here and gave us all night long samples of what he could do 
882_123266_000032_000000	train-clean-360	No particular event marked the next day 
882_123266_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Bogs dead levels melancholy desert tracks wherever we travelled 
none	none	By nightfall we had accomplished half our journey and we lay at Kroesolbt On the nineteenth of June for about a mile that is an Icelandic mile we walked upon hardened lava this ground is called in the country hraun the writhen surface presented the appearance of distorted twisted cables sometimes stretched in length sometimes contorted together an immense torrent once liquid now solid ran from the nearest mountains now extinct volcanoes but the ruins around revealed the violence of the past eruptions 
882_123266_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Yet here and there were a few jets of steam from hot springs 
882_123266_000034_000000	train-clean-360	We had no time to watch these phenomena we had to proceed on our way 
none	none	Soon at the foot of the mountains the boggy land reappeared intersected by little lakes Our route now lay westward we had turned the great bay of Faxa and the twin peaks of Snaefell rose white into the cloudy sky at the distance of at least five miles 
882_123266_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The horses did their duty well no difficulties stopped them in their steady career 
882_123266_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I was getting tired but my uncle was as firm and straight as he was at our first start 
882_123266_000035_000002	train-clean-360	I could not help admiring his persistency as well as the hunter s who treated our expedition like a mere promenade 
882_123266_000036_000000	train-clean-360	June twenty 
882_123266_000036_000001	train-clean-360	At six p m we reached Buedir a village on the sea shore and the guide there claiming his due my uncle settled with him 
none	none	It was Hans own family that is his uncles and cousins who gave us hospitality we were kindly received and without taxing too much the goodness of these folks I would willingly have tarried here to recruit after my fatigues But my uncle who wanted no recruiting would not hear of it and the next morning we had to bestride our beasts again 
882_123266_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The soil told of the neighbourhood of the mountain whose granite foundations rose from the earth like the knotted roots of some huge oak 
882_123266_000037_000001	train-clean-360	We were rounding the immense base of the volcano 
882_123266_000037_000002	train-clean-360	The Professor hardly took his eyes off it 
none	none	He tossed up his arms and seemed to defy it and to declare There stands the giant that I shall conquer After about four hours walking the horses stopped of their own accord at the door of the priest s house at Stapi CHAPTER XIV BUT ARCTICS CAN BE INHOSPITABLE TOO Stapi is a village consisting of about thirty huts built of lava at the south side of the base of the volcano 
882_123267_000002_000001	train-clean-360	It extends along the inner edge of a small fiord inclosed between basaltic walls of the strangest construction 
882_123267_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Basalt is a brownish rock of igneous origin 
none	none	It assumes regular forms the arrangement of which is often very surprising 
882_123267_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Here nature had done her work geometrically with square and compass and plummet Everywhere else her art consists alone in throwing down huge masses together in disorder 
none	none	You see cones imperfectly formed irregular pyramids with a fantastic disarrangement of lines but here as if to exhibit an example of regularity though in advance of the very earliest architects she has created a severely simple order of architecture never surpassed either by the splendours of Babylon or the wonders of Greece 
882_123267_000004_000000	train-clean-360	I had heard of the Giant s Causeway in Ireland and Fingal s Cave in Staffa one of the Hebrides but I had never yet seen a basaltic formation 
882_123267_000005_000000	train-clean-360	At Stapi I beheld this phenomenon in all its beauty 
882_123267_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The wall that confined the fiord like all the coast of the peninsula was composed of a series of vertical columns thirty feet high 
882_123267_000006_000001	train-clean-360	These straight shafts of fair proportions supported an architrave of horizontal slabs the overhanging portion of which formed a semi arch over the sea 
882_123267_000006_000002	train-clean-360	At intervals under this natural shelter there spread out vaulted entrances in beautiful curves into which the waves came dashing with foam and spray 
882_123267_000006_000003	train-clean-360	A few shafts of basalt torn from their hold by the fury of tempests lay along the soil like remains of an ancient temple in ruins for ever fresh and over which centuries passed without leaving a trace of age upon them 
882_123267_000007_000000	train-clean-360	This was our last stage upon the earth 
882_123267_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Hans had exhibited great intelligence and it gave me some little comfort to think then that he was not going to leave us 
none	none	On arriving at the door of the rector s house which was not different from the others I saw a man shoeing a horse hammer in hand and with a leathern apron on Saellvertu said the hunter God dag said the blacksmith in good Danish Kyrkoherde said Hans turning round to my uncle
882_123267_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 The rector repeated the Professor 
882_123267_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 It seems Axel that this good man is the rector 
none	none	Our guide in the meanwhile was making the kyrkoherde aware of the position of things when the latter suspending his labours for a moment uttered a sound no doubt understood between horses and farriers and immediately a tall and ugly hag appeared from the hut She must have been six feet at the least 
882_123267_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I was in great alarm lest she should treat me to the Icelandic kiss but there was no occasion to fear nor did she do the honours at all too gracefully 
none	none	The visitors room seemed to me the worst in the whole cabin 
882_123267_000014_000001	train-clean-360	It was close dirty and evil smelling 
none	none	But we had to be content The rector did not to go in for antique hospitality 
882_123267_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Very far from it 
882_123267_000014_000005	train-clean-360	Before the day was over I saw that we had to do with a blacksmith a fisherman a hunter a joiner but not at all with a minister of the Gospel 
none	none	To be sure it was a week day perhaps on a Sunday he made amends I don t mean to say anything against these poor priests who after all are very wretched They receive from the Danish Government a ridiculously small pittance and they get from the parish the fourth part of the tithe which does not come to sixty marks a year about Lfour 
882_123267_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Hence the necessity to work for their livelihood but after fishing hunting and shoeing horses for any length of time one soon gets into the ways and manners of fishermen hunters and farriers and other rather rude and uncultivated people and that evening I found out that temperance was not among the virtues that distinguished my host 
none	none	My uncle soon discovered what sort of a man he had to do with instead of a good and learned man he found a rude and coarse peasant He therefore resolved to commence the grand expedition at once and to leave this inhospitable parsonage He cared nothing about fatigue and resolved to spend some days upon the mountain The preparations for our departure were therefore made the very day after our arrival at Stapi Hans hired the services of three Icelanders to do the duty of the horses in the transport of the burdens but as soon as we had arrived at the crater these natives were to turn back and leave us to our own devices 
882_123267_000017_000002	train-clean-360	This was to be clearly understood 
none	none	My uncle now took the opportunity to explain to Hans that it was his intention to explore the interior of the volcano to its farthest limits 
882_123267_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Hans merely nodded 
none	none	There or elsewhere down in the bowels of the earth or anywhere on the surface all was alike to him 
882_123267_000019_000002	train-clean-360	For my own part the incidents of the journey had hitherto kept me amused and made me forgetful of coming evils but now my fears again were beginning to get the better of me 
882_123267_000019_000003	train-clean-360	But what could I do 
887_123290_000012_000000	train-clean-100	what could I do 
882_123267_000019_000004	train-clean-360	The place to resist the Professor would have been Hamburg not the foot of Snaefell 
882_123267_000020_000000	train-clean-360	One thought above all others harassed and alarmed me it was one calculated to shake firmer nerves than mine 
882_123267_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Now thought I here we are about to climb Snaefell 
none	none	Very good 
882_123267_000021_000002	train-clean-360	We will explore the crater 
882_123267_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Very good too others have done as much without dying for it 
882_123267_000021_000004	train-clean-360	But that is not all 
none	none	If there is a way to penetrate into the very bowels of the island if that ill advised Saknussemm has told a true tale we shall lose our way amidst the deep subterranean passages of this volcano 
882_123267_000021_000006	train-clean-360	Now there is no proof that Snaefell is extinct 
882_123267_000021_000007	train-clean-360	Who can assure us that an eruption is not brewing at this very moment 
882_123267_000021_000008	train-clean-360	Does it follow that because the monster has slept since twelve twenty nine he must therefore never awake again 
882_123267_000021_000009	train-clean-360	And if he wakes up presently where shall we be 
882_123267_000022_000000	train-clean-360	It was worth while debating this question and I did debate it 
882_123267_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I could not sleep for dreaming about eruptions 
none	none	Now the part of ejected scoriae and ashes seemed to my mind a very rough one to act 
882_123267_000023_000000	train-clean-360	So at last when I could hold out no longer I resolved to lay the case before my uncle as prudently and as cautiously as possible just under the form of an almost impossible hypothesis 
882_123267_000024_000000	train-clean-360	I went to him 
882_123267_000024_000001	train-clean-360	I communicated my fears to him and drew back a step to give him room for the explosion which I knew must follow 
none	none	But I was mistaken
882_123267_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I was thinking of that 
882_123267_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I was thinking of that he replied with great simplicity 
882_123267_000026_000000	train-clean-360	What could those words mean Was he actually going to listen to reason 
none	none	Was he contemplating the abandonment of his plans 
882_123267_000026_000002	train-clean-360	This was too good to be true 
882_123267_000027_000000	train-clean-360	After a few moments silence during which I dared not question him he resumed 
none	none	I was thinking of that Ever since we arrived at Stapi I have been occupied with the important question you have just opened for we must not be guilty of imprudence
882_123267_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 No indeed I replied with forcible emphasis 
none	none	For six hundred years Snaefell has been dumb but he may speak again Now eruptions are always preceded by certain well known phenomena 
882_123267_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I have therefore examined the natives I have studied external appearances and I can assure you Axel that there will be no eruption 
882_123267_000031_000000	train-clean-360	At this positive affirmation I stood amazed and speechless 
887_123290_000027_000000	train-clean-100	I stood amazed 
none	none	and speechless
882_123267_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t doubt my word said my uncle 
882_123267_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Well follow me 
882_123267_000033_000000	train-clean-360	I obeyed like an automaton 
882_123267_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Coming out from the priest s house the Professor took a straight road which through an opening in the basaltic wall led away from the sea 
882_123267_000033_000002	train-clean-360	We were soon in the open country if one may give that name to a vast extent of mounds of volcanic products 
882_123267_000033_000003	train-clean-360	This tract seemed crushed under a rain of enormous ejected rocks of trap basalt granite and all kinds of igneous rocks 
882_123267_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Here and there I could see puffs and jets of steam curling up into the air called in Icelandic reykir issuing from thermal springs and indicating by their motion the volcanic energy underneath 
882_123267_000034_000001	train-clean-360	This seemed to justify my fears But I fell from the height of my new born hopes when my uncle said 
882_123267_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 You see all these volumes of steam Axel well they demonstrate that we have nothing to fear from the fury of a volcanic eruption 
882_123267_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Am I to believe that I cried 
882_123267_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Understand this clearly added the Professor 
882_123267_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 At the approach of an eruption these jets would redouble their activity but disappear altogether during the period of the eruption 
none	none	For the elastic fluids being no longer under pressure go off by way of the crater instead of escaping by their usual passages through the fissures in the soil Therefore if these vapours remain in their usual condition if they display no augmentation of force and if you add to this the observation that the wind and rain are not ceasing and being replaced by a still and heavy atmosphere then you may affirm that no eruption is preparing But
882_123267_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 No more that is sufficient 
none	none	When science has uttered her voice let babblers hold their peace 
882_123267_000040_000000	train-clean-360	I returned to the parsonage very crestfallen 
882_123267_000040_000001	train-clean-360	My uncle had beaten me with the weapons of science 
882_123267_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Still I had one hope left and this was that when we had reached the bottom of the crater it would be impossible for want of a passage to go deeper in spite of all the Saknussemm s in Iceland 
882_123267_000041_000000	train-clean-360	I spent that whole night in one constant nightmare in the heart of a volcano and from the deepest depths of the earth I saw myself tossed up amongst the interplanetary spaces under the form of an eruptive rock 
882_123267_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The next day June twenty three Hans was awaiting us with his companions carrying provisions tools and instruments two iron pointed sticks two rifles and two shot belts were for my uncle and myself 
882_123267_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Hans as a cautious man had added to our luggage a leathern bottle full of water which with that in our flasks would ensure us a supply of water for eight days 
none	none	It was nine in the morning 
882_123267_000043_000001	train-clean-360	The priest and his tall Megaera were awaiting us at the door 
none	none	We supposed they were standing there to bid us a kind farewell 
882_123267_000043_000003	train-clean-360	But the farewell was put in the unexpected form of a heavy bill in which everything was charged even to the very air we breathed in the pastoral house infected as it was 
882_123267_000043_000004	train-clean-360	This worthy couple were fleecing us just as a Swiss innkeeper might have done and estimated their imperfect hospitality at the highest price 
none	none	My uncle paid without a remark a man who is starting for the centre of the earth need not be particular about a few rix dollars 
882_123267_000045_000000	train-clean-360	This point being settled Hans gave the signal and we soon left Stapi behind us 
882_123268_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XV 
none	none	SNAEFELL AT LAST 
882_123268_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Snaefell is five thousand feet high 
none	none	Its double cone forms the limit of a trachytic belt which stands out distinctly in the mountain system of the island 
882_123268_000004_000002	train-clean-360	From our starting point we could see the two peaks boldly projected against the dark grey sky I could see an enormous cap of snow coming low down upon the giant s brow 
882_123268_000005_000000	train-clean-360	We walked in single file headed by the hunter who ascended by narrow tracks where two could not have gone abreast 
882_123268_000005_000001	train-clean-360	There was therefore no room for conversation 
882_123268_000006_000000	train-clean-360	After we had passed the basaltic wall of the fiord of Stapi we passed over a vegetable fibrous peat bog left from the ancient vegetation of this peninsula 
none	none	The vast quantity of this unworked fuel would be sufficient to warm the whole population of Iceland for a century this vast turbary measured in certain ravines had in many places a depth of seventy feet and presented layers of carbonized remains of vegetation alternating with thinner layers of tufaceous pumice 
882_123268_000007_000000	train-clean-360	As a true nephew of the Professor Liedenbrock and in spite of my dismal prospects I could not help observing with interest the mineralogical curiosities which lay about me as in a vast museum and I constructed for myself a complete geological account of Iceland 
882_123268_000008_000000	train-clean-360	This most curious island has evidently been projected from the bottom of the sea at a comparatively recent date 
882_123268_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Possibly it may still be subject to gradual elevation 
none	none	If this is the case its origin may well be attributed to subterranean fires 
882_123268_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Therefore in this case the theory of Sir Humphry Davy Saknussemm s document and my uncle s theories would all go off in smoke 
882_123268_000008_000004	train-clean-360	This hypothesis led me to examine with more attention the appearance of the surface and I soon arrived at a conclusion as to the nature of the forces which presided at its birth 
none	none	Iceland which is entirely devoid of alluvial soil is wholly composed of volcanic tufa that is to say an agglomeration of porous rocks and stones 
882_123268_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Before the volcanoes broke out it consisted of trap rocks slowly upraised to the level of the sea by the action of central forces 
882_123268_000009_000002	train-clean-360	The internal fires had not yet forced their way through 
none	none	But at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south west to north east through which was gradually forced out the trachyte which was to form a mountain chain 
882_123268_000010_000001	train-clean-360	No violence accompanied this change the matter thrown out was in vast quantities and the liquid material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in extensive plains or in hillocky masses 
none	none	To this period belong the felspar syenites and porphyries But with the help of this outflow the thickness of the crust of the island increased materially and therefore also its powers of resistance It may easily be conceived what vast quantities of elastic gases what masses of molten matter accumulated beneath its solid surface whilst no exit was practicable after the cooling of the trachytic crust 
882_123268_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore a time would come when the elastic and explosive forces of the imprisoned gases would upheave this ponderous cover and drive out for themselves openings through tall chimneys Hence then the volcano would distend and lift up the crust and then burst through a crater suddenly formed at the summit or thinnest part of the volcano 
882_123268_000012_000000	train-clean-360	To the eruption succeeded other volcanic phenomena 
none	none	Through the outlets now made first escaped the ejected basalt of which the plain we had just left presented such marvellous specimens 
882_123268_000012_000002	train-clean-360	We were moving over grey rocks of dense and massive formation which in cooling had formed into hexagonal prisms 
882_123268_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Everywhere around us we saw truncated cones formerly so many fiery mouths 
none	none	After the exhaustion of the basalt the volcano the power of which grew by the extinction of the lesser craters supplied an egress to lava ashes and scoriae of which I could see lengthened screes streaming down the sides of the mountain like flowing hair Such was the succession of phenomena which produced Iceland all arising from the action of internal fire and to suppose that the mass within did not still exist in a state of liquid incandescence was absurd and nothing could surpass the absurdity of fancying that it was possible to reach the earth s centre 
882_123268_000015_000000	train-clean-360	So I felt a little comforted as we advanced to the assault of Snaefell 
882_123268_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The way was growing more and more arduous the ascent steeper and steeper the loose fragments of rock trembled beneath us and the utmost care was needed to avoid dangerous falls 
882_123268_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Hans went on as quietly as if he were on level ground sometimes he disappeared altogether behind the huge blocks then a shrill whistle would direct us on our way to him 
none	none	Sometimes he would halt pick up a few bits of stone build them up into a recognisable form and thus made landmarks to guide us in our way back 
882_123268_000017_000002	train-clean-360	A very wise precaution in itself but as things turned out quite useless 
none	none	Three hours fatiguing march had only brought us to the base of the mountain 
882_123268_000018_000001	train-clean-360	There Hans bid us come to a halt and a hasty breakfast was served out 
882_123268_000018_000002	train-clean-360	My uncle swallowed two mouthfuls at a time to get on faster 
882_123268_000018_000003	train-clean-360	But whether he liked it or not this was a rest as well as a breakfast hour and he had to wait till it pleased our guide to move on which came to pass in an hour 
none	none	The three Icelanders just as taciturn as their comrade the hunter never spoke and ate their breakfasts in silence 
882_123268_000019_000000	train-clean-360	We were now beginning to scale the steep sides of Snaefell 
882_123268_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Its snowy summit by an optical illusion not unfrequent in mountains seemed close to us and yet how many weary hours it took to reach it 
882_123268_000019_000002	train-clean-360	The stones adhering by no soil or fibrous roots of vegetation rolled away from under our feet and rushed down the precipice below with the swiftness of an avalanche 
none	none	At some places the flanks of the mountain formed an angle with the horizon of at least thirty six degrees 
887_123290_000012_000002	train-clean-100	it was impossible 
none	none	to climb them and these stony cliffs had to be tacked round not without great difficulty 
882_123268_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Then we helped each other with our sticks 
none	none	I must admit that my uncle kept as close to me as he could he never lost sight of me and in many straits his arm furnished me with a powerful support 
882_123268_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He himself seemed to possess an instinct for equilibrium for he never stumbled 
882_123268_000021_000002	train-clean-360	The Icelanders though burdened with our loads climbed with the agility of mountaineers 
882_123268_000022_000000	train-clean-360	To judge by the distant appearance of the summit of Snaefell it would have seemed too steep to ascend on our side 
none	none	Fortunately after an hour of fatigue and athletic exercises in the midst of the vast surface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks a kind of staircase appeared unexpectedly which greatly facilitated our ascent 
882_123268_000022_000002	train-clean-360	It was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by the eruptions called sting by the Icelanders 
none	none	If this torrent had not been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the mountain it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands 
882_123268_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Such as it was it did us good service 
882_123268_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The steepness increased but these stone steps allowed us to rise with facility and even with such rapidity that having rested for a moment while my companions continued their ascent I perceived them already reduced by distance to microscopic dimensions 
none	none	At seven we had ascended the two thousand steps of this grand staircase and we had attained a bulge in the mountain a kind of bed on which rested the cone proper of the crater 
882_123268_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Three thousand two hundred feet below us stretched the sea 
none	none	We had passed the limit of perpetual snow which on account of the moisture of the climate is at a greater elevation in Iceland than the high latitude would give reason to suppose The cold was excessively keen The wind was blowing violently 
176_123271_000039_000008	train-clean-360	I was exhausted 
882_123268_000025_000004	train-clean-360	The Professor saw that my limbs were refusing to perform their office and in spite of his impatience he decided on stopping 
882_123268_000025_000005	train-clean-360	He therefore spoke to the hunter who shook his head saying 
none	none	Ofvanfoer It seems we must go higher said my uncle Then he asked Hans for his reason Mistour replied the guide Ja Mistour said one of the Icelanders in a tone of alarm What does that word mean I asked uneasily
882_123268_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Look said my uncle 
882_123268_000033_000000	train-clean-360	I looked down upon the plain 
none	none	An immense column of pulverized pumice sand and dust was rising with a whirling circular motion like a waterspout the wind was lashing it on to that side of Snaefell where we were holding on this dense veil hung across the sun threw a deep shadow over the mountain 
882_123268_000033_000002	train-clean-360	If that huge revolving pillar sloped down it would involve us in its whirling eddies 
882_123268_000033_000003	train-clean-360	This phenomenon which is not unfrequent when the wind blows from the glaciers is called in Icelandic mistour 
none	none	Hastigt hastigt cried our guide 
882_123268_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Without knowing Danish I understood at once that we must follow Hans at the top of our speed 
none	none	He began to circle round the cone of the crater but in a diagonal direction so as to facilitate our progress Presently the dust storm fell upon the mountain which quivered under the shock the loose stones caught with the irresistible blasts of wind flew about in a perfect hail as in an eruption 
882_123268_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Happily we were on the opposite side and sheltered from all harm 
none	none	But for the precaution of our guide our mangled bodies torn and pounded into fragments would have been carried afar like the ruins hurled along by some unknown meteor 
882_123268_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Yet Hans did not think it prudent to spend the night upon the sides of the cone 
none	none	We continued our zigzag climb The fifteen hundred remaining feet took us five hours to clear the circuitous route the diagonal and the counter marches must have measured at least three leagues I could stand it no longer 
882_123268_000036_000004	train-clean-360	I was yielding to the effects of hunger and cold 
882_123268_000036_000005	train-clean-360	The rarefied air scarcely gave play to the action of my lungs 
none	none	At last at eleven in the sunlight night the summit of Snaefell was reached and before going in for shelter into the crater I had time to observe the midnight sun at his lowest point gilding with his pale rays the island that slept at my feet 
176_123269_000000_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XVI 
none	none	BOLDLY DOWN THE CRATER Supper was rapidly devoured and the little company housed themselves as best they could The bed was hard the shelter not very substantial and our position an anxious one at five thousand feet above the sea level 
176_123269_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Yet I slept particularly well it was one of the best nights I had ever had and I did not even dream 
176_123269_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Next morning we awoke half frozen by the sharp keen air but with the light of a splendid sun 
176_123269_000003_000001	train-clean-360	I rose from my granite bed and went out to enjoy the magnificent spectacle that lay unrolled before me 
176_123269_000004_000000	train-clean-360	I stood on the very summit of the southernmost of Snaefell s peaks The range of the eye extended over the whole island 
none	none	By an optical law which obtains at all great heights the shores seemed raised and the centre depressed 
176_123269_000004_000002	train-clean-360	It seemed as if one of Helbesmer s raised maps lay at my feet 
none	none	I could see deep valleys intersecting each other in every direction precipices like low walls lakes reduced to ponds rivers abbreviated into streams 
176_123269_000004_000004	train-clean-360	On my right were numberless glaciers and innumerable peaks some plumed with feathery clouds of smoke 
176_123269_000004_000005	train-clean-360	The undulating surface of these endless mountains crested with sheets of snow reminded one of a stormy sea 
none	none	If I looked westward there the ocean lay spread out in all its magnificence like a mere continuation of those flock like summits 
176_123269_000004_000007	train-clean-360	The eye could hardly tell where the snowy ridges ended and the foaming waves began 
none	none	I was thus steeped in the marvellous ecstasy which all high summits develop in the mind and now without giddiness for I was beginning to be accustomed to these sublime aspects of nature My dazzled eyes were bathed in the bright flood of the solar rays I was forgetting where and who I was to live the life of elves and sylphs the fanciful creation of Scandinavian superstitions 
176_123269_000005_000003	train-clean-360	I felt intoxicated with the sublime pleasure of lofty elevations without thinking of the profound abysses into which I was shortly to be plunged 
176_123269_000005_000004	train-clean-360	But I was brought back to the realities of things by the arrival of Hans and the Professor who joined me on the summit 
176_123269_000006_000000	train-clean-360	My uncle pointed out to me in the far west a light steam or mist a semblance of land which bounded the distant horizon of waters 
176_123269_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Greenland said he 
176_123269_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Greenland I cried 
176_123269_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes we are only thirty five leagues from it and during thaws the white bears borne by the ice fields from the north are carried even into Iceland 
none	none	But never mind that Here we are at the top of Snaefell and here are two peaks one north and one south 
176_123269_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Hans will tell us the name of that on which we are now standing 
176_123269_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The question being put Hans replied 
none	none	Scartaris 
176_123269_000012_000000	train-clean-360	My uncle shot a triumphant glance at me 
176_123269_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Now for the crater he cried 
176_123269_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The crater of Snaefell resembled an inverted cone the opening of which might be half a league in diameter 
176_123269_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Its depth appeared to be about two thousand feet 
176_123269_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Imagine the aspect of such a reservoir brim full and running over with liquid fire amid the rolling thunder 
176_123269_000014_000003	train-clean-360	The bottom of the funnel was about two hundred fifty feet in circuit so that the gentle slope allowed its lower brim to be reached without much difficulty 
176_123269_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Involuntarily I compared the whole crater to an enormous erected mortar and the comparison put me in a terrible fright 
176_123269_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 What madness I thought to go down into a mortar perhaps a loaded mortar to be shot up into the air at a moment s notice 
176_123269_000016_000000	train-clean-360	But I did not try to back out of it 
176_123269_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Hans with perfect coolness resumed the lead and I followed him without a word 
none	none	In order to facilitate the descent Hans wound his way down the cone by a spiral path Our route lay amidst eruptive rocks some of which shaken out of their loosened beds rushed bounding down the abyss and in their fall awoke echoes remarkable for their loud and well defined sharpness 
176_123269_000018_000000	train-clean-360	In certain parts of the cone there were glaciers 
176_123269_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Here Hans advanced only with extreme precaution sounding his way with his iron pointed pole to discover any crevasses in it 
none	none	At particularly dubious passages we were obliged to connect ourselves with each other by a long cord in order that any man who missed his footing might be held up by his companions This solid formation was prudent but did not remove all danger 
176_123269_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Yet notwithstanding the difficulties of the descent down steeps unknown to the guide the journey was accomplished without accidents except the loss of a coil of rope which escaped from the hands of an Icelander and took the shortest way to the bottom of the abyss 
none	none	At mid day we arrived I raised my head and saw straight above me the upper aperture of the cone framing a bit of sky of very small circumference but almost perfectly round 
176_123269_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Just upon the edge appeared the snowy peak of Saris standing out sharp and clear against endless space 
176_123269_000021_000000	train-clean-360	At the bottom of the crater were three chimneys through which in its eruptions Snaefell had driven forth fire and lava from its central furnace 
176_123269_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Each of these chimneys was a hundred feet in diameter 
176_123269_000021_000002	train-clean-360	They gaped before us right in our path 
176_123269_000021_000003	train-clean-360	I had not the courage to look down either of them 
176_123269_000021_000004	train-clean-360	But Professor Liedenbrock had hastily surveyed all three he was panting running from one to the other gesticulating and uttering incoherent expressions 
176_123269_000021_000005	train-clean-360	Hans and his comrades seated upon loose lava rocks looked at him with as much wonder as they knew how to express and perhaps taking him for an escaped lunatic 
176_123269_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly my uncle uttered a cry 
176_123269_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I thought his foot must have slipped and that he had fallen down one of the holes 
176_123269_000022_000002	train-clean-360	But no I saw him with arms outstretched and legs straddling wide apart erect before a granite rock that stood in the centre of the crater just like a pedestal made ready to receive a statue of Pluto 
none	none	He stood like a man stupefied but the stupefaction soon gave way to delirious rapture
176_123269_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Axel Axel he cried 
176_123269_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 Come come 
176_123269_000024_000000	train-clean-360	I ran 
none	none	Hans and the Icelanders never stirred
176_123269_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Look cried the Professor 
176_123269_000026_000000	train-clean-360	And sharing his astonishment but I think not his joy I read on the western face of the block in Runic characters half mouldered away with lapse of ages this thrice accursed name 
176_123269_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 At this point a Runic text appears 
none	none	Arne Saknussemm replied my uncle
176_123269_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you yet doubt 
176_123269_000029_000000	train-clean-360	I made no answer and I returned in silence to my lava seat in a state of utter speechless consternation 
176_123269_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Here was crushing evidence 
176_123269_000030_000000	train-clean-360	How long I remained plunged in agonizing reflections I cannot tell all that I know is that on raising my head again I saw only my uncle and Hans at the bottom of the crater 
176_123269_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The Icelanders had been dismissed and they were now descending the outer slopes of Snaefell to return to Stapi 
176_123269_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Hans slept peaceably at the foot of a rock in a lava bed where he had found a suitable couch for himself but my uncle was pacing around the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage 
none	none	I had neither the wish nor the strength to rise and following the guide s example I went off into an unhappy slumber fancying I could hear ominous noises or feel tremblings within the recesses of the mountain 
176_123269_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Thus the first night in the crater passed away 
176_123269_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The next morning a grey heavy cloudy sky seemed to droop over the summit of the cone 
176_123269_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I did not know this first from the appearances of nature but I found it out by my uncle s impetuous wrath 
176_123269_000034_000000	train-clean-360	I soon found out the cause and hope dawned again in my heart 
176_123269_000034_000001	train-clean-360	For this reason 
none	none	Of the three ways open before us one had been taken by Saknussemm The indications of the learned Icelander hinted at in the cryptogram pointed to this fact that the shadow of Scartaris came to touch that particular way during the latter days of the month of June That sharp peak might hence be considered as the gnomon of a vast sun dial the shadow projected from which on a certain day would point out the road to the centre of the earth 
176_123269_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Now no sun no shadow and therefore no guide 
176_123269_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Here was June twenty five 
176_123269_000037_000002	train-clean-360	If the sun was clouded for six days we must postpone our visit till next year 
176_123269_000038_000000	train-clean-360	My limited powers of description would fail were I to attempt a picture of the Professor s angry impatience 
176_123269_000038_000001	train-clean-360	The day wore on and no shadow came to lay itself along the bottom of the crater 
176_123269_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Hans did not move from the spot he had selected yet he must be asking himself what were we waiting for if he asked himself anything at all 
176_123269_000038_000003	train-clean-360	My uncle spoke not a word to me 
176_123269_000038_000004	train-clean-360	His gaze ever directed upwards was lost in the grey and misty space beyond 
176_123269_000039_000000	train-clean-360	On the twenty sixth nothing yet 
none	none	Rain mingled with snow was falling all day long 
176_123269_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Hans built a hut of pieces of lava 
none	none	I felt a malicious pleasure in watching the thousand rills and cascades that came tumbling down the sides of the cone and the deafening continuous din awaked by every stone against which they bounded My uncle s rage knew no bounds 
176_123269_000040_000001	train-clean-360	It was enough to irritate a meeker man than he for it was foundering almost within the port 
176_123269_000041_000000	train-clean-360	But Heaven never sends unmixed grief and for Professor Liedenbrock there was a satisfaction in store proportioned to his desperate anxieties 
none	none	The next day the sky was again overcast but on the twenty ninth of June the last day but one of the month with the change of the moon came a change of weather The sun poured a flood of light down the crater Every hillock every rock and stone every projecting surface had its share of the beaming torrent and threw its shadow on the ground Amongst them all Scartaris laid down his sharp pointed angular shadow which began to move slowly in the opposite direction to that of the radiant orb 
176_123269_000043_000000	train-clean-360	My uncle turned too and followed it 
176_123269_000044_000000	train-clean-360	At noon being at its least extent it came and softly fell upon the edge of the middle chimney 
none	none	There it is there it is shouted the Professor Now for the centre of the globe he added in Danish 
176_123269_000047_000000	train-clean-360	I looked at Hans to hear what he would say 
none	none	Foruet was his tranquil answer Forward replied my uncle It was thirteen minutes past one 
176_123270_000006_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XVII 
none	none	VERTICAL DESCENT 
176_123270_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Now began our real journey 
176_123270_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Hitherto our toil had overcome all difficulties now difficulties would spring up at every step 
176_123270_000009_000000	train-clean-360	I had not yet ventured to look down the bottomless pit into which I was about to take a plunge 
176_123270_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The supreme hour had come 
176_123270_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I might now either share in the enterprise or refuse to move forward 
176_123270_000009_000003	train-clean-360	But I was ashamed to recoil in the presence of the hunter 
176_123270_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Hans accepted the enterprise with such calmness such indifference such perfect disregard of any possible danger that I blushed at the idea of being less brave than he 
none	none	If I had been alone I might have once more tried the effect of argument but in the presence of the guide I held my peace my heart flew back to my sweet Virlandaise and I approached the central chimney 
176_123270_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I have already mentioned that it was a hundred feet in diameter and three hundred feet round 
176_123270_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I bent over a projecting rock and gazed down 
none	none	My hair stood on end with terror 
176_123270_000010_000003	train-clean-360	The bewildering feeling of vacuity laid hold upon me 
176_123270_000010_000004	train-clean-360	I felt my centre of gravity shifting its place and giddiness mounting into my brain like drunkenness 
176_123270_000010_000005	train-clean-360	There is nothing more treacherous than this attraction down deep abysses 
176_123270_000010_000006	train-clean-360	I was just about to drop down when a hand laid hold of me 
none	none	It was that of Hans I suppose I had not taken as many lessons on gulf exploration as I ought to have done in the Frelsers Kirk at Copenhagen 
176_123270_000011_000000	train-clean-360	But however short was my examination of this well I had taken some account of its conformation 
176_123270_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Its almost perpendicular walls were bristling with innumerable projections which would facilitate the descent 
none	none	But if there was no want of steps still there was no rail A rope fastened to the edge of the aperture might have helped us down 
176_123270_000011_000003	train-clean-360	But how were we to unfasten it when arrived at the other end 
176_123270_000012_000000	train-clean-360	My uncle employed a very simple expedient to obviate this difficulty He uncoiled a cord of the thickness of a finger and four hundred feet long first he dropped half of it down then he passed it round a lava block that projected conveniently and threw the other half down the chimney 
176_123270_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Each of us could then descend by holding with the hand both halves of the rope which would not be able to unroll itself from its hold when two hundred feet down it would be easy to get possession of the whole of the rope by letting one end go and pulling down by the other 
none	none	Then the exercise would go on again ad infinitum
176_123270_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Now said my uncle after having completed these preparations now let us look to our loads 
176_123270_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I will divide them into three lots each of us will strap one upon his back 
176_123270_000013_000002	train-clean-360	I mean only fragile articles 
176_123270_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Of course we were not included under that head 
none	none	Hans said he will take charge of the tools and a portion of the provisions you Axel will take another third of the provisions and the arms and I will take the rest of the provisions and the delicate instruments
176_123270_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 But said I the clothes and that mass of ladders and ropes what is to become of them 
none	none	They will go down by themselves
176_123270_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 How so I asked 
176_123270_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 You will see presently 
176_123270_000020_000000	train-clean-360	My uncle was always willing to employ magnificent resources 
176_123270_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Obeying orders Hans tied all the non fragile articles in one bundle corded them firmly and sent them bodily down the gulf before us 
176_123270_000021_000000	train-clean-360	I listened to the dull thuds of the descending bale 
176_123270_000021_000001	train-clean-360	My uncle leaning over the abyss followed the descent of the luggage with a satisfied nod and only rose erect when he had quite lost sight of it 
none	none	Very well now it is our turn 
176_123270_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Now I ask any sensible man if it was possible to hear those words without a shudder 
176_123270_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor fastened his package of instruments upon his shoulders Hans took the tools I took the arms and the descent commenced in the following order Hans my uncle and myself 
176_123270_000024_000001	train-clean-360	It was effected in profound silence broken only by the descent of loosened stones down the dark gulf 
176_123270_000025_000000	train-clean-360	I dropped as it were frantically clutching the double cord with one hand and buttressing myself from the wall with the other by means of my stick 
176_123270_000025_000001	train-clean-360	One idea overpowered me almost fear lest the rock should give way from which I was hanging 
none	none	This cord seemed a fragile thing for three persons to be suspended from 
176_123270_000025_000003	train-clean-360	I made as little use of it as possible performing wonderful feats of equilibrium upon the lava projections which my foot seemed to catch hold of like a hand 
176_123270_000026_000000	train-clean-360	When one of these slippery steps shook under the heavier form of Hans he said in his tranquil voice 
none	none	Gif akt
176_123270_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Attention repeated my uncle 
176_123270_000029_000000	train-clean-360	In half an hour we were standing upon the surface of a rock jammed in across the chimney from one side to the other 
176_123270_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Hans pulled the rope by one of its ends the other rose in the air after passing the higher rock it came down again bringing with it a rather dangerous shower of bits of stone and lava 
176_123270_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Leaning over the edge of our narrow standing ground I observed that the bottom of the hole was still invisible 
none	none	The same manoeuvre was repeated with the cord and half an hour after we had descended another two hundred feet 
176_123270_000033_000000	train-clean-360	I don t suppose the maddest geologist under such circumstances would have studied the nature of the rocks that we were passing 
176_123270_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I am sure I did trouble my head about them 
none	none	Pliocene miocene eocene cretaceous jurassic triassic permian carboniferous devonian silurian or primitive was all one to me 
176_123270_000033_000003	train-clean-360	But the Professor no doubt was pursuing his observations or taking notes for in one of our halts he said to me 
176_123270_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 The farther I go the more confidence I feel 
none	none	The order of these volcanic formations affords the strongest confirmation to the theories of Davy 
176_123270_000034_000002	train-clean-360	We are now among the primitive rocks upon which the chemical operations took place which are produced by the contact of elementary bases of metals with water 
176_123270_000034_000003	train-clean-360	I repudiate the notion of central heat altogether 
176_123270_000034_000004	train-clean-360	We shall see further proof of that very soon 
none	none	No variation always the same conclusion Of course I was not inclined to argue 
176_123270_000035_000002	train-clean-360	My silence was taken for consent and the descent went on 
176_123270_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Another three hours and I saw no bottom to the chimney yet 
176_123270_000036_000001	train-clean-360	When I lifted my head I perceived the gradual contraction of its aperture Its walls by a gentle incline were drawing closer to each other and it was beginning to grow darker 
176_123270_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Still we kept descending 
176_123270_000037_000001	train-clean-360	It seemed to me that the falling stones were meeting with an earlier resistance and that the concussion gave a more abrupt and deadened sound 
176_123270_000038_000000	train-clean-360	As I had taken care to keep an exact account of our manoeuvres with the rope which I knew that we had repeated fourteen times each descent occupying half an hour the conclusion was easy that we had been seven hours plus fourteen quarters of rest making ten hours and a half 
none	none	We had started at one it must therefore now be eleven o clock and the depth to which we had descended was fourteen times two hundred feet or twenty eight hundred feet At this moment I heard the voice of Hans Halt he cried 
176_123270_000041_000000	train-clean-360	I stopped short just as I was going to place my feet upon my uncle s head 
none	none	We are there he cried
176_123270_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Where said I stepping near to him 
176_123270_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 At the bottom of the perpendicular chimney he answered 
176_123270_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Is there no way farther 
176_123270_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes there is a sort of passage which inclines to the right 
none	none	We will see about that to morrow Let us have our supper and go to sleep 
176_123270_000047_000000	train-clean-360	The darkness was not yet complete 
176_123270_000047_000001	train-clean-360	The provision case was opened we refreshed ourselves and went to sleep as well as we could upon a bed of stones and lava fragments 
176_123270_000048_000000	train-clean-360	When lying on my back I opened my eyes and saw a bright sparkling point of light at the extremity of the gigantic tube three thousand feet long now a vast telescope 
none	none	It was a star which seen from this depth had lost all scintillation and which by my computation should be forty six Ursa minor Then I fell fast asleep 
176_123271_000000_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XVIII 
176_123271_000001_000000	train-clean-360	THE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS
176_123271_000002_000000	train-clean-360	At eight in the morning a ray of daylight came to wake us up 
176_123271_000002_000001	train-clean-360	The thousand shining surfaces of lava on the walls received it on its passage and scattered it like a shower of sparks 
176_123271_000003_000000	train-clean-360	There was light enough to distinguish surrounding objects 
176_123271_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Axel what do you say to it cried my uncle rubbing his hands 
176_123271_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at Koenigsberg 
176_123271_000004_000002	train-clean-360	No noise of cart wheels no cries of basket women no boatmen shouting 
none	none	No doubt it is very quiet at the bottom of this well but there is something alarming in the quietness itself Now come my uncle cried if you are frightened already what will you be by and by We have not gone a single inch yet into the bowels of the earth What do you mean I mean that we have only reached the level of the island long vertical tube which terminates at the mouth of the crater has its lower end only at the level of the sea
176_123271_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you sure of that 
176_123271_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Quite sure 
none	none	Consult the barometer 
176_123271_000011_000000	train-clean-360	In fact the mercury which had risen in the instrument as fast as we descended had stopped at twenty nine inches 
none	none	You see said the Professor we have now only the pressure of our atmosphere and I shall be glad when the aneroid takes the place of the barometer 
176_123271_000013_000000	train-clean-360	And in truth this instrument would become useless as soon as the weight of the atmosphere should exceed the pressure ascertained at the level of the sea 
176_123271_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 But I said is there not reason to fear that this ever increasing pressure will become at last very painful to bear 
176_123271_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 No we shall descend at a slow rate and our lungs will become inured to a denser atmosphere 
none	none	Aeronauts find the want of air as they rise to high elevations but we shall perhaps have too much of the two this is what I should prefer 
176_123271_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Don t let us lose a moment 
none	none	Where is the bundle we sent down before us 
176_123271_000016_000000	train-clean-360	I then remembered that we had searched for it in vain the evening before 
176_123271_000016_000001	train-clean-360	My uncle questioned Hans who after having examined attentively with the eye of a huntsman replied 
none	none	Der huppe Up there 
176_123271_000019_000000	train-clean-360	And so it was 
176_123271_000019_000001	train-clean-360	The bundle had been caught by a projection a hundred feet above us 
176_123271_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Immediately the Icelander climbed up like a cat and in a few minutes the package was in our possession 
none	none	Now said my uncle let us breakfast but we must lay in a good stock for we don t know how long we may have to go on The biscuit and extract of meat were washed down with a draught of water mingled with a little gin 
176_123271_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Breakfast over my uncle drew from his pocket a small notebook intended for scientific observations 
176_123271_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He consulted his instruments and recorded 
none	none	Monday July one Chronometer eight point seventeen a m barometer two hundred ninety seven in thermometer six deg forty three deg F Direction E S E 
176_123271_000025_000000	train-clean-360	This last observation applied to the dark gallery and was indicated by the compass 
none	none	Now Axel cried the Professor with enthusiasm now we are really going into the interior of the earth 
176_123271_000026_000001	train-clean-360	At this precise moment the journey commences 
176_123271_000027_000000	train-clean-360	So saying my uncle took in one hand Ruhmkorff s apparatus which was hanging from his neck and with the other he formed an electric communication with the coil in the lantern and a sufficiently bright light dispersed the darkness of the passage 
176_123271_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Hans carried the other apparatus which was also put into action This ingenious application of electricity would enable us to go on for a long time by creating an artificial light even in the midst of the most inflammable gases 
176_123271_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Now march cried my uncle 
176_123271_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Each shouldered his package 
none	none	Hans drove before him the load of cords and clothes and myself walking last we entered the gallery At the moment of becoming engulfed in this dark gallery I raised my head and saw for the last time through the length of that vast tube the sky of Iceland which I was never to behold again 
176_123271_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The lava in the last eruption of twelve twenty nine had forced a passage through this tunnel 
176_123271_000032_000001	train-clean-360	It still lined the walls with a thick and glistening coat 
176_123271_000032_000002	train-clean-360	The electric light was here intensified a hundredfold by reflection 
176_123271_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The only difficulty in proceeding lay in not sliding too fast down an incline of about forty five degrees happily certain asperities and a few blisterings here and there formed steps and we descended letting our baggage slip before us from the end of a long rope 
176_123271_000034_000000	train-clean-360	But that which formed steps under our feet became stalactites overhead 
none	none	The lava which was porous in many places had formed a surface covered with small rounded blisters crystals of opaque quartz set with limpid tears of glass and hanging like clustered chandeliers from the vaulted roof seemed as it were to kindle and form a sudden illumination as we passed on our way It seemed as if the genii of the depths were lighting up their palace to receive their terrestrial guests It is magnificent I cried spontaneously
176_123271_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 My uncle what a sight Don t you admire those blending hues of lava passing from reddish brown to bright yellow by imperceptible shades 
176_123271_000035_000002	train-clean-360	And these crystals are just like globes of light 
none	none	Ali you think so do you Axel my boy Well you will see greater splendours than these I hope 
176_123271_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Now let us march march 
176_123271_000037_000000	train-clean-360	He had better have said slide for we did nothing but drop down the steep inclines 
none	none	It was the facifs descensus Averni of Virgil 
176_123271_000037_000002	train-clean-360	The compass which I consulted frequently gave our direction as south east with inflexible steadiness 
176_123271_000037_000003	train-clean-360	This lava stream deviated neither to the right nor to the left 
176_123271_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Yet there was no sensible increase of temperature 
176_123271_000038_000001	train-clean-360	This justified Davy s theory and more than once I consulted the thermometer with surprise 
none	none	Two hours after our departure it only marked ten deg fifty deg Fahr an increase of only four deg This gave reason for believing that our descent was more horizontal than vertical As for the exact depth reached it was very easy to ascertain that the Professor measured accurately the angles of deviation and inclination on the road but he kept the results to himself About eight in the evening he signalled to stop 
176_123271_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Hans sat down at once 
176_123271_000039_000002	train-clean-360	The lamps were hung upon a projection in the lava we were in a sort of cavern where there was plenty of air 
176_123271_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Certain puffs of air reached us 
176_123271_000039_000004	train-clean-360	What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them 
176_123271_000039_000005	train-clean-360	I could not answer that question at the moment 
176_123271_000039_000006	train-clean-360	Hunger and fatigue made me incapable of reasoning 
176_123271_000039_000007	train-clean-360	A descent of seven hours consecutively is not made without considerable expenditure of strength 
none	none	I was exhausted 
176_123271_000039_000009	train-clean-360	The order to halt therefore gave me pleasure 
176_123271_000039_000010	train-clean-360	Hans laid our provisions upon a block of lava and we ate with a good appetite But one thing troubled me our supply of water was half consumed 
176_123271_000039_000011	train-clean-360	My uncle reckoned upon a fresh supply from subterranean sources but hitherto we had met with none 
none	none	I could not help drawing his attention to this circumstance Are you surprised at this want of springs he said
176_123271_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 More than that I am anxious about it we have only water enough for five days 
176_123271_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t be uneasy Axel we shall find more than we want 
none	none	When When we have left this bed of lava behind us 
176_123271_000044_000001	train-clean-360	How could springs break through such walls as these 
176_123271_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 But perhaps this passage runs to a very great depth 
none	none	It seems to me that we have made no great progress vertically Why do you suppose that Because if we had gone deep into the crust of earth we should have encountered greater heat According to your system said my uncle But what does the thermometer say Hardly fifteen degrees fifty nine deg Fahr nine degrees only since our departure Well what is your conclusion
176_123271_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 This is my conclusion 
none	none	According to exact observations the increase of temperature in the interior of the globe advances at the rate of one degree one four five deg Fahr for every hundred feet 
176_123271_000051_000003	train-clean-360	But certain local conditions may modify this rate 
176_123271_000051_000004	train-clean-360	Thus at Yakoutsk in Siberia the increase of a degree is ascertained to be reached every thirty six feet 
none	none	This difference depends upon the heat conducting power of the rocks Moreover in the neighbourhood of an extinct volcano through gneiss it has been observed that the increase of a degree is only attained at every one hundred twenty five feet 
176_123271_000051_000006	train-clean-360	Let us therefore assume this last hypothesis as the most suitable to our situation and calculate 
none	none	Well do calculate my boy
176_123271_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing is easier said I putting down figures in my note book Nine times a hundred and twenty five feet gives a depth of eleven hundred and twenty five feet 
176_123271_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Very accurate indeed 
none	none	Well
176_123271_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 By my observation we are at ten thousand feet below the level of the sea 
176_123271_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that possible 
176_123271_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes or figures are of no use 
176_123271_000059_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor s calculations were quite correct 
176_123271_000059_000001	train-clean-360	We had already attained a depth of six thousand feet beyond that hitherto reached by the foot of man such as the mines of Kitz Bahl in Tyrol and those of Wuttembourg in Bohemia 
none	none	The temperature which ought to have been eighty one deg one hundred seventy eight deg Fahr was scarcely fifteen deg fifty nine deg Fahr Here was cause for reflection CHAPTER XIX GEOLOGICAL STUDIES IN SITU Next day Tuesday June thirty at six a m the descent began again 
886-123272-0000	train-other-500	We were still following the gallery of lava a real natural staircase and as gently sloping as those inclined planes which in some old houses are still found instead of flights of steps
none	none	 And so we went on until twelve point seventeen 
886-123272-0001	train-other-500	the precise moment when we overtook Hans who had stopped Ah here we are exclaimed my uncle at the very end of the chimney I looked around me We were standing at the intersection of two roads
886-123272-0002	train-other-500	both dark and narrow Which were we to take This was a difficulty Still my uncle refused to admit an appearance of hesitation either before me or the guide he pointed out the Eastern tunnel
886-123272-0003	train-other-500	and we were soon all three in it Besides there would have been interminable hesitation before this choice of roads for since there was no indication whatever to guide our choice
886-123272-0004	train-other-500	we were obliged to trust to chance The slope of this gallery was scarcely perceptible and its sections very unequal Sometimes we passed a series of arches succeeding each other like the majestic arcades of a gothic cathedral
886-123272-0005	train-other-500	Here the architects of the middle ages might have found studies for every form of the sacred art which sprang from the development of the pointed arch A mile farther we had to bow our heads under corniced elliptic arches in the romanesque style
886-123272-0006	train-other-500	and massive pillars standing out from the wall bent under the spring of the vault that rested heavily upon them In other places this magnificence gave way to narrow channels between low structures which looked like beaver s huts and we had to creep along
886-123272-0007	train-other-500	through extremely narrow passages The heat was perfectly bearable Involuntarily I began to think of its heat when the lava thrown out by Snaefell was boiling and working through this now silent road
886-123272-0008	train-other-500	I imagined the torrents of fire hurled back at every angle in the gallery and the accumulation of intensely heated vapours in the midst of this confined channel I only hope thought I
886-123272-0009	train-other-500	that this so called extinct volcano won t take a fancy in his old age to begin his sports again I abstained from communicating these fears to Professor Liedenbrock He would never have understood them at all He had but one idea
886-123272-0010	train-other-500	forward He walked he slid he scrambled he tumbled with a persistency which one could not but admire By six in the evening after a not very fatiguing walk
886-123272-0011	train-other-500	we had gone two leagues south but scarcely a quarter of a mile down My uncle said it was time to go to sleep We ate without talking and went to sleep without reflection Our arrangements for the night were very simple
886-123272-0012	train-other-500	a railway rug each into which we rolled ourselves was our sole covering We had neither cold nor intrusive visits to fear Travellers who penetrate into the wilds of central Africa and into the pathless forests of the New World
886-123272-0013	train-other-500	are obliged to watch over each other by night But we enjoyed absolute safety and utter seclusion no savages or wild beasts infested these silent depths
none	none	 Next morning we awoke fresh and in good spirits 
886-123272-0014	train-other-500	The road was resumed As the day before we followed the path of the lava It was impossible to tell what rocks we were passing the tunnel instead of tending lower approached more and more nearly to a horizontal direction
886-123272-0015	train-other-500	I even fancied a slight rise But about ten this upward tendency became so evident and therefore so fatiguing that I was obliged to slacken my pace Well Axel demanded the Professor impatiently
886-123272-0016	train-other-500	Well I cannot stand it any longer I replied What after three hours walk over such easy ground It may be easy but it is tiring all the same What when we have nothing to do but keep going down
886-123272-0017	train-other-500	Going up if you please Going up said my uncle with a shrug No doubt for the last half hour the inclines have gone the other way and at this rate we shall soon arrive upon the level soil of Iceland
886-123272-0018	train-other-500	The Professor nodded slowly and uneasily like a man that declines to be convinced I tried to resume the conversation He answered not a word and gave the signal for a start I saw that his silence was nothing but ill humour
886-123272-0019	train-other-500	Still I had courageously shouldered my burden again and was rapidly following Hans whom my uncle preceded I was anxious not to be left behind My greatest care was not to lose sight of my companions
886-123272-0020	train-other-500	I shuddered at the thought of being lost in the mazes of this vast subterranean labyrinth Besides if the ascending road did become steeper I was comforted with the thought that it was bringing us nearer to the surface There was hope in this
886-123272-0021	train-other-500	Every step confirmed me in it and I was rejoicing at the thought of meeting my little Graeuben again By mid day there was a change in the appearance of this wall of the gallery
none	none	 I noticed it by a diminution of the amount of light reflected from the sides 
886-123272-0022	train-other-500	solid rock was appearing in the place of the lava coating The mass was composed of inclined and sometimes vertical strata
none	none	 We were passing through rocks of the transition or silurian one system 
886-123272-0023	train-other-500	It is evident I cried the marine deposits formed in the second period these shales limestones and sandstones We are turning away from the primary granite We are just as if we were people of Hamburg going to Luebeck by way of Hanover
886-123272-0024	train-other-500	I had better have kept my observations to myself But my geological instinct was stronger than my prudence and uncle Liedenbrock heard my exclamation What s that you are saying he asked See
886-123272-0025	train-other-500	I said pointing to the varied series of sandstones and limestones and the first indication of slate Well We are at the period when the first plants and animals appeared
none	none	 Do you think so 
886-123272-0026	train-other-500	Look close and examine I obliged the Professor to move his lamp over the walls of the gallery I expected some signs of astonishment but he spoke not a word and went on Had he understood me or not
none	none	 Did he refuse to admit out of self love as an uncle and a philosopher that he had mistaken his way when he chose the eastern tunnel or was he determined to examine this passage to its farthest extremity It was evident that we had left the lava path and that this road could not possibly lead to the extinct furnace of Snaefell Yet I asked myself if I was not depending too much on this change in the rock Might I not myself be mistaken Were we really crossing the layers of rock which overlie the granite foundation one The name given by Sir Roderick Murchison to a vast series of fossiliferous strata which lies between the non fossiliferous slaty schists below and the old red sandstone above The system is well developed in the region of Shropshire et cetera once inhabited by the Silures under Caractacus or Caradoc Tr If I am right I thought I must soon find some fossil remains of primitive life and then we must yield to evidence 
886-123272-0027	train-other-500	I will look I had not gone a hundred paces before incontestable proofs presented themselves It could not be otherwise
none	none	 for in the Silurian age the seas contained at least fifteen hundred vegetable and animal species 
886-123272-0028	train-other-500	My feet which had become accustomed to the indurated lava floor suddenly rested upon a dust composed of the debris of plants and shells
none	none	 In the walls were distinct impressions of fucoids and lycopodites 
886-123272-0029	train-other-500	Professor Liedenbrock could not be mistaken I thought and yet he pushed on with I suppose his eyes resolutely shut This was only invincible obstinacy I could hold out no longer
886-123272-0030	train-other-500	I picked up a perfectly formed shell which had belonged to an animal not unlike the woodlouse then joining my uncle I said Look at this Very well said he quietly
886-123272-0031	train-other-500	it is the shell of a crustacean of an extinct species called a trilobite Nothing more But don t you conclude Just what you conclude yourself Yes I do perfectly
none	none	 We have left the granite and the lava It is possible that I may be mistaken 
886-123272-0032	train-other-500	But I cannot be sure of that until I have reached the very end of this gallery You are right in doing this my uncle and I should quite approve of your determination if there were not a danger threatening us nearer and nearer What danger The want of water
none	none	 Well Axel we will put ourselves upon rations CHAPTER XX THE FIRST SIGNS OF DISTRESS In fact we had to ration ourselves 
886-123273-0000	train-other-500	Our provision of water could not last more than three days I found that out for certain when supper time came And to our sorrow we had little reason to expect to find a spring in these transition beds
886-123273-0001	train-other-500	The whole of the next day the gallery opened before us its endless arcades We moved on almost without a word Hans silence seemed to be infecting us The road was now not ascending
886-123273-0002	train-other-500	at least not perceptibly Sometimes even it seemed to have a slight fall But this tendency which was very trifling could not do anything to reassure the Professor for there was no change in the beds
886-123273-0003	train-other-500	and the transitional characteristics became more and more decided The electric light was reflected in sparkling splendour from the schist limestone and old red sandstone of the walls It might have been thought that we were passing through a section of Wales
886-123273-0004	train-other-500	of which an ancient people gave its name to this system Specimens of magnificent marbles clothed the walls some of a greyish agate fantastically veined with white others of rich crimson or yellow dashed with splotches of red
886-123273-0005	train-other-500	then came dark cherry coloured marbles relieved by the lighter tints of limestone The greater part of these bore impressions of primitive organisms Creation had evidently advanced since the day before
none	none	 Instead of rudimentary trilobites 
886-123273-0006	train-other-500	I noticed remains of a more perfect order of beings amongst others ganoid fishes and some of those sauroids in which palaeontologists have discovered the earliest reptile forms The Devonian seas were peopled by animals of these species
886-123273-0007	train-other-500	and deposited them by thousands in the rocks of the newer formation It was evident that we were ascending that scale of animal life in which man fills the highest place But Professor Liedenbrock seemed not to notice it He was awaiting one of two events
886-123273-0008	train-other-500	either the appearance of a vertical well opening before his feet down which our descent might be resumed or that of some obstacle which should effectually turn us back on our own footsteps But evening came and neither wish was gratified
886-123273-0009	train-other-500	On Friday after a night during which I felt pangs of thirst our little troop again plunged into the winding passages of the gallery After ten hours walking I observed a singular deadening of the reflection of our lamps from the side walls
886-123273-0010	train-other-500	The marble the schist the limestone and the sandstone were giving way to a dark and lustreless lining At one moment the tunnel becoming very narrow I leaned against the wall When I removed my hand it was black
886-123273-0011	train-other-500	I looked nearer and found we were in a coal formation A coal mine I cried A mine without miners my uncle replied Who knows I asked
none	none	 I know the Professor pronounced decidedly 
886-123273-0012	train-other-500	I am certain that this gallery driven through beds of coal was never pierced by the hand of man But whether it be the hand of nature or not does not matter Supper time is come let us sup Hans prepared some food
886-123273-0013	train-other-500	I scarcely ate and I swallowed down the few drops of water rationed out to me One flask half full was all we had left to slake the thirst of three men After their meal my two companions laid themselves down upon their rugs
886-123273-0014	train-other-500	and found in sleep a solace for their fatigue But I could not sleep and I counted every hour until morning On Saturday at six we started afresh In twenty minutes we reached a vast open space
886-123273-0015	train-other-500	I then knew that the hand of man had not hollowed out this mine the vaults would have been shored up and as it was they seemed to be held up by a miracle of equilibrium This cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in height
886-123273-0016	train-other-500	A large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean disturbance Yielding to some vast power from below it had broken asunder leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now penetrating for the first time
886-123273-0017	train-other-500	The whole history of the carboniferous period was written upon these gloomy walls and a geologist might with ease trace all its diverse phases The beds of coal were separated by strata of sandstone or compact clays
886-123273-0018	train-other-500	and appeared crushed under the weight of overlying strata At the age of the world which preceded the secondary period the earth was clothed with immense vegetable forms the product of the double influence of tropical heat and constant moisture
886-123273-0019	train-other-500	a vapoury atmosphere surrounded the earth still veiling the direct rays of the sun Thence arises the conclusion that the high temperature then existing was due to some other source than the heat of the sun
886-123273-0020	train-other-500	Perhaps even the orb of day may not have been ready yet to play the splendid part he now acts There were no climates as yet and a torrid heat equal from pole to equator was spread over the whole surface of the globe
886-123273-0021	train-other-500	Whence this heat Was it from the interior of the earth Notwithstanding the theories of Professor Liedenbrock a violent heat did at that time brood within the body of the spheroid
none	none	 Its action was felt to the very last coats of the terrestrial crust the plants 
886-123273-0022	train-other-500	unacquainted with the beneficent influences of the sun yielded neither flowers nor scent But their roots drew vigorous life from the burning soil of the early days of this planet There were but few trees Herbaceous plants alone existed
886-123273-0023	train-other-500	There were tall grasses ferns lycopods besides sigillaria asterophyllites now scarce plants but then the species might be counted by thousands The coal measures owe their origin to this period of profuse vegetation
886-123273-0024	train-other-500	The yet elastic and yielding crust of the earth obeyed the fluid forces beneath Thence innumerable fissures and depressions The plants sunk underneath the waters formed by degrees into vast accumulated masses
886-123273-0025	train-other-500	Then came the chemical action of nature in the depths of the seas the vegetable accumulations first became peat then acted upon by generated gases and the heat of fermentation they underwent a process of complete mineralization
886-123273-0026	train-other-500	Thus were formed those immense coalfields which nevertheless are not inexhaustible and which three centuries at the present accelerated rate of consumption will exhaust unless the industrial world will devise a remedy
886-123273-0027	train-other-500	These reflections came into my mind whilst I was contemplating the mineral wealth stored up in this portion of the globe These no doubt I thought will never be discovered the working of such deep mines would involve too large an outlay
886-123273-0028	train-other-500	and where would be the use as long as coal is yet spread far and wide near the surface Such as my eyes behold these virgin stores such they will be when this world comes to an end
886-123273-0029	train-other-500	But still we marched on and I alone was forgetting the length of the way by losing myself in the midst of geological contemplations The temperature remained what it had been during our passage through the lava and schists
886-123273-0030	train-other-500	Only my sense of smell was forcibly affected by an odour of protocarburet of hydrogen I immediately recognised in this gallery the presence of a considerable quantity of the dangerous gas called by miners firedamp
886-123273-0031	train-other-500	the explosion of which has often occasioned such dreadful catastrophes Happily our light was from Ruhmkorff s ingenious apparatus If unfortunately we had explored this gallery with torches
886-123273-0032	train-other-500	a terrible explosion would have put an end to travelling and travellers at one stroke This excursion through the coal mine lasted till night My uncle scarcely could restrain his impatience at the horizontal road
886-123273-0033	train-other-500	The darkness always deep twenty yards before us prevented us from estimating the length of the gallery and I was beginning to think it must be endless when suddenly at six o clock a wall very unexpectedly stood before us Right or left
886-123273-0034	train-other-500	top or bottom there was no road farther we were at the end of a blind alley Very well it s all right cried my uncle now at any rate we shall know what we are about We are not in Saknussemm s road
886-123273-0035	train-other-500	and all we have to do is to go back Let us take a night s rest and in three days we shall get to the fork in the road Yes said I if we have any strength left Why not Because to morrow we shall have no water
886-123273-0036	train-other-500	Nor courage either asked my uncle severely
none	none	 I dared make no answer CHAPTER XXI COMPASSION FUSES THE PROFESSOR S HEART Next day we started early 
886-123274-0000	train-other-500	We had to hasten forward It was a three days march to the cross roads I will not speak of the sufferings we endured in our return My uncle bore them with the angry impatience of a man obliged to own his weakness
886-123274-0001	train-other-500	Hans with the resignation of his passive nature I I confess with complaints and expressions of despair I had no spirit to oppose this ill fortune As I had foretold
886-123274-0002	train-other-500	the water failed entirely by the end of the first day s retrograde march Our fluid aliment was now nothing but gin but this infernal fluid burned my throat and I could not even endure the sight of it I found the temperature and the air stifling
none	none	 Fatigue paralysed my limbs 
886-123274-0003	train-other-500	More than once I dropped down motionless Then there was a halt and my uncle and the Icelander did their best to restore me But I saw that the former was struggling painfully against excessive fatigue and the tortures of thirst
none	none	 At last on Tuesday July eight we arrived on our hands and knees and half dead at the junction of the two roads There I dropped like a lifeless lump extended on the lava soil It was ten in the morning 
886-123274-0005	train-other-500	Hans and my uncle clinging to the wall tried to nibble a few bits of biscuit Long moans escaped from my swollen lips After some time my uncle approached me and raised me in his arms
none	none	 Poor boy 
886-123274-0006	train-other-500	said he in genuine tones of compassion I was touched with these words not being accustomed to see the excitable Professor in a softened mood I grasped his trembling hands in mine He let me hold them and looked at me
886-123274-0007	train-other-500	His eyes were moistened Then I saw him take the flask that was hanging at his side To my amazement he placed it on my lips Drink said he Had I heard him Was my uncle beside himself
886-123274-0008	train-other-500	I stared at him stupidly and felt as if I could not understand him Drink he said again And raising his flask he emptied it every drop between my lips Oh infinite pleasure
886-123274-0009	train-other-500	a slender sip of water came to moisten my burning mouth It was but one sip but it was enough to recall my ebbing life I thanked my uncle with clasped hands Yes he said a draught of water
886-123274-0010	train-other-500	but it is the very last you hear the last I had kept it as a precious treasure at the bottom of my flask Twenty times nay a hundred times have I fought against a frightful impulse to drink it off But no Axel I kept it for you
886-123274-0011	train-other-500	My dear uncle I said whilst hot tears trickled down my face Yes my poor boy I knew that as soon as you arrived at these cross roads you would drop half dead and I kept my last drop of water to reanimate you
886-123274-0012	train-other-500	Thank you thank you I said Although my thirst was only partially quenched yet some strength had returned The muscles of my throat until then contracted now relaxed again and the inflammation of my lips abated somewhat
886-123274-0013	train-other-500	and I was now able to speak Let us see I said we have now but one thing to do We have no water we must go back While I spoke my uncle avoided looking at me he hung his head down
886-123274-0014	train-other-500	his eyes avoided mine We must return I exclaimed vehemently we must go back on our way to Snaefell May God give us strength to climb up the crater again Return said my uncle
886-123274-0015	train-other-500	as if he was rather answering himself than me Yes return without the loss of a minute A long silence followed So then Axel replied the Professor ironically
886-123274-0016	train-other-500	you have found no courage or energy in these few drops of water Courage I see you just as feeble minded as you were before and still expressing only despair
886-123274-0017	train-other-500	What sort of a man was this I had to do with and what schemes was he now revolving in his fearless mind What you won t go back Should I renounce this expedition just when we have the fairest chance of success Never
886-123274-0018	train-other-500	Then must we resign ourselves to destruction No Axel no go back Hans will go with you Leave me to myself Leave you here Leave me I tell you I have undertaken this expedition
886-123274-0019	train-other-500	I will carry it out to the end and I will not return Go Axel go My uncle was in high state of excitement His voice which had for a moment been tender and gentle had now become hard and threatening
886-123274-0020	train-other-500	He was struggling with gloomy resolutions against impossibilities I would not leave him in this bottomless abyss and on the other hand the instinct of self preservation prompted me to fly
886-123274-0021	train-other-500	The guide watched this scene with his usual phlegmatic unconcern Yet he understood perfectly well what was going on between his two companions The gestures themselves were sufficient to show that we were each bent on taking a different road
886-123274-0022	train-other-500	but Hans seemed to take no part in a question upon which depended his life He was ready to start at a given signal or to stay if his master so willed it How I wished at this moment I could have made him understand me
886-123274-0023	train-other-500	My words my complaints my sorrow would have had some influence over that frigid nature Those dangers which our guide could not understand I could have demonstrated and proved to him Together we might have over ruled the obstinate Professor
886-123274-0024	train-other-500	if it were needed we might perhaps have compelled him to regain the heights of Snaefell I drew near to Hans I placed my hand upon his He made no movement My parted lips sufficiently revealed my sufferings
886-123274-0025	train-other-500	The Icelander slowly moved his head and calmly pointing to my uncle said Master Master I shouted you madman no he is not the master of our life we must fly we must drag him Do you hear me
none	none	 Do you understand 
886-123274-0026	train-other-500	I had seized Hans by the arm I wished to oblige him to rise I strove with him My uncle interposed Be calm Axel you will get nothing from that immovable servant Therefore listen to my proposal
886-123274-0027	train-other-500	I crossed my arms and confronted my uncle boldly The want of water he said is the only obstacle in our way In this eastern gallery made up of lavas schists and coal we have not met with a single particle of moisture
886-123274-0028	train-other-500	Perhaps we shall be more fortunate if we follow the western tunnel I shook my head incredulously Hear me to the end the Professor went on with a firm voice
886-123274-0029	train-other-500	Whilst you were lying there motionless I went to examine the conformation of that gallery It penetrates directly downward and in a few hours it will bring us to the granite rocks There we must meet with abundant springs
886-123274-0030	train-other-500	The nature of the rock assures me of this and instinct agrees with logic to support my conviction Now this is my proposal When Columbus asked of his ships crews for three days more to discover a new world those crews
886-123274-0031	train-other-500	disheartened and sick as they were recognised the justice of the claim and he discovered America I am the Columbus of this nether world and I only ask for one more day
886-123274-0032	train-other-500	If in a single day I have not met with the water that we want I swear to you we will return to the surface of the earth In spite of my irritation I was moved with these words
886-123274-0033	train-other-500	as well as with the violence my uncle was doing to his own wishes in making so hazardous a proposal Well I said do as you will and God reward your superhuman energy You have now but a few hours to tempt fortune
none	none	 Let us start CHAPTER XXII TOTAL FAILURE OF WATER This time the descent commenced by the new gallery Hans walked first as was his custom We had not gone a hundred yards when the Professor moving his lantern along the walls cried Here are primitive rocks Now we are in the right way Forward When in its early stages the earth was slowly cooling its contraction gave rise in its crust to disruptions distortions fissures and chasms The passage through which we were moving was such a fissure through which at one time granite poured out in a molten state Its thousands of windings formed an inextricable labyrinth through the primeval mass As fast as we descended the succession of beds forming the primitive foundation came out with increasing distinctness Geologists consider this primitive matter to be the base of the mineral crust of the earth and have ascertained it to be composed of three different formations schist gneiss and mica schist resting upon that unchangeable foundation the granite Never had mineralogists found themselves in so marvellous a situation to study nature in situ What the boring machine an insensible inert instrument was unable to bring to the surface of the inner structure of the globe we were able to peruse with our own eyes and handle with our own hands Through the beds of schist coloured with delicate shades of green ran in winding course threads of copper and manganese with traces of platinum and gold I thought what riches are here buried at an unapproachable depth in the earth hidden for ever from the covetous eyes of the human race These treasures have been buried at such a profound depth by the convulsions of primeval times that they run no chance of ever being molested by the pickaxe or the spade To the schists succeeded gneiss partially stratified remarkable for the parallelism and regularity of its lamina then mica schists laid in large plates or flakes revealing their lamellated structure by the sparkle of the white shining mica The light from our apparatus reflected from the small facets of quartz shot sparkling rays at every angle and I seemed to be moving through a diamond within which the quickly darting rays broke across each other in a thousand flashing coruscations About six o clock this brilliant fete of illuminations underwent a sensible abatement of splendour then almost ceased The walls assumed a crystallised though sombre appearance mica was more closely mingled with the feldspar and quartz to form the proper rocky foundations of the earth which bears without distortion or crushing the weight of the four terrestrial systems We were immured within prison walls of granite It was eight in the evening No signs of water had yet appeared I was suffering horribly My uncle strode on He refused to stop He was listening anxiously for the murmur of distant springs But no there was dead silence And now my limbs were failing beneath me I resisted pain and torture that I might not stop my uncle which would have driven him to despair for the day was drawing near to its end and it was his last At last I failed utterly I uttered a cry and fell Come to me I am dying My uncle retraced his steps He gazed upon me with his arms crossed then these muttered words passed his lips It s all over The last thing I saw was a fearful gesture of rage and my eyes closed When I reopened them I saw my two companions motionless and rolled up in their coverings Were they asleep As for me I could not get one moment s sleep I was suffering too keenly and what embittered my thoughts was that there was no remedy My uncle s last words echoed painfully in my ears it s all over For in such a fearful state of debility it was madness to think of ever reaching the upper world again We had above us a league and a half of terrestrial crust The weight of it seemed to be crushing down upon my shoulders I felt weighed down and I exhausted myself with imaginary violent exertions to turn round upon my granite couch A few hours passed away A deep silence reigned around us the silence of the grave No sound could reach us through walls the thinnest of which were five miles thick Yet in the midst of my stupefaction I seemed to be aware of a noise It was dark down the tunnel but I seemed to see the Icelander vanishing from our sight with the lamp in his hand Why was he leaving us Was Hans going to forsake us My uncle was fast asleep I wanted to shout but my voice died upon my parched and swollen lips The darkness became deeper and the last sound died away in the far distance Hans has abandoned us I cried Hans Hans But these words were only spoken within me They went no farther Yet after the first moment of terror I felt ashamed of suspecting a man of such extraordinary faithfulness Instead of ascending he was descending the gallery An evil design would have taken him up not down This reflection restored me to calmness and I turned to other thoughts None but some weighty motive could have induced so quiet a man to forfeit his sleep Was he on a journey of discovery Had he during the silence of the night caught a sound a murmuring of something in the distance which had failed to affect my hearing CHAPTER XXIII WATER DISCOVERED For a whole hour I was trying to work out in my delirious brain the reasons which might have influenced this seemingly tranquil huntsman The absurdest notions ran in utter confusion through my mind I thought madness was coming on But at last a noise of footsteps was heard in the dark abyss Hans was approaching A flickering light was beginning to glimmer on the wall of our darksome prison then it came out full at the mouth of the gallery Hans appeared He drew close to my uncle laid his hand upon his shoulder and gently woke him My uncle rose up What is the matter he asked Watten replied the huntsman No doubt under the inspiration of intense pain everybody becomes endowed with the gift of divers tongues I did not know a word of Danish yet instinctively I understood the word he had uttered Water water I cried clapping my hands and gesticulating like a madman Water repeated my uncle Hvar he asked in Icelandic Nedat replied Hans Where Down below I understood it all I seized the hunter s hands and pressed them while he looked on me without moving a muscle of his countenance The preparations for our departure were not long in making and we were soon on our way down a passage inclining two feet in seven In an hour we had gone a mile and a quarter and descended two thousand feet Then I began to hear distinctly quite a new sound of something running within the thickness of the granite wall a kind of dull dead rumbling like distant thunder During the first part of our walk not meeting with the promised spring I felt my agony returning but then my uncle acquainted me with the cause of the strange noise Hans was not mistaken he said What you hear is the rushing of a torrent A torrent I exclaimed There can be no doubt a subterranean river is flowing around us We hurried forward in the greatest excitement I was no longer sensible of my fatigue This murmuring of waters close at hand was already refreshing me It was audibly increasing The torrent after having for some time flowed over our heads was now running within the left wall roaring and rushing Frequently I touched the wall hoping to feel some indications of moisture But there was no hope here Yet another half hour another half league was passed Then it became clear that the hunter had gone no farther Guided by an instinct peculiar to mountaineers he had as it were felt this torrent through the rock but he had certainly seen none of the precious liquid he had drunk nothing himself Soon it became evident that if we continued our walk we should widen the distance between ourselves and the stream the noise of which was becoming fainter We returned Hans stopped where the torrent seemed closest I sat near the wall while the waters were flowing past me at a distance of two feet with extreme violence But there was a thick granite wall between us and the object of our desires Without reflection without asking if there were any means of procuring the water I gave way to a movement of despair Hans glanced at me with I thought a smile of compassion He rose and took the lamp I followed him He moved towards the wall I looked on He applied his ear against the dry stone and moved it slowly to and fro listening intently I perceived at once that he was examining to find the exact place where the torrent could be heard the loudest He met with that point on the left side of the tunnel at three feet from the ground I was stirred up with excitement I hardly dared guess what the hunter was about to do But I could not but understand and applaud and cheer him on when I saw him lay hold of the pickaxe to make an attack upon the rock We are saved I cried Yes cried my uncle almost frantic with excitement Hans is right Capital fellow Who but he would have thought of it Yes who but he Such an expedient however simple would never have entered into our minds True it seemed most hazardous to strike a blow of the hammer in this part of the earth s structure Suppose some displacement should occur and crush us all Suppose the torrent bursting through should drown us in a sudden flood There was nothing vain in these fancies But still no fears of falling rocks or rushing floods could stay us now and our thirst was so intense that to satisfy it we would have dared the waves of the north Atlantic Hans set about the task which my uncle and I together could not have accomplished If our impatience had armed our hands with power we should have shattered the rock into a thousand fragments Not so Hans Full of self possession he calmly wore his way through the rock with a steady succession of light and skilful strokes working through an aperture six inches wide at the outside I could hear a louder noise of flowing waters and I fancied I could feel the delicious fluid refreshing my parched lips The pick had soon penetrated two feet into the granite partition and our man had worked for above an hour I was in an agony of impatience My uncle wanted to employ stronger measures and I had some difficulty in dissuading him still he had just taken a pickaxe in his hand when a sudden hissing was heard and a jet of water spurted out with violence against the opposite wall Hans almost thrown off his feet by the violence of the shock uttered a cry of grief and disappointment of which I soon under stood the cause when plunging my hands into the spouting torrent I withdrew them in haste for the water was scalding hot The water is at the boiling point I cried Well never mind let it cool my uncle replied The tunnel was filling with steam whilst a stream was forming which by degrees wandered away into subterranean windings and soon we had the satisfaction of swallowing our first draught Could anything be more delicious than the sensation that our burning intolerable thirst was passing away and leaving us to enjoy comfort and pleasure But where was this water from No matter It was water and though still warm it brought life back to the dying I kept drinking without stopping and almost without tasting At last after a most delightful time of reviving energy I cried Why this is a chalybeate spring Nothing could be better for the digestion said my uncle It is highly impregnated with iron It will be as good for us as going to the Spa or to Toeplitz Well it is delicious Of course it is water should be found six miles underground It has an inky flavour which is not at all unpleasant What a capital source of strength Hans has found for us here We will call it after his name Agreed I cried And Hansbach it was from that moment Hans was none the prouder After a moderate draught he went quietly into a corner to rest Now I said we must not lose this water What is the use of troubling ourselves my uncle replied I fancy it will never fail Never mind we cannot be sure let us fill the water bottle and our flasks and then stop up the opening My advice was followed so far as getting in a supply but the stopping up of the hole was not so easy to accomplish It was in vain that we took up fragments of granite and stuffed them in with tow we only scalded our hands without succeeding The pressure was too great and our efforts were fruitless It is quite plain said I that the higher body of this water is at a considerable elevation The force of the jet shows that No doubt answered my uncle If this column of water is thirty two thousand feet high that is from the surface of the earth it is equal to the weight of a thousand atmospheres But I have got an idea Well Why should we trouble ourselves to stop the stream from coming out at all Because Well I could not assign a reason When our flasks are empty where shall we fill them again Can we tell that No there was no certainty Well let us allow the water to run on It will flow down and will both guide and refresh us That is well planned I cried With this stream for our guide there is no reason why we should not succeed in our undertaking Ah my boy you agree with me now cried the Professor laughing I agree with you most heartily Well let us rest awhile and then we will start again I was forgetting that it was night The chronometer soon informed me of that fact and in a very short time refreshed and thankful we all three fell into a sound sleep CHAPTER XXIV WELL SAID OLD MOLE CANST THOU WORK I THE GROUND SO FAST By the next day we had forgotten all our sufferings At first I was wondering that I was no longer thirsty and I was for asking for the reason The answer came in the murmuring of the stream at my feet We breakfasted and drank of this excellent chalybeate water I felt wonderfully stronger and quite decided upon pushing on Why should not so firmly convinced a man as my uncle furnished with so industrious a guide as Hans and accompanied by so determined a nephew as myself go on to final success Such were the magnificent plans which struggled for mastery within me If it had been proposed to me to return to the summit of Snaefell I should have indignantly declined Most fortunately all we had to do was to descend Let us start I cried awakening by my shouts the echoes of the vaulted hollows of the earth On Thursday at eight a m we started afresh The granite tunnel winding from side to side earned us past unexpected turns and seemed almost to form a labyrinth but on the whole its direction seemed to be south easterly My uncle never ceased to consult his compass to keep account of the ground gone over The gallery dipped down a very little way from the horizontal scarcely more than two inches in a fathom and the stream ran gently murmuring at our feet I compared it to a friendly genius guiding us underground and caressed with my hand the soft naiad whose comforting voice accompanied our steps With my reviving spirits these mythological notions seemed to come unbidden As for my uncle he was beginning to storm against the horizontal road He loved nothing better than a vertical path but this way seemed indefinitely prolonged and instead of sliding along the hypothenuse as we were now doing he would willingly have dropped down the terrestrial radius But there was no help for it and as long as we were approaching the centre at all we felt that we must not complain From time to time a steeper path appeared our naiad then began to tumble before us with a hoarser murmur and we went down with her to a greater depth On the whole that day and the next we made considerable way horizontally very little vertically On Friday evening the tenth of July according to our calculations we were thirty leagues south east of Rejkiavik and at a depth of two leagues and a half At our feet there now opened a frightful abyss My uncle however was not to be daunted and he clapped his hands at the steepness of the descent This will take us a long way he cried and without much difficulty for the projections in the rock form quite a staircase The ropes were so fastened by Hans as to guard against accident and the descent commenced I can hardly call it perilous for I was beginning to be familiar with this kind of exercise This well or abyss was a narrow cleft in the mass of the granite called by geologists a fault and caused by the unequal cooling of the globe of the earth If it had at one time been a passage for eruptive matter thrown out by Snaefell I still could not understand why no trace was left of its passage We kept going down a kind of winding staircase which seemed almost to have been made by the hand of man Every quarter of an hour we were obliged to halt to take a little necessary repose and restore the action of our limbs We then sat down upon a fragment of rock and we talked as we ate and drank from the stream Of course down this fault the Hansbach fell in a cascade and lost some of its volume but there was enough and to spare to slake our thirst Besides when the incline became more gentle it would of course resume its peaceable course At this moment it reminded me of my worthy uncle in his frequent fits of impatience and anger while below it ran with the calmness of the Icelandic hunter On the sixth and seventh of July we kept following the spiral curves of this singular well penetrating in actual distance no more than two leagues but being carried to a depth of five leagues below the level of the sea But on the eighth about noon the fault took towards the south east a much gentler slope one of about forty five degrees Then the road became monotonously easy It could not be otherwise for there was no landscape to vary the stages of our journey On Wednesday the fifteenth we were seven leagues underground and had travelled fifty leagues away from Snaefell Although we were tired our health was perfect and the medicine chest had not yet had occasion to be opened My uncle noted every hour the indications of the compass the chronometer the aneroid and the thermometer the very same which he has published in his scientific report of our journey It was therefore not difficult to know exactly our whereabouts When he told me that we had gone fifty leagues horizontally I could not repress an exclamation of astonishment at the thought that we had now long left Iceland behind us What is the matter he cried I was reflecting that if your calculations are correct we are no longer under Iceland Do you think so I am not mistaken I said and examining the map I added We have passed Cape Portland and those fifty leagues bring us under the wide expanse of ocean Under the sea my uncle repeated rubbing his hands with delight Can it be I said Is the ocean spread above our heads
887_123289_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Of course Axel 
none	none	What can be more natural At Newcastle are there not coal mines extending far under the sea It was all very well for the Professor to call this so simple but I could not feel quite easy at the thought that the boundless ocean was rolling over my head And yet it really mattered very little whether it was the plains and mountains that covered our heads or the Atlantic waves as long as we were arched over by solid granite And besides I was getting used to this idea for the tunnel now running straight now winding as capriciously in its inclines as in its turnings but constantly preserving its south easterly direction and always running deeper was gradually carrying us to very great depths indeed Four days later Saturday the eighteenth of July in the evening we arrived at a kind of vast grotto and here my uncle paid Hans his weekly wages and it was settled that the next day Sunday should be a day of rest CHAPTER XXV DE PROFUNDIS I therefore awoke next day relieved from the preoccupation of an immediate start Although we were in the very deepest of known depths there was something not unpleasant about it And besides we were beginning to get accustomed to this troglodyte one life I no longer thought of sun moon and stars trees houses and towns nor of any of those terrestrial superfluities which are necessaries of men who live upon the earth s surface Being fossils we looked upon all those things as mere jokes The grotto was an immense apartment Along its granite floor ran our faithful stream At this distance from its spring the water was scarcely tepid and we drank of it with pleasure After breakfast the Professor gave a few hours to the arrangement of his daily notes First said he I will make a calculation to ascertain our exact position I hope after our return to draw a map of our journey which will be in reality a vertical section of the globe containing the track of our expedition That will be curious uncle but are your observations sufficiently accurate to enable you to do this correctly Yes I have everywhere observed the angles and the inclines I am sure there is no error Let us see where we are now Take your compass and note the direction I looked and replied carefully one tpwgln a hole dnw to creep into The name of an Ethiopian tribe who lived in caves and holes a hole and to creep into South east by east Well answered the Professor after a rapid calculation I infer that we have gone eighty five leagues since we started Therefore we are under mid Atlantic To be sure we are And perhaps at this very moment there is a storm above and ships over our heads are being rudely tossed by the tempest Quite probable And whales are lashing the roof of our prison with their tails It may be Axel but they won t shake us here But let us go back to our calculation Here we are eighty five leagues south east of Snaefell and I reckon that we are at a depth of sixteen leagues Sixteen leagues I cried No doubt Why this is the very limit assigned by science to the thickness of the crust of the earth I don t deny it And here according to the law of increasing temperature there ought to be a heat of twenty seven thirty two deg Fahr So there should my lad And all this solid granite ought to be running in fusion You see that it is not so and that as so often happens facts come to overthrow theories I am obliged to agree but after all it is surprising What does the thermometer say Twenty seven six tenths eighty two deg Fahr Therefore the savants are wrong by twenty seven oh five deg and the proportional increase is a mistake Therefore Humphry Davy was right and I am not wrong in following him What do you say now Nothing In truth I had a good deal to say I gave way in no respect to Davy s theory I still held to the central heat although I did not feel its effects I preferred to admit in truth that this chimney of an extinct volcano lined with lavas which are non conductors of heat did not suffer the heat to pass through its walls But without stopping to look up new arguments I simply took up our situation such as it was Well admitting all your calculations to be quite correct you must allow me to draw one rigid result therefrom What is it Speak freely At the latitude of Iceland where we now are the radius of the earth the distance from the centre to the surface is about fifteen eighty three leagues let us say in round numbers sixteen hundred leagues or four thousand eight hundred miles Out of sixteen hundred leagues we have gone twelve So you say And these twelve at a cost of eighty five leagues diagonally Exactly so In twenty days Yes Now sixteen leagues are the hundredth part of the earth s radius At this rate we shall be two thousand days or nearly five years and a half in getting to the centre No answer was vouchsafed to this rational conclusion Without reckoning too that if a vertical depth of sixteen leagues can be attained only by a diagonal descent of eighty four it follows that we must go eight thousand miles in a south easterly direction so that we shall emerge from some point in the earth s circumference instead of getting to the centre Confusion to all your figures and all your hypotheses besides shouted my uncle in a sudden rage What is the basis of them all How do you know that this passage does not run straight to our destination Besides there is a precedent What one man has done another may do I hope so but still I may be permitted You shall have my leave to hold your tongue Axel but not to talk in that irrational way I could see the awful Professor bursting through my uncle s skin and I took timely warning Now look at your aneroid What does that say It says we are under considerable pressure Very good so you see that by going gradually down and getting accustomed to the density of the atmosphere we don t suffer at all Nothing except a little pain in the ears That s nothing and you may get rid of even that by quick breathing whenever you feel the pain Exactly so I said determined not to say a word that might cross my uncle s prejudices There is even positive pleasure in living in this dense atmosphere Have you observed how intense sound is down here No doubt it is A deaf man would soon learn to hear perfectly But won t this density augment Yes according to a rather obscure law It is well known that the weight of bodies diminishes as fast as we descend You know that it is at the surface of the globe that weight is most sensibly felt and that at the centre there is no weight at all I am aware of that but tell me will not air at last acquire the density of water Of course under a pressure of seven hundred and ten atmospheres And how lower down still Lower down the density will still increase But how shall we go down then Why we must fill our pockets with stones Well indeed my worthy uncle you are never at a loss for an answer I dared venture no farther into the region of probabilities for I might presently have stumbled upon an impossibility which would have brought the Professor on the scene when he was not wanted Still it was evident that the air under a pressure which might reach that of thousands of atmospheres would at last reach the solid state and then even if our bodies could resist the strain we should be stopped and no reasonings would be able to get us on any farther But I did not advance this argument My uncle would have met it with his inevitable Saknussemm a precedent which possessed no weight with me for even if the journey of the learned Icelander were really attested there was one very simple answer that in the sixteenth century there was neither barometer or aneroid and therefore Saknussemm could not tell how far he had gone But I kept this objection to myself and waited the course of events The rest of the day was passed in calculations and in conversations I remained a steadfast adherent of the opinions of Professor Liedenbrock and I envied the stolid indifference of Hans who without going into causes and effects went on with his eyes shut wherever his destiny guided him CHAPTER XXVI THE WORST PERIL OF ALL It must be confessed that hitherto things had not gone on so badly and that I had small reason to complain If our difficulties became no worse we might hope to reach our end And to what a height of scientific glory we should then attain I had become quite a Liedenbrock in my reasonings seriously I had But would this state of things last in the strange place we had come to Perhaps it might For several days steeper inclines some even frightfully near to the perpendicular brought us deeper and deeper into the mass of the interior of the earth Some days we advanced nearer to the centre by a league and a half or nearly two leagues These were perilous descents in which the skill and marvellous coolness of Hans were invaluable to us That unimpassioned Icelander devoted himself with incomprehensible deliberation and thanks to him we crossed many a dangerous spot which we should never have cleared alone But his habit of silence gained upon him day by day and was infecting us External objects produce decided effects upon the brain A man shut up between four walls soon loses the power to associate words and ideas together How many prisoners in solitary confinement become idiots if not mad for want of exercise for the thinking faculty During the fortnight following our last conversation no incident occurred worthy of being recorded But I have good reason for remembering one very serious event which took place at this time and of which I could scarcely now forget the smallest details By the seventh of August our successive descents had brought us to a depth of thirty leagues that is that for a space of thirty leagues there were over our heads solid beds of rock ocean continents and towns We must have been two hundred leagues from Iceland On that day the tunnel went down a gentle slope I was ahead of the others My uncle was carrying one of Ruhmkorff s lamps and I the other I was examining the beds of granite Suddenly turning round I observed that I was alone Well well I thought I have been going too fast or Hans and my uncle have stopped on the way Come this won t do I must join them Fortunately there is not much of an ascent I retraced my steps I walked for a quarter of an hour I gazed into the darkness I shouted No reply my voice was lost in the midst of the cavernous echoes which alone replied to my call I began to feel uneasy A shudder ran through me Calmly I said aloud to myself I am sure to find my companions again There are not two roads I was too far ahead I will return For half an hour I climbed up I listened for a call and in that dense atmosphere a voice could reach very far But there was a dreary silence in all that long gallery I stopped I could not believe that I was lost I was only bewildered for a time not lost I was sure I should find my way again Come I repeated since there is but one road and they are on it I must find them again I have but to ascend still Unless indeed missing me and supposing me to be behind they too should have gone back But even in this case I have only to make the greater haste I shall find them I am sure I repeated these words in the fainter tones of a half convinced man Besides to associate even such simple ideas with words and reason with them was a work of time A doubt then seized upon me Was I indeed in advance when we became separated Yes to be sure I was Hans was after me preceding my uncle He had even stopped for a while to strap his baggage better over his shoulders I could remember this little incident It was at that very moment that I must have gone on Besides I thought have not I a guarantee that I shall not lose my way a clue in the labyrinth that cannot be broken my faithful stream I have but to trace it back and I must come upon them This conclusion revived my spirits and I resolved to resume my march without loss of time How I then blessed my uncle s foresight in preventing the hunter from stopping up the hole in the granite This beneficent spring after having satisfied our thirst on the road would now be my guide among the windings of the terrestrial crust Before starting afresh I thought a wash would do me good I stooped to bathe my face in the Hansbach To my stupefaction and utter dismay my feet trod only the rough dry granite The stream was no longer at my feet CHAPTER XXVII LOST IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH To describe my despair would be impossible No words could tell it I was buried alive with the prospect before me of dying of hunger and thirst Mechanically I swept the ground with my hands How dry and hard the rock seemed to me But how had I left the course of the stream For it was a terrible fact that it no longer ran at my side Then I understood the reason of that fearful silence when for the last time I listened to hear if any sound from my companions could reach my ears At the moment when I left the right road I had not noticed the absence of the stream It is evident that at that moment a deviation had presented itself before me whilst the Hansbach following the caprice of another incline had gone with my companions away into unknown depths How was I to return There was not a trace of their footsteps or of my own for the foot left no mark upon the granite floor I racked my brain for a solution of this impracticable problem One word described my position Lost Lost at an immeasurable depth Thirty leagues of rock seemed to weigh upon my shoulders with a dreadful pressure I felt crushed I tried to carry back my ideas to things on the surface of the earth I could scarcely succeed Hamburg the house in the Koenigstrasse my poor Graeuben all that busy world underneath which I was wandering about was passing in rapid confusion before my terrified memory I could revive with vivid reality all the incidents of our voyage Iceland M Fridrikssen Snaefell I said to myself that if in such a position as I was now in I was fool enough to cling to one glimpse of hope it would be madness and that the best thing I could do was to despair What human power could restore me to the light of the sun by rending asunder the huge arches of rock which united over my head buttressing each other with impregnable strength Who could place my feet on the right path and bring me back to my company Oh my uncle burst from my lips in the tone of despair It was my only word of reproach for I knew how much he must be suffering in seeking me wherever he might be When I saw myself thus far removed from all earthly help I had recourse to heavenly succour The remembrance of my childhood the recollection of my mother whom I had only known in my tender early years came back to me and I knelt in prayer imploring for the Divine help of which I was so little worthy This return of trust in God s providence allayed the turbulence of my fears and I was enabled to concentrate upon my situation all the force of my intelligence I had three days provisions with me and my flask was full But I could not remain alone for long Should I go up or down Up of course up continually I must thus arrive at the point where I had left the stream that fatal turn in the road With the stream at my feet I might hope to regain the summit of Snaefell Why had I not thought of that sooner Here was evidently a chance of safety The most pressing duty was to find out again the course of the Hansbach I rose and leaning upon my iron pointed stick I ascended the gallery The slope was rather steep I walked on without hope but without indecision like a man who has made up his mind For half an hour I met with no obstacle I tried to recognise my way by the form of the tunnel by the projections of certain rocks by the disposition of the fractures But no particular sign appeared and I soon saw that this gallery could not bring me back to the turning point It came to an abrupt end I struck against an impenetrable wall and fell down upon the rock Unspeakable despair then seized upon me I lay overwhelmed aghast My last hope was shattered against this granite wall Lost in this labyrinth whose windings crossed each other in all directions it was no use to think of flight any longer Here I must die the most dreadful of deaths And strange to say the thought came across me that when some day my petrified remains should be found thirty leagues below the surface in the bowels of the earth the discovery might lead to grave scientific discussions I tried to speak aloud but hoarse sounds alone passed my dry lips I panted for breath In the midst of my agony a new terror laid hold of me In falling my lamp had got wrong I could not set it right and its light was paling and would soon disappear altogether I gazed painfully upon the luminous current growing weaker and weaker in the wire coil A dim procession of moving shadows seemed slowly unfolding down the darkening walls I scarcely dared to shut my eyes for one moment for fear of losing the least glimmer of this precious light Every instant it seemed about to vanish and the dense blackness to come rolling in palpably upon me One last trembling glimmer shot feebly up I watched it in trembling and anxiety I drank it in as if I could preserve it concentrating upon it the full power of my eyes as upon the very last sensation of light which they were ever to experience and the next moment I lay in the heavy gloom of deep thick unfathomable darkness A terrible cry of anguish burst from me Upon earth in the midst of the darkest night light never abdicates its functions altogether It is still subtle and diffusive but whatever little there may be the eye still catches that little Here there was not an atom the total darkness made me totally blind Then I began to lose my head I arose with my arms stretched out before me attempting painfully to feel my way I began to run wildly hurrying through the inextricable maze still descending still running through the substance of the earth s thick crust a struggling denizen of geological faults crying shouting yelling soon bruised by contact with the jagged rock falling and rising again bleeding trying to drink the blood which covered my face and even waiting for some rock to shatter my skull against I shall never know whither my mad career took me After the lapse of some hours no doubt exhausted I fell like a lifeless lump at the foot of the wall and lost all consciousness CHAPTER XXVIII THE RESCUE IN THE WHISPERING GALLERY When I returned to partial life my face was wet with tears How long that state of insensibility had lasted I cannot say I had no means now of taking account of time Never was solitude equal to this never had any living being been so utterly forsaken After my fall I had lost a good deal of blood I felt it flowing over me Ah how happy I should have been could I have died and if death were not yet to be gone through I would think no longer I drove away every idea and conquered by my grief I rolled myself to the foot of the opposite wall Already I was feeling the approach of another faint and was hoping for complete annihilation when a loud noise reached me It was like the distant rumble of continuous thunder and I could hear its sounding undulations rolling far away into the remote recesses of the abyss Whence could this noise proceed It must be from some phenomenon proceeding in the great depths amidst which I lay helpless Was it an explosion of gas Was it the fall of some mighty pillar of the globe I listened still I wanted to know if the noise would be repeated A quarter of an hour passed away Silence reigned in this gallery I could not hear even the beating of my heart Suddenly my ear resting by chance against the wall caught or seemed to catch certain vague indescribable distant articulate sounds as of words This is a delusion I thought But it was not Listening more attentively I heard in reality a murmuring of voices But my weakness prevented me from understanding what the voices said Yet it was language I was sure of it For a moment I feared the words might be my own brought back by the echo Perhaps I had been crying out unknown to myself I closed my lips firmly and laid my ear against the wall again Yes truly some one is speaking those are words Even a few feet from the wall I could hear distinctly I succeeded in catching uncertain strange undistinguishable words They came as if pronounced in low murmured whispers The word forlorad was several times repeated in a tone of sympathy and sorrow Help I cried with all my might Help I listened I watched in the darkness for an answer a cry a mere breath of sound but nothing came Some minutes passed A whole world of ideas had opened in my mind I thought that my weakened voice could never penetrate to my companions It is they I repeated What other men can be thirty leagues under ground I again began to listen Passing my ear over the wall from one place to another I found the point where the voices seemed to be best heard The word forlorad again returned then the rolling of thunder which had roused me from my lethargy No I said no it is not through such a mass that a voice can be heard I am surrounded by granite walls and the loudest explosion could never be heard here This noise comes along the gallery There must be here some remarkable exercise of acoustic laws I listened again and this time yes this time I did distinctly hear my name pronounced across the wide interval It was my uncle s own voice He was talking to the guide And forlorad is a Danish word Then I understood it all To make myself heard I must speak along this wall which would conduct the sound of my voice just as wire conducts electricity But there was no time to lose If my companions moved but a few steps away the acoustic phenomenon would cease I therefore approached the wall and pronounced these words as clearly as possible Uncle Liedenbrock I waited with the deepest anxiety Sound does not travel with great velocity Even increased density air has no effect upon its rate of travelling it merely augments its intensity Seconds which seemed ages passed away and at last these words reached me Axel Axel is it you Yes yes I replied My boy where are you Lost in the deepest darkness Where is your lamp It is out And the stream Disappeared Axel Axel take courage Wait I am exhausted I can t answer Speak to me Courage resumed my uncle Don t speak Listen to me We have looked for you up the gallery and down the gallery Could not find you I wept for you my poor boy At last supposing you were still on the Hansbach we fired our guns Our voices are audible to each other but our hands cannot touch But don t despair Axel It is a great thing that we can hear each other During this time I had been reflecting A vague hope was returning to my heart There was one thing I must know to begin with I placed my lips close to the wall saying My uncle My boy came to me after a few seconds We must know how far we are apart That is easy You have your chronometer Yes Well take it Pronounce my name noting exactly the second when you speak I will repeat it as soon as it shall come to me and you will observe the exact moment when you get my answer Yes and half the time between my call and your answer will exactly indicate that which my voice will take in coming to you Just so my uncle Are you ready Yes Now attention I am going to call your name I put my ear to the wall and as soon as the name Axel came I immediately replied Axel then waited Forty seconds said my uncle Forty seconds between the two words so the sound takes twenty seconds in coming Now at the rate of eleven twenty feet in a second this is twenty two thousand four hundred feet or four miles and a quarter nearly Four miles and a quarter I murmured It will soon be over Axel Must I go up or down Down for this reason We are in a vast chamber with endless galleries Yours must lead into it for it seems as if all the clefts and fractures of the globe radiated round this vast cavern So get up and begin walking Walk on drag yourself along if necessary slide down the steep places and at the end you will find us ready to receive you Now begin moving These words cheered me up Good bye uncle I cried I am going There will be no more voices heard when once I have started So good bye Good bye Axel au revoir These were the last words I heard This wonderful underground conversation carried on with a distance of four miles and a quarter between us concluded with these words of hope I thanked God from my heart for it was He who had conducted me through those vast solitudes to the point where alone of all others perhaps the voices of my companions could have reached me This acoustic effect is easily explained on scientific grounds It arose from the concave form of the gallery and the conducting power of the rock There are many examples of this propagation of sounds which remain unheard in the intermediate space I remember that a similar phenomenon has been observed in many places amongst others on the internal surface of the gallery of the dome of saint Paul s in London and especially in the midst of the curious caverns among the quarries near Syracuse the most wonderful of which is called Dionysius Ear These remembrances came into my mind and I clearly saw that since my uncle s voice really reached me there could be no obstacle between us Following the direction by which the sound came of course I should arrive in his presence if my strength did not fail me I therefore rose I rather dragged myself than walked The slope was rapid and I slid down Soon the swiftness of the descent increased horribly and threatened to become a fall I no longer had the strength to stop myself Suddenly there was no ground under me I felt myself revolving in air striking and rebounding against the craggy projections of a vertical gallery quite a well my head struck against a sharp corner of the rock and I became unconscious CHAPTER XXIX THALATTA THALATTA When I came to myself I was stretched in half darkness covered with thick coats and blankets My uncle was watching over me to discover the least sign of life At my first sigh he took my hand when I opened my eyes he uttered a cry of joy He lives he lives he cried Yes I am still alive I answered feebly My dear nephew said my uncle pressing me to his breast you are saved I was deeply touched with the tenderness of his manner as he uttered these words and still more with the care with which he watched over me But such trials were wanted to bring out the Professor s tenderer qualities At this moment Hans came he saw my hand in my uncle s and I may safely say that there was joy in his countenance God dag said he How do you do Hans How are you And now uncle tell me where we are at the present moment To morrow Axel to morrow Now you are too faint and weak I have bandaged your head with compresses which must not be disturbed Sleep now and to morrow I will tell you all But do tell me what time it is and what day It is Sunday the eighth of August and it is ten at night You must ask me no more questions until the tenth In truth I was very weak and my eyes involuntarily closed I wanted a good night s rest and I therefore went off to sleep with the knowledge that I had been four long days alone in the heart of the earth Next morning on awakening I looked round me My couch made up of all our travelling gear was in a charming grotto adorned with splendid stalactites and the soil of which was a fine sand It was half light There was no torch no lamp yet certain mysterious glimpses of light came from without through a narrow opening in the grotto I heard too a vague and indistinct noise something like the murmuring of waves breaking upon a shingly shore and at times I seemed to hear the whistling of wind I wondered whether I was awake whether I was dreaming whether my brain crazed by my fall was not affected by imaginary noises Yet neither eyes nor ears could be so utterly deceived It is a ray of daylight I thought sliding in through this cleft in the rock That is indeed the murmuring of waves That is the rustling noise of wind Am I quite mistaken or have we returned to the surface of the earth Has my uncle given up the expedition or is it happily terminated I was asking myself these unanswerable questions when the Professor entered Good morning Axel he cried cheerily I feel sure you are better Yes I am indeed said I sitting up on my couch You can hardly fail to be better for you have slept quietly Hans and I watched you by turns and we have noticed you were evidently recovering Indeed I do feel a great deal better and I will give you a proof of that presently if you will let me have my breakfast You shall eat lad The fever has left you Hans rubbed your wounds with some ointment or other of which the Icelanders keep the secret and they have healed marvellously Our hunter is a splendid fellow Whilst he went on talking my uncle prepared a few provisions which I devoured eagerly notwithstanding his advice to the contrary All the while I was overwhelming him with questions which he answered readily I then learnt that my providential fall had brought me exactly to the extremity of an almost perpendicular shaft and as I had landed in the midst of an accompanying torrent of stones the least of which would have been enough to crush me the conclusion was that a loose portion of the rock had come down with me This frightful conveyance had thus carried me into the arms of my uncle where I fell bruised bleeding and insensible Truly it is wonderful that you have not been killed a hundred times over But for the love of God don t let us ever separate again or we many never see each other more Not separate Is the journey not over then I opened a pair of astonished eyes which immediately called for the question What is the matter Axel I have a question to ask you You say that I am safe and sound No doubt you are And all my limbs unbroken Certainly And my head Your head except for a few bruises is all right and it is on your shoulders where it ought to be Well I am afraid my brain is affected Your mind affected Yes I fear so Are we again on the surface of the globe No certainly not Then I must be mad for don t I see the light of day and don t I hear the wind blowing and the sea breaking on the shore Ah is that all Do tell me all about it I can t explain the inexplicable but you will soon see and understand that geology has not yet learnt all it has to learn Then let us go I answered quickly No Axel the open air might be bad for you Open air Yes the wind is rather strong You must not expose yourself But I assure you I am perfectly well A little patience my nephew A relapse might get us into trouble and we have no time to lose for the voyage may be a long one The voyage Yes rest to day and to morrow we will set sail Set sail and I almost leaped up What did it all mean Had we a river a lake a sea to depend upon Was there a ship at our disposal in some underground harbour My curiosity was highly excited my uncle vainly tried to restrain me When he saw that my impatience was doing me harm he yielded I dressed in haste For greater safety I wrapped myself in a blanket and came out of the grotto 
724_123283_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XXX 
none	none	A NEW MARE INTERNUM 
724_123283_000003_000000	train-clean-360	At first I could hardly see anything 
724_123283_000003_000001	train-clean-360	My eyes unaccustomed to the light quickly closed 
724_123283_000003_000002	train-clean-360	When I was able to reopen them I stood more stupefied even than surprised 
724_123283_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 The sea I cried 
724_123283_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes my uncle replied the Liedenbrock Sea and I don t suppose any other discoverer will ever dispute my claim to name it after myself as its first discoverer 
none	none	A vast sheet of water the commencement of a lake or an ocean spread far away beyond the range of the eye reminding me forcibly of that open sea which drew from Xenophon s ten thousand Greeks after their long retreat the simultaneous cry Thalatta thalatta the sea the sea 
724_123283_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine shining sand softly lapped by the waves and strewn with the small shells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings 
724_123283_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The waves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to vast inclosed spaces 
724_123283_000006_000003	train-clean-360	A light foam flew over the waves before the breath of a moderate breeze and some of the spray fell upon my face On this slightly inclining shore about a hundred fathoms from the limit of the waves came down the foot of a huge wall of vast cliffs which rose majestically to an enormous height 
none	none	Some of these dividing the beach with their sharp spurs formed capes and promontories worn away by the ceaseless action of the surf 
724_123283_000006_000005	train-clean-360	Farther on the eye discerned their massive outline sharply defined against the hazy distant horizon 
724_123283_000007_000000	train-clean-360	It was quite an ocean with the irregular shores of earth but desert and frightfully wild in appearance 
724_123283_000008_000000	train-clean-360	If my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea it was because a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it 
724_123283_000008_000001	train-clean-360	It was not the light of the sun with his dazzling shafts of brightness and the splendour of his rays nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer of the moonbeams the dim reflection of a nobler body of light 
none	none	No the illuminating power of this light its trembling diffusiveness its bright clear whiteness and its low temperature showed that it must be of electric origin 
724_123283_000008_000003	train-clean-360	It was like an aurora borealis a continuous cosmical phenomenon filling a cavern of sufficient extent to contain an ocean 
724_123283_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The vault that spanned the space above the sky if it could be called so seemed composed of vast plains of cloud shifting and variable vapours which by their condensation must at certain times fall in torrents of rain 
724_123283_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I should have thought that under so powerful a pressure of the atmosphere there could be no evaporation and yet under a law unknown to me there were broad tracts of vapour suspended in the air 
none	none	But then the weather was fine The play of the electric light produced singular effects upon the upper strata of cloud 
724_123283_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Deep shadows reposed upon their lower wreaths and often between two separated fields of cloud there glided down a ray of unspeakable lustre 
none	none	But it was not solar light and there was no heat 
724_123283_000009_000005	train-clean-360	The general effect was sad supremely melancholy 
none	none	Instead of the shining firmament spangled with its innumerable stars shining singly or in clusters I felt that all these subdued and shaded lights were ribbed in by vast walls of granite which seemed to overpower me with their weight and that all this space great as it was would not be enough for the march of the humblest of satellites Then I remembered the theory of an English captain who likened the earth to a vast hollow sphere in the interior of which the air became luminous because of the vast pressure that weighed upon it while two stars Pluto and Proserpine rolled within upon the circuit of their mysterious orbits We were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation Its width could not be estimated since the shore ran widening as far as eye could reach nor could its length for the dim horizon bounded the new 
724_123283_000011_000002	train-clean-360	As for its height it must have been several leagues 
724_123283_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Where this vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell but there was a cloud hanging far above the height of which we estimated at twelve thousand feet a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour and no doubt due to the great density of the air 
724_123283_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The word cavern does not convey any idea of this immense space words of human tongue are inadequate to describe the discoveries of him who ventures into the deep abysses of earth 
724_123283_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Besides I could not tell upon what geological theory to account for the existence of such an excavation 
724_123283_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Had the cooling of the globe produced it 
none	none	I knew of celebrated caverns from the descriptions of travellers but had never heard of any of such dimensions as this 
724_123283_000014_000000	train-clean-360	If the grotto of Guachara in Colombia visited by Humboldt had not given up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher who investigated it to the depth of twenty five hundred feet it probably did not extend much farther 
none	none	The immense mammoth cave in Kentucky is of gigantic proportions since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet one above the level of an unfathomable lake and travellers have explored its ramifications to the extent of forty miles 
724_123283_000014_000002	train-clean-360	But what were these cavities compared to that in which I stood with wonder and admiration with its sky of luminous vapours its bursts of electric light and a vast sea filling its bed 
724_123283_000014_000003	train-clean-360	My imagination fell powerless before such immensity 
none	none	I gazed upon these wonders in silence 
724_123283_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Words failed me to express my feelings 
724_123283_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I felt as if I was in some distant planet Uranus or Neptune and in the presence of phenomena of which my terrestrial experience gave me no cognisance 
none	none	For such novel sensations new words were wanted and my imagination failed to supply them I gazed I thought I admired with a stupefaction mingled with a certain amount of fear The unforeseen nature of this spectacle brought back the colour to my cheeks I was under a new course of treatment with the aid of astonishment and my convalescence was promoted by this novel system of therapeutics besides the dense and breezy air invigorated me supplying more oxygen to my lungs 
724_123283_000017_000000	train-clean-360	It will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles 
none	none	one One hundred and twenty Trans I was delighted to leave my dark grotto 
724_123283_000019_000001	train-clean-360	My uncle already familiar with these wonders had ceased to feel surprise 
none	none	You feel strong enough to walk a little way now he asked Yes certainly and nothing could be more delightful
724_123283_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Well take my arm Axel and let us follow the windings of the shore 
724_123283_000023_000000	train-clean-360	I eagerly accepted and we began to coast along this new sea 
724_123283_000023_000001	train-clean-360	On the left huge pyramids of rock piled one upon another produced a prodigious titanic effect 
none	none	Down their sides flowed numberless waterfalls which went on their way in brawling but pellucid streams A few light vapours leaping from rock to rock denoted the place of hot springs and streams flowed softly down to the common basin gliding down the gentle slopes with a softer murmur 
724_123283_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Amongst these streams I recognised our faithful travelling companion the Hansbach coming to lose its little volume quietly in the mighty sea just as if it had done nothing else since the beginning of the world 
724_123283_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 We shall see it no more I said with a sigh 
none	none	What matters replied the philosopher whether this or another serves to guide us I thought him rather ungrateful 
724_123283_000028_000000	train-clean-360	But at that moment my attention was drawn to an unexpected sight 
724_123283_000028_000001	train-clean-360	At a distance of five hundred paces at the turn of a high promontory appeared a high tufted dense forest 
724_123283_000028_000002	train-clean-360	It was composed of trees of moderate height formed like umbrellas with exact geometrical outlines 
724_123283_000028_000003	train-clean-360	The currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon their shape and in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved and firm just like a clump of petrified cedars 
none	none	I hastened forward 
724_123283_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I could not give any name to these singular creations 
724_123283_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Were they some of the two hundred thousand species of vegetables known hitherto and did they claim a place of their own in the lacustrine flora 
724_123283_000029_000003	train-clean-360	No when we arrived under their shade my surprise turned into admiration 
724_123283_000029_000004	train-clean-360	There stood before me productions of earth but of gigantic stature which my uncle immediately named 
724_123283_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 It is only a forest of mushrooms said he 
724_123283_000031_000000	train-clean-360	And he was right 
none	none	Imagine the large development attained by these plants which prefer a warm moist climate I knew that the Lycopodon giganteum attains according to Bulliard a circumference of eight or nine feet but here were pale mushrooms thirty to forty feet high and crowned with a cap of equal diameter 
724_123283_000031_000003	train-clean-360	There they stood in thousands 
724_123283_000031_000004	train-clean-360	No light could penetrate between their huge cones and complete darkness reigned beneath those giants they formed settlements of domes placed in close array like the round thatched roofs of a central African city 
724_123283_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Yet I wanted to penetrate farther underneath though a chill fell upon me as soon as I came under those cellular vaults 
none	none	For half an hour we wandered from side to side in the damp shades and it was a comfortable and pleasant change to arrive once more upon the sea shore 
724_123283_000033_000000	train-clean-360	But the subterranean vegetation was not confined to these fungi Farther on rose groups of tall trees of colourless foliage and easy to recognise 
724_123283_000033_000001	train-clean-360	They were lowly shrubs of earth here attaining gigantic size lycopodiums a hundred feet high the huge sigillaria found in our coal mines tree ferns as tall as our fir trees in northern latitudes lepidodendra with cylindrical forked stems terminated by long leaves and bristling with rough hairs like those of the cactus 
724_123283_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Wonderful magnificent splendid cried my uncle 
724_123283_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 Here is the entire flora of the second period of the world the transition period 
724_123283_000034_000002	train-clean-360	These humble garden plants with us were tall trees in the early ages 
none	none	Look Axel and admire it all 
724_123283_000034_000004	train-clean-360	Never had botanist such a feast as this 
none	none	You are right my uncle 
724_123283_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Providence seems to have preserved in this immense conservatory the antediluvian plants which the wisdom of philosophers has so sagaciously put together again 
724_123283_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 It is a conservatory Axel but is it not also a menagerie 
none	none	Surely not a menagerie
724_123283_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes no doubt of it 
724_123283_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Look at that dust under your feet see the bones scattered on the ground 
none	none	So there are I cried bones of extinct animals 
724_123283_000040_000000	train-clean-360	I had rushed upon these remains formed of indestructible phosphates of lime and without hesitation I named these monstrous bones which lay scattered about like decayed trunks of trees 
none	none	Here is the lower jaw of a mastodon one I said
724_123283_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 These are the molar teeth of the deinotherium this femur must have belonged to the greatest of those beasts the megatherium 
724_123283_000041_000002	train-clean-360	It certainly is a menagerie for these remains were not brought here by a deluge 
none	none	The animals to which they belonged roamed on the shores of this subterranean sea under the shade of those arborescent trees 
724_123283_000041_000004	train-clean-360	Here are entire skeletons 
724_123283_000041_000005	train-clean-360	And yet I cannot understand the appearance of these quadrupeds in a granite cavern 
none	none	one These animals belonged to a late geological period the Pliocene just before the glacial epoch and therefore could have no connection with the carboniferous vegetation Trans Why
724_123283_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Because animal life existed upon the earth only in the secondary period when a sediment of soil had been deposited by the rivers and taken the place of the incandescent rocks of the primitive period 
none	none	Well Axel there is a very simple answer to your objection that this soil is alluvial What at such a depth below the surface of the earth
724_123283_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 No doubt and there is a geological explanation of the fact 
none	none	At a certain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust or bark alternately acted on by forces from above or below according to the laws of attraction and gravitation 
724_123283_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Probably there were subsidences of the outer crust when a portion of the sedimentary deposits was carried down sudden openings 
724_123283_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 That may be I replied but if there have been creatures now extinct in these underground regions why may not some of those monsters be now roaming through these gloomy forests or hidden behind the steep crags 
724_123283_000049_000000	train-clean-360	And as this unpleasant notion got hold of me I surveyed with anxious scrutiny the open spaces before me but no living creature appeared upon the barren strand 
724_123283_000050_000000	train-clean-360	I felt rather tired and went to sit down at the end of a promontory at the foot of which the waves came and beat themselves into spray Thence my eye could sweep every part of the bay within its extremity a little harbour was formed between the pyramidal cliffs where the still waters slept untouched by the boisterous winds 
none	none	A brig and two or three schooners might have moored within it in safety 
724_123283_000050_000002	train-clean-360	I almost fancied I should presently see some ship issue from it full sail and take to the open sea under the southern breeze 
724_123283_000051_000000	train-clean-360	But this illusion lasted a very short time 
724_123283_000051_000001	train-clean-360	We were the only living creatures in this subterranean world 
724_123283_000051_000002	train-clean-360	When the wind lulled a deeper silence than that of the deserts fell upon the arid naked rocks and weighed upon the surface of the ocean 
none	none	I then desired to pierce the distant haze and to rend asunder the mysterious curtain that hung across the horizon 
724_123283_000051_000004	train-clean-360	Anxious queries arose to my lips 
724_123283_000051_000005	train-clean-360	Where did that sea terminate 
724_123283_000051_000006	train-clean-360	Where did it lead to 
none	none	Should we ever know anything about its opposite shores 
724_123283_000052_000000	train-clean-360	My uncle made no doubt about it at all I both desired and feared 
none	none	After spending an hour in the contemplation of this marvellous spectacle we returned to the shore to regain the grotto and I fell asleep in the midst of the strangest thoughts 
724_123284_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XXXI 
none	none	PREPARATIONS FOR A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY 
724_123284_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The next morning I awoke feeling perfectly well 
none	none	I thought a bathe would do me good and I went to plunge for a few minutes into the waters of this mediterranean sea for assuredly it better deserved this name than any other sea 
724_123284_000005_000000	train-clean-360	I came back to breakfast with a good appetite 
724_123284_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Hans was a good caterer for our little household he had water and fire at his disposal so that he was able to vary our bill of fare now and then For dessert he gave us a few cups of coffee and never was coffee so delicious 
724_123284_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Now said my uncle now is the time for high tide and we must not lose the opportunity to study this phenomenon 
724_123284_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 What the tide I cried 
724_123284_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Can the influence of the sun and moon be felt down here 
none	none	Why not Are not all bodies subject throughout their mass to the power of universal attraction 
724_123284_000008_000002	train-clean-360	This mass of water cannot escape the general law 
724_123284_000008_000003	train-clean-360	And in spite of the heavy atmospheric pressure on the surface you will see it rise like the Atlantic itself 
none	none	At the same moment we reached the sand on the shore and the waves were by slow degrees encroaching on the shore
724_123284_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Here is the tide rising I cried 
none	none	Yes Axel and judging by these ridges of foam you may observe that the sea will rise about twelve feet
724_123284_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 This is wonderful I said 
none	none	No it is quite natural You may say so uncle but to me it is most extraordinary and I can hardly believe my eyes 
724_123284_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Who would ever have imagined under this terrestrial crust an ocean with ebbing and flowing tides with winds and storms 
724_123284_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Well replied my uncle is there any scientific reason against it 
none	none	No I see none as soon as the theory of central heat is given up So then thus far he answered the theory of Sir Humphry Davy is confirmed Evidently it is and now there is no reason why there should not be seas and continents in the interior of the earth No doubt said my uncle and inhabited too
724_123284_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 To be sure said I and why should not these waters yield to us fishes of unknown species 
724_123284_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 At any rate he replied we have not seen any yet 
none	none	Well let us make some lines and see if the bait will draw here as it does in sublunary regions
724_123284_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 We will try Axel for we must penetrate all secrets of these newly discovered regions 
724_123284_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 But where are we uncle for I have not yet asked you that question and your instruments must be able to furnish the answer 
724_123284_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Horizontally three hundred and fifty leagues from Iceland 
724_123284_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 So much as that 
724_123284_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sure of not being a mile out of my reckoning 
724_123284_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 And does the compass still show south east 
none	none	Yes with a westerly deviation of nineteen degrees forty five minutes just as above ground As for its dip a curious fact is coming to light which I have observed carefully that the needle instead of dipping towards the pole as in the northern hemisphere on the contrary rises from it
724_123284_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Would you then conclude I said that the magnetic pole is somewhere between the surface of the globe and the point where we are 
724_123284_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Exactly so and it is likely enough that if we were to reach the spot beneath the polar regions about that seventy first degree where Sir James Ross has discovered the magnetic pole to be situated we should see the needle point straight up 
724_123284_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore that mysterious centre of attraction is at no great depth 
724_123284_000031_000000	train-clean-360	I remarked It is so and here is a fact which science has scarcely suspected 
724_123284_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Science my lad has been built upon many errors but they are errors which it was good to fall into for they led to the truth 
724_123284_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 What depth have we now reached 
724_123284_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 We are thirty five leagues below the surface 
none	none	So I said examining the map the Highlands of Scotland are over our heads and the Grampians are raising their rugged summits above us
724_123284_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes answered the Professor laughing 
none	none	It is rather a heavy weight to bear but a solid arch spans over our heads 
724_123284_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The great Architect has built it of the best materials and never could man have given it so wide a stretch 
724_123284_000036_000003	train-clean-360	What are the finest arches of bridges and the arcades of cathedrals compared with this far reaching vault with a radius of three leagues beneath which a wide and tempest tossed ocean may flow at its ease 
724_123284_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I am not afraid that it will fall down upon my head 
724_123284_000037_000001	train-clean-360	But now what are your plans 
724_123284_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Are you not thinking of returning to the surface now 
none	none	Return no indeed We will continue our journey everything having gone on well so far
724_123284_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 But how are we to get down below this liquid surface 
724_123284_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I am not going to dive head foremost 
724_123284_000040_000001	train-clean-360	But if all oceans are properly speaking but lakes since they are encompassed by land of course this internal sea will be surrounded by a coast of granite and on the opposite shores we shall find fresh passages opening 
724_123284_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 How long do you suppose this sea to be 
724_123284_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Thirty or forty leagues so that we have no time to lose and we shall set sail to morrow 
none	none	I looked about for a ship
724_123284_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Set sail shall we 
724_123284_000044_000001	train-clean-360	But I should like to see my boat first 
724_123284_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 It will not be a boat at all but a good well made raft 
724_123284_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I said a raft would be just as hard to make as a boat and I don t see 
724_123284_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I know you don t see but you might hear if you would listen 
724_123284_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Don t you hear the hammer at work 
none	none	Hans is already busy at it What has he already felled the trees Oh the trees were already down 
724_123284_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Come and you will see for yourself 
724_123284_000050_000000	train-clean-360	After half an hour s walking on the other side of the promontory which formed the little natural harbour I perceived Hans at work 
724_123284_000050_000001	train-clean-360	In a few more steps I was at his side 
724_123284_000050_000002	train-clean-360	To my great surprise a half finished raft was already lying on the sand made of a peculiar kind of wood and a great number of planks straight and bent and of frames were covering the ground enough almost for a little fleet 
724_123284_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Uncle what wood is this I cried 
724_123284_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 It is fir pine or birch and other northern coniferae mineralised by the action of the sea 
724_123284_000052_000001	train-clean-360	It is called surturbrand a variety of brown coal or lignite found chiefly in Iceland 
none	none	But surely then like other fossil wood it must be as hard as stone and cannot float Sometimes that may happen some of these woods become true anthracites but others such as this have only gone through the first stage of fossil transformation 
724_123284_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Just look added my uncle throwing into the sea one of those precious waifs 
724_123284_000055_000000	train-clean-360	The bit of wood after disappearing returned to the surface and oscillated to and fro with the waves 
724_123284_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you convinced said my uncle 
724_123284_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I am quite convinced although it is incredible 
724_123284_000058_000000	train-clean-360	By next evening thanks to the industry and skill of our guide the raft was made 
none	none	It was ten feet by five the planks of surturbrand braced strongly together with cords presented an even surface and when launched this improvised vessel floated easily upon the waves of the Liedenbrock Sea 
724_123285_000003_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XXXII 
none	none	WONDERS OF THE DEEP 
724_123285_000005_000000	train-clean-360	On the thirteenth of August we awoke early 
724_123285_000005_000001	train-clean-360	We were now to begin to adopt a mode of travelling both more expeditious and less fatiguing than hitherto 
724_123285_000006_000000	train-clean-360	A mast was made of two poles spliced together a yard was made of a third a blanket borrowed from our coverings made a tolerable sail There was no want of cordage for the rigging and everything was well and firmly made 
724_123285_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The provisions the baggage the instruments the guns and a good quantity of fresh water from the rocks around all found their proper places on board and at six the Professor gave the signal to embark Hans had fitted up a rudder to steer his vessel 
724_123285_000007_000001	train-clean-360	He took the tiller and unmoored the sail was set and we were soon afloat 
724_123285_000007_000002	train-clean-360	At the moment of leaving the harbour my uncle who was tenaciously fond of naming his new discoveries wanted to give it a name and proposed mine amongst others 
724_123285_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 But I have a better to propose I said Grauben 
none	none	Let it be called Port Graeuben it will look very well upon the map Port Graeuben let it be then And so the cherished remembrance of my Virlandaise became associated with our adventurous expedition 
724_123285_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The wind was from the north west 
724_123285_000011_000001	train-clean-360	We went with it at a high rate of speed 
724_123285_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The dense atmosphere acted with great force and impelled us swiftly on 
none	none	In an hour my uncle had been able to estimate our progress 
724_123285_000012_000001	train-clean-360	At this rate he said we shall make thirty leagues in twenty four hours and we shall soon come in sight of the opposite shore 
724_123285_000013_000000	train-clean-360	I made no answer but went and sat forward 
none	none	The northern shore was already beginning to dip under the horizon 
724_123285_000013_000002	train-clean-360	The eastern and western strands spread wide as if to bid us farewell 
724_123285_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Before our eyes lay far and wide a vast sea shadows of great clouds swept heavily over its silver grey surface the glistening bluish rays of electric light here and there reflected by the dancing drops of spray shot out little sheaves of light from the track we left in our rear 
724_123285_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Soon we entirely lost sight of land no object was left for the eye to judge by and but for the frothy track of the raft I might have thought we were standing still 
none	none	About twelve immense shoals of seaweeds came in sight 
724_123285_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I was aware of the great powers of vegetation that characterise these plants which grow at a depth of twelve thousand feet reproduce themselves under a pressure of four hundred atmospheres and sometimes form barriers strong enough to impede the course of a ship 
none	none	But never I think were such seaweeds as those which we saw floating in immense waving lines upon the sea of Liedenbrock Our raft skirted the whole length of the fuci three or four thousand feet long undulating like vast serpents beyond the reach of sight I found some amusement in tracing these endless waves always thinking I should come to the end of them and for hours my patience was vying with my surprise What natural force could have produced such plants and what must have been the appearance of the earth in the first ages of its formation when under the action of heat and moisture the vegetable kingdom alone was developing on its surface 
724_123285_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Evening came and as on the previous day I perceived no change in the luminous condition of the air 
724_123285_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It was a constant condition the permanency of which might be relied upon 
724_123285_000018_000000	train-clean-360	After supper I laid myself down at the foot of the mast and fell asleep in the midst of fantastic reveries 
724_123285_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Hans keeping fast by the helm let the raft run on which after all needed no steering the wind blowing directly aft 
none	none	Since our departure from Port Graeuben Professor Liedenbrock had entrusted the log to my care I was to register every observation make entries of interesting phenomena the direction of the wind the rate of sailing the way we made in a word every particular of our singular voyage 
724_123285_000021_000000	train-clean-360	I shall therefore reproduce here these daily notes written so to speak as the course of events directed in order to furnish an exact narrative of our passage 
none	none	Friday August fourteen Wind steady N W The raft makes rapid way in a direct line Coast thirty leagues to leeward 
724_123285_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Nothing in sight before us 
724_123285_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Intensity of light the same 
724_123285_000022_000005	train-clean-360	Weather fine that is to say that the clouds are flying high are light and bathed in a white atmosphere resembling silver in a state of fusion 
none	none	Therm eighty nine deg Fahr 
724_123285_000023_000000	train-clean-360	At noon Hans prepared a hook at the end of a line 
724_123285_000023_000001	train-clean-360	He baited it with a small piece of meat and flung it into the sea 
724_123285_000023_000002	train-clean-360	For two hours nothing was caught 
none	none	Are these waters then bare of inhabitants 
724_123285_000023_000004	train-clean-360	No there s a pull at the line 
724_123285_000023_000005	train-clean-360	Hans draws it in and brings out a struggling fish 
724_123285_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 A sturgeon I cried a small sturgeon 
724_123285_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The Professor eyes the creature attentively and his opinion differs from mine 
724_123285_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The head of this fish was flat but rounded in front and the anterior part of its body was plated with bony angular scales it had no teeth its pectoral fins were large and of tail there was none 
724_123285_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The animal belonged to the same order as the sturgeon but differed from that fish in many essential particulars 
none	none	After a short examination my uncle pronounced his opinion
724_123285_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 This fish belongs to an extinct family of which only fossil traces are found in the devonian formations 
none	none	What I cried Have we taken alive an inhabitant of the seas of primitive ages Yes and you will observe that these fossil fishes have no identity with any living species 
724_123285_000029_000001	train-clean-360	To have in one s possession a living specimen is a happy event for a naturalist 
724_123285_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 But to what family does it belong 
none	none	It is of the order of ganoids of the family of the cephalaspidae and a species of pterichthys 
724_123285_000031_000001	train-clean-360	But this one displays a peculiarity confined to all fishes that inhabit subterranean waters 
none	none	It is blind and not only blind but actually has no eyes at all 
724_123285_000032_000000	train-clean-360	I looked nothing could be more certain 
724_123285_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But supposing it might be a solitary case we baited afresh and threw out our line 
none	none	Surely this ocean is well peopled with fish for in another couple of hours we took a large quantity of pterichthydes as well as of others belonging to the extinct family of the dipterides but of which my uncle could not tell the species none had organs of sight 
724_123285_000032_000003	train-clean-360	This unhoped for catch recruited our stock of provisions 
724_123285_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Thus it is evident that this sea contains none but species known to us in their fossil state in which fishes as well as reptiles are the less perfectly and completely organised the farther back their date of creation 
724_123285_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Perhaps we may yet meet with some of those saurians which science has reconstructed out of a bit of bone or cartilage 
724_123285_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I took up the telescope and scanned the whole horizon and found it everywhere a desert sea 
none	none	We are far away removed from the shores 
724_123285_000035_000000	train-clean-360	I gaze upward in the air 
none	none	Why should not some of the strange birds restored by the immortal Cuvier again flap their sail broad vans in this dense and heavy atmosphere 
724_123285_000035_000002	train-clean-360	There are sufficient fish for their support 
724_123285_000035_000003	train-clean-360	I survey the whole space that stretches overhead it is as desert as the shore was 
none	none	Still my imagination carried me away amongst the wonderful speculations of palaeontology 
724_123285_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Though awake I fell into a dream 
724_123285_000036_000002	train-clean-360	I thought I could see floating on the surface of the waters enormous chelonia pre adamite tortoises resembling floating islands

724_123285_000040_000005	train-clean-360	An illusion has laid hold upon me

724_123285_000044_000000	train-clean-360	At that moment I felt the sinewy hand of Hans seizing me vigorously But for him carried away by my dream I should have thrown myself into the sea 
724_123285_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Is he mad cried the Professor 
724_123285_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it all about at last I cried returning to myself

none	none	No but I have had a strange hallucination it is over now 
724_123285_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Is all going on right 
none	none	Yes it is a fair wind and a fine sea we are sailing rapidly along and if I am not out in my reckoning we shall soon land At these words I rose and gazed round upon the horizon still everywhere bounded by clouds alone CHAPTER XXXIII A BATTLE OF MONSTERS Saturday August fifteen The sea unbroken all round No land in sight The horizon seems extremely distant My head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream My uncle has had no dreams but he is out of temper He examines the horizon all round with his glass and folds his arms with the air of an injured man I remark that Professor Liedenbrock has a tendency to relapse into an impatient mood and I make a note of it in my log All my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that I am well his nature has resumed its sway And yet what cause was there for anger Is not the voyage prospering as favourably as possible under the circumstances Is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed You seem anxious my uncle I said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye Anxious No not at all Impatient then One might be with less reason than now Yet we are going very fast What does that signify I am not complaining that the rate is slow but that the sea is so wide I then remembered that the Professor before starting had estimated the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues Now we had made three times the distance yet still the southern coast was not in sight We are not descending as we ought to be the Professor declares We are losing time and the fact is I have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft He called this sea a pond and our long voyage taking a little sail But I remarked since we have followed the road that Saknussemm has shown us That is just the question Have we followed that road Did Saknussemm meet this sheet of water Did he cross it Has not the stream that we followed led us altogether astray At any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far This prospect is magnificent and But I don t care for prospects I came with an object and I mean to attain it Therefore don t talk to me about views and prospects I take this as my answer and I leave the Professor to bite his lips with impatience At six in the evening Hans asks for his wages and his three rix dollars are counted out to him Sunday August sixteen Nothing new Weather unchanged The wind freshens On awaking my first thought was to observe the intensity of the light I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim or fail altogether But there seemed no reason to fear The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves Truly this sea is of infinite width It must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic and why not My uncle took soundings several times He tied the heaviest of our pickaxes to a long rope which he let down two hundred fathoms No bottom yet and we had some difficulty in hauling up our plummet But when the pick was shipped again Hans pointed out on its surface deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard bodies I looked at the hunter Taender said he I could not understand him and turned to my uncle who was entirely absorbed in his calculations I had rather not disturb him while he is quiet I return to the Icelander He by a snapping motion of his jaws conveys his ideas to me Teeth I cried considering the iron bar with more attention Yes indeed those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal The jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength Is there some monster beneath us belonging to the extinct races more voracious than the shark more fearful in vastness than the whale I could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar Surely will my last night s dream be realised These thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleep Monday August seventeen I am trying to recall the peculiar instincts of the monsters of the pre adamite world who coming next in succession after the molluscs the crustaceans and le fishes preceded the animals of mammalian race upon the earth The world then belonged to reptiles Those monsters held the mastery in the seas of the secondary period They possessed a perfect organisation gigantic proportions prodigious strength The saurians of our day the alligators and the crocodiles are but feeble reproductions of their forefathers of primitive ages I shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance No human eye has ever beheld them living They burdened this earth a thousand ages before man appeared but their fossil remains found in the argillaceous limestone called by the English the lias have enabled their colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and anatomically ascertained I saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length Am I then fated I a denizen of earth to be placed face to face with these representatives of long extinct families No surely it cannot be Yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile My eyes are fearfully bent upon the sea I dread to see one of these monsters darting forth from its submarine caverns I suppose Professor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side What a very bad notion that was of his I thought to myself to take soundings just here He has disturbed some monstrous beast in its remote den and if we are not attacked on our voyage I look at our guns and see that they are all right My uncle notices it and looks on approvingly Already widely disturbed regions on the surface of the water indicate some commotion below The danger is approaching We must be on the look out Tuesday August eighteen Evening came or rather the time came when sleep weighs down the weary eyelids for there is no night here and the ceaseless light wearies the eyes with its persistency just as if we were sailing under an arctic sun Hans was at the helm During his watch I slept Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms What is the matter shouted my uncle Have we struck land Hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges I looked and cried It is an enormous porpoise Yes replied my uncle and there is a sea lizard of vast size And farther on a monstrous crocodile Look at its vast jaws and its rows of teeth It is diving down There s a whale a whale cried the Professor I can see its great fins See how he is throwing out air and water through his blowers And in fact two liquid columns were rising to a considerable height above the sea We stood amazed thunderstruck at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters They were of supernatural dimensions the smallest of them would have crunched our raft crew and all at one snap of its huge jaws Hans wants to tack to get away from this dangerous neighbourhood but he sees on the other hand enemies not less terrible a tortoise forty feet long and a serpent of thirty lifting its fearful head and gleaming eyes above the flood Flight was out of the question now The reptiles rose they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains They described around us gradually narrowing circles I took up my rifle But what could a ball do against the scaly armour with which these enormous beasts were clad We stood dumb with fear They approach us close on one side the crocodile on the other the serpent The remainder of the sea monsters have disappeared I prepare to fire Hans stops me by a gesture The two monsters pass within a hundred and fifty yards of the raft and hurl themselves the one upon the other with a fury which prevents them from seeing us At three hundred yards from us the battle was fought We could distinctly observe the two monsters engaged in deadly conflict But it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the fray the porpoise the whale the lizard the tortoise Every moment I seem to see one or other of them I point them to the Icelander He shakes his head negatively Tva says he What two Does he mean that there are only two animals He is right said my uncle whose glass has never left his eye Surely you must be mistaken I cried No the first of those monsters has a porpoise s snout a lizard s head a crocodile s teeth and hence our mistake It is the ichthyosaurus the fish lizard the most terrible of the ancient monsters of the deep And the other The other is a plesiosaurus almost lizard a serpent armoured with the carapace and the paddles of a turtle he is the dreadful enemy of the other Hans had spoken truly Two monsters only were creating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal and as large as a man s head Nature has endowed it with an optical apparatus of extreme power and capable of resisting the pressure of the great volume of water in the depths it inhabits It has been appropriately called the saurian whale for it has both the swiftness and the rapid movements of this monster of our own day This one is not less than a hundred feet long and I can judge of its size when it sweeps over the waters the vertical coils of its tail Its jaw is enormous and according to naturalists it is armed with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth The plesiosaurus a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail has four flappers or paddles to act like oars Its body is entirely covered with a thick armour of scales and its neck as flexible as a swan s rises thirty feet above the waves Those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity They heaved around them liquid mountains which rolled even to our raft and rocked it perilously Twenty times we were near capsizing Hissings of prodigious force are heard The two beasts are fast locked together I cannot distinguish the one from the other The probable rage of the conqueror inspires us with intense fear One hour two hours pass away The struggle continues with unabated ferocity The combatants alternately approach and recede from our raft We remain motionless ready to fire Suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under water All at once an enormous head is darted up the head of the plesiosaurus The monster is wounded to death I no longer see his scaly armour Only his long neck shoots up drops again coils and uncoils droops lashes the waters like a gigantic whip and writhes like a worm that you tread on The water is splashed for a long way around The spray almost blinds us But soon the reptile s agony draws to an end its movements become fainter its contortions cease to be so violent and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on the labouring deep As for the ichthyosaurus has he returned to his submarine cavern or will he reappear on the surface of the sea CHAPTER XXXIV THE GREAT GEYSER Wednesday August nineteen Fortunately the wind blows violently and has enabled us to flee from the scene of the late terrible struggle Hans keeps at his post at the helm My uncle whom the absorbing incidents of the combat had drawn away from his contemplations began again to look impatiently around him The voyage resumes its uniform tenor which I don t care to break with a repetition of such events as yesterday s Thursday Aug twenty Wind N N E unsteady and fitful Temperature high Rate three and a half leagues an hour About noon a distant noise is heard I note the fact without being able to explain it It is a continuous roar In the distance says the Professor there is a rock or islet against which the sea is breaking Hans climbs up the mast but sees no breakers The ocean is smooth and unbroken to its farthest limit Three hours pass away The roarings seem to proceed from a very distant waterfall I remark upon this to my uncle who replies doubtfully Yes I am convinced that I am right Are we then speeding forward to some cataract which will cast us down an abyss This method of getting on may please the Professor because it is vertical but for my part I prefer the more ordinary modes of horizontal progression At any rate some leagues to the windward there must be some noisy phenomenon for now the roarings are heard with increasing loudness Do they proceed from the sky or the ocean I look up to the atmospheric vapours and try to fathom their depths The sky is calm and motionless The clouds have reached the utmost limit of the lofty vault and there lie still bathed in the bright glare of the electric light It is not there that we must seek for the cause of this phenomenon Then I examine the horizon which is unbroken and clear of all mist There is no change in its aspect But if this noise arises from a fall a cataract if all this ocean flows away headlong into a lower basin yet if that deafening roar is produced by a mass of falling water the current must needs accelerate and its increasing speed will give me the measure of the peril that threatens us I consult the current there is none I throw an empty bottle into the sea it lies still About four Hans rises lays hold of the mast climbs to its top Thence his eye sweeps a large area of sea and it is fixed upon a point His countenance exhibits no surprise but his eye is immovably steady He sees something says my uncle I believe he does Hans comes down then stretches his arm to the south saying Dere nere Down there repeated my uncle Then seizing his glass he gazes attentively for a minute which seems to me an age Yes yes he cried I see a vast inverted cone rising from the surface Is it another sea beast Perhaps it is Then let us steer farther westward for we know something of the danger of coming across monsters of that sort Let us go straight on replied my uncle I appealed to Hans He maintained his course inflexibly Yet if at our present distance from the animal a distance of twelve leagues at the least the column of water driven through its blowers may be distinctly seen it must needs be of vast size The commonest prudence would counsel immediate flight but we did not come so far to be prudent Imprudently therefore we pursue our way The nearer we approach the higher mounts the jet of water What monster can possibly fill itself with such a quantity of water and spurt it up so continuously At eight in the evening we are not two leagues distant from it Its body dusky enormous hillocky lies spread upon the sea like an islet Is it illusion or fear Its length seems to me a couple of thousand yards What can be this cetacean which neither Cuvier nor Blumenbach knew anything about It lies motionless as if asleep the sea seems unable to move it in the least it is the waves that undulate upon its sides The column of water thrown up to a height of five hundred feet falls in rain with a deafening uproar And here are we scudding like lunatics before the wind to get near to a monster that a hundred whales a day would not satisfy Terror seizes upon me I refuse to go further I will cut the halliards if necessary I am in open mutiny against the Professor who vouchsafes no answer Suddenly Hans rises and pointing with his finger at the menacing object he says Holm An island cries my uncle That s not an island I cried sceptically It s nothing else shouted the Professor with a loud laugh But that column of water Geyser said Hans No doubt it is a geyser like those in Iceland At first I protest against being so widely mistaken as to have taken an island for a marine monster But the evidence is against me and I have to confess my error It is nothing worse than a natural phenomenon As we approach nearer the dimensions of the liquid column become magnificent The islet resembles with a most deceiving likeness an enormous cetacean whose head dominates the waves at a height of twenty yards The geyser a word meaning fury rises majestically from its extremity Deep and heavy explosions are heard from time to time when the enormous jet possessed with more furious violence shakes its plumy crest and springs with a bound till it reaches the lowest stratum of the clouds It stands alone No steam vents no hot springs surround it and all the volcanic power of the region is concentrated here Sparks of electric fire mingle with the dazzling sheaf of lighted fluid every drop of which refracts the prismatic colours Let us land said the Professor But we must carefully avoid this waterspout which would sink our raft in a moment Hans steering with his usual skill brought us to the other extremity of the islet I leaped up on the rock my uncle lightly followed while our hunter remained at his post like a man too wise ever to be astonished We walked upon granite mingled with siliceous tufa The soil shivers and shakes under our feet like the sides of an overheated boiler filled with steam struggling to get loose We come in sight of a small central basin out of which the geyser springs I plunge a register thermometer into the boiling water It marks an intense heat of three hundred twenty five deg which is far above the boiling point therefore this water issues from an ardent furnace which is not at all in harmony with Professor Liedenbrock s theories I cannot help making the remark Well he replied how does that make against my doctrine Oh nothing at all I said seeing that I was going in opposition to immovable obstinacy Still I am constrained to confess that hitherto we have been wonderfully favoured and that for some reason unknown to myself we have accomplished our journey under singularly favourable conditions of temperature But it seems manifest to me that some day we shall reach a region where the central heat attains its highest limits and goes beyond a point that can be registered by our thermometers That is what we shall see So says the Professor who having named this volcanic islet after his nephew gives the signal to embark again For some minutes I am still contemplating the geyser I notice that it throws up its column of water with variable force sometimes sending it to a great height then again to a lower which I attribute to the variable pressure of the steam accumulated in its reservoir At last we leave the island rounding away past the low rocks on its southern shore Hans has taken advantage of the halt to refit his rudder But before going any farther I make a few observations to calculate the distance we have gone over and note them in my journal We have crossed two hundred and seventy leagues of sea since leaving Port Graeuben and we are six hundred and twenty leagues from Iceland under England one one This distance carries the travellers as far as under the Pyrenees if the league measures three miles Trans CHAPTER XXXV AN ELECTRIC STORM Friday August twenty one On the morrow the magnificent geyser has disappeared The wind has risen and has rapidly carried us away from Axel Island The roarings become lost in the distance The weather if we may use that term will change before long The atmosphere is charged with vapours pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters The clouds are sinking lower and assume an olive hue The electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged I feel peculiar sensations like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes The heavily voluted cumulus clouds lower gloomily and threateningly they wear that implacable look which I have sometimes noticed at the outbreak of a great storm The air is heavy the sea is calm In the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton piled up in picturesque disorder By degrees they dilate and gain in huge size what they lose in number Such is their ponderous weight that they cannot rise from the horizon but obeying an impulse from higher currents their dense consistency slowly yields The gloom upon them deepens and they soon present to our view a ponderous mass of almost level surface From time to time a fleecy tuft of mist with yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense floor of grey and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity My whole body is saturated my hair bristles just as when you stand upon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine It seems to me as if my companions the moment they touched me would receive a severe shock like that from an electric eel At ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated The wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms I am loth to believe these atmospheric menaces and yet I cannot help muttering Here s some very bad weather coming on The Professor made no answer His temper is awful to judge from the working of his features as he sees this vast length of ocean unrolling before him to an indefinite extent He can only spare time to shrug his shoulders viciously There s a heavy storm coming on I cried pointing towards the horizon Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea A deep silence falls on all around The lately roaring winds are hushed into a dead calm nature seems to breathe no more and to be sinking into the stillness of death On the mast already I see the light play of a lambent saint Elmo s fire the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead The rudder stands motionless in a sluggish waveless sea But if we have now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose which at the first shock of the tempest may capsize us in a moment Let us reef the sail and cut the mast down I cried That will be safest No no Never shouted my impetuous uncle Never Let the wind catch us if it will What I want is to get the least glimpse of rock or shore even if our raft should be smashed into shivers The words were hardly out of his mouth when a sudden change took place in the southern sky The piled up vapours condense into water and the air put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mists rouses itself into a whirlwind It rushes on from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern The darkness deepens scarcely can I jot down a few hurried notes The helm makes a bound My uncle falls full length I creep close to him He has laid a firm hold upon a rope and appears to watch with grim satisfaction this awful display of elemental strife Hans stirs not His long hair blown by the pelting storm and laid flat across his immovable countenance makes him a strange figure for the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little luminous radiations This frightful mask of electric sparks suggests to me even in this dizzy excitement a comparison with pre adamite man the contemporary of the ichthyosaurus and the megatherium one one Rather of the mammoth and the mastodon Trans The mast yet holds firm The sail stretches tight like a bubble ready to burst The raft flies at a rate that I cannot reckon but not so fast as the foaming clouds of spray which it dashes from side to side in its headlong speed The sail the sail I cry motioning to lower it No replies my uncle Nej repeats Hans leisurely shaking his head But now the rain forms a rushing cataract in front of that horizon toward which we are running with such maddening speed But before it has reached us the rain cloud parts asunder the sea boils and the electric fires are brought into violent action by a mighty chemical power that descends from the higher regions The most vivid flashes of lightning are mingled with the violent crash of continuous thunder Ceaseless fiery arrows dart in and out amongst the flying thunder clouds the vaporous mass soon glows with incandescent heat hailstones rattle fiercely down and as they dash upon our iron tools they too emit gleams and flashes of lurid light The heaving waves resemble fiery volcanic hills each belching forth its own interior flames and every crest is plumed with dancing fire My eyes fail under the dazzling light my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder I must be bound to the mast which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of the storm Here my notes become vague and indistinct I have only been able to find a few which I seem to have jotted down almost unconsciously But their very brevity and their obscurity reveal the intensity of the excitement which dominated me and describe the actual position even better than my memory could do Sunday twenty three Where are we Driven forward with a swiftness that cannot be measured The night was fearful no abatement of the storm The din and uproar are incessant our ears are bleeding to exchange a word is impossible The lightning flashes with intense brilliancy and never seems to cease for a moment Zigzag streams of bluish white fire dash down upon the sea and rebound and then take an upward flight till they strike the granite vault that overarches our heads Suppose that solid roof should crumble down upon our heads Other flashes with incessant play cross their vivid fires while others again roll themselves into balls of living fire which explode like bombshells but the music of which scarcely adds to the din of the battle strife that almost deprives us of our senses of hearing and sight the limit of intense loudness has been passed within which the human ear can distinguish one sound from another If all the powder magazines in the world were to explode at once we should hear no more than we do now From the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam Whither are we flying My uncle lies full length across the raft The heat increases I refer to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated Monday August twenty four Will there be an end to it Is the atmospheric condition having once reached this density to become final We are prostrated and worn out with fatigue But Hans is as usual The raft bears on still to the south east We have made two hundred leagues since we left Axel Island At noon the violence of the storm redoubles We are obliged to secure as fast as possible every article that belongs to our cargo Each of us is lashed to some part of the raft The waves rise above our heads For three days we have never been able to make each other hear a word Our mouths open our lips move but not a word can be heard We cannot even make ourselves heard by approaching our mouth close to the ear My uncle has drawn nearer to me He has uttered a few words They seem to be We are lost but I am not sure At last I write down the words Let us lower the sail He nods his consent Scarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has bounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft Mast and sail flew up in an instant together and I saw them carried up to prodigious height resembling in appearance a pterodactyle one of those strong birds of the infant world We lay there our blood running cold with unspeakable terror The fireball half of it white half azure blue and the size of a ten inch shell moved slowly about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind Here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast thence it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine Horrible we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches Hans who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it And now my turn comes pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the melting heat it drops at my feet spinning silently round upon the deck I try to move my foot away but cannot A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs We suffer stifling pains Why am I unable to move my foot Is it riveted to the planks Alas the fall upon our fated raft of this electric globe has magnetised every iron article on board The instruments the tools our guns are clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each other the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let into the timbers and I cannot draw my foot away from the spot At last by a violent effort I release myself at the instant when the ball in its gyrations was about to seize upon it and carry me off my feet Ah what a flood of intense and dazzling light the globe has burst and we are deluged with tongues of fire Then all the light disappears I could just see my uncle at full length on the raft and Hans still at his helm and spitting fire under the action of the electricity which has saturated him But where are we going to Where Tuesday August twenty five I recover from a long swoon The storm continues to roar and rage the lightnings dash hither and thither like broods of fiery serpents filling all the air Are we still under the sea Yes we are borne at incalculable speed We have been carried under England under the channel under France perhaps under the whole of Europe A fresh noise is heard Surely it is the sea breaking upon the rocks But then

887_123289_000011_000002	train-clean-100	Hans prepared some food which I could not touch and each of us exhausted with three sleepless nights fell into a broken and painful sleep 
887_123289_000012_000000	train-clean-100	The next day the weather was splendid 
887_123289_000012_000001	train-clean-100	The sky and the sea had sunk into sudden repose 
none	none	Every trace of the awful storm had disappeared The exhilarating voice of the Professor fell upon my ears as I awoke he was ominously cheerful
887_123289_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Well my boy he cried have you slept well 
887_123289_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Would not any one have thought that we were still in our cheerful little house on the Koenigstrasse and that I was only just coming down to breakfast and that I was to be married to Graeuben that day 
887_123289_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Alas if the tempest had but sent the raft a little more east we should have passed under Germany under my beloved town of Hamburg under the very street where dwelt all that I loved most in the world Then only forty leagues would have separated us 
887_123289_000015_000001	train-clean-100	But they were forty leagues perpendicular of solid granite wall and in reality we were a thousand leagues asunder 
887_123289_000016_000000	train-clean-100	All these painful reflections rapidly crossed my mind before I could answer my uncle s question 
887_123289_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Well now he repeated won t you tell me how you have slept 
887_123289_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh very well I said 
887_123289_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 I am only a little knocked up but I shall soon be better 
none	none	Oh says my uncle that s nothing to signify 
887_123289_000019_000001	train-clean-100	You are only a little bit tired 
887_123289_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 But you uncle you seem in very good spirits this morning 
887_123289_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Delighted my boy delighted 
887_123289_000021_000001	train-clean-100	We have got there 
887_123289_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 To our journey s end 
887_123289_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 No but we have got to the end of that endless sea 
887_123289_000023_000001	train-clean-100	Now we shall go by land and really begin to go down 
none	none	down down
887_123289_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 But my dear uncle do let me ask you one question 
none	none	Of course Axel
887_123289_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 How about returning 
none	none	Returning 
887_123289_000027_000001	train-clean-100	Why you are talking about the return before the arrival 
887_123289_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 No I only want to know how that is to be managed 
887_123289_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 In the simplest way possible 
887_123289_000029_000001	train-clean-100	When we have reached the centre of the globe either we shall find some new way to get back or we shall come back like decent folks the way we came 
887_123289_000029_000002	train-clean-100	I feel pleased at the thought that it is sure not to be shut against us 
887_123289_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 But then we shall have to refit the raft 
none	none	Of course
887_123289_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Then as to provisions have we enough to last 
887_123289_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes to be sure we have 
887_123289_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Hans is a clever fellow and I am sure he must have saved a large part of our cargo 
887_123289_000033_000002	train-clean-100	But still let us go and make sure 
887_123289_000034_000000	train-clean-100	We left this grotto which lay open to every wind 
887_123289_000034_000001	train-clean-100	At the same time I cherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well 
887_123289_000034_000002	train-clean-100	It seemed to me impossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have destroyed everything on board 
887_123289_000034_000003	train-clean-100	On my arrival on the shore I found Hans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good order 
887_123289_000034_000004	train-clean-100	My uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude 
none	none	This man with almost superhuman devotion had been at work all the while that we were asleep and had saved the most precious of the articles at the risk of his life 
887_123289_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Not that we had suffered no losses 
887_123289_000035_000001	train-clean-100	For instance our firearms but we might do without them 
887_123289_000035_000002	train-clean-100	Our stock of powder had remained uninjured after having risked blowing up during the storm 
887_123289_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Well cried the Professor as we have no guns we cannot hunt that s all 
887_123289_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes but how about the instruments 
887_123289_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Here is the aneroid the most useful of all and for which I would have given all the others 
887_123289_000038_000001	train-clean-100	By means of it I can calculate the depth and know when we have reached the centre without it we might very likely go beyond and come out at the antipodes 
887_123289_000039_000000	train-clean-100	Such high spirits as these were rather too strong 
887_123289_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 But where is the compass 
none	none	I asked
887_123289_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Here it is upon this rock in perfect condition as well as the thermometers and the chronometer 
887_123289_000041_000001	train-clean-100	The hunter is a splendid fellow 
none	none	There was no denying it 
887_123289_000042_000001	train-clean-100	We had all our instruments 
887_123289_000042_000002	train-clean-100	As for tools and appliances there they all lay on the ground ladders ropes picks spades et cetera 
887_123289_000043_000000	train-clean-100	Still there was the question of provisions to be settled and I asked How are we off for provisions 
none	none	The boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore in a perfect state of preservation for the most part the sea had spared them and what with biscuits salt meat spirits and salt fish we might reckon on four months supply Four months cried the Professor We have time to go and to return and with what is left I will give a grand dinner to my friends at the Johannaeum 
887_123289_000046_000000	train-clean-100	I ought by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle s ways yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me 
none	none	Now said he we will replenish our supply of water with the rain which the storm has left in all these granite basins therefore we shall have no reason to fear anything from thirst 
887_123289_000047_000001	train-clean-100	As for the raft I will recommend Hans to do his best to repair it although I don t expect it will be of any further use to us 
887_123289_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 How so I cried 
887_123289_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 An idea of my own my lad 
887_123289_000049_000001	train-clean-100	I don t think we shall come out by the way that we went in 
887_123289_000050_000000	train-clean-100	I stared at the Professor with a good deal of mistrust 
887_123289_000050_000001	train-clean-100	I asked was he not touched in the brain 
887_123289_000050_000002	train-clean-100	And yet there was method in his madness 
887_123289_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 And now let us go to breakfast said he 
887_123289_000052_000000	train-clean-100	I followed him to a headland after he had given his instructions to the hunter 
887_123289_000052_000001	train-clean-100	There preserved meat biscuit and tea made us an excellent meal one of the best I ever remember 
887_123289_000052_000002	train-clean-100	Hunger the fresh air the calm quiet weather after the commotions we had gone through all contributed to give me a good appetite 
887_123289_000053_000000	train-clean-100	Whilst breakfasting I took the opportunity to put to my uncle the question where we were now 
887_123289_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 That seems to me I said rather difficult to make out 
887_123289_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes it is difficult he said to calculate exactly perhaps even impossible since during these three stormy days I have been unable to keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft but still we may get an approximation 
none	none	The last observation I remarked was made on the island when the geyser was
887_123289_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 You mean Axel Island 
887_123289_000057_000001	train-clean-100	Don t decline the honour of having given your name to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the globe 
887_123289_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 Well said I let it be Axel Island 
none	none	Then we had cleared two hundred and seventy leagues of sea and we were six hundred leagues from Iceland
887_123289_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 Very well answered my uncle let us start from that point and count four days storm during which our rate cannot have been less than eighty leagues in the twenty four hours 
887_123289_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 That is right and this would make three hundred leagues more 
none	none	Yes and the Liedenbrock sea would be six hundred leagues from shore to shore 
887_123289_000061_000001	train-clean-100	Surely Axel it may vie in size with the Mediterranean itself 
887_123289_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 Especially I replied if it happens that we have only crossed it in its narrowest part 
none	none	And it is a curious circumstance I added that if my computations are right and we are nine hundred leagues from Rejkiavik we have now the Mediterranean above our head That is a good long way my friend But whether we are under Turkey or the Atlantic depends very much upon the question in what direction we have been moving 
887_123289_000063_000002	train-clean-100	Perhaps we have deviated 
887_123289_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 No I think not 
887_123289_000064_000001	train-clean-100	Our course has been the same all along and I believe this shore is south east of Port Graeuben 
887_123289_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 Well replied my uncle we may easily ascertain this by consulting the compass 
887_123289_000065_000001	train-clean-100	Let us go and see what it says 
887_123289_000066_000000	train-clean-100	The Professor moved towards the rock upon which Hans had laid down the instruments 
887_123289_000066_000001	train-clean-100	He was gay and full of spirits he rubbed his hands he studied his attitudes 
887_123289_000066_000002	train-clean-100	I followed him curious to know if I was right in my estimate 
887_123289_000066_000003	train-clean-100	As soon as we had arrived at the rock my uncle took the compass laid it horizontally and questioned the needle which after a few oscillations presently assumed a fixed position My uncle looked and looked and looked again 
887_123289_000066_000004	train-clean-100	He rubbed his eyes and then turned to me thunderstruck with some unexpected discovery 
887_123289_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 What is the matter I asked 
none	none	He motioned to me to look 
887_123289_000068_000001	train-clean-100	An exclamation of astonishment burst from me 
887_123289_000068_000002	train-clean-100	The north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be the south 
887_123289_000068_000003	train-clean-100	It pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea 
887_123289_000068_000004	train-clean-100	I shook the box examined it again it was in perfect condition 
887_123289_000068_000005	train-clean-100	In whatever position I placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned to this unexpected quarter 
none	none	Therefore there seemed no reason to doubt that during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind unperceived by us which had brought our raft back to the shore which we thought we had left so long a distance behind us CHAPTER XXXVII THE LIEDENBROCK MUSEUM OF GEOLOGY 
887_123290_000002_000000	train-clean-100	How shall I describe the strange series of passions which in succession shook the breast of Professor Liedenbrock 
887_123290_000002_000001	train-clean-100	First stupefaction then incredulity lastly a downright burst of rage Never had I seen the man so put out of countenance and so disturbed The fatigues of our passage across the dangers met had all to be begun over again 
887_123290_000002_000002	train-clean-100	We had gone backwards instead of forwards 
887_123290_000003_000000	train-clean-100	But my uncle rapidly recovered himself 
887_123290_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 Aha will fate play tricks upon me 
887_123290_000004_000001	train-clean-100	Will the elements lay plots against me 
887_123290_000004_000002	train-clean-100	Shall fire air and water make a combined attack against me 
887_123290_000004_000003	train-clean-100	Well they shall know what a determined man can do 
887_123290_000004_000004	train-clean-100	I will not yield 
887_123290_000004_000005	train-clean-100	I will not stir a single foot backwards and it will be seen whether man or nature is to have the upper hand 
887_123290_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Erect upon the rock angry and threatening Otto Liedenbrock was a rather grotesque fierce parody upon the fierce Achilles defying the lightning 
887_123290_000005_000001	train-clean-100	But I thought it my duty to interpose and attempt to lay some restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism 
887_123290_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Just listen to me I said firmly 
none	none	Ambition must have a limit somewhere we cannot perform impossibilities we are not at all fit for another sea voyage who would dream of undertaking a voyage of five hundred leagues upon a heap of rotten planks with a blanket in rags for a sail a stick for a mast and fierce winds in our teeth We cannot steer we shall be buffeted by the tempests and we should be fools and madmen to attempt to cross a second time 
887_123290_000007_000000	train-clean-100	I was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten minutes without interruption not that the Professor was paying any respectful attention to his nephew s arguments but because he was deaf to all my eloquence 
887_123290_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 To the raft he shouted 
887_123290_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Such was his only reply 
none	none	It was no use for me to entreat supplicate get angry or do anything else in the way of opposition it would only have been opposing a will harder than the granite rock 
887_123290_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Hans was finishing the repairs of the raft 
887_123290_000010_000001	train-clean-100	One would have thought that this strange being was guessing at my uncle s intentions 
887_123290_000010_000002	train-clean-100	With a few more pieces of surturbrand he had refitted our vessel 
887_123290_000010_000003	train-clean-100	A sail already hung from the new mast and the wind was playing in its waving folds 
887_123290_000011_000000	train-clean-100	The Professor said a few words to the guide and immediately he put everything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure The air was clear and the north west wind blew steadily 
none	none	What could I do 
887_123290_000012_000001	train-clean-100	Could I stand against the two 
none	none	It was impossible 
887_123290_000012_000003	train-clean-100	If Hans had but taken my side 
887_123290_000012_000004	train-clean-100	But no it was not to be 
887_123290_000012_000005	train-clean-100	The Icelander seemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget and deny himself 
887_123290_000012_000006	train-clean-100	I could get nothing out of a servant so feudalised as it were to his master 
887_123290_000012_000007	train-clean-100	My only course was to proceed 
887_123290_000013_000000	train-clean-100	I was therefore going with as much resignation as I could find to resume my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle laid his hand upon my shoulder 
887_123290_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 We shall not sail until to morrow he said 
887_123290_000015_000000	train-clean-100	I made a movement intended to express resignation 
none	none	I must neglect nothing he said and since my fate has driven me on this part of the coast I will not leave it until I have examined it To understand what followed it must be borne in mind that through circumstances hereafter to be explained we were not really where the Professor supposed we were 
887_123290_000017_000001	train-clean-100	In fact we were not upon the north shore of the sea 
887_123290_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Now let us start upon fresh discoveries I said 
887_123290_000019_000000	train-clean-100	And leaving Hans to his work we started off together 
887_123290_000019_000001	train-clean-100	The space between the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable 
887_123290_000019_000002	train-clean-100	It took half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock 
887_123290_000019_000003	train-clean-100	We trampled under our feet numberless shells of all the forms and sizes which existed in the earliest ages of the world 
887_123290_000019_000004	train-clean-100	I also saw immense carapaces more than fifteen feet in diameter 
887_123290_000019_000005	train-clean-100	They had been the coverings of those gigantic glyptodons or armadilloes of the pleiocene period of which the modern tortoise is but a miniature representative 
none	none	one The soil was besides this scattered with stony fragments boulders rounded by water action and ridged up in successive lines 
887_123290_000019_000007	train-clean-100	I was therefore led to the conclusion that at one time the sea must have covered the ground on which we were treading 
none	none	On the loose and scattered rocks now out of the reach of the highest tides the waves had left manifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone 
887_123290_000020_000000	train-clean-100	This might up to a certain point explain the existence of an ocean forty leagues beneath the surface of the globe 
887_123290_000020_000001	train-clean-100	But in my opinion this liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within the interior of the earth and it certainly had its origin in the waters of the ocean overhead which had made their way hither through some fissure 
none	none	Yet it must be believed that that fissure is now closed and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a very short time 
887_123290_000020_000003	train-clean-100	Perhaps even this water subjected to the fierce action of central heat had partly been resolved into vapour 
none	none	This would explain the existence of those clouds suspended over our heads and the development of that electricity which raised such tempests within the bowels of the earth This theory of the phenomena we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to me for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature fixed physical laws will or may always explain them 
887_123290_000022_000000	train-clean-100	We were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil the deposits of the waters of former ages 
none	none	The Professor was carefully examining every little fissure in the rocks 
887_123290_000022_000002	train-clean-100	Wherever he saw a hole he always wanted to know the depth of it 
887_123290_000022_000003	train-clean-100	To him this was important 
887_123290_000023_000000	train-clean-100	We had traversed the shores of the Liedenbrock sea for a mile when we observed a sudden change in the appearance of the soil 
887_123290_000023_000001	train-clean-100	It seemed upset contorted and convulsed by a violent upheaval of the lower strata 
887_123290_000023_000002	train-clean-100	In many places depressions or elevations gave witness to some tremendous power effecting the dislocation of strata 
none	none	one The glyptodon and armadillo are mammalian the tortoise is a chelonian a reptile distinct classes of the animal kingdom therefore the latter cannot be a representative of the former Trans 
887_123290_000025_000000	train-clean-100	We moved with difficulty across these granite fissures and chasms mingled with silex crystals of quartz and alluvial deposits when a field nay more than a field a vast plain of bleached bones lay spread before us 
887_123290_000025_000001	train-clean-100	It seemed like an immense cemetery where the remains of twenty ages mingled their dust together 
887_123290_000025_000002	train-clean-100	Huge mounds of bony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance 
887_123290_000025_000003	train-clean-100	They undulated away to the limits of the horizon and melted in the distance in a faint haze 
887_123290_000025_000004	train-clean-100	There within three square miles were accumulated the materials for a complete history of the animal life of ages a history scarcely outlined in the too recent strata of the inhabited world 
none	none	But an impatient curiosity impelled our steps crackling and rattling our feet were trampling on the remains of prehistoric animals and interesting fossils the possession of which is a matter of rivalry and contention between the museums of great cities A thousand Cuviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains deposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection I stood amazed 
887_123290_000027_000001	train-clean-100	My uncle had uplifted his long arms to the vault which was our sky his mouth gaping wide his eyes flashing behind his shining spectacles his head balancing with an up and down motion his whole attitude denoted unlimited astonishment 
none	none	Here he stood facing an immense collection of scattered leptotheria mericotheria lophiodia anoplotheria megatheria mastodons protopithecae pterodactyles and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled together for his special satisfaction 
887_123290_000027_000003	train-clean-100	Fancy an enthusiastic bibliomaniac suddenly brought into the midst of the famous Alexandrian library burnt by Omar and restored by a miracle from its ashes just such a crazed enthusiast was my uncle Professor Liedenbrock 
none	none	But more was to come when with a rush through clouds of bone dust he laid his hand upon a bare skull and cried with a voice trembling with excitement Axel 
887_123290_000029_000001	train-clean-100	Axel a human head 
887_123290_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 A human skull I cried no less astonished 
887_123290_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes nephew 
none	none	Aha M Milne Edwards Ah M de Quatrefages how I wish you were standing here at the side of Otto Liedenbrock 
887_123291_000004_000000	train-clean-100	CHAPTER XXXVIII 
none	none	THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN 
887_123291_000006_000000	train-clean-100	To understand this apostrophe of my uncle s made to absent French savants it will be necessary to allude to an event of high importance in a palaeontological point of view which had occurred a little while before our departure 
none	none	On the twenty eighth of March eighteen sixty three some excavators working under the direction of M Boucher de Perthes in the stone quarries of Moulin Quignon near Abbeville in the department of Somme found a human jawbone fourteen feet beneath the surface 
887_123291_000007_000001	train-clean-100	It was the first fossil of this nature that had ever been brought to light 
887_123291_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Not far distant were found stone hatchets and flint arrow heads stained and encased by lapse of time with a uniform coat of rust 
887_123291_000008_000000	train-clean-100	The noise of this discovery was very great not in France alone but in England and in Germany 
none	none	Several savants of the French Institute and amongst them MM Milne Edwards and de Quatrefages saw at once the importance of this discovery proved to demonstration the genuineness of the bone in question and became the most ardent defendants in what the English called this trial of a jawbone To the geologists of the United Kingdom who believed in the certainty of the fact Messrs Falconer Busk Carpenter and others scientific Germans were soon joined and amongst them the forwardest the most fiery and the most enthusiastic was my uncle Liedenbrock 
887_123291_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Therefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary period seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted 
none	none	It is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent in M Elie de Beaumont This high authority maintained that the soil of Moulin Quignon was not diluvial at all but was of much more recent formation and agreeing in that with Cuvier he refused to admit that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the quaternary period My uncle Liedenbrock along with the great body of the geologists had maintained his ground disputed and argued until M Elie de Beaumont stood almost alone in his opinion 
887_123291_000011_000000	train-clean-100	We knew all these details but we were not aware that since our departure the question had advanced to farther stages 
none	none	Other similar maxillaries though belonging to individuals of various types and different nations were found in the loose grey soil of certain grottoes in France Switzerland and Belgium as well as weapons tools earthen utensils bones of children and adults The existence therefore of man in the quaternary period seemed to become daily more certain 
887_123291_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Nor was this all 
887_123291_000012_000001	train-clean-100	Fresh discoveries of remains in the pleiocene formation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human species to a higher antiquity still 
887_123291_000012_000002	train-clean-100	It is true that these remains were not human bones but objects bearing the traces of his handiwork such as fossil leg bones of animals sculptured and carved evidently by the hand of man 
none	none	Thus at one bound the record of the existence of man receded far back into the history of the ages past he was a predecessor of the mastodon he was a contemporary of the southern elephant he lived a hundred thousand years ago when according to geologists the pleiocene formation was in progress 
887_123291_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Such then was the state of palaeontological science and what we knew of it was sufficient to explain our behaviour in the presence of this stupendous Golgotha 
887_123291_000014_000001	train-clean-100	Any one may now understand the frenzied excitement of my uncle when twenty yards farther on he found himself face to face with a primitive man 
887_123291_000015_000000	train-clean-100	It was a perfectly recognisable human body 
none	none	Had some particular soil like that of the cemetery saint Michel at Bordeaux preserved it thus for so many ages 
887_123291_000015_000002	train-clean-100	It might be so 
887_123291_000015_000003	train-clean-100	But this dried corpse with its parchment like skin drawn tightly over the bony frame the limbs still preserving their shape sound teeth abundant hair and finger and toe nails of frightful length this desiccated mummy startled us by appearing just as it had lived countless ages ago 
887_123291_000015_000004	train-clean-100	I stood mute before this apparition of remote antiquity 
887_123291_000015_000005	train-clean-100	My uncle usually so garrulous was struck dumb likewise 
887_123291_000015_000006	train-clean-100	We raised the body 
887_123291_000015_000007	train-clean-100	We stood it up against a rock 
none	none	It seemed to stare at us out of its empty orbits We sounded with our knuckles his hollow frame After some moments silence the Professor was himself again Otto Liedenbrock yielding to his nature forgot all the circumstances of our eventful journey forgot where we were standing forgot the vaulted cavern which contained us No doubt he was in mind back again in his Johannaeum holding forth to his pupils for he assumed his learned air and addressing himself to an imaginary audience he proceeded thus Gentlemen I have the honour to introduce to you a man of the quaternary or post tertiary system 
887_123291_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Eminent geologists have denied his existence others no less eminent have affirmed it 
none	none	The saint Thomases of palaeontology if they were here might now touch him with their fingers and would be obliged to acknowledge their error 
887_123291_000017_000003	train-clean-100	I am quite aware that science has to be on its guard with discoveries of this kind 
none	none	I know what capital enterprising individuals like Barnum have made out of fossil men 
887_123291_000017_000005	train-clean-100	I have heard the tale of the kneepan of Ajax the pretended body of Orestes claimed to have been found by the Spartans and of the body of Asterius ten cubits long of which Pausanias speaks 
887_123291_000017_000006	train-clean-100	I have read the reports of the skeleton of Trapani found in the fourteenth century and which was at the time identified as that of Polyphemus and the history of the giant unearthed in the sixteenth century near Palermo 
887_123291_000017_000007	train-clean-100	You know as well as I do gentlemen the analysis made at Lucerne in fifteen seventy seven of those huge bones which the celebrated doctor Felix Plater affirmed to be those of a giant nineteen feet high 
887_123291_000017_000008	train-clean-100	I have gone through the treatises of Cassanion and all those memoirs pamphlets answers and rejoinders published respecting the skeleton of Teutobochus the invader of Gaul dug out of a sandpit in the Dauphine in sixteen thirteen 
none	none	In the eighteenth century I would have stood up for Scheuchzer s pre adamite man against Peter Campet 
887_123291_000017_000010	train-clean-100	I have perused a writing entitled Gigan 
887_123291_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Here my uncle s unfortunate infirmity met him that of being unable in public to pronounce hard words 
887_123291_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 The pamphlet entitled Gigan 
none	none	He could get no further Giganteo 
887_123291_000022_000000	train-clean-100	It was not to be done 
887_123291_000022_000001	train-clean-100	The unlucky word would not come out 
none	none	At the Johannaeum there would have been a laugh
887_123291_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Gigantosteologie at last the Professor burst out between two words which I shall not record here 
none	none	Then rushing on with renewed vigour and with great animation
887_123291_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes gentlemen I know all these things and more 
887_123291_000025_000001	train-clean-100	I know that Cuvier and Blumenbach have recognised in these bones nothing more remarkable than the bones of the mammoth and other mammals of the post tertiary period 
887_123291_000025_000002	train-clean-100	But in the presence of this specimen to doubt would be to insult science 
887_123291_000025_000003	train-clean-100	There stands the body 
none	none	You may see it touch it 
887_123291_000025_000005	train-clean-100	It is not a mere skeleton it is an entire body preserved for a purely anthropological end and purpose 
887_123291_000026_000000	train-clean-100	I was good enough not to contradict this startling assertion 
none	none	If I could only wash it in a solution of sulphuric acid pursued my uncle I should be able to clear it from all the earthy particles and the shells which are incrusted about it 
887_123291_000027_000001	train-clean-100	But I do not possess that valuable solvent 
none	none	Yet such as it is the body shall tell us its own wonderful story 
887_123291_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Here the Professor laid hold of the fossil skeleton and handled it with the skill of a dexterous showman 
none	none	You see he said that it is not six feet long and that we are still separated by a long interval from the pretended race of giants As for the family to which it belongs it is evidently Caucasian 
887_123291_000029_000001	train-clean-100	It is the white race our own 
887_123291_000029_000002	train-clean-100	The skull of this fossil is a regular oval or rather ovoid 
887_123291_000029_000003	train-clean-100	It exhibits no prominent cheekbones no projecting jaws 
887_123291_000029_000004	train-clean-100	It presents no appearance of that prognathism which diminishes the facial angle 
none	none	one Measure that angle 
887_123291_000029_000006	train-clean-100	It is nearly ninety degrees 
887_123291_000029_000007	train-clean-100	But I will go further in my deductions and I will affirm that this specimen of the human family is of the Japhetic race which has since spread from the Indies to the Atlantic 
887_123291_000029_000008	train-clean-100	Don t smile gentlemen 
887_123291_000030_000000	train-clean-100	Nobody was smiling but the learned Professor was frequently disturbed by the broad smiles provoked by his learned eccentricities 
none	none	Yes he pursued with animation this is a fossil man the contemporary of the mastodons whose remains fill this amphitheatre But if you ask me how he came there how those strata on which he lay slipped down into this enormous hollow in the globe I confess I cannot answer that question No doubt in the post tertiary period considerable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth The long continued cooling of the globe produced chasms fissures clefts and faults into which very probably portions of the upper earth may have fallen 
887_123291_000031_000002	train-clean-100	I make no rash assertions but there is the man surrounded by his own works by hatchets by flint arrow heads which are the characteristics of the stone age 
887_123291_000031_000003	train-clean-100	And unless he came here like myself as a tourist on a visit and as a pioneer of science I can entertain no doubt of the authenticity of his remote origin 
none	none	one The facial angle is formed by two lines one touching the brow and the front teeth the other from the orifice of the ear to the lower line of the nostrils The greater this angle the higher intelligence denoted by the formation of the skull Prognathism is that projection of the jaw bones which sharpens or lessons this angle and which is illustrated in the negro countenance and in the lowest savages The Professor ceased to speak and the audience broke out into loud and unanimous applause For of course my uncle was right and wiser men than his nephew would have had some trouble to refute his statements 
887_123291_000034_000000	train-clean-100	Another remarkable thing 
none	none	This fossil body was not the only one in this immense catacomb We came upon other bodies at every step amongst this mortal dust and my uncle might select the most curious of these specimens to demolish the incredulity of sceptics In fact it was a wonderful spectacle that of these generations of men and animals commingled in a common cemetery 
887_123291_000035_000001	train-clean-100	Then one very serious question arose presently which we scarcely dared to suggest Had all those creatures slided through a great fissure in the crust of the earth down to the shores of the Liedenbrock sea when they were dead and turning to dust or had they lived and grown and died here in this subterranean world under a false sky just like inhabitants of the upper earth 
none	none	Until the present time we had seen alive only marine monsters and fishes Might not some living man some native of the abyss be yet a wanderer below on this desert strand CHAPTER XXXIX FOREST SCENERY ILLUMINATED BY ELECTRICITY For another half hour we trod upon a pavement of bones We pushed on impelled by our burning curiosity What other marvels did this cavern contain What new treasures lay here for science to unfold I was prepared for any surprise my imagination was ready for any astonishment however astounding We had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones The rash Professor careless of losing his way hurried me forward We advanced in silence bathed in luminous electric fluid By some phenomenon which I am unable to explain it lighted up all sides of every object equally Such was its diffusiveness there being no central point from which the light emanated that shadows no longer existed You might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer No vapour was visible The rocks the distant mountains a few isolated clumps of forest trees in the distance presented a weird and wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light We were like Hoffmann s shadowless man After walking a mile we reached the outskirts of a vast forest but not one of those forests of fungi which bordered Port Graeuben Here was the vegetation of the tertiary period in its fullest blaze of magnificence Tall palms belonging to species no longer living splendid palmacites firs yews cypress trees thujas representatives of the conifers were linked together by a tangled network of long climbing plants A soft carpet of moss and hepaticas luxuriously clothed the soil A few sparkling streams ran almost in silence under what would have been the shade of the trees but that there was no shadow On their banks grew tree ferns similar to those we grow in hothouses But a remarkable feature was the total absence of colour in all those trees shrubs and plants growing without the life giving heat and light of the sun Everything seemed mixed up and confounded in one uniform silver grey or light brown tint like that of fading and faded leaves Not a green leaf anywhere and the flowers which were abundant enough in the tertiary period which first gave birth to flowers looked like brown paper flowers without colour or scent My uncle Liedenbrock ventured to penetrate under this colossal grove I followed him not without fear Since nature had here provided vegetable nourishment why should not the terrible mammals be there too I perceived in the broad clearings left by fallen trees decayed with age leguminose plants acerineae rubiceae and many other eatable shrubs dear to ruminant animals at every period Then I observed mingled together in confusion trees of countries far apart on the surface of the globe The oak and the palm were growing side by side the Australian eucalyptus leaned against the Norwegian pine the birch tree of the north mingled its foliage with New Zealand kauris It was enough to distract the most ingenious classifier of terrestrial botany Suddenly I halted I drew back my uncle The diffused light revealed the smallest object in the dense and distant thickets I had thought I saw no I did see with my own eyes vast colossal forms moving amongst the trees They were gigantic animals it was a herd of mastodons not fossil remains but living and resembling those the bones of which were found in the marshes of Ohio in eighteen oh one I saw those huge elephants whose long flexible trunks were grouting and turning up the soil under the trees like a legion of serpents I could hear the crashing noise of their long ivory tusks boring into the old decaying trunks The boughs cracked and the leaves torn away by cartloads went down the cavernous throats of the vast brutes So then the dream in which I had had a vision of the prehistoric world of the tertiary and post tertiary periods was now realised And there we were alone in the bowels of the earth at the mercy of its wild inhabitants My uncle was gazing with intense and eager interest Come on said he seizing my arm Forward forward No I will not I cried We have no firearms What could we do in the midst of a herd of these four footed giants Come away uncle come No human being may with safety dare the anger of these monstrous beasts No human creature replied my uncle in a lower voice You are wrong Axel Look look down there I fancy I see a living creature similar to ourselves it is a man I looked shaking my head incredulously But though at first I was unbelieving I had to yield to the evidence of my senses In fact at a distance of a quarter of a mile leaning against the trunk of a gigantic kauri stood a human being the Proteus of those subterranean regions a new son of Neptune watching this countless herd of mastodons Immanis pecoris custos immanior ipse one one The shepherd of gigantic herds and huger still himself Yes truly huger still himself It was no longer a fossil being like him whose dried remains we had easily lifted up in the field of bones it was a giant able to control those monsters In stature he was at least twelve feet high His head huge and unshapely as a buffalo s was half hidden in the thick and tangled growth of his unkempt hair It most resembled the mane of the primitive elephant In his hand he wielded with ease an enormous bough a staff worthy of this shepherd of the geologic period We stood petrified and speechless with amazement But he might see us We must fly Come do come I said to my uncle who for once allowed himself to be persuaded In another quarter of an hour our nimble heels had carried us beyond the reach of this horrible monster And yet now that I can reflect quietly now that my spirit has grown calm again now that months have slipped by since this strange and supernatural meeting what am I to think what am I to believe I must conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been deceived that our eyes did not see what we supposed they saw No human being lives in this subterranean world no generation of men dwells in those inferior caverns of the globe unknown to and unconnected with the inhabitants of its surface It is absurd to believe it I had rather admit that it may have been some animal whose structure resembled the human some ape or baboon of the early geological ages some protopitheca or some mesopitheca some early or middle ape like that discovered by mister Lartet in the bone cave of Sansau But this creature surpassed in stature all the measurements known in modern palaeontology But that a man a living man and therefore whole generations doubtless besides should be buried there in the bowels of the earth is impossible However we had left behind us the luminous forest dumb with astonishment overwhelmed and struck down with a terror which amounted to stupefaction We kept running on for fear the horrible monster might be on our track It was a flight a fall like that fearful pulling and dragging which is peculiar to nightmare Instinctively we got back to the Liedenbrock sea and I cannot say into what vagaries my mind would not have carried me but for a circumstance which brought me back to practical matters Although I was certain that we were now treading upon a soil not hitherto touched by our feet I often perceived groups of rocks which reminded me of those about Port Graeuben Besides this seemed to confirm the indications of the needle and to show that we had against our will returned to the north of the Liedenbrock sea Occasionally we felt quite convinced Brooks and waterfalls were tumbling everywhere from the projections in the rocks I thought I recognised the bed of surturbrand our faithful Hansbach and the grotto in which I had recovered life and consciousness Then a few paces farther on the arrangement of the cliffs the appearance of an unrecognised stream or the strange outline of a rock came to throw me again into doubt I communicated my doubts to my uncle Like myself he hesitated he could recognise nothing again amidst this monotonous scene Evidently said I we have not landed again at our original starting point but the storm has carried us a little higher and if we follow the shore we shall find Port Graeuben If that is the case it will be useless to continue our exploration and we had better return to our raft But Axel are you not mistaken It is difficult to speak decidedly uncle for all these rocks are so very much alike Yet I think I recognise the promontory at the foot of which Hans constructed our launch We must be very near the little port if indeed this is not it I added examining a creek which I thought I recognised No Axel we should at least find our own traces and I see nothing But I do see I cried darting upon an object lying on the sand And I showed my uncle a rusty dagger which I had just picked up Come said he had you this weapon with you I No certainly But you perhaps Not that I am aware said the Professor I have never had this object in my possession Well this is strange No Axel it is very simple The Icelanders often wear arms of this kind This must have belonged to Hans and he has lost it I shook my head Hans had never had an object like this in his possession Did it not belong to some pre adamite warrior I cried to some living man contemporary with the huge cattle driver But no This is not a relic of the stone age It is not even of the iron age This blade is steel My uncle stopped me abruptly on my way to a dissertation which would have taken me a long way and said coolly Be calm Axel and reasonable This dagger belongs to the sixteenth century it is a poniard such as gentlemen carried in their belts to give the coup de grace Its origin is Spanish It was never either yours or mine or the hunter s nor did it belong to any of those human beings who may or may not inhabit this inner world See it was never jagged like this by cutting men s throats its blade is coated with a rust neither a day nor a year nor a hundred years old The Professor was getting excited according to his wont and was allowing his imagination to run away with him Axel we are on the way towards the grand discovery This blade has been left on the strand for from one to three hundred years and has blunted its edge upon the rocks that fringe this subterranean sea But it has not come alone It has not twisted itself out of shape some one has been here before us Yes a man has And who was that man A man who has engraved his name somewhere with that dagger That man wanted once more to mark the way to the centre of the earth Let us look about look about And wonderfully interested we peered all along the high wall peeping into every fissure which might open out into a gallery And so we arrived at a place where the shore was much narrowed Here the sea came to lap the foot of the steep cliff leaving a passage no wider than a couple of yards Between two boldly projecting rocks appeared the mouth of a dark tunnel There upon a granite slab appeared two mysterious graven letters half eaten away by time They were the initials of the bold and daring traveller Runic initials appear here A S shouted my uncle Arne Saknussemm Arne Saknussemm everywhere CHAPTER XL PREPARATIONS FOR BLASTING A PASSAGE TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH Since the start upon this marvellous pilgrimage I had been through so many astonishments that I might well be excused for thinking myself well hardened against any further surprise Yet at the sight of these two letters engraved on this spot three hundred years ago I stood aghast in dumb amazement Not only were the initials of the learned alchemist visible upon the living rock but there lay the iron point with which the letters had been engraved I could no longer doubt of the existence of that wonderful traveller and of the fact of his unparalleled journey without the most glaring incredulity Whilst these reflections were occupying me Professor Liedenbrock had launched into a somewhat rhapsodical eulogium of which Arne Saknussemm was of course the hero Thou marvellous genius he cried thou hast not forgotten one indication which might serve to lay open to mortals the road through the terrestrial crust and thy fellow creatures may even now after the lapse of three centuries again trace thy footsteps through these deep and darksome ways You reserved the contemplation of these wonders for other eyes besides your own Your name graven from stage to stage leads the bold follower of your footsteps to the very centre of our planet s core and there again we shall find your own name written with your own hand I too will inscribe my name upon this dark granite page But for ever henceforth let this cape that advances into the sea discovered by yourself be known by your own illustrious name Cape Saknussemm Such were the glowing words of panegyric which fell upon my attentive ear and I could not resist the sentiment of enthusiasm with which I too was infected The fire of zeal kindled afresh in me I forgot everything I dismissed from my mind the past perils of the journey the future danger of our return That which another had done I supposed we might also do and nothing that was not superhuman appeared impossible to me Forward forward I cried I was already darting down the gloomy tunnel when the Professor stopped me he the man of impulse counselled patience and coolness Let us first return to Hans he said and bring the raft to this spot I obeyed not without dissatisfaction and passed out rapidly among the rocks on the shore I said Uncle do you know it seems to me that circumstances have wonderfully befriended us hitherto You think so Axel No doubt even the tempest has put us on the right way Blessings on that storm It has brought us back to this coast from which fine weather would have carried us far away Suppose we had touched with our prow the prow of a rudder the southern shore of the Liedenbrock sea what would have become of us We should never have seen the name of Saknussemm and we should at this moment be imprisoned on a rockbound impassable coast Yes Axel it is providential that whilst supposing we were steering south we should have just got back north at Cape Saknussemm I must say that this is astonishing and that I feel I have no way to explain it What does that signify uncle Our business is not to explain facts but to use them Certainly but Well uncle we are going to resume the northern route and to pass under the north countries of Europe under Sweden Russia Siberia who knows where instead of burrowing under the deserts of Africa or perhaps the waves of the Atlantic and that is all I want to know Yes Axel you are right It is all for the best since we have left that weary horizontal sea which led us nowhere Now we shall go down down down Do you know that it is now only fifteen hundred leagues to the centre of the globe Is that all I cried Why that s nothing Let us start march All this crazy talk was going on still when we met the hunter Everything was made ready for our instant departure Every bit of cordage was put on board We took our places and with our sail set Hans steered us along the coast to Cape Saknussemm The wind was unfavourable to a species of launch not calculated for shallow water In many places we were obliged to push ourselves along with iron pointed sticks Often the sunken rocks just beneath the surface obliged us to deviate from our straight course At last after three hours sailing about six in the evening we reached a place suitable for our landing I jumped ashore followed by my uncle and the Icelander This short passage had not served to cool my ardour On the contrary I even proposed to burn our ship to prevent the possibility of return but my uncle would not consent to that I thought him singularly lukewarm At least I said don t let us lose a minute Yes yes lad he replied but first let us examine this new gallery to see if we shall require our ladders My uncle put his Ruhmkorff s apparatus in action the raft moored to the shore was left alone the mouth of the tunnel was not twenty yards from us and our party with myself at the head made for it without a moment s delay The aperture which was almost round was about five feet in diameter the dark passage was cut out in the live rock and lined with a coat of the eruptive matter which formerly issued from it the interior was level with the ground outside so that we were able to enter without difficulty We were following a horizontal plane when only six paces in our progress was interrupted by an enormous block just across our way Accursed rock I cried in a passion finding myself suddenly confronted by an impassable obstacle Right and left we searched in vain for a way up and down side to side there was no getting any farther I felt fearfully disappointed and I would not admit that the obstacle was final I stopped I looked underneath the block no opening Above granite still Hans passed his lamp over every portion of the barrier in vain We must give up all hope of passing it I sat down in despair My uncle strode from side to side in the narrow passage But how was it with Saknussemm I cried Yes said my uncle was he stopped by this stone barrier No no I replied with animation This fragment of rock has been shaken down by some shock or convulsion or by one of those magnetic storms which agitate these regions and has blocked up the passage which lay open to him Many years have elapsed since the return of Saknussemm to the surface and the fall of this huge fragment Is it not evident that this gallery was once the way open to the course of the lava and that at that time there must have been a free passage See here are recent fissures grooving and channelling the granite roof This roof itself is formed of fragments of rock carried down of enormous stones as if by some giant s hand but at one time the expulsive force was greater than usual and this block like the falling keystone of a ruined arch has slipped down to the ground and blocked up the way It is only an accidental obstruction not met by Saknussemm and if we don t destroy it we shall be unworthy to reach the centre of the earth Such was my sentence The soul of the Professor had passed into me The genius of discovery possessed me wholly I forgot the past I scorned the future I gave not a thought to the things of the surface of this globe into which I had dived its cities and its sunny plains Hamburg and the Koenigstrasse even poor Graeuben who must have given us up for lost all were for the time dismissed from the pages of my memory Well cried my uncle let us make a way with our pickaxes Too hard for the pickaxe Well then the spade That would take us too long What then Why gunpowder to be sure Let us mine the obstacle and blow it up Oh yes it is only a bit of rock to blast Hans to work cried my uncle The Icelander returned to the raft and soon came back with an iron bar which he made use of to bore a hole for the charge This was no easy work A hole was to be made large enough to hold fifty pounds of guncotton whose expansive force is four times that of gunpowder I was terribly excited Whilst Hans was at work I was actively helping my uncle to prepare a slow match of wetted powder encased in linen This will do it I said It will replied my uncle By midnight our mining preparations were over the charge was rammed into the hole and the slow match uncoiled along the gallery showed its end outside the opening A spark would now develop the whole of our preparations into activity To morrow said the Professor I had to be resigned and to wait six long hours CHAPTER XLI THE GREAT EXPLOSION AND THE RUSH DOWN BELOW The next day Thursday August twenty seven is a well remembered date in our subterranean journey It never returns to my memory without sending through me a shudder of horror and a palpitation of the heart From that hour we had no further occasion for the exercise of reason or judgment or skill or contrivance We were henceforth to be hurled along the playthings of the fierce elements of the deep At six we were afoot The moment drew near to clear a way by blasting through the opposing mass of granite I begged for the honour of lighting the fuse This duty done I was to join my companions on the raft which had not yet been unloaded we should then push off as far as we could and avoid the dangers arising from the explosion the effects of which were not likely to be confined to the rock itself The fuse was calculated to burn ten minutes before setting fire to the mine I therefore had sufficient time to get away to the raft I prepared to fulfil my task with some anxiety After a hasty meal my uncle and the hunter embarked whilst I remained on shore I was supplied with a lighted lantern to set fire to the fuse Now go said my uncle and return immediately to us Don t be uneasy I replied I will not play by the way I immediately proceeded to the mouth of the tunnel I opened my lantern I laid hold of the end of the match The Professor stood chronometer in hand Ready he cried Ay Fire I instantly plunged the end of the fuse into the lantern It spluttered and flamed and I ran at the top of my speed to the raft Come on board quickly and let us push off Hans with a vigorous thrust sent us from the shore The raft shot twenty fathoms out to sea It was a moment of intense excitement The Professor was watching the hand of the chronometer Five minutes more he said Four Three My pulse beat half seconds Two One Down granite rocks down with you What took place at that moment I believe I did not hear the dull roar of the explosion But the rocks suddenly assumed a new arrangement they rent asunder like a curtain I saw a bottomless pit open on the shore The sea lashed into sudden fury rose up in an enormous billow on the ridge of which the unhappy raft was uplifted bodily in the air with all its crew and cargo We all three fell down flat In less than a second we were in deep unfathomable darkness Then I felt as if not only myself but the raft also had no support beneath I thought it was sinking but it was not so I wanted to speak to my uncle but the roaring of the waves prevented him from hearing even the sound of my voice In spite of darkness noise astonishment and terror I then understood what had taken place On the other side of the blown up rock was an abyss The explosion had caused a kind of earthquake in this fissured and abysmal region a great gulf had opened and the sea now changed into a torrent was hurrying us along into it I gave myself up for lost An hour passed away two hours perhaps I cannot tell We clutched each other fast to save ourselves from being thrown off the raft We felt violent shocks whenever we were borne heavily against the craggy projections Yet these shocks were not very frequent from which I concluded that the gully was widening It was no doubt the same road that Saknussemm had taken but instead of walking peaceably down it as he had done we were carrying a whole sea along with us These ideas it will be understood presented themselves to my mind in a vague and undetermined form I had difficulty in associating any ideas together during this headlong race which seemed like a vertical descent To judge by the air which was whistling past me and made a whizzing in my ears we were moving faster than the fastest express trains To light a torch under these conditions would have been impossible and our last electric apparatus had been shattered by the force of the explosion I was therefore much surprised to see a clear light shining near me It lighted up the calm and unmoved countenance of Hans The skilful huntsman had succeeded in lighting the lantern and although it flickered so much as to threaten to go out it threw a fitful light across the awful darkness I was right in my supposition It was a wide gallery The dim light could not show us both its walls at once The fall of the waters which were carrying us away exceeded that of the swiftest rapids in American rivers Its surface seemed composed of a sheaf of arrows hurled with inconceivable force I cannot convey my impressions by a better comparison The raft occasionally seized by an eddy spun round as it still flew along When it approached the walls of the gallery I threw on them the light of the lantern and I could judge somewhat of the velocity of our speed by noticing how the jagged projections of the rocks spun into endless ribbons and bands so that we seemed confined within a network of shifting lines I supposed we were running at the rate of thirty leagues an hour My uncle and I gazed on each other with haggard eyes clinging to the stump of the mast which had snapped asunder at the first shock of our great catastrophe We kept our backs to the wind not to be stifled by the rapidity of a movement which no human power could check Hours passed away No change in our situation but a discovery came to complicate matters and make them worse In seeking to put our cargo into somewhat better order I found that the greater part of the articles embarked had disappeared at the moment of the explosion when the sea broke in upon us with such violence I wanted to know exactly what we had saved and with the lantern in my hand I began my examination Of our instruments none were saved but the compass and the chronometer our stock of ropes and ladders was reduced to the bit of cord rolled round the stump of the mast Not a spade not a pickaxe not a hammer was left us and irreparable disaster we had only one day s provisions left I searched every nook and corner every crack and cranny in the raft There was nothing Our provisions were reduced to one bit of salt meat and a few biscuits I stared at our failing supplies stupidly I refused to take in the gravity of our loss And yet what was the use of troubling myself If we had had provisions enough for months how could we get out of the abyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent Why should we fear the horrors of famine when death was swooping down upon us in a multitude of other forms Would there be time left to die of starvation Yet by an inexplicable play of the imagination I forgot my present dangers to contemplate the threatening future Was there any chance of escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent and of returning to the surface of the globe I could not form the slightest conjecture how or when But one chance in a thousand or ten thousand is still a chance whilst death from starvation would leave us not the smallest hope in the world The thought came into my mind to declare the whole truth to my uncle to show him the dreadful straits to which we were reduced and to calculate how long we might yet expect to live But I had the courage to preserve silence I wished to leave him cool and self possessed At that moment the light from our lantern began to sink by little and little and then went out entirely The wick had burnt itself out Black night reigned again and there was no hope left of being able to dissipate the palpable darkness We had yet a torch left but we could not have kept it alight Then like a child I closed my eyes firmly not to see the darkness After a considerable lapse of time our speed redoubled I could perceive it by the sharpness of the currents that blew past my face The descent became steeper I believe we were no longer sliding but falling down I had an impression that we were dropping vertically My uncle s hand and the vigorous arm of Hans held me fast Suddenly after a space of time that I could not measure I felt a shock The raft had not struck against any hard resistance but had suddenly been checked in its fall A waterspout an immense liquid column was beating upon the surface of the waters I was suffocating I was drowning But this sudden flood was not of long duration In a few seconds I found myself in the air again which I inhaled with all the force of my lungs My uncle and Hans were still holding me fast by the arms and the raft was still carrying us CHAPTER XLII HEADLONG SPEED UPWARD THROUGH THE HORRORS OF DARKNESS It might have been as I guessed about ten at night The first of my senses which came into play after this last bout was that of hearing All at once I could hear and it was a real exercise of the sense of hearing I could hear the silence in the gallery after the din which for hours had stunned me At last these words of my uncle s came to me like a vague murmuring We are going up What do you mean I cried Yes we are going up up I stretched out my arm I touched the wall and drew back my hand bleeding We were ascending with extreme rapidity The torch The torch cried the Professor Not without difficulty Hans succeeded in lighting the torch and the flame preserving its upward tendency threw enough light to show us what kind of a place we were in Just as I thought said the Professor We are in a tunnel not four and twenty feet in diameter The water had reached the bottom of the gulf It is now rising to its level and carrying us with it Where to I cannot tell but we must be ready for anything We are mounting at a speed which seems to me of fourteen feet in a second or ten miles an hour At this rate we shall get on Yes if nothing stops us if this well has an aperture But suppose it to be stopped If the air is condensed by the pressure of this column of water we shall be crushed Axel replied the Professor with perfect coolness our situation is almost desperate but there are some chances of deliverance and it is these that I am considering If at every instant we may perish so at every instant we may be saved Let us then be prepared to seize upon the smallest advantage But what shall we do now Recruit our strength by eating At these words I fixed a haggard eye upon my uncle That which I had been so unwilling to confess at last had to be told Eat did you say Yes at once The Professor added a few words in Danish but Hans shook his head mournfully What cried my uncle Have we lost our provisions Yes here is all we have left one bit of salt meat for the three My uncle stared at me as if he could not understand Well said I do you think we have any chance of being saved My question was unanswered An hour passed away I began to feel the pangs of a violent hunger My companions were suffering too and not one of us dared touch this wretched remnant of our goodly store But now we were mounting up with excessive speed Sometimes the air would cut our breath short as is experienced by aeronauts ascending too rapidly But whilst they suffer from cold in proportion to their rise we were beginning to feel a contrary effect The heat was increasing in a manner to cause us the most fearful anxiety and certainly the temperature was at this moment at the height of one hundred deg Fahr What could be the meaning of such a change Up to this time facts had supported the theories of Davy and of Liedenbrock until now particular conditions of non conducting rocks electricity and magnetism had tempered the laws of nature giving us only a moderately warm climate for the theory of a central fire remained in my estimation the only one that was true and explicable Were we then turning back to where the phenomena of central heat ruled in all their rigour and would reduce the most refractory rocks to the state of a molten liquid I feared this and said to the Professor If we are neither drowned nor shattered to pieces nor starved to death there is still the chance that we may be burned alive and reduced to ashes At this he shrugged his shoulders and returned to his thoughts Another hour passed and except some slight increase in the temperature nothing new had happened Come said he we must determine upon something Determine on what said I Yes we must recruit our strength by carefully rationing ourselves and so prolong our existence by a few hours But we shall be reduced to very great weakness at last And our last hour is not far off Well if there is a chance of safety if a moment for active exertion presents itself where should we find the required strength if we allowed ourselves to be enfeebled by hunger Well uncle when this bit of meat has been devoured what shall we have left Nothing Axel nothing at all But will it do you any more good to devour it with your eyes than with your teeth Your reasoning has in it neither sense nor energy Then don t you despair I cried irritably No certainly not was the Professor s firm reply What do you think there is any chance of safety left Yes I do as long as the heart beats as long as body and soul keep together I cannot admit that any creature endowed with a will has need to despair of life Resolute words these The man who could speak so under such circumstances was of no ordinary type Finally what do you mean to do I asked Eat what is left to the last crumb and recruit our fading strength This meal will be our last perhaps so let it be But at any rate we shall once more be men and not exhausted empty bags Well let us consume it then I cried My uncle took the piece of meat and the few biscuits which had escaped from the general destruction He divided them into three equal portions and gave one to each This made about a pound of nourishment for each The Professor ate his greedily with a kind of feverish rage I ate without pleasure almost with disgust Hans quietly moderately masticating his small mouthfuls without any noise and relishing them with the calmness of a man above all anxiety about the future By diligent search he had found a flask of Hollands he offered it to us each in turn and this generous beverage cheered us up slightly Fortraefflig said Hans drinking in his turn Excellent replied my uncle A glimpse of hope had returned although without cause But our last meal was over and it was now five in the morning Man is so constituted that health is a purely negative state Hunger once satisfied it is difficult for a man to imagine the horrors of starvation they cannot be understood without being felt Therefore it was that after our long fast these few mouthfuls of meat and biscuit made us triumph over our past agonies But as soon as the meal was done we each of us fell deep into thought What was Hans thinking of that man of the far West but who seemed ruled by the fatalist doctrines of the East As for me my thoughts were made up of remembrances and they carried me up to the surface of the globe of which I ought never to have taken leave The house in the Koenigstrasse my poor dear Graeuben that kind soul Martha flitted like visions before my eyes and in the dismal moanings which from time to time reached my ears I thought I could distinguish the roar of the traffic of the great cities upon earth My uncle still had his eye upon his work Torch in hand he tried to gather some idea of our situation from the observation of the strata This calculation could at best be but a vague approximation but a learned man is always a philosopher when he succeeds in remaining cool and assuredly Professor Liedenbrock possessed this quality to a surprising degree I could hear him murmuring geological terms I could understand them and in spite of myself I felt interested in this last geological study Eruptive granite he was saying We are still in the primitive period But we are going up up higher still Who can tell Ah who can tell With his hand he was examining the perpendicular wall and in a few more minutes he continued This is gneiss here is mica schist Ah presently we shall come to the transition period and then What did the Professor mean Could he be trying to measure the thickness of the crust of the earth that lay between us and the world above Had he any means of making this calculation No he had not the aneroid and no guessing could supply its place Still the temperature kept rising and I felt myself steeped in a broiling atmosphere I could only compare it to the heat of a furnace at the moment when the molten metal is running into the mould Gradually we had been obliged to throw aside our coats and waistcoats the lightest covering became uncomfortable and even painful Are we rising into a fiery furnace I cried at one moment when the heat was redoubling No replied my uncle that is impossible quite impossible Yet I answered feeling the wall this well is burning hot At the same moment touching the water I had to withdraw my hand in haste The water is scalding I cried This time the Professor s only answer was an angry gesture Then an unconquerable terror seized upon me from which I could no longer get free I felt that a catastrophe was approaching before which the boldest spirit must quail A dim vague notion laid hold of my mind but which was fast hardening into certainty I tried to repel it but it would return I dared not express it in plain terms Yet a few involuntary observations confirmed me in my view By the flickering light of the torch I could distinguish contortions in the granite beds a phenomenon was unfolding in which electricity would play the principal part then this unbearable heat this boiling water I consulted the compass The compass had lost its properties it had ceased to act properly CHAPTER XLIII SHOT OUT OF A VOLCANO AT LAST Yes our compass was no longer a guide the needle flew from pole to pole with a kind of frenzied impulse it ran round the dial and spun hither and thither as if it were giddy or intoxicated I knew quite well that according to the best received theories the mineral covering of the globe is never at absolute rest the changes brought about by the chemical decomposition of its component parts the agitation caused by great liquid torrents and the magnetic currents are continually tending to disturb it even when living beings upon its surface may fancy that all is quiet below A phenomenon of this kind would not have greatly alarmed me or at any rate it would not have given rise to dreadful apprehensions But other facts other circumstances of a peculiar nature came to reveal to me by degrees the true state of the case There came incessant and continuous explosions I could only compare them to the loud rattle of a long train of chariots driven at full speed over the stones or a roar of unintermitting thunder Then the disordered compass thrown out of gear by the electric currents confirmed me in a growing conviction The mineral crust of the globe threatened to burst up the granite foundations to come together with a crash the fissure through which we were helplessly driven would be filled up the void would be full of crushed fragments of rock and we poor wretched mortals were to be buried and annihilated in this dreadful consummation My uncle I cried we are lost now utterly lost What are you in a fright about now was the calm rejoinder What is the matter with you The matter Look at those quaking walls look at those shivering rocks Don t you feel the burning heat Don t you see how the water boils and bubbles Are you blind to the dense vapours and steam growing thicker and denser every minute See this agitated compass needle It is an earthquake that is threatening us My undaunted uncle calmly shook his head Do you think said he an earthquake is coming I do Well I think you are mistaken What don t you recognise the symptoms Of an earthquake no I am looking out for something better What can you mean Explain It is an eruption Axel An eruption Do you mean to affirm that we are running up the shaft of a volcano I believe we are said the indomitable Professor with an air of perfect self possession and it is the best thing that could possibly happen to us under our circumstances The best thing Was my uncle stark mad What did the man mean and what was the use of saying facetious things at a time like this What I shouted Are we being taken up in an eruption Our fate has flung us here among burning lavas molten rocks boiling waters and all kinds of volcanic matter we are going to be pitched out expelled tossed up vomited spit out high into the air along with fragments of rock showers of ashes and scoria in the midst of a towering rush of smoke and flames and it is the best thing that could happen to us Yes replied the Professor eyeing me over his spectacles I don t see any other way of reaching the surface of the earth I pass rapidly over the thousand ideas which passed through my mind My uncle was right undoubtedly right and never had he seemed to me more daring and more confirmed in his notions than at this moment when he was calmly contemplating the chances of being shot out of a volcano In the meantime up we went the night passed away in continual ascent the din and uproar around us became more and more intensified I was stifled and stunned I thought my last hour was approaching and yet imagination is such a strong thing that even in this supreme hour I was occupied with strange and almost childish speculations But I was the victim not the master of my own thoughts It was very evident that we were being hurried upward upon the crest of a wave of eruption beneath our raft were boiling waters and under these the more sluggish lava was working its way up in a heated mass together with shoals of fragments of rock which when they arrived at the crater would be dispersed in all directions high and low We were imprisoned in the shaft or chimney of some volcano There was no room to doubt of that But this time instead of Snaefell an extinct volcano we were inside one in full activity I wondered therefore where could this mountain be and in what part of the world we were to be shot out I made no doubt but that it would be in some northern region Before its disorders set in the needle had never deviated from that direction From Cape Saknussemm we had been carried due north for hundreds of leagues Were we under Iceland again Were we destined to be thrown up out of Hecla or by which of the seven other fiery craters in that island Within a radius of five hundred leagues to the west I remembered under this parallel of latitude only the imperfectly known volcanoes of the north east coast of America To the east there was only one in the eightieth degree of north latitude the Esk in Jan Mayen Island not far from Spitzbergen Certainly there was no lack of craters and there were some capacious enough to throw out a whole army But I wanted to know which of them was to serve us for an exit from the inner world Towards morning the ascending movement became accelerated If the heat increased instead of diminishing as we approached nearer to the surface of the globe this effect was due to local causes alone and those volcanic The manner of our locomotion left no doubt in my mind An enormous force a force of hundreds of atmospheres generated by the extreme pressure of confined vapours was driving us irresistibly forward But to what numberless dangers it exposed us Soon lurid lights began to penetrate the vertical gallery which widened as we went up Right and left I could see deep channels like huge tunnels out of which escaped dense volumes of smoke tongues of fire lapped the walls which crackled and sputtered under the intense heat See see my uncle I cried Well those are only sulphureous flames and vapours which one must expect to see in an eruption They are quite natural But suppose they should wrap us round But they won t wrap us round But we shall be stifled We shall not be stifled at all The gallery is widening and if it becomes necessary we shall abandon the raft and creep into a crevice But the water the rising water There is no more water Axel only a lava paste which is bearing us up on its surface to the top of the crater The liquid column had indeed disappeared to give place to dense and still boiling eruptive matter of all kinds The temperature was becoming unbearable A thermometer exposed to this atmosphere would have marked one hundred fifty deg The perspiration streamed from my body But for the rapidity of our ascent we should have been suffocated But the Professor gave up his idea of abandoning the raft and it was well he did However roughly joined together those planks afforded us a firmer support than we could have found anywhere else About eight in the morning a new incident occurred The upward movement ceased The raft lay motionless What is this I asked shaken by this sudden stoppage as if by a shock It is a halt replied my uncle Is the eruption checked I asked I hope not I rose and tried to look around me Perhaps the raft itself stopped in its course by a projection was staying the volcanic torrent If this were the case we should have to release it as soon as possible But it was not so The blast of ashes scorix and rubbish had ceased to rise Has the eruption stopped I cried Ah said my uncle between his clenched teeth you are afraid But don t alarm yourself this lull cannot last long It has lasted now five minutes and in a short time we shall resume our journey to the mouth of the crater As he spoke the Professor continued to consult his chronometer and he was again right in his prognostications The raft was soon hurried and driven forward with a rapid but irregular movement which lasted about ten minutes and then stopped again Very good said my uncle in ten minutes more we shall be off again for our present business lies with an intermittent volcano It gives us time now and then to take breath This was perfectly true When the ten minutes were over we started off again with renewed and increased speed We were obliged to lay fast hold of the planks of the raft not to be thrown off Then again the paroxysm was over I have since reflected upon this singular phenomenon without being able to explain it At any rate it was clear that we were not in the main shaft of the volcano but in a lateral gallery where there were felt recurrent tunes of reaction How often this operation was repeated I cannot say All I know is that at each fresh impulse we were hurled forward with a greatly increased force and we seemed as if we were mere projectiles During the short halts we were stifled with the heat whilst we were being projected forward the hot air almost stopped my breath I thought for a moment how delightful it would be to find myself carried suddenly into the arctic regions with a cold thirty deg below the freezing point My overheated brain conjured up visions of white plains of cool snow where I might roll and allay my feverish heat Little by little my brain weakened by so many constantly repeated shocks seemed to be giving way altogether But for the strong arm of Hans I should more than once have had my head broken against the granite roof of our burning dungeon I have therefore no exact recollection of what took place during the following hours I have a confused impression left of continuous explosions loud detonations a general shaking of the rocks all around us and of a spinning movement with which our raft was once whirled helplessly round It rocked upon the lava torrent amidst a dense fall of ashes Snorting flames darted their fiery tongues at us There were wild fierce puffs of stormy wind from below resembling the blasts of vast iron furnaces blowing all at one time and I caught a glimpse of the figure of Hans lighted up by the fire and all the feeling I had left was just what I imagine must be the feeling of an unhappy criminal doomed to be blown away alive from the mouth of a cannon just before the trigger is pulled and the flying limbs and rags of flesh and skin fill the quivering air and spatter the blood stained ground CHAPTER XLIV SUNNY LANDS IN THE BLUE MEDITERRANEAN When I opened my eyes again I felt myself grasped by the belt with the strong hand of our guide With the other arm he supported my uncle I was not seriously hurt but I was shaken and bruised and battered all over I found myself lying on the sloping side of a mountain only two yards from a gaping gulf which would have swallowed me up had I leaned at all that way Hans had saved me from death whilst I lay rolling on the edge of the crater Where are we asked my uncle irascibly as if he felt much injured by being landed upon the earth again The hunter shook his head in token of complete ignorance Is it Iceland I asked Nej replied Hans What Not Iceland cried the Professor Hans must be mistaken I said raising myself up This was our final surprise after all the astonishing events of our wonderful journey I expected to see a white cone covered with the eternal snow of ages rising from the midst of the barren deserts of the icy north faintly lighted with the pale rays of the arctic sun far away in the highest latitudes known but contrary to all our expectations my uncle the Icelander and myself were sitting half way down a mountain baked under the burning rays of a southern sun which was blistering us with the heat and blinding us with the fierce light of his nearly vertical rays I could not believe my own eyes but the heated air and the sensation of burning left me no room for doubt We had come out of the crater half naked and the radiant orb to which we had been strangers for two months was lavishing upon us out of his blazing splendours more of his light and heat than we were able to receive with comfort When my eyes had become accustomed to the bright light to which they had been so long strangers I began to use them to set my imagination right At least I would have it to be Spitzbergen and I was in no humour to give up this notion The Professor was the first to speak and said Well this is not much like Iceland But is it Jan Mayen I asked Nor that either he answered This is no northern mountain here are no granite peaks capped with snow Look Axel look Above our heads at a height of five hundred feet or more we saw the crater of a volcano through which at intervals of fifteen minutes or so there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire mingled with pumice stones ashes and flowing lava I could feel the heaving of the mountain which seemed to breathe like a huge whale and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes Beneath down a pretty steep declivity ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred feet giving the mountain a height of about thirteen hundred or fourteen hundred feet But the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich verdure amongst which I was able to distinguish the olive the fig and vines covered with their luscious purple bunches I was forced to confess that there was nothing arctic here When the eye passed beyond these green surroundings it rested on a wide blue expanse of sea or lake which appeared to enclose this enchanting island within a compass of only a few leagues Eastward lay a pretty little white seaport town or village with a few houses scattered around it and in the harbour of which a few vessels of peculiar rig were gently swayed by the softly swelling waves Beyond it groups of islets rose from the smooth blue waters but in such numbers that they seemed to dot the sea like a shoal To the west distant coasts lined the dim horizon on some rose blue mountains of smooth undulating forms on a more distant coast arose a prodigious cone crowned on its summit with a snowy plume of white cloud To the northward lay spread a vast sheet of water sparkling and dancing under the hot bright rays the uniformity broken here and there by the topmast of a gallant ship appearing above the horizon or a swelling sail moving slowly before the wind This unforeseen spectacle was most charming to eyes long used to underground darkness Where are we Where are we I asked faintly Hans closed his eyes with lazy indifference What did it matter to him My uncle looked round with dumb surprise Well whatever mountain this may be he said at last it is very hot here The explosions are going on still and I don t think it would look well to have come out by an eruption and then to get our heads broken by bits of falling rock Let us get down Then we shall know better what we are about Besides I am starving and parching with thirst Decidedly the Professor was not given to contemplation For my part I could for another hour or two have forgotten my hunger and my fatigue to enjoy the lovely scene before me but I had to follow my companions The slope of the volcano was in many places of great steepness We slid down screes of ashes carefully avoiding the lava streams which glided sluggishly by us like fiery serpents As we went I chattered and asked all sorts of questions as to our whereabouts for I was too much excited not to talk a great deal We are in Asia I cried on the coasts of India in the Malay Islands or in Oceania We have passed through half the globe and come out nearly at the antipodes But the compass said my uncle Ay the compass I said greatly puzzled According to the compass we have gone northward Has it lied Surely not Could it lie Unless indeed this is the North Pole Oh no it is not the Pole but Well here was something that baffled us completely I could not tell what to say But now we were coming into that delightful greenery and I was suffering greatly from hunger and thirst Happily after two hours walking a charming country lay open before us covered with olive trees pomegranate trees and delicious vines all of which seemed to belong to anybody who pleased to claim them Besides in our state of destitution and famine we were not likely to be particular Oh the inexpressible pleasure of pressing those cool sweet fruits to our lips and eating grapes by mouthfuls off the rich full bunches Not far off in the grass under the delicious shade of the trees I discovered a spring of fresh cool water in which we luxuriously bathed our faces hands and feet Whilst we were thus enjoying the sweets of repose a child appeared out of a grove of olive trees Ah I cried here is an inhabitant of this happy land It was but a poor boy miserably ill clad a sufferer from poverty and our aspect seemed to alarm him a great deal in fact only half clothed with ragged hair and beards we were a suspicious looking party and if the people of the country knew anything about thieves we were very likely to frighten them Just as the poor little wretch was going to take to his heels Hans caught hold of him and brought him to us kicking and struggling My uncle began to encourage him as well as he could and said to him in good German Was heiszt diesen Berg mein Knablein Sage mir geschwind What is this mountain called my little friend The child made no answer Very well said my uncle I infer that we are not in Germany He put the same question in English We got no forwarder I was a good deal puzzled Is the child dumb cried the Professor who proud of his knowledge of many languages now tried French Comment appellet on cette montagne mon enfant Silence still Now let us try Italian said my uncle and he said Dove noi siamo Yes where are we I impatiently repeated But there was no answer still Will you speak when you are told exclaimed my uncle shaking the urchin by the ears Come si noma questa isola STROMBOLI replied the little herdboy slipping out of Hans hands and scudding into the plain across the olive trees We were hardly thinking of that Stromboli What an effect this unexpected name produced upon my mind We were in the midst of the Mediterranean Sea on an island of the AEolian archipelago in the ancient Strongyle where AEolus kept the winds and the storms chained up to be let loose at his will And those distant blue mountains in the east were the mountains of Calabria And that threatening volcano far away in the south was the fierce Etna Stromboli Stromboli I repeated My uncle kept time to my exclamations with hands and feet as well as with words We seemed to be chanting in chorus What a journey we had accomplished How marvellous Having entered by one volcano we had issued out of another more than two thousand miles from Snaefell and from that barren far away Iceland The strange chances of our expedition had carried us into the heart of the fairest region in the world We had exchanged the bleak regions of perpetual snow and of impenetrable barriers of ice for those of brightness and the rich hues of all glorious things We had left over our heads the murky sky and cold fogs of the frigid zone to revel under the azure sky of Italy After our delicious repast of fruits and cold clear water we set off again to reach the port of Stromboli It would not have been wise to tell how we came there The superstitious Italians would have set us down for fire devils vomited out of hell so we presented ourselves in the humble guise of shipwrecked mariners It was not so glorious but it was safer On my way I could hear my uncle murmuring But the compass that compass It pointed due north How are we to explain that fact My opinion is I replied disdainfully that it is best not to explain it That is the easiest way to shelve the difficulty Indeed sir The occupant of a professorial chair at the Johannaeum unable to explain the reason of a cosmical phenomenon Why it would be simply disgraceful And as he spoke my uncle half undressed in rags a perfect scarecrow with his leathern belt around him settling his spectacles upon his nose and looking learned and imposing was himself again the terrible German professor of mineralogy One hour after we had left the grove of olives we arrived at the little port of San Vicenzo where Hans claimed his thirteen week s wages which was counted out to him with a hearty shaking of hands all round At that moment if he did not share our natural emotion at least his countenance expanded in a manner very unusual with him and while with the ends of his fingers he lightly pressed our hands I believe he smiled CHAPTER XLV ALL S WELL THAT ENDS WELL Such is the conclusion of a history which I cannot expect everybody to believe for some people will believe nothing against the testimony of their own experience However I am indifferent to their incredulity and they may believe as much or as little as they please The Stromboliotes received us kindly as shipwrecked mariners They gave us food and clothing After waiting forty eight hours on the thirty one saint of August a small craft took us to Messina where a few days rest completely removed the effect of our fatigues On Friday September the fourth we embarked on the steamer Volturno employed by the French Messageries Imperiales and in three days more we were at Marseilles having no care on our minds except that abominable deceitful compass which we had mislaid somewhere and could not now examine but its inexplicable behaviour exercised my mind fearfully On the ninth of September in the evening we arrived at Hamburg I cannot describe to you the astonishment of Martha or the joy of Graeuben Now you are a hero Axel said to me my blushing fiancee my betrothed you will not leave me again I looked tenderly upon her and she smiled through her tears How can I describe the extraordinary sensation produced by the return of Professor Liedenbrock Thanks to Martha s ineradicable tattling the news that the Professor had gone to discover a way to the centre of the earth had spread over the whole civilised world People refused to believe it and when they saw him they would not believe him any the more Still the appearance of Hans and sundry pieces of intelligence derived from Iceland tended to shake the confidence of the unbelievers Then my uncle became a great man and I was now the nephew of a great man which is not a privilege to be despised Hamburg gave a grand fete in our honour A public audience was given to the Professor at the Johannaeum at which he told all about our expedition with only one omission the unexplained and inexplicable behaviour of our compass On the same day with much state he deposited in the archives of the city the now famous document of Saknussemm and expressed his regret that circumstances over which he had no control had prevented him from following to the very centre of the earth the track of the learned Icelander He was modest notwithstanding his glory and he was all the more famous for his humility So much honour could not but excite envy There were those who envied him his fame and as his theories resting upon known facts were in opposition to the systems of science upon the question of the central fire he sustained with his pen and by his voice remarkable discussions with the learned of every country For my part I cannot agree with his theory of gradual cooling in spite of what I have seen and felt I believe and always shall believe in the central heat But I admit that certain circumstances not yet sufficiently understood may tend to modify in places the action of natural phenomena While these questions were being debated with great animation my uncle met with a real sorrow Our faithful Hans in spite of our entreaties had left Hamburg the man to whom we owed all our success and our lives too would not suffer us to reward him as we could have wished He was seized with the mal de pays a complaint for which we have not even a name in English Farval said he one day and with that simple word he left us and sailed for Rejkiavik which he reached in safety We were strongly attached to our brave eider down hunter though far away in the remotest north he will never be forgotten by those whose lives he protected and certainly I shall not fail to endeavour to see him once more before I die To conclude I have to add that this Journey into the Interior of the Earth created a wonderful sensation in the world It was translated into all civilised languages The leading newspapers extracted the most interesting passages which were commented upon picked to pieces discussed attacked and defended with equal enthusiasm and determination both by believers and sceptics Rare privilege my uncle enjoyed during his lifetime the glory he had deservedly won and he may even boast the distinguished honour of an offer from mister Barnum to exhibit him on most advantageous terms in all the principal cities in the United States But there was one dead fly amidst all this glory and honour one fact one incident of the journey remained a mystery Now to a man eminent for his learning an unexplained phenomenon is an unbearable hardship Well it was yet reserved for my uncle to be completely happy One day while arranging a collection of minerals in his cabinet I noticed in a corner this unhappy compass which we had long lost sight of I opened it and began to watch it It had been in that corner for six months little mindful of the trouble it was giving Suddenly to my intense astonishment I noticed a strange fact and I uttered a cry of surprise What is the matter my uncle asked That compass Well See its poles are reversed Reversed Yes they point the wrong way My uncle looked he compared and the house shook with his triumphant leap of exultation A light broke in upon his spirit and mine See there he cried as soon as he was able to speak After our arrival at Cape Saknussemm the north pole of the needle of this confounded compass began to point south instead of north Evidently Here then is the explanation of our mistake But what phenomenon could have caused this reversal of the poles The reason is evident uncle Tell me then Axel During the electric storm on the Liedenbrock sea that ball of fire which magnetised all the iron on board reversed the poles of our magnet Aha aha shouted the Professor with a loud laugh So it was just an electric joke From that day forth the Professor was the most glorious of savants and I was the happiest of men for my pretty Virlandaise resigning her place as ward took her position in the old house on the Koenigstrasse in the double capacity of niece to my uncle and wife to a certain happy youth What is the need of adding that the illustrious Otto Liedenbrock corresponding member of all the scientific geographical and mineralogical societies of all the civilised world was now her uncle and mine End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Journey to the Interior of the Earth by
