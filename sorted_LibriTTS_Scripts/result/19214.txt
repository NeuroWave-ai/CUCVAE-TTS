Pius V fifteen seventy two Gregory XIII fifteen eighty five Sixtus V fifteen ninety Urban VII fifteen ninety Gregory XIV fifteen ninety one Innocent IX fifteen ninety one Clement VII In a nation so divided as the English it could scarcely be expected that the death of one sovereign and the accession of another who was generally believed to have embraced opposite principles to those which prevailed could be the object of universal satisfaction yet so much were men displeased with the present conduct of affairs and such apprehensions were entertained of futurity that the people overlooking their theological disputes expressed a general and unfeigned joy that the sceptre had passed into the hand of Elizabeth That princess had discovered great prudence in her conduct during the reign of her sister and as men were sensible of the imminent danger to which she was every moment exposed compassion towards her situation and concern for her safety had rendered her to an uncommon degree the favorite of the nation A parliament had been assembled a few days before Mary s death and when Heathe archbishop of York then chancellor notified to them that event scarcely an interval of regret appeared and the two houses immediately resounded with the joyful acclamations of God save Queen Elizabeth long and happily may she reign The people less actuated by faction and less influenced by private views expressed a joy still more general and hearty on her proclamation and the auspicious commencement of this reign prognosticated that felicity and glory which during its whole course so uniformly attended it Elizabeth was at Hatfield when she heard of her sister s death and after a few days she went thence to London through crowds of people who strove with each other in giving her the strongest testimony of their affection On her entrance into the Tower she could not forbear reflecting on the great difference between her present fortune and that which a few years before had attended her when she was conducted to that place as a prisoner and lay there exposed to all the bigoted malignity of her enemies She fell on her knees and expressed her thanks to Heaven for the deliverance which the Almighty had granted her from her bloody persecutors a deliverance she said no less miraculous than that which Daniel had received from the den of lions This act of pious gratitude seems to have been the last circumstance in which she remembered any past hardships and injuries With a prudence and magnanimity truly laudable she buried all offences in oblivion and received with affability even those who had acted with the greatest malevolence against her Sir Henry Benningfield himself to whose custody she had been committed and who had treated her with severity never felt during the whole course of her reign any effects of her resentment Yet was not the gracious reception which she gave prostitute and undistinguishing When the bishops came in a body to make their obeisance to her she expressed to all of them sentiments of regard except to Bonner from whom she turned aside as from a man polluted with blood who was a just object of horror to every heart susceptible of humanity Burnet vol ii p three hundred seventy three Burnet vol ii p three hundred seventy four Burnet vol ii p three hundred seventy four Heylin p one hundred two After employing a few days in ordering her domestic affairs Elizabeth notified to foreign courts her sister s death and her own accession She sent Lord Cobham to the Low Countries where Philip then resided and she took care to express to that monarch her gratitude for the protection which he had afforded her and her desire of persevering in that friendship which had so happily commenced between them Philip who had long foreseen this event and who still hoped by means of Elizabeth to obtain that dominion over England of which he had failed in espousing Mary immediately despatched orders to the duke of Feria his ambassador at London to make proposals of marriage to the queen and he offered to procure from Rome a dispensation for that purpose But Elizabeth soon came to the resolution of declining the proposal She saw that the nation had entertained an extreme aversion to the Spanish alliance during her sister s reign and that one great cause of the popularity which she herself enjoyed was the prospect of being freed by her means from the danger of foreign subjection She was sensible that her affinity with Philip was exactly similar to that of her father with Catharine of Arragon and that her marrying that monarch was in effect declaring herself illegitimate and incapable of succeeding to the throne And though the power of the Spanish monarchy might still be sufficient in opposition to all pretenders to support her title her masculine spirit disdained such precarious dominion which as it would depend solely on the power of another must be exercised according to his inclinations But while these views prevented her from entertaining any thoughts of a marriage with Philip she gave him an obliging though evasive answer and he still retained such hopes of success that he sent a messenger to Rome with orders to solicit the dispensation Camden in Kennet p three hundred seventy Burnet vol ii p three hundred seventy five The queen too on her sister s death had written to Sir Edward Carne the English ambassador at Rome to notify her accession to the pope but the precipitate nature of Paul broke through all the cautious measures concerted by this young princess He told Carne that England was a fief of the holy see and it was great temerity in Elizabeth to have assumed without his participation the title and authority of queen that being illegitimate she could not possibly inherit that kingdom nor could he annul the sentence pronounced by Clement VII and Paul III with regard to Henry s marriage that were he to proceed with rigor he should punish this criminal invasion of his rights by rejecting all her applications but being willing to treat her with paternal indulgence he would still keep the door of grace open to her and that if she would renounce all pretensions to the crown and submit entirely to his will she should experience the utmost lenity compatible with the dignity of the apostolic see When this answer was reported to Elizabeth she was astonished at the character of that aged pontiff and having recalled her ambassador she continued with more determined resolution to pursue those measures which already she had secretly embraced The queen not to alarm the partisans of the Catholic religion had retained eleven of her sister s counsellors but in order to balance their authority she added eight more who were known to be inclined to the Protestant communion the marquis of Northampton the earl of Bedford Sir Thomas Parry Sir Edward Rogers Sir Ambrose Cave Sir Francis Knolles Sir Nicholas Bacon whom she created lord keeper and Sir William Cecil secretary of state Father Paul lib v Strype s Ann vol i p five With these counsellors particularly Cecil she frequently deliberated concerning the expediency of restoring the Protestant religion and the means of executing that great enterprise Cecil told her that the greater part of the nation had ever since her father s reign inclined to the reformation and though her sister had constrained them to profess the ancient faith the cruelties exercised by her ministers had still more alienated their affections from it that happily the interests of the sovereign here concurred with the inclinations of the people nor was her title to the crown compatible with the authority of the Roman pontiff that a sentence so solemnly pronounced by two popes against her mother s marriage could not possibly be recalled without inflicting a mortal wound on the credit of the see of Rome and even if she were allowed to retain the crown it would only be on an uncertain and dependent footing that this circumstance alone counterbalanced all dangers whatsoever and these dangers themselves if narrowly examined would be found very little formidable that the curses and execrations of the Romish church when not seconded by military force were in the present age more an object of ridicule than of terror and had now as little influence in this world as in the next that though the bigotry or ambition of Henry or Philip might incline them to execute a sentence of excommunication against her their interests were so incompatible that they never could concur in any plan of operations and the enmity of the one would always insure to her the friendship of the other that if they encouraged the discontents of her Catholic subjects their dominions also abounded with Protestants and it would be easy to retaliate upon them that even such of the English as seemed at present zealously attached to the Catholic faith would most of them embrace the religion of their new sovereign and the nation had of late been so much accustomed to these revolutions that men had lost all idea of truth and falsehood in such subjects that the authority of Henry VIII so highly raised by many concurring circumstances first inured the people to this submissive deference and it was the less difficult for succeeding princes to continue the nation in a track to which it had so long been accustomed and that it would be easy for her by bestowing on Protestants all preferment in civil offices and the militia the church and the universities both to insure her own authority and to render her religion entirely predominant The education of Elizabeth as well as her interest led her to favor the reformation and she remained not long in suspense with regard to the party which she should embrace But though determined in her own mind she resolved to proceed by gradual and secure steps and not to imitate the example of Mary in encouraging the bigots of her party to make immediately a violent invasion on the established religion She thought it requisite however to discover such symptoms of her intentions as might give encouragement to the Protestants so much depressed by the late violent persecutions She immediately recalled all the exiles and gave liberty to the prisoners who were confined on account of religion We are told of a pleasantry of one Rainsford on this occasion who said to the queen that he had a petition to present her in behalf of other prisoners called Matthew Mark Luke and John she readily replied that it behoved her first to consult the prisoners themselves and to learn of them whether they desired that liberty which he demanded for them Burnet vol ii p three hundred seventy seven Camden p three hundred seventy Burnet vol ii p three hundred seventy eight Camden p three hundred seventy one Heylin p one hundred three Elizabeth also proceeded to exert in favor of the reformers some acts of power which were authorized by the extent of royal prerogative during that age Finding that the Protestant teachers irritated by persecution broke out in a furious attack on the ancient superstition and that the Romanists replied with no less zeal and acrimony she published a proclamation by which she inhibited all preaching without a special license and though she dispensed with these orders in favor of some preachers of her own sect she took care that they should be the most calm and moderate of the party She also suspended the laws so far as to order a great part of the service the litany the Lord s prayer the creed and the gospels to be read in English And having first published injunctions that all the churches should conform themselves to the practice of her own chapel she forbade the host to be any more elevated in her presence an innovation which however frivolous it may appear implied the most material consequences These declarations of her intention concurring with preceding suspicions made the bishops foresee with certainty a revolution in religion They therefore refused to officiate at her coronation and it was with some difficulty that the bishop of Carlisle was at last prevailed on to perform the ceremony When she was conducted through London amidst the joyful acclamations of her subjects a boy who personated truth was let down from one of the triumphal arches and presented to her a copy of the Bible She received the book with the most gracious deportment placed it next her bosom and declared that amidst all the costly testimonies which the city had that day given her of their attachment this present was by far the most precious and most acceptable Such were the innocent artifices by which Elizabeth insinuated herself into the affections of her subjects Open in her address gracious and affable in all public appearances she rejoiced in the concourse of her subjects entered into all their pleasures and amusements and without departing from her dignity which she knew well how to preserve she acquired a popularity beyond what any of her predecessors or successors ever could attain Her own sex exulted to see a woman hold the reins of empire with such prudence and fortitude and while a young princess of twenty five years for that was her age at her accession who possessed all the graces and insinuation though not all the beauty of her sex courted the affections of individuals by her civilities of the public by her services her authority though corroborated by the strictest bands of law and religion appeared to be derived entirely from the choice and inclination of the people Heylin p one hundred four Strype vol i p forty one Camden p three hundred seventy one Heylin p one hundred four Strype vol i p fifty four Stowe p six hundred thirty five Burnet vol ii p three hundred eighty Strype vol i p twenty nine A sovereign of this disposition was not likely to offend her subjects by any useless or violent exertions of power and Elizabeth though she threw out such hints as encouraged the Protestants delayed the entire change of religion till the meeting of the parliament which was summoned to assemble The elections had gone entirely against the Catholics who seem not indeed to have made any great struggle for the superiority and the houses met in a disposition of gratifying the queen in every particular which she could desire of them They began the session with a unanimous declaration that Queen Elizabeth was and ought to be as well by the word of God as the common and statute laws of the realm the lawful undoubted and true heir to the crown lawfully descended from the blood royal according to the order of succession settled in the thirty fifth of Henry VIII Notwithstanding the bias of the nation towards the Protestant sect it appears that some violence at least according to our present ideas was used in these elections five candidates were nominated by the court to each borough and three to each county and by the sheriff s authority the members were chosen from among these candidates See state papers collected by Edward earl of Clarendon p ninety two I Eliz cap three This act of recognition was probably dictated by the queen herself and her ministers and she showed her magnanimity as well as moderation in the terms which she employed on that occasion She followed not Mary s practice in declaring the validity of her mother s marriage or in expressly repealing the act formerly made against her own legitimacy she knew that this attempt must be attended with reflections on her father s memory and on the birth of her deceased sister and as all the world was sensible that Henry s divorce from Anne Boleyn was merely the effect of his usual violence and caprice she scorned to found her title on any act of an assembly which had too much prostituted its authority by its former variable servile and iniquitous decisions Satisfied therefore in the general opinion entertained with regard to this fact which appeared the more undoubted the less anxiety she discovered in fortifying it by votes and inquiries she took possession of the throne both as her birthright and as insured to her by former acts of parliament and she never appeared anxious to distinguish these titles The first bill brought into parliament with a view of trying their disposition on the head of religion was that for suppressing the monasteries lately erected and for restoring the tenths and first fruits to the queen This point being gained without much difficulty a bill was next introduced annexing the supremacy to the crown and though the queen was there denominated governess not head of the church it conveyed the same extensive power which under the latter title had been exercised by her father and brother All the bishops who were present in the upper house strenuously opposed this law and as they possessed more learning than the temporal peers they triumphed in the debate but the majority of voices in that house as well as among the commons was against them By this act the crown without the concurrence either of the parliament or even of the convocation was vested with the whole spiritual power might repress all heresies might establish or repeal all canons might alter every point of discipline and might ordain or abolish any religious rite or ceremony Camden p three hundred seventy two Heylin p one hundred seven one hundred eight I Eliz cap one This last power was anew recognized in the bill of uniformity I Eliz cap two In determining heresy the sovereign was only limited if that could be called a limitation to such doctrines as had been adjudged heresy by the authority of the Scripture by the first four general councils or by any general council which followed the Scripture as their rule or to such other doctrines as should hereafter be denominated heresy by the parliament and convocation In order to exercise this authority the queen by a clause of the act was empowered to name commissioners either laymen or clergymen as she should think proper and on this clause was afterwards founded the court of ecclesiastical commission which assumed large discretionary not to say arbitrary powers totally incompatible with any exact boundaries in the constitution Their proceedings indeed were only consistent with absolute monarchy but were entirely suitable to the genius of the act on which they were established an act that at once gave the crown alone all the power which had formerly been claimed by the popes but which even these usurping prelates had never been able fully to exercise without some concurrence of the national clergy Whoever refused to take an oath acknowledging the queen s supremacy was incapacitated from holding any office whoever denied the supremacy or attempted to deprive the queen of that prerogative forfeited for the first offence all his goods and chattels for the second was subjected to the penalty of a praemunire but the third offence was declared treason These punishments however severe were less rigorous than those which were formerly during the reigns of her father and brother inflicted in like cases A law was passed confirming all the statutes enacted in King Edward s time with regard to religion the nomination of bishops was given to the crown without any election of the chapters the queen was empowered on the vacancy of any see to seize all the temporalities and to bestow on the bishop elect an equivalent in the impropriations belonging to the crown This pretended equivalent was commonly much inferior in value and thus the queen amidst all her concern for religion followed the example of the preceding reformers in committing depredations on the ecclesiastical revenues The bishops and all incumbents were prohibited from alienating their revenues and from letting leases longer than twenty one years or three lives This law seemed to be meant for securing the property of the church but as an exception was left in favor of the crown great abuses still prevailed It was usual for the courtiers during this reign to make an agreement with a bishop or incumbent and to procure a fictitious alienation to the queen who afterwards transferred the lands to the person agreed on This method of pillaging the church was not remedied till the beginning of James I The present depression of the clergy exposed them to all injuries and the laity never stopped till they had reduced the church to such poverty that her plunder was no longer a compensation for the odium incurred by it A solemn and public disputation was held during this session in presence of Lord Keeper Bacon between the divines of the Protestant and those of the Catholic communion The champions appointed to defend the religion of the sovereign were as in all former instances entirely triumphant and the Popish disputants being pronounced refractory and obstinate were even punished by imprisonment I Eliz cap two Strype vol i p seventy nine Strype vol i p ninety five Emboldened by this victory the Protestants ventured on the last and most important step and brought into parliament a bill for abolishing the mass and reestablishing the liturgy of King Edward Penalties were enacted as well against those who departed from this mode of worship as against those who absented themselves from the church and the sacraments And thus in one session without any violence tumult or clamor was the whole system of religion altered on the very commencement of a reign and by the will of a young woman whose title to the crown was by many thought liable to objections an event which though it may appear surprising to men in the present age was every where expected on the first intelligence of Elizabeth s accession The commons also made a sacrifice to the queen more difficult to obtain than that of any articles of faith they voted a subsidy of four shillings in the pound on land and two shillings and eightpence on movables together with two fifteenths one The house in no instance departed from the most respectful deference and complaisance towards the queen Even the importune address which they made her on the conclusion of the session to fix her choice of a husband could not they supposed be very disagreeable to one of her sex and age The address was couched in the most respectful expressions yet met with a refusal from the queen one Eliz cap two See note A at the end of the volume She told the speaker that as the application from the house was conceived in general terms only recommending marriage without pretending to direct her choice of a husband she could not take offence at the address or regard it otherwise than as a new instance of their affectionate attachment to her that any further interposition on their part would have ill become either them to make as subjects or her to bear as an independent princess that even while she was a private person and exposed to much danger she had always declined that engagement which she regarded as an encumbrance much more at present would she persevere in this sentiment when the charge of a great kingdom was committed to her and her life ought to be entirely devoted to promoting the interests of religion and the happiness of her subjects that as England was her husband wedded to her by this pledge and here she showed her finger with the same gold ring upon it with which she had solemnly betrothed herself to the kingdom at her inauguration so all Englishmen were her children and while she was employed in rearing or governing such a family she could not deem herself barren or her life useless and unprofitable that if she ever entertained thoughts of changing her condition the care of her subjects welfare would still be uppermost in her thoughts but should she live and die a virgin she doubted not but divine Providence seconded by their counsels and her own measures would be able to prevent all dispute with regard to the succession and secure them a sovereign who perhaps better than her own issue would imitate her example in loving and cherishing her people and that for her part she desired that no higher character or fairer remembrance of her should be transmitted to posterity than to have this inscription engraved on her tombstone when she should pay the last debt to nature Here lies Elizabeth who lived and died a maiden queen After the prorogation of the parliament the laws enacted with regard to religion were put in execution and met with little opposition from any quarter The liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar tongue and the oath of supremacy was tendered to the clergy The number of bishops had been reduced to fourteen by a sickly season which preceded and all these except the bishop of Landaff having refused compliance were degraded from their sees but of the inferior clergy throughout all England where there are near ten thousand parishes only eighty rectors and vicars fifty prebendaries fifteen heads of colleges twelve archdeacons and as many deans sacrificed their livings to their religious principles Camden p three hundred seventy five Sir Simon d Ewes It is thought remarkable by Camden that though this session was the first of the reign no person was attainted but on the contrary some restored in blood by the parliament a good symptom of the lenity at least of the prudence of the queen s government and that it should appear remarkable is a proof of the rigor of preceding reigns Camden p three hundred seventy six Heylin p one hundred fifteen Strype vol i p seventy three with some small variations Those in high ecclesiastic stations being exposed to the eyes of the public seem chiefly to have placed a point of honor in their perseverance but on the whole the Protestants in the former change introduced by Mary appear to have been much more rigid and conscientious Though the Catholic religion adapting itself to the senses and enjoining observances which enter into the common train of life does at present lay faster hold on the mind than the reformed which being chiefly spiritual resembles more a system of metaphysics yet was the proportion of zeal as well as of knowledge during the first ages after the reformation much greater on the side of the Protestants The Catholics continued ignorantly and supinely in their ancient belief or rather their ancient practices but the reformers obliged to dispute on every occasion and inflamed to a degree of enthusiasm by novelty and persecution had strongly attached themselves to their tenets and were ready to sacrifice their fortunes and even their lives in support of their speculative and abstract principles The forms and ceremonies still preserved in the English liturgy as they bore some resemblance to the ancient service tended further to reconcile the Catholics to the established religion and as the queen permitted no other mode of worship and at the same time struck out every thing that could be offensive to them in the new liturgy even those who were addicted to the Romish communion made no scruple of attending the established church Had Elizabeth gratified her own inclinations the exterior appearance which is the chief circumstance with the people would have been still more similar between the new and the ancient form of worship Her love of state and magnificence which she affected in every thing inspired her with an inclination towards the pomp of the Catholic religion and it was merely in compliance with the prejudices of her party that she gave up either images or the addresses to saints or prayers for the dead Some foreign princes interposed to procure the Romanists the privilege of separate assemblies in particular cities but the queen would not comply with their request and she represented the manifest danger of disturbing the national peace by a toleration of different religions Heylin p one hundred eleven Burnet vol ii p three hundred seventy six three hundred ninety seven Camden p three hundred seventy one Camden p three hundred seventy eight Strype vol i p one hundred fifty three hundred seventy While the queen and parliament were employed in settling the public religion the negotiations for a peace were still conducted first at Cercamp then at Chateau Cambresis between the ministers of France Spain and England and Elizabeth though equally prudent was not equally successful in this transaction Philip employed his utmost efforts to procure the restitution of Calais both as bound in honor to indemnify England which merely on his account had been drawn into the war and as engaged in interest to remove France to a distance from his frontiers in the Low Countries So long as he entertained hopes of espousing the queen he delayed concluding a peace with Henry and even after the change of religion in England deprived him of all such views his ministers hinted to her a proposal which may be regarded as reasonable and honorable Though all his own terms with France were settled he seemed willing to continue the war till she should obtain satisfaction provided she would stipulate to adhere to the Spanish alliance and continue hostilities against Henry during the course of six years but Elizabeth after consulting with her ministers wisely rejected this proposal She was sensible of the low state of her finances the great debts contracted by her father brother and sister the disorders introduced into every part of the administration the divisions by which her people were agitated and she was convinced that nothing but tranquillity during some years could bring the kingdom again into a flourishing condition or enable her to act with dignity and vigor in her transactions with foreign nations Well acquainted with the value which Henry put upon Calais and the impossibility during the present emergence of recovering it by treaty she was willing rather to suffer that loss than submit to such a dependence on Spain as she must expect to fall into if she continued pertinaciously in her present demand She ordered therefore her ambassadors Lord Effingham the bishop of Ely and doctor Wotton to conclude the negotiation and to settle a peace with Henry on any reasonable terms Henry offered to stipulate a marriage between the eldest daughter of the dauphin and the eldest son of Elizabeth and to engage for the restitution of Calais as the dowry of that princess but as the queen was sensible that this treaty would appear to the world a palpable evasion she insisted upon more equitable at least more plausible conditions Forbes s Full View vol i p fifty nine Forbes s Full View vol i p fifty four It was at last agreed that Henry should restore Calais at the expiration of eight years that in case of failure he should pay five hundred thousand crowns and the queen s title to Calais still remain that he should find the security of seven or eight foreign merchants not natives of France for the payment of this sum that he should deliver five hostages till that security were provided that if Elizabeth broke the peace with France or Scotland during the interval she should forfeit all title to Calais but if Henry made war on Elizabeth he should be obliged immediately to restore that fortress All men of penetration easily saw that these stipulations were but a colorable pretence for abandoning Calais but they excused the queen on account of the necessity of her affairs and they even extolled her prudence in submitting without further struggle to that necessity A peace with Scotland was a necessary consequence of that with France Forbes vol i p sixty eight Rymer tom xv p five hundred five Philip and Henry terminated hostilities by a mutual restitution of all places taken during the course of the war and Philip espoused the princess Elizabeth eldest daughter of France formerly betrothed to his son Don Carlos The duke of Savoy married Margaret Henry s sister and obtained a restitution of all his dominions of Savoy and Piedmont except a few towns retained by France And thus general tranquillity seemed to be restored to Europe But though peace was concluded between France and England there soon appeared a ground of quarrel of the most serious nature and which was afterwards attended with the most important consequences The two marriages of Henry VIII that with Catharine of Arragon and that with Anne Boleyn were incompatible with each other and it seemed impossible that both of them could be regarded as valid and legal but still the birth of Elizabeth lay under some disadvantages to which that of her sister Mary was not exposed Henry s first marriage had obtained the sanction of all the powers both civil and ecclesiastical which were then acknowledged in England and it was natural for Protestants as well as Romanists to allow on account of the sincere intention of the parties that their issue ought to be regarded as legitimate But his divorce and second marriage had been concluded in direct opposition to the see of Rome and though they had been ratified by the authority both of the English parliament and convocation those who were strongly attached to the Catholic communion and who reasoned with great strictness were led to regard them as entirely invalid and to deny altogether the queen s right of succession The next heir of blood was the queen of Scots now married to the dauphin and the great power of that princess joined to her plausible title rendered her a formidable rival to Elizabeth The king of France had secretly been soliciting at Rome a bull of excommunication against the queen and she had here been beholden to the good offices of Philip who from interest more than either friendship or generosity had negotiated in her favor and had successfully opposed the pretensions of Henry But the court of France was not discouraged with this repulse the duke of Guise and his brothers thinking that it would much augment their credit if their niece should bring an accession of England as she had already done of Scotland to the crown of France engaged the king not to neglect the claim and by their persuasion he ordered his son and daughter in law to assume openly the arms as well as title of England and to quarter these arms on all their equipages furniture and liveries When the English ambassador complained of this injury he could obtain nothing but an evasive answer that as the queen of Scots was descended from the blood royal of England she was entitled by the example of many princes to assume the arms of that kingdom But besides that this practice had never prevailed without permission being first obtained and without making a visible difference between the arms Elizabeth plainly saw that this pretension had not been advanced during the reign of her sister Mary and that therefore the king of France intended on the first opportunity to dispute her legitimacy and her title to the crown Alarmed at the danger she thenceforth conceived a violent jealousy against the queen of Scots and was determined as far as possible to incapacitate Henry from the execution of his project The sudden death of that monarch who was killed in a tournament at Paris while celebrating the espousals of his sister with the duke of Savoy altered not her views Being informed that his successor Francis II still continued to assume without reserve the title of King of England she began to consider him and his queen as her mortal enemies and the present situation of affairs in Scotland afforded her a favorable opportunity both of revenging the injury and providing for her own safety The murder of the cardinal primate at saint Andrew s had deprived the Scottish Catholics of a head whose severity courage and capacity had rendered him extremely formidable to the innovators in religion and the execution of the laws against heresy began thenceforth to be more remiss The queen regent governed the kingdom by prudent and moderate counsels and as she was not disposed to sacrifice the civil interests of the state to the bigotry or interests of the clergy she deemed it more expedient to temporize and to connive at the progress of a doctrine which she had not power entirely to repress When informed of the death of Edward and the accession of Mary to the crown of England she entertained hopes that the Scottish reformers deprived of the countenance which they received from that powerful kingdom would lose their ardor with their prospect of success and would gradually return to the faith of their ancestors But the progress and revolutions of religion are little governed by the usual maxims of civil policy and the event much disappointed the expectations of the regent Many of the English preachers terrified with the severity of Mary s government took shelter in Scotland where they found more protection and a milder administration and while they propagated their theological tenets they filled the whole kingdom with a just horror against the cruelties of the bigoted Catholics and showed their disciples the fate which they must expect if ever their adversaries should attain an uncontrolled authority over them A hierarchy moderate in its acquisitions of power and riches may safely grant a toleration to sectaries and the more it softens the zeal of innovators by lenity and liberty the more securely will it possess those advantages which the legal establishments bestow upon it But where superstition has raised a church to such an exorbitant height as that of Rome persecution is less the result of bigotry in the priests than of a necessary policy and the rigor of law is the only method of repelling the attacks of men who besides religious zeal have so many other motives derived both from public and private interest to engage them on the side of innovation But though such overgrown hierarchies may long support themselves by these violent expedients the time comes when severities tend only to enrage the new sectaries and make them break through all bounds of reason and moderation This crisis was now visibly approaching in Scotland and whoever considers merely the transactions resulting from it will be inclined to throw the blame equally on both parties whoever enlarges his view and reflects on the situations will remark the necessary progress of human affairs and the operation of those principles which are inherent in human nature Some heads of the reformers in Scotland such as the earl of Argyle his son Lord Lorne the earls of Morton and Glencarne Erskine of Dun and others observing the danger to which they were exposed and desirous to propagate their principles entered privately into a bond or association and called themselves the congregation of the Lord in contradistinction to the established church which they denominated the congregation of Satan The tenor of the bond was as follows We perceiving how Satan in his members the Antichrist of our time do cruelly rage seeking to overthrow and to destroy the gospel of Christ and his congregation ought according to our bounden duty to strive in our master s cause even unto the death being certain of the victory in him We do therefore promise before the majesty of God and his congregation that we by his grace shall with all diligence continually apply our whole power substance and our very lives to maintain set forward and establish the most blessed word of God and his congregation and shall labor by all possible means to have faithful ministers truly and purely to minister Christ s gospel and sacraments to his people we shall maintain them nourish them and defend them the whole congregation of Christ and every member thereof by our whole power and at the hazard of our lives against Satan and all wicked power who may intend tyranny and trouble against the said congregation unto which holy word and congregation we do join ourselves and we forsake and renounce the congregation of Satan with all the superstitious abomination and idolatry thereof and moreover shall declare ourselves manifestly enemies thereto by this faithful promise before God testified to this congregation by our subscriptions At Edinburgh the third of December fifteen fifty seven Keith p sixty six Knox p one hundred one Had the subscribers of this zealous league been content only to demand a toleration of the new opinions however incompatible their pretensions might have been with the policy of the church of Rome they would have had the praise of opposing tyrannical laws enacted to support an establishment prejudicial to civil society but it is plain that they carried their views much further and their practice immediately discovered the spirit by which they were actuated Supported by the authority which they thought belonged to them as the congregation of the Lord they ordained that prayers in the vulgar tongue should be used in all the parish churches of the kingdom and that preaching and the interpretation of the Scriptures should be practised in private houses til God should move the prince to grant public preaching by faithful and true ministers Such bonds of association are always the fore runners of rebellion and this violent invasion of the established religion was the actual commencement of it Before this league was publicly known or avowed the clergy alarmed with the progress of the reformation attempted to recover their lost authority by a violent exercise of power which tended still further to augment the zeal and number of their enemies Hamilton the primate seized Walter Mill a priest of an irreproachable life who had embraced the new doctrines and having tried him at saint Andrew s condemned him to the flames for heresy Such general aversion was entertained against this barbarity that it was some time before the bishops could prevail on any one to act the part of a civil judge and pronounce sentence upon Mill and even after the time of his execution was fixed all the shops of saint Andrew s being shut no one would sell a rope to tie him to the stake and the primate himself was obliged to furnish this implement The man bore the torture with that courage which though usual on these occasions always appears supernatural and astonishing to the multitude The people to express their abhorrence against the cruelty of the priests raised a monument of stones on the place of his execution and as fast as the stones were removed by order of the clergy they were again supplied from the voluntary zeal of the populace It is in vain for men to oppose the severest punishment to the united motives of religion and public applause and this was the last barbarity of the kind which the Catholics had the power to exercise in Scotland The reformers used at that time King Edward s liturgy in Scotland Forbes p one hundred fifty five Keith p sixty six Knox p one hundred one Knox p one hundred twenty two Some time after the people discovered their sentiments in such a manner as was sufficient to prognosticate to the priests the fate which was awaiting them It was usual on the festival of saint Giles the tutelar saint of Edinburgh to carry in procession the image of that saint but the Protestants in order to prevent the ceremony found means on the eve of the festival to purloin the statue from the church and they pleased themselves with imagining the surprise and disappointment of his votaries The clergy however framed hastily a new image which in derision was called by the people young saint Giles and they carried it through the streets attended by all the ecclesiastics in the town and neighborhood The multitude abstained from violence so long as the queen regent continued a spectator but the moment she retired they invaded the idol threw it in the mire and broke it in pieces The flight and terror of the priests and friars who it was remarked deserted in his greatest distress the object of their worship was the source of universal mockery and laughter Encouraged by all these appearances the congregation proceeded with alacrity in openly soliciting subscriptions to their league and the death of Mary of England with the accession of Elizabeth which happened about this time contributed to increase their hopes of final success in their undertaking They ventured to present a petition to the regent craving a reformation of the church and of the wicked scandalous and detestable lives of the prelates and ecclesiastics They framed a petition which they intended to present to parliament and in which after premising that they could not communicate with the damnable idolatry and intolerable abuses of the Papistical church they desired that the laws against heretics should be executed by the civil magistrate alone and that the Scripture should be the sole rule in judging of heresy They even petitioned the convocation and insisted that prayers should be said in the vulgar tongue and that bishops should be chosen with the consent of the gentry of the diocese and priests with the consent of the parishioners The regent prudently temporized between these parties and as she aimed at procuring a matrimonial crown for her son in law the dauphin she was on that as well as other accounts unwilling to come to extremities with either of them Knox p one hundred twenty one Knox p one hundred twenty three Keith p seventy eight eighty one eighty two But after this concession was obtained she received orders from France probably dictated by the violent spirit of her brothers to proceed with rigor against the reformers and to restore the royal authority by some signal act of power She made the more eminent of the Protestant teachers be cited to appear before the council at Stirling but when their followers were marching thither in great multitudes in order to protect and countenance them she entertained apprehensions of an insurrection and it is said dissipated the people by a promise two that nothing should be done to the prejudice of the ministers Sentence however was passed by which all the ministers were pronounced rebels on account of their not appearing a measure which enraged the people and made them resolve to oppose the regent s authority by force of arms and to proceed to extremities against the clergy of the established religion In this critical time John Knox arrived from Geneva where he had passed some years in banishment and where he had imbibed from his commerce with Calvin the highest fanaticism of his sect augmented by the native ferocity of his own character He had been invited back to Scotland by the leaders of the reformation and mounting the pulpit at Perth during the present ferment of men s minds he declaimed with his usual vehemence against the idolatry and other abominations of the church of Rome and incited his audience to exert their utmost zeal for its subversion A priest was so imprudent after this sermon as to open his repository of images and relics and prepare himself to say mass The audience exalted to a disposition for any furious enterprise were as much enraged as if the spectacle had not been quite familiar to them they attacked the priest with fury broke the images in pieces tore the pictures overthrew the altars scattered about the sacred vases and left no implement of idolatrous worship as they termed it entire or undefaced They thence proceeded with additional numbers and augmented rage to the monasteries of the Gray and Black friars which they pillaged in an instant the Carthusians underwent the same fate and the populace not content with robbing and expelling the monks vented their fury on the buildings which had been the receptacles of such abomination and in a little time nothing but the walls of these edifices were left standing The inhabitants of Coupar in Fife soon after imitated the example Melvil s Memoirs p twenty four Jebb vol ii p four hundred forty six See note B at the end of the volume Spotswood p one hundred twenty one Knox p one hundred twenty seven The queen regent provoked at these violences assembled an army and prepared to chastise the rebels She had about two thousand French under her command with a few Scottish troops and being assisted by such of the nobility as were well affected to her she pitched her camp within ten miles of Perth Even the earl of Argyle and Lord James Stuart prior of saint Andrew s the queen s natural brother though deeply engaged with the reformers attended the regent in this enterprise either because they blamed the fury of the populace or hoped by their own influence and authority to mediate some agreement between the parties The congregation on the other hand made preparations for defence and being joined by the earl of Glencarne from the west and being countenanced by many of the nobility and gentry they appeared formidable from their numbers as well as from the zeal by which they were animated They sent an address to the regent where they plainly insinuated that if they were pursued to extremities by the cruel beasts the churchmen they would have recourse to foreign powers for assistance and they subscribed themselves her faithful subjects in all things not repugnant to God assuming at the same time the name of the faithful congregation of Christ Jesus They applied to the nobility attending her and maintained that their own past violences were justified by the word of God which commands the godly to destroy idolatry and all the monuments of it and though all civil authority was sacred yet was there a great difference between the authority and the persons who exercised it and that it ought to be considered whether or not those abominations called by the pestilent Papists religion and which they defend by fire and sword be the true religion of Christ Jesus They remonstrated with such of the queen s army as had formerly embraced their party and told them that as they were already reputed traitors by God they should likewise be excommunicated from their society and from the participation of the sacraments of the church which God by his mighty power had erected among them whose ministers have the same authority which Christ granted to his apostles in these words Whose sins ye shall forgive shall be forgiven and whose sins ye shall retain shall be retained Knox p one hundred twenty nine Knox p one hundred thirty one Knox p one hundred thirty three We may here see that these new saints were no less lofty in their pretensions than the ancient hierarchy no wonder they were enraged against the latter as their rivals in dominion They joined to all these declarations an address to the established church and they affixed this title to it To the generation of Antichrist the pestilent prelates and their shavelings in Scotland the congregation of Christ Jesus within the same sayeth The tenor of the manifesto was suitable to the title They told the ecclesiastics As ye by tyranny intend not only to destroy our bodies but also by the same to hold our souls in bondage of the devil subject to idolatry so shall we with all the force and power which God shall grant unto us execute just vengeance and punishment upon you yea we shall begin that same war which God commanded Israel to execute against the Canaanites that is contract of peace shall never be made till you desist from your open idolatry and cruel persecution of God s children And this in the name of the eternal God and of his Son Christ Jesus whose verity we profess and gospel we have preached and holy sacraments rightly administered we signify unto you to be our intent so far as God will assist us to withstand your idolatry Take this for warning and be not deceived With these outrageous symptoms commenced in Scotland that cant hypocrisy and fanaticism which long infested that kingdom and which though now mollified by the lenity of the civil power is still ready to break out on all occasions The queen regent finding such obstinate zeal in the rebels was content to embrace the counsels of Argyle and the prior of saint Andrew s and to form an accommodation with them She was received into Perth which submitted on her promising an indemnity for past offences and engaging not to leave any French garrison in the place Complaints very ill founded immediately arose concerning the infraction of this capitulation Some of the inhabitants it was pretended were molested on account of the late violences and some companies of Scotch soldiers supposed to be in French pay were quartered in the town which step though taken on very plausible grounds was loudly exclaimed against by the congregation A contemptuous term for a priest Keith p eighty five eighty six eighty seven Knox p one hundred thirty four Knox p one hundred thirty nine It is asserted that the regent to justify these measures declared that princes ought not to have their promises too strictly urged upon them nor was any faith to be kept with heretics and that for her part could she find as good a color she would willingly bereave all these men of their lives and fortunes But it is nowise likely that such expressions ever dropped from this prudent and virtuous princess On the contrary it appears that all these violences were disagreeable to her that she was in this particular overruled by the authority of the French counsellors placed about her and that she often thought if the management of those affairs had been intrusted wholly to herself she could easily without force have accommodated all differences three The congregation inflamed with their own zeal and enraged by these disappointments remained not long in tranquillity Even before they left Perth and while as yet they had no color to complain of any violation of treaty they had signed a new covenant in which besides their engagements to mutual defence they vowed in the name of God to employ their whole power in destroying every thing that dishonored his holy name and this covenant was subscribed among others by Argyle and the prior of saint Andrew s Knox p one hundred thirty nine Spotswood p one hundred twenty three See note C at the end of the volume Keith p eighty nine Knox p one hundred thirty eight These two leaders now desired no better pretence for deserting the regent and openly joining their associates than the complaints however doubtful or rather false of her breach of promise The congregation also encouraged by this accession of force gave themselves up entirely to the furious zeal of Knox and renewed at Crail Anstruther and other places in Fife like depredations on the churches and monasteries with those formerly committed at Perth and Coupar The regent who marched against them with her army finding their power so much increased was glad to conclude a truce for a few days and to pass over with her forces to the Lothians The reformers besieged and took Perth proceeded thence to Stirling where they exercised their usual fury and finding nothing able to resist them they bent their march to Edinburgh the inhabitants of which as they had already anticipated the zeal of the congregation against the churches and monasteries gladly opened their gates to them The regent with the few forces which remained with her took shelter in Dunbar where she fortified herself in expectation of a reenforcement from France Meanwhile she employed her partisans in representing to the people the dangerous consequences of this open rebellion and she endeavored to convince them that the Lord James under pretence of religion had formed the scheme of wresting the sceptre from the hands of the sovereign By these considerations many were engaged to desert the army of the congregation but much more by the want of pay or any means of subsistence and the regent observing the malecontents to be much weakened ventured to march to Edinburgh with a design of suppressing them On the interposition of the duke of Chatelrault who still adhered to her she agreed to a capitulation in which she granted them a toleration of their religion and they engaged to commit no further depredations on the churches Soon after they evacuated the city and before they left it they proclaimed the articles of agreement but they took care to publish only the articles favorable to themselves and they were guilty of an imposture in adding one to the number namely that idolatry should not again be erected in any place where it was at that time suppressed four An agreement concluded while men were in this disposition could not be durable and both sides endeavored to strengthen themselves as much as possible against the ensuing rupture which appeared inevitable The regent having got a reenforcement of one thousand men from France began to fortify Leith and the congregation seduced to their party the duke of Chatelrault who had long appeared inclined to join them and who was at last determined by the arrival of his son the earl of Arran from France where he had escaped many dangers from the jealousy as well as bigotry of Henry and the duke of Guise More French troops soon after disembarked under the command of La Brosse who was followed by the bishop of Amiens and three doctors of the Sorbonne These last were supplied with store of syllogisms authorities citations and scholastic arguments which they intended to oppose to the Scottish preachers and which they justly presumed would acquire force and produce conviction by the influence of the French arms and artillery See note D at the end of the volume Spotswood p one hundred thirty four Thuan lib xxiv c ten The constable Montmorency had always opposed the marriage of the dauphin with the queen of Scots and had foretold that by forming such close connections with Scotland the ancient league would be dissolved and the natives of that kingdom jealous of a foreign yoke would soon become instead of allies attached by interest and inclination the most inveterate enemies to the French government But though the event seemed now to have justified the prudence of that aged minister it is not improbable considering the violent counsels by which France was governed that the insurrection was deemed a favorable event as affording a pretence for sending over armies for entirely subduing the country for attainting the rebels and for preparing means thence to invade England and support Mary s title to the crown of that kingdom The leaders of the congregation well acquainted with these views were not insensible of their danger and saw that their only safety consisted in the vigor and success of their measures They were encouraged by the intelligence received of the sudden death of Henry II and having passed an act from their own authority depriving the queen dowager of the regency and ordering all the French troops to evacuate the kingdom they collected forces to put their edict in execution against them They again became masters of Edinburgh but found themselves unable to keep long possession of that city Their tumultuary armies assembled in haste and supported by no pay soon separated upon the least disaster or even any delay of success and were incapable of resisting such veteran troops as the French who were also seconded by some of the Scottish nobility among whom the earl of Bothwell distinguished himself Hearing that the marquis of Elbeuf brother to the regent was levying an army against them in Germany they thought themselves excusable for applying in this extremity to the assistance of England and as the sympathy of religion as well as regard to national liberty had now counterbalanced the ancient animosity against that kingdom this measure was the result of inclination no less than of interest five Maitland of Lidington therefore and Robert Melvil were secretly despatched by the congregation to solicit succors from Elizabeth Forbes vol i p one hundred thirty nine Thuan lib xxiv c thirteen See note E at the end of the volume The wise council of Elizabeth did not long deliberate in agreeing to this request which concurred so well with the views and interests of their mistress Cecil in particular represented to the queen that the union of the crowns of Scotland and France both of them the hereditary enemies of England was ever regarded as a pernicious event and her father as well as Protector Somerset had employed every expedient both of war and negotiation to prevent it that the claim which Mary advanced to the crown rendered the present situation of England still more dangerous and demanded on the part of the queen the greatest vigilance and precaution that the capacity ambition and exorbitant views of the family of Guise who now governed the French counsels were sufficiently known and they themselves made no secret of their design to place their niece on the throne of England that deeming themselves secure of success they had already somewhat imprudently and prematurely taken off the mask and Throgmorton the English ambassador at Paris sent over by every courier incontestable proofs of their hostile intentions that they only waited till Scotland should be entirely subdued and having thus deprived the English of the advantages resulting from their situation and naval power they prepared means for subverting the queen s authority that the zealous Catholics in England discontented with the present government and satisfied in the legality of Mary s title would bring them considerable reenforcement and would disturb every measure of defence against that formidable power that the only expedient for preventing these designs was to seize the present opportunity and take advantage of a like zeal in the Protestants of Scotland nor could any doubt be entertained with regard to the justice of a measure founded on such evident necessity and directed only to the ends of self preservation that though a French war attended with great expense seemed the necessary consequence of supporting the malecontents in Scotland that power if removed to the continent would be much less formidable and a small disbursement at present would in the end be found the greatest frugality and that the domestic dissensions of France which every day augmented together with the alliance of Philip who notwithstanding his bigotry and hypocrisy would never permit the entire conquest of England were sufficient to secure the queen against the dangerous ambition and resentment of the house of Guise Forbes vol i p one

Elizabeth s propensity to caution and economy was though with some difficulty overcome by these powerful motives and she prepared herself to support by arms and money the declining affairs of the congregation in Scotland She equipped a fleet which consisted of thirteen ships of war and giving the command of it to Winter she sent it to the Frith of Forth she appointed the young duke of Norfolk her lieutenant in the northern counties and she assembled at Berwick an army of eight thousand men under the command of Lord Gray warden of the east and middle marches Though the court of France sensible of the danger offered her to make immediate restitution of Calais provided she would not interpose in the affairs of Scotland she resolutely replied that she never would put an inconsiderable fishing town in competition with the safety of her dominions and she still continued her preparations She concluded a treaty of mutual defence with the congregation which was to last during the marriage of the queen of Scots with Francis and a year after and she promised never to desist till the French had entirely evacuated Scotland And having thus taken all proper measures for success and received from the Scots six hostages for the performance of articles she ordered her fleet and army to begin their operations Forbes vol i p four hundred fifty four four hundred sixty Spotswood p one hundred forty six Knox p two hundred seventeen Haynes s State Papers vol i p one hundred fifty three Rymer tom xv p five hundred sixty nine The appearance of Elizabeth s fleet in the frith disconcerted the French army who were at that time ravaging the county of Fife and obliged them to make a circuit by Stirling in order to reach Leith where they prepared themselves for defence The English army reenforced by five thousand Scots sat down before the place and after two skirmishes in the former of which the English had the advantage in the latter the French they began to batter the town and though repulsed with considerable loss in a rash and ill conducted assault they reduced the garrison to great difficulties Their distress was augmented by two events the dispersion by a storm of D Elbeuf s fleet which carried a considerable army on board and the death of the queen regent who expired about this time in the Castle of Edinburgh a woman endowed with all the capacity which shone forth in her family but possessed of much more virtue and moderation than appeared in the conduct of the other branches of it The French who found it impossible to subsist for want of provisions and who saw that the English were continually reenforced by fresh numbers were obliged to capitulate and the bishop of Valence and Count Randan plenipotentiaries from France signed a treaty at Edinburgh with Cecil and doctor Wotton whom Elizabeth had sent thither for that purpose It was there stipulated that the French should instantly evacuate Scotland that the king and queen of France and Scotland should thenceforth abstain from bearing the arms of England or assuming the title of that kingdom that further satisfaction for the injury already done in that particular should be granted Elizabeth and that commissioners should meet to settle this point or if they could not agree that the king of Spain should be umpire between the crowns Besides these stipulations which regarded England some concessions were granted to the Scots namely that an amnesty should be published for all past offences that none but natives should enjoy any office in Scotland that the states should name twenty four persons of whom the queen of Scots should choose seven and the states five and in the hands of these twelve should the whole administration be placed during their queen s absence and that Mary should neither make peace nor war without consent of the states In order to hasten the execution of this important treaty Elizabeth sent ships by which the French forces were transported into their own country Haynes vol i p two hundred fifty six two hundred fifty nine Haynes vol i p two hundred twenty three Rymer tom xv p five hundred ninety three Keith p one hundred thirty seven Spotswood p one hundred forty seven Knox p two hundred twenty nine Thus Europe saw in the first transaction of this reign the genius and capacity of the queen and her ministers She discerned at a distance the danger which threatened her and instantly took vigorous measures to prevent it Making all possible advantages of her situation she proceeded with celerity to a decision and was not diverted by any offers negotiations or remonstrances of the French court She stopped not till she had brought the matter to a final issue and had converted that very power to which her enemies trusted for her destruction into her firmest support and security By exacting no improper conditions from the Scottish malecontents even during their greatest distresses she established an entire confidence with them and having cemented the union by all the ties of gratitude interest and religion she now possessed an influence over them beyond what remained even with their native sovereign The regard which she acquired by this dexterous and spirited conduct gave her every where abroad as well as at home more authority than had attended her sister though supported by all the power of the Spanish monarchy The subsequent measures of the Scottish reformers tended still more to cement their union with England Being now entirely masters of the kingdom they made no further ceremony or scruple in fully effecting their purpose In the treaty of Edinburgh it had been agreed that a parliament or convention should soon be assembled and the leaders of the congregation not waiting till the queen of Scots should ratify that treaty thought themselves fully entitled without the sovereign s authority immediately to summon a parliament The reformers presented a petition to this assembly in which they were not contented with desiring the establishment of their doctrine they also applied for the punishment of the Catholics whom they called vassals to the Roman harlot and they asserted that among all the rabble of the clergy such is their expression there was not one lawful minister but that they were all of them thieves and murderers yea rebels and traitors to civil authority and therefore unworthy to be suffered in any reformed commonwealth The parliament seem to have been actuated by the same spirit of rage and persecution After ratifying a confession of faith agreeable to the new doctrines they passed a statute against the mass and not only abolished it in all the churches but enacted that whoever any where either officiated in it or was present at it should be chastised for the first offence with confiscation of goods and corporal punishment at the discretion of the magistrate for the second with banishment and for the third with loss of life Forbes vol i p three hundred fifty four three hundred seventy two Jebb vol ii p four hundred fifty two Knox p two hundred thirty seven two hundred thirty eight Knox p two hundred fifty four A law was also voted for abolishing the papal jurisdiction in Scotland the Presbyterian form of discipline was settled leaving only at first some shadow of authority to certain ecclesiastics whom they called superintendents The prelates of the ancient faith appeared in order to complain of great injustice committed on them by the invasion of their property but the parliament took no notice of them till at last these ecclesiastics tired with fruitless attendance departed the town They were then cited to appear and as nobody presented himself it was voted by the parliament that the ecclesiastics were entirely satisfied and found no reason of complaint Sir James Sandilands prior of saint John was sent over to France to obtain the ratification of these acts but was very ill received by Mary who denied the validity of a parliament summoned without the royal consent and she refused her sanction to those statutes But the Protestants gave themselves little concern about their queen s refusal They immediately put the statutes in execution they abolished the mass they settled their ministers they committed every where furious devastations on the monasteries and even on the churches which they thought profaned by idolatry and deeming the property of the clergy lawful prize they took possession without ceremony of the far greater part of the ecclesiastical revenues Their new preachers who had authority sufficient to incite them to war and insurrection could not restrain their rapacity and fanaticism concurring with avarice an incurable wound was given to the papal authority in that country The Protestant nobility and gentry united by the consciousness of such unpardonable guilt alarmed for their new possessions well acquainted with the imperious character of the house of Guise saw no safety for themselves but in the protection of England and they despatched Morton Glencarne and Lidington to express their sincere gratitude to the queen for her past favors and represent to her the necessity of continuing them Elizabeth on her part had equal reason to maintain a union with the Scottish Protestants and soon found that the house of Guise notwithstanding their former disappointments had not laid aside the design of contesting her title and subverting her authority Francis and Mary whose counsels were wholly directed by them refused to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh and showed no disposition to give her any satisfaction for that mortal affront which they had put upon her by their openly assuming the title and arms of England She was sensible of the danger attending such pretensions and it was with pleasure she heard of the violent factions which prevailed in the French government and of the opposition which had arisen against the measures of the duke of Guise That ambitious prince supported by his four brothers the cardinal of Lorraine the duke of Aumale the marquis of Elbeuf and the grand prior men no less ambitious than himself had engrossed all the authority of the crown and as he was possessed of every quality which could command the esteem or seduce the affections of men there appeared no end of his acquisitions and pretensions The constable Montmorency who had long balanced his credit was deprived of all power the princes of the blood the king of Navarre and his brother the prince of Conde were entirely excluded from offices and favor the queen mother herself Catharine de Medicis found her influence every day declining and as Francis a young prince infirm both in mind and body was wholly governed by his consort who knew no law but the pleasure of her uncles men despaired of ever obtaining freedom from the dominion of that aspiring family It was the contests of religion which first inspired the French with courage openly to oppose their unlimited authority The theological disputes first started in the north of Germany next in Switzerland countries at that time wholly illiterate had long ago penetrated into France and as they were assisted by the general discontent against the court and church of Rome and by the zealous spirit of the age the proselytes to the new religion were secretly increasing in every province Henry II in imitation of his father Francis had opposed the progress of the reformers and though a prince addicted to pleasure and society he was transported by a vehemence as well as bigotry which had little place in the conduct of his predecessor Rigorous punishments had been inflicted on the most eminent of the Protestant party and a point of honor seemed to have arisen whether the one sect could exercise or the other suffer most barbarity The death of Henry put some stop to the persecutions and the people who had admired the constancy of the new preachers now heard with favor their doctrines and arguments But the cardinal of Lorraine as well as his brothers who were possessed of the legal authority thought it their interest to support the established religion and when they revived the execution of the penal statutes they necessarily drove the malecontent princes and nobles to embrace the protection of the new religion The king of Navarre a man of mild dispositions but of a weak character and the prince of Conde who possessed many great qualities having declared themselves in favor of the Protestants that sect acquired new force from their countenance and the admiral Coligny with his brother Andelot no longer scrupled to make open profession of their communion The integrity of the admiral who was believed sincere in his attachment to the new doctrine and his great reputation both for valor and conduct for the arts of peace as well as of war brought credit to the reformers and after a frustrated attempt of the malecontents to seize the king s person at Amboise of which Elizabeth had probably some intelligence every place was full of distraction and matters hastened to an open rupture between the parties But the house of Guise though these factions had obliged them to remit their efforts in Scotland and had been one chief cause of Elizabeth s success were determined not to relinquish their authority in France or yield to the violence of their enemies They found an opportunity of seizing the king of Navarre and the prince of Conde they threw the former into prison they obtained a sentence of death against the latter and they were proceeding to put the sentence in execution when the king s sudden death saved the noble prisoner and interrupted the prosperity of the duke of Guise The queen mother was appointed regent to her son Charles IX now in his minority the king of Navarre was named lieutenant general of the kingdom the sentence against Conde was annulled the constable was recalled to court and the family of Guise though they still enjoyed great offices and great power found a counterpoise to their authority Forbes vol i p two hundred fourteen Throgmorton about this time unwilling to intrust to letters the great secrets committed to him obtained leave under some pretext to come over to London Elizabeth was determined to make advantage of these events against the queen of Scots whom she still regarded as a dangerous rival She saw herself freed from the perils attending a union of Scotland with France and from the pretensions of so powerful a prince as Francis but she considered at the same time that the English Catholics who were numerous and who were generally prejudiced in favor of Mary s title would now adhere to that princess with more zealous attachment when they saw that her succession no longer endangered the liberties of the kingdom and was rather attended with the advantage of effecting an entire union with Scotland She gave orders therefore to her ambassador Throgmorton a vigilant and able minister to renew his applications to the queen of Scots and to require her ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh But though Mary had desisted after her husband s death from bearing the arms and title of Queen of England she still declined gratifying Elizabeth in this momentous article and being swayed by the ambitious suggestions of her uncles she refused to make any formal renunciation of her pretensions Meanwhile the queen mother of France who imputed to Mary all the mortifications which she had met with during Francis s lifetime took care to retaliate on her by like injuries and the queen of Scots finding her abode in France disagreeable began to think of returning to her native country Lord James who had been sent in deputation from the states to invite her over seconded these intentions and she applied to Elizabeth by D Oisel for a safe conduct in case she should be obliged to pass through England but she received for answer that till she had given satisfaction by ratifying the treaty of Edinburgh she could expect no favor from a person whom she had so much injured Goodall vol i p one hundred seventy five This denial excited her indignation and she made no scruple of expressing her sentiments to Throgmorton when he reiterated his applications to gratify his mistress in a demand which he represented as so reasonable Having cleared the room of her attendants she said to him How weak I may prove or how far a woman s frailty may transport me I cannot tell however I am resolved not to have so many witnesses of my infirmity as your mistress had at her audience of my ambassador D Oisel There is nothing disturbs me so much as the having asked with so much impunity a favor which it was of no consequence for me to obtain I can with God s leave return to my own country without her leave as I came to France in spite of all the opposition of her brother King Edward neither do I want friends both able and willing to conduct me home as they have brought me hither though I was desirous rather to make an experiment of your mistress s friendship than of the assistance of any other person I have often heard you say that a good correspondence between her and myself would conduce much to the security and happiness of both our kingdoms were she well convinced of this truth she would hardly have denied me so small a request But perhaps she bears a better inclination to my rebellious subjects than to me their sovereign her equal in royal dignity her near relation and the undoubted heir of her kingdoms Besides her friendship I ask nothing at her hands I neither trouble her nor concern myself in the affairs of her state not that I am ignorant that there are now in England a great many malecontents who are no friends to the present establishment She is pleased to upbraid me as a person little experienced in the world I freely own it but age will cure that defect However I am already old enough to acquit myself honestly and courteously to my friends and relations and to encourage no reports of your mistress which would misbecome a queen and her kinswoman I would also say by her leave that I am a queen as well as she and not altogether friendless and perhaps I have as great a soul too so that methinks we should be upon a level in our treatment of each other As soon as I have consulted the states of my kingdom I shall be ready to give her a seasonable answer and I am the more intent on my journey in order to make the quicker despatch in this affair But she it seems intends to stop my journey so that either she will not let me give her satisfaction or is resolved not to be satisfied perhaps on purpose to keep up the disagreement between us She has often reproached me with my being young and I must be very young indeed and as ill advised to treat of matters of such great concern and importance without the advice of my parliament I have not been wanting in all friendly offices to her but she disbelieves or overlooks them I could heartily wish that I were as nearly allied to her in affection as in blood for that indeed would be a most valuable alliance Caballa p three hundred seventy four Spotswood p one hundred seventy seven Such a spirited reply notwithstanding the obliging terms interspersed in it was but ill fitted to conciliate friendship between these rival princesses or cure those mutual jealousies which had already taken place Elizabeth equipped a fleet on pretence of pursuing pirates but probably with an intention of intercepting the queen of Scots in her return homewards Mary embarked at Calais and passing the English fleet in a fog arrived safely at Leith attended by her three uncles the duke of Aumale the grand prior and the marquis of Elbeuf together with the marquis of Damville and other French courtiers This change of abode and situation was very little agreeable to that princess Besides her natural prepossessions in favor of a country in which she had been educated from her earliest infancy and where she had borne so high a rank she could not forbear both regretting the society of that people so celebrated for their humane disposition and their respectful attachment to their sovereign and reflecting on the disparity of the scene which lay before her It is said that after she was embarked at Calais she kept her eyes fixed on the coast of France and never turned them from that beloved object till darkness fell and intercepted it from her view She then ordered a couch to be spread for her in the open air and charged the pilot that if in the morning the land were still in sight he should awake her and afford her one parting view of that country in which all her affections were centred The weather proved calm so that the ship made little way in the night time and Mary had once more an opportunity of seeing the French coast She sat up on her couch and still looking towards the land often repeated these words Farewell France farewell I shall never see thee more The first aspect however of things in Scotland was more favorable if not to her pleasure and happiness at least to her repose and security than she had reason to apprehend No sooner did the French galleys appear off Leith than people of all ranks who had long expected their arrival flocked towards the shore with an earnest impatience to behold and receive their young sovereign Some were led by duty some by interest some by curiosity and all combined to express their attachment to her and to insinuate themselves into her confidence on the commencement of her administration She had now reached her nineteenth year and the bloom of her youth and amiable beauty of her person were further recommended by the affability of her address the politeness of her manners and the elegance of her genius Well accomplished in all the superficial but engaging graces of a court she afforded when better known still more promising indications of her character and men prognosticated both humanity from her soft and obliging deportment and penetration from her taste in all the refined arts of music eloquence and poetry And as the Scots had long been deprived of the presence of their sovereign whom they once despaired ever more to behold among them her arrival seemed to give universal satisfaction and nothing appeared about the court but symptoms of affection joy and festivity Keith p one hundred seventy nine Jebb vol ii p four hundred eighty three Buchan lib xvii c nine Spotswood p one hundred seventy eight one hundred seventy nine Keith p one hundred eighty Thuan lib xxix c two The first measures which Mary embraced confirmed all the prepossessions entertained in her favor She followed the advice given her in France by D Oisel and the bishop of Amiens as well as her uncles and she bestowed her confidence entirely on the leaders of the reformed party who had greatest influence over the people and who she found were alone able to support her government Her brother Lord James whom she soon after created earl of Murray obtained the chief authority and after him Lidington secretary of state a man of great sagacity had a principal share in her confidence By the vigor of these men s measures she endeavored to establish order and justice in a country divided by public factions and private feuds and that fierce intractable people unacquainted with laws and obedience seemed for a time to submit peaceably to her gentle and prudent administration But there was one circumstance which blasted all these promising appearances and bereaved Mary of that general favor which her agreeable manners and judicious deportment gave her just reason to expect She was still a Papist and though she published soon after her arrival a proclamation enjoining every one to submit to the established religion the preachers and their adherents could neither be reconciled to a person polluted with so great an abomination nor lay aside their jealousies of her future conduct It was with great difficulty she could obtain permission for saying mass in her own chapel and had not the people apprehended that if she had here met with a refusal she would instantly have returned to France the zealots never would have granted her even that small indulgence The cry was Shall we suffer that idol to be again erected within the realm It was asserted in the pulpit that one mass was more terrible than ten thousand armed men landed to invade the kingdom Lord Lindesey and the gentlemen of Fife exclaimed that the idolater should die the death such was their expression One that carried tapers for the ceremony of that worship was attacked and insulted in the court of the palace And if Lord James and some popular leaders had not interposed the most dangerous uproar was justly apprehended from the ungoverned fury of the multitude Knox p two hundred eighty seven Knox p two hundred eighty four two hundred eighty five two hundred eighty seven Spotswood p one hundred seventy nine The usual prayers in the churches were to this purpose that God would turn the queen s heart which was obstinate against him and his truth or if his holy will be otherwise that he would strengthen the hearts and hands of the elect stoutly to oppose the rage of all tyrants Nay it was openly called in question whether that princess being an idolatress was entitled to any authority even in civil matters The helpless queen was every moment exposed to contumely which she bore with benignity and patience Soon after her arrival she dined in the Castle of Edinburgh and it was there contrived that a boy six years of age should be let down from the roof and should present her with a Bible a Psalter and the keys of the castle Lest she should be at a loss to understand this insult on her as a Papist all the decorations expressed the burning of Corah Dathan and Abiram and other punishments inflicted by God upon idolatry The town council of Edinburgh had the assurance from their own authority to issue a proclamation banishing from their district all the wicked rabble of Antichrist the pope such as priests monks friars together with adulterers and fornicators And because the privy council suspended the magistrates for their insolence the passionate historians v of that age have inferred that the queen was engaged by a sympathy of manners to take adulterers and fornicators under her protection It appears probable that the magistrates were afterwards reinstated in their office and that their proclamation was confirmed v Keith p one hundred seventy nine Keith p two hundred two Keith p one hundred eighty nine Keith p one hundred ninety two v Knox p two hundred ninety two Buchan lib xvii c twenty Haynes vol i p three hundred seventy two v Keith p two hundred two But all the insolence of the people was inconsiderable in comparison of that which was exercised by the clergy and the preachers who took a pride in vilifying even to her face this amiable princess The assembly of the church framed an address in which after telling her that her mass was a bastard service of God the fountain of all impiety and the source of every evil which abounded in the realm they expressed their hopes that she would ere this time have preferred truth to her own preconceived opinion and have renounced her religion which they assured her was nothing but abomination and vanity They said that the present abuses of government were so enormous that if a speedy remedy were not provided God would not fail in his anger to strike the head and the tail the disobedient prince and sinful people They required that severe punishment should be inflicted on adulterers and fornicators And they concluded with demanding for themselves some addition both of power and property The ringleader in all these insults on majesty was John Knox who possessed an uncontrolled authority in the church and even in the civil affairs of the nation and who triumphed in the contumelious usage of his sovereign His usual appellation for the queen was Jezebel and though she endeavored by the most gracious condescension to win his favor all her insinuations could gain nothing on his obdurate heart She promised him access to her whenever he demanded it and she even desired him if he found her blamable in any thing to reprehend her freely in private rather than vilify her in the pulpit before the whole people but he plainly told her that he had a public ministry intrusted to him that if she would come to church she should there hear the gospel of truth and that it was not his business to apply to every individual nor had he leisure for that occupation The political principles of the man which he communicated to his brethren were as full of sedition as his theological were of rage and bigotry Though he once condescended so far as to tell the queen that he would submit to her in the same manner as Paul did to Nero he remained not long in this dutiful strain He said to her that Samuel feared not to slay Agag the fat and delicate king of Amalek whom King Saul had saved neither spared Elias Jezebel s false prophets and Baal s priests though King Ahab was present Phineas added he was no magistrate yet feared he not to strike Cosbi and Zimri in the very act of filthy fornication And so madam your grace may see that others than chief magistrates may lawfully inflict punishment on such crimes as are condemned by the law of God Knox had formerly during the reign of Mary of England written a book against female succession to the crown the title of it is The first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regimen of women He was too proud either to recant the tenets of this book or even to apologize for them and his conduct showed that he thought no more civility than loyalty due to any of the female sex Knox p three hundred eleven three hundred twelve Knox p three hundred ten Knox p two hundred eighty eight Knox p three hundred twenty six The whole life of Mary was from the demeanor of these men filled with bitterness and sorrow This rustic apostle scruples not in his history to inform us that he once treated her with such severity that she lost all command of temper and dissolved in tears before him yet so far from being moved with youth and beauty and royal dignity reduced to that condition he persevered in his insolent reproofs and when he relates this incident he discovers a visible pride and satisfaction in his own conduct The pulpits had become mere scenes of railing against the vices of the court among which were always noted as the principal feasting finery dancing balls and whoredom their necessary attendant Some ornaments which the ladies at that time wore upon their petticoats excited mightily the indignation of the preachers and they affirmed that such vanity would provoke God s vengeance not only against these foolish women but against the whole realm Mary whose age condition and education invited her to liberty and cheerfulness was curbed in all amusements by the absurd severity of these reformers and she found every moment reason to regret her leaving that country from whose manners she had in her early youth received the first impressions Her two uncles the duke of Aumale and the grand prior with the other French nobility soon took leave of her the marquis of Elbeuf remained some time longer but after his departure she was left to the society of her own subjects men unacquainted with the pleasures of conversation ignorant of arts and civility and corrupted beyond their usual rusticity by a dismal fanaticism which rendered them incapable of all humanity or improvement Though Mary had made no attempt to restore the ancient religion her Popery was a sufficient crime though her behavior was hitherto irreproachable and her manners sweet and engaging her gayety and ease were interpreted as signs of dissolute vanity And to the harsh and preposterous usage which this princess met with may in part be ascribed those errors of her subsequent conduct which seemed so little of a piece with the general tenor of her character Knox p three hundred thirty two three hundred thirty three Knox p three hundred twenty two Knox p three hundred thirty Knox p two hundred ninety four There happened to the marquis of Elbeuf before his departure an adventure which though frivolous might enable him to give Mary s friends in France a melancholy idea of her situation This nobleman with the earl of Bothwell and some other young courtiers had been engaged after a debauch to pay a visit to a woman called Alison Craig who was known to be liberal of her favors and because they were denied admittance they broke the windows thrust open the door and committed some disorders in searching for the damsel It happened that the assembly of the church was sitting at that time and they immediately took the matter under their cognizance In conjunction with several of the nobility they presented an address to the queen which was introduced with this awful prelude To the queen s majesty and to her secret and great council her grace s faithful and obedient subjects the professors of Christ Jesus s holy evangil wish the spirit of righteous judgment The tenor of the petition was that the fear of God the duty which they owed her grace and the terrible threatenings denounced by God against every city or country where horrible crimes were openly committed compelled them to demand the severe punishment of such as had done what in them lay to kindle the wrath of God against the whole realm that the iniquity of which they complained was so heinous and so horrible that they should esteem themselves accomplices in it if they had been engaged by worldly fear or servile complaisance to pass it over in silence or bury it in oblivion that as they owed her grace obedience in the administration of justice so were they entitled to require of her in return the sharp and condign punishment of this enormity which they repeated it might draw down the vengeance of God on the whole kingdom and that they maintained it to be her duty to lay aside all private affections towards the actors in so heinous a crime and so enormous a villany and without delay bring them to a trial and inflict the severest penalty upon them The queen gave a gracious reception to his peremptory address but because she probably thought that breaking the windows of a brothel merited not such severe reprehension she only replied that her uncle was a stranger and that he was attended by a young company but she would put such order to him and to all others that her subjects should henceforth have no reason to complain Her passing over this incident so slightly was the source of great discontent and was regarded as a proof of the most profligate manners Knox p three hundred two three hundred three three hundred four Keith p five hundred nine It is not to be omitted that Alison Craig the cause of all the uproar was known to entertain a commerce with the earl of Arran who on account of his great zeal for the reformation was without scruple indulged in that enormity Some of the populace of Edinburgh broke into the queen s chapel during her absence and committed outrages for which two of them were indicted and it was intended to bring them to a trial Knox wrote circular letters to the most considerable zealots of the party and charged them to appear in town and protect their brethren The holy sacraments he there said are abused by profane Papists the mass has been said and in worshipping that idol the priests have omitted no ceremony not even the conjuring of their accursed water that had ever been practised in the time of the greatest blindness These violent measures for opposing justice were little short of rebellion and Knox was summoned before the council to answer for his offence The courage of the man was equal to his insolence He scrupled not to tell the queen that the pestilent Papists who had inflamed her against these holy men were the sons of the devil and must therefore obey the directions of their father who had been a liar and a manslayer from the beginning The matter ended with the full acquittal of Knox Randolph the English ambassador in Scotland had reason to write to Cecil speaking of the Scottish nation I think marvellously of the wisdom of God that gave this unruly inconstant and cumbersome people no more power nor substance for they would otherwise run wild Knox Knox p three hundred thirty six three hundred forty two Keith p two hundred two We have related these incidents at greater length than the necessity of our subject may seem to require but even trivial circumstances which show the manners of the age are often more instructive as well as entertaining than the great transactions of wars and negotiations which are nearly similar in all periods and in all countries of the world The reformed clergy in Scotland had at that time a very natural reason for their ill humor namely the poverty or rather beggary to which they were reduced The nobility and gentry had at first laid their hands on all the property of the regular clergy without making any provision for the friars and nuns whom they turned out of their possessions The secular clergy of the Catholic communion though they lost all ecclesiastical jurisdiction still held some of the temporalities of their benefices and either became laymen themselves and converted them into private property or made conveyance of them at low prices to the nobility who thus enriched themselves by the plunder of the church The new teachers had hitherto subsisted chiefly by the voluntary oblations of the faithful and in a poor country divided in religious sentiments this establishment was regarded as very scanty and very precarious Repeated applications were made for a legal settlement to the preachers and though almost every thing in the kingdom was governed by their zeal and caprice it was with difficulty that their request was at last complied with The fanatical spirit which they indulged and their industry in decrying the principles and practices of the Romish communion which placed such merit in enriching the clergy proved now a very sensible obstacle to their acquisitions The convention however passed a vote by which they divided all the ecclesiastical benefices into twenty one shares they assigned fourteen to the ancient possessors of the remaining seven they granted three to the crown and if that were found to answer the public expenses they bestowed the overplus on the reformed ministers The queen was empowered to levy all the seven and it was ordained that she should afterwards pay to the clergy what should be judged to suffice for their maintenance The necessities of the crown the rapacity of the courtiers and the small affection which Mary bore to the Protestant ecclesiastics rendered their revenues contemptible as well as uncertain and the preachers finding that they could not rival the gentry or even the middling rank of men in opulence and plenty were necessitated to betake themselves to other expedients for supporting their authority They affected a furious zeal for religion morose manners a vulgar and familiar yet mysterious cant and though the liberality of subsequent princes put them afterwards on a better footing with regard to revenue and thereby corrected in some degree those bad habits it must be confessed that while many other advantages attend Presbyterian government these inconveniences are not easily separated from the genius of that ecclesiastical polity Knox p two hundred ninety six Keith p two hundred ten The queen of Scots destitute of all force possessing a narrow revenue surrounded with a factious turbulent nobility a bigoted people and insolent ecclesiastics soon found that her only expedient for maintaining tranquillity was to preserve a good correspondence with Elizabeth who by former connections and services had acquired such authority over all these ranks of men Jebb vol ii p four hundred fifty six Soon after her arrival in Scotland Secretary Lidington was sent to London in order to pay her compliments to the queen and express her desire of friendship and a good correspondence and he received a commission from her as well as from the nobility of Scotland to demand as a means of cementing this friendship that Mary should by act of parliament or by proclamation for the difference between these securities was not then deemed very considerable be declared successor to the crown No request could be more unreasonable or made at a more improper juncture The queen replied that Mary had once discovered her intention not to wait for the succession but had openly without ceremony or reserve assumed the title of Queen of England and had pretended a superior right to her throne and kingdom that though her ambassadors and those of her husband the French king had signed a treaty in which they renounced that claim and promised satisfaction for so great an indignity she was so intoxicated with this imaginary right that she had rejected the most earnest solicitations and even as some endeavored to persuade her had incurred some danger in crossing the seas rather than ratify that equitable treaty that her partisans every where had still the assurance to insist on her title and had presumed to talk of her own birth as illegitimate that while affairs were on this footing while a claim thus openly made so far from being openly renounced was only suspended till a more favorable opportunity it would in her be the most egregious imprudence to fortify the hands of a pretender to her crown by declaring her the successor that no expedient could be worse imagined for cementing friendship than such a declaration and kings were often found to bear no good will to their successors even though their own children much more when the connection was less intimate and when such cause of disgust and jealousy had already been given and indeed was still continued on the part of Mary that though she was willing from the amity which she bore her kinswoman to ascribe her former pretensions to the advice of others by whose direction she was then governed her present refusal to relinquish them could proceed only from her own prepossessions and was a proof that she still harbored some dangerous designs against her that it was the nature of all men to be disgusted with the present to entertain flattering views of futurity to think their services ill rewarded to expect a better recompense from the successor and she should esteem herself scarcely half a sovereign over the English if they saw her declare her heir and arm her rival with authority against her own repose and safety that she knew the inconstant nature of the people she was acquainted with the present divisions in religion she was not ignorant that the same party which expected greater favor during the reign of Mary did also imagine that the title of that princess was superior to her own that for her part whatever claims were advanced she was determined to live and die queen of England and after her death it was the business of others to examine who had the best pretensions either by the laws or by right of blood to the succession that she hoped the claim of the queen of Scots would then be found solid and considering the injury which she herself had received it was sufficient indulgence if she promised in the mean time to do nothing which might in any respect weaken or invalidate it and that Mary if her title were really preferable a point which for her own part she had never inquired into possessed all advantages above her rivals who destitute both of present power and of all support by friends would only expose themselves to inevitable ruin by advancing any weak or even doubtful pretensions These views of the queen were so prudent and judicious that there was no likelihood of her ever departing from them but that she might put the matter to a fuller proof she offered to explain the words of the treaty of Edinburgh so as to leave no suspicion of their excluding Mary s right of succession and in this form she again required her to ratify that treaty Matters at last came to this issue that Mary agreed to the proposal and offered to renounce all present pretensions to the crown of England provided Elizabeth would agree to declare her the successor But such was the jealous character of this latter princess that she never would consent to strengthen the interest and authority of any claimant by fixing the succession much less would she make this concession in favor of a rival queen who possessed such plausible pretensions for the present and who though she might verbally renounce them could easily resume her claim on the first opportunity Buchanan lib xvii c fourteen seventeen Camden p three hundred eighty five Spotswood p one hundred eighty one hundred eighty one Spotswood p one hundred eighty one Haynes vol i p three hundred seventy seven Mary s proposal however bore so specious an appearance of equity and justice that Elizabeth sensible that reason would by superficial thinkers be deemed to lie entirely on that side made no more mention of the matter and though further concessions were never made by either princess they put on all the appearances of a cordial reconciliation and friendship with each other The queen observed that even without her interposition Mary was sufficiently depressed by the mutinous spirit of her own subjects and instead of giving Scotland for the present any inquietude or disturbance she employed herself more usefully and laudably in regulating the affairs of her own kingdom and promoting the happiness of her people She made some progress in paying those great debts which lay upon the crown she regulated the coin which had been much debased by her predecessors she furnished her arsenals with great quantities of arms from Germany and other places engaged her nobility and gentry to imitate her example in this particular introduced into the kingdom the art of making gunpowder and brass cannon fortified her frontiers on the side of Scotland made frequent reviews of the militia encouraged agriculture by allowing a free exportation of corn promoted trade and navigation and so much increased the shipping of her kingdom both by building vessels of force herself and suggesting like undertakings to the merchants that she was justly styled the restorer of naval glory and the queen of the northern seas The natural frugality of her temper so far from incapacitating her for these great enterprises only enabled her to execute them with greater certainty and success and all the world saw in her conduct the happy effects of a vigorous perseverance in judicious and well concerted projects Camden p three hundred eighty eight Strype vol i p two hundred thirty three hundred thirty six three hundred thirty seven It is easy to imagine that so great a princess who enjoyed such singular felicity and renown would receive proposals of marriage from every one that had any likelihood of succeeding and though she had made some public declarations in favor of a single life few believed that she would persevere forever in that resolution The archduke Charles second son of the emperor as well as Casimir son of the elector palatine made applications to her and as this latter prince professed the reformed religion he thought himself on that account better entitled to succeed in his addresses Eric king of Sweden and Adolph duke of Holstein were encouraged by the same views to become suitors and the earl of Arran heir to the crown of Scotland was by the states of that kingdom recommended to her as a suitable marriage Haynes vol i p two hundred thirty three Even some of her own subjects though they did not openly declare their pretensions entertained hopes of success The earl of Arundel a person declining in years but descended from an ancient and noble family as well as possessed of great riches flattered himself with this prospect as did also Sir William Pickering a man much esteemed for his personal merit But the person most likely to succeed was a younger son of the late duke of Northumberland Lord Robert Dudley who by means of his exterior qualities joined to address and flattery had become in a manner her declared favorite and had great influence in all her counsels The less worthy he appeared of this distinction the more was his great favor ascribed to some violent affection which could thus seduce the judgment of this penetrating princess and men long expected that he would obtain the preference above so many princes and monarchs But the queen gave all these suitors a gentle refusal which still encouraged their pursuit and thought that she should the better attach them to her interest if they were still allowed to entertain hopes of succeeding in their pretensions It is also probable that this policy was not entirely free from a mixture of female coquetry and that though she was determined in her own mind never to share her power with any man she was not displeased with the courtship solicitation and professions of love which the desire of acquiring so valuable a prize procured her from all quarters What is most singular in the conduct and character of Elizabeth is that though she determined never to have any heir of her own body she was not only very averse to fix any successor to the crown but seems also to have resolved as far as it lay in her power that no one who had pretensions to the succession should ever have any heirs or successors If the exclusion given by the will of Henry VIII to the posterity of Margaret queen of Scotland was allowed to be valid the right to the crown devolved on the house of Suffolk and the lady Catharine Gray younger sister to the lady Jane was now the heir of that family This lady had been married to Lord Herbert son of the earl of Pembroke but having been divorced from that nobleman she had made a private marriage with the earl of Hertford son of the protector and her husband soon after consummation travelled into France In a little time she appeared to be pregnant which so enraged Elizabeth that she threw her into the Tower and summoned Hertford to appear in order to answer for his misdemeanor He made no scruple of acknowledging the marriage which though concluded without the queen s consent was entirely suitable to both parties and for this offence he was also committed to the Tower Elizabeth s severity stopped not here she issued a commission to inquire into the matter and as Hertford could not within the time limited prove the nuptials by witnesses the commerce between him and his consort was declared unlawful and their posterity illegitimate They were still detained in custody but by bribing their keepers they found means to have further intercourse and another child appeared to be the fruit of their commerce This was a fresh source of vexation to the queen who made a fine of fifteen thousand pounds be set on Hertford by the star chamber and ordered his confinement to be thenceforth more rigid and severe He lay in this condition for nine years till the death of his wife by freeing Elizabeth from all fears procured him his liberty This extreme severity must be accounted for either by the unrelenting jealousy of the queen who was afraid lest a pretender to the succession should acquire credit by having issue or by her malignity which with all her great qualities made one ingredient in her character and which led her to envy in others those natural pleasures of love and posterity of which her own ambition and desire of dominion made her renounce all

execute these projects during the queen s lifetime they had only deemed such precautions requisite in case of her demise which some pretenders to judicial astrology had assured them they might with certainty look for before the year expired They were condemned by the jury but received a pardon from the queen s clemency Strype vol i p three hundred thirty three Heylin p one hundred fifty four CHAPTER XXXIX ELIZABETH After the commencement of the religious wars in France which rendered that flourishing kingdom during the course of near forty years a scene of horror and devastation the great rival powers in Europe were Spain and England and it was not long before an animosity first political then personal broke out between the sovereigns of these countries Philip II of Spain though he reached not any enlarged views of policy was endowed with great industry and sagacity a remarkable caution in his enterprises an unusual foresight in all his measures and as he was ever cool and seemingly unmoved by passion and possessed neither talents nor inclination for war both his subjects and his neighbors had reason to expect justice happiness and tranquillity from his administration But prejudices had on him as pernicious effects as ever passion had on any other monarch and the spirit of bigotry and tyranny by which he was actuated with the fraudulent maxims which governed his counsels excited the most violent agitation among his own people engaged him in acts of the most enormous cruelty and threw all Europe into combustion After Philip had concluded peace at Chateau Cambresis and had remained some time in the Netherlands in order to settle the affairs of that country he embarked for Spain and as the gravity of that nation with their respectful obedience to their prince had appeared more agreeable to his humor than the homely familiar manners and the pertinacious liberty of the Flemings it was expected that he would for the future reside altogether at Madrid and would govern all his extensive dominions by Spanish ministers and Spanish counsels Having met with a violent tempest on his voyage he no sooner arrived in harbor than he fell on his knees and after giving thanks for his deliverance he vowed that his life which was thus providentially saved should thenceforth be entirely devoted to the extirpation of heresy His subsequent conduct corresponded to these professions Finding that the new doctrines had penetrated into Spain he let loose the rage of persecution against all who professed them or were suspected of adhering to them and by his violence he gave new edge even to the usual cruelty of priests and inquisitors He threw into prison Constantine Ponce who had been confessor to his father the emperor Charles who had attended him during his retreat and in whose arms that great monarch had terminated his life and after this ecclesiastic died in confinement he still ordered him to be tried and condemned for heresy and his statue to be committed to the flames He even deliberated whether he should not exercise like severity against the memory of his father who was suspected during his later years to have indulged a propensity towards the Lutheran principles in his unrelenting zeal for orthodoxy he spared neither age sex nor condition he was present with an inflexible countenance at the most barbarous executions he issued rigorous orders for the prosecution of heretics in Spain Italy the Indies and the Low Countries and having founded his determined tyranny on maxims of civil policy as well as on principles of religion he made it apparent to all his subjects that there was no method except the most entire compliance or most obstinate resistance to escape or elude the severity of his vengeance Thuanns lib xxiii cap fourteen During that extreme animosity which prevailed between the adherents of the opposite religions the civil magistrate who found it difficult if not impossible for the same laws to govern such enraged adversaries was naturally led by specious rules of prudence in embracing one party to declare war against the other and to exterminate by fire and sword those bigots who from abhorrence of his religion had proceeded to an opposition of his power and to a hatred of his person If any prince possessed such enlarged views as to foresee that a mutual toleration would in time abate the fury of religious prejudices he yet met with difficulties in reducing this principle to practice and might deem the malady too violent to await a remedy which though certain must necessarily be slow in its operation But Philip though a profound hypocrite and extremely governed by self interest seems also to have been himself actuated by an imperious bigotry and as he employed great reflection in all his conduct he could easily palliate the gratification of his natural temper under the color of wisdom and find in this system no less advantage to his foreign than his domestic politics By placing himself at the head of the Catholic party he converted the zealots of the ancient faith into partisans of Spanish greatness and by employing the powerful allurement of religion he seduced every where the subjects from that allegiance which they owed to their native sovereign The course of events guiding and concurring with choice had placed Elizabeth in a situation diametrically opposite and had raised her to be the glory the bulwark and the support of the numerous though still persecuted Protestants throughout Europe More moderate in her temper than Philip she found with pleasure that the principles of her sect required not such extreme severity in her domestic government as was exercised by that monarch and having no object but self preservation she united her interests in all foreign negotiations with those who were every where struggling under oppression and guarding themselves against ruin and extermination The more virtuous sovereign was thus happily thrown into the more favorable cause and fortune in this instance concurred with policy and nature During the lifetime of Henry II of France and of his successor the force of these principles was somewhat restrained though not altogether overcome by motives of a superior interest and the dread of uniting England with the French monarchy engaged Philip to maintain a good correspondence with Elizabeth Yet even during this period he rejected the garter which she sent him he refused to ratify the ancient league between the house of Burgundy and England he furnished ships to transport French forces into Scotland he endeavored to intercept the earl of Arran who was hastening to join the malecontents in that country and the queen s wisest ministers still regarded his friendship as hollow and precarious Digges s Complete Ambassador p three hundred sixty nine Haynes p five hundred eighty five Strype vol iv No two hundred forty six Haynes vol i p two hundred eighty two hundred eighty one two hundred eighty three two hundred eighty four But no sooner did the death of Francis II put an end to Philip s apprehensions with regard to Mary s succession than his animosity against Elizabeth began more openly to appear and the interests of Spain and those of England were found opposite in every negotiation and transaction The two great monarchies of the continent France and Spain being possessed of nearly equal force were naturally antagonists and England from its power and situation was entitled to support its own dignity as well as tranquillity by holding the balance between them Whatever incident therefore tended too much to depress one of these rival powers as it left the other without control might be deemed contrary to the interests of England yet so much were these great maxims of policy overruled during that age by the disputes of theology that Philip found an advantage in supporting the established government and religion of France and Elizabeth in protecting faction and innovation The queen regent of France when reinstated in authority by the death of her son Francis had formed a plan of administration more subtle than judicious and balancing the Catholics with the Hugonots the duke of Guise with the prince of Conde she endeavored to render herself necessary to both and to establish her own dominion on their constrained obedience But the equal counterpoise of power which among foreign nations is the source of tranquillity proves always the ground of quarrel between domestic factions and if the animosity of religion concur with the frequent occasions which present themselves of mutual injury it is impossible during any time to preserve a firm concord in so delicate a situation The constable Montmorency moved by zeal for the ancient faith joined himself to the duke of Guise the king of Navarre from his inconstant temper and his jealousy of the superior genius of his brother embraced the same party and Catharine finding herself depressed by this combination had recourse to Conde and the Hugonots who gladly embraced the opportunity of fortifying themselves by her countenance and protection Davila lib ii Davila lib iii An edict had been published granting a toleration to the Protestants but the interested violence of the duke of Guise covered with the pretence of religious zeal broke through this agreement and the two parties after the fallacious tranquillity of a moment renewed their mutual insults and injuries Conde Coligny Andelot assembled their friends and flew to arms Guise and Montmorency got possession of the king s person and constrained the queen regent to embrace their party fourteen armies were levied and put in motion in different parts of France each province each city each family was agitated with intestine rage and animosity The father was divided against the son brother against brother and women themselves sacrificing their humanity as well as their timidity to the religious fury distinguished themselves by acts of ferocity and valor Wherever the Hugonots prevailed the images were broken the altars pillaged the churches demolished the monasteries consumed with fire where success attended the Catholics they burned the Bibles rebaptized the infants constrained married persons to pass anew through the nuptial ceremony and plunder desolation and bloodshed attended equally the triumph of both parties The parliament of Paris itself the seat of law and justice instead of employing its authority to compose these fatal quarrels published an edict by which it put the sword into the hands of the enraged multitude and empowered the Catholics every where to massacre the Hugonots and it was during this period when men began to be somewhat enlightened and in this nation renowned for polished manners that the theological rage which had long been boiling in men s veins seems to have attained its last stage of virulence and ferocity Father Paul lib vii Father Paul lib vii Father Paul lib vii Haynes p three hundred ninety one Philip jealous of the progress which the Hugonots made in France and dreading that the contagion would spread into the Low Country provinces had formed a secret alliance with the princes of Guise and had entered into a mutual concert for the protection of the ancient faith and the suppression of heresy He now sent six thousand men with some supply of money to reenforce the Catholic party and the prince of Conde finding himself unequal to so great a combination countenanced by the royal authority was obliged to despatch the Vidame of Chartres and Briguemaut to London in order to crave the assistance and protection of Elizabeth Most of the province of Normandy was possessed by the Hugonots and Conde offered to put Havre de Grace into the hands of the English on condition that together with three thousand man for the garrison of that place the queen should likewise send over three thousand to defend Dieppe and Rouen and should furnish the prince with a supply of a hundred thousand crowns Elizabeth besides the general and essential interest of supporting the Protestants and opposing the rapid progress of her enemy the duke of Guise had other motives which engaged her to accept of this proposal When she concluded the peace at Chateau Cambresis she had good reason to foresee that France never would voluntarily fulfil the article which regarded the restitution of Calais and many subsequent incidents had tended to confirm this suspicion Considerable sums of money had been expended on the fortifications long leases had been granted of the lands and many inhabitants had been encouraged to build and settle there by assurances that Calais should never be restored to the English The queen therefore wisely concluded that could she get possession of Havre a place which commanded the mouth of the Seine and was of greater importance than Calais she should easily constrain the French to execute the treaty and should have the glory of restoring to the crown that ancient possession so much the favorite of the nation No measure could be more generally odious in France than the conclusion of this treaty with Elizabeth Men were naturally led to compare the conduct of Guise who had finally expelled the English and had debarred these dangerous and destructive enemies from all access into France with the treasonable politics of Conde who had again granted them an entrance into the heart of the kingdom The prince had the more reason to repent of this measure as he reaped not from it all the advantage which he expected Three thousand English immediately took possession of Havre and Dieppe under the command of Sir Edward Poinings but the latter place was found so little capable of defence that it was immediately abandoned The siege of Rouen was already formed by the Catholics under the command of the king of Navarre and Montmorency and it was with difficulty that Poinings could throw a small reenforcement into the place Though these English troops behaved with gallantry and though the king of Navarre was mortally wounded during the siege the Catholics still continued the attack of the place and carrying it at last by assault put the whole garrison to the sword Forbes vol ii p forty eight Forbes vol ii p fifty four two hundred fifty seven Forbes vol ii p one hundred ninety nine Forbes vol ii p one hundred sixty one The earl of Warwick eldest son of the late duke of Northumberland arrived soon after at Havre with another body of three thousand English and took on him the command of the place It was expected that the French Catholics flushed with their success at Rouen would immediately have formed the siege of Havre which was not as yet in any condition of defence but the intestine disorders of the kingdom soon diverted their attention to another enterprise Andelot seconded by the negotiations of Elizabeth had levied a considerable body of Protestants in Germany and having arrived at Orleans the seat of the Hugonots power he enabled the prince of Conde and the admiral to take the field and oppose the progress of their enemies After threatening Paris during some time they took their march towards Normandy with a view of engaging the English to act in conjunction with them and of fortifying themselves by the further assistance which they expected from the zeal and vigor of Elizabeth The Catholics commanded by the constable and under him by the duke of Guise followed on their rear and overtaking them at Dreux obliged them to give battle The field was fought with great obstinacy on both sides and the action was distinguished by this singular event that Conde and Montmorency the commanders of the opposite armies fell both of them prisoners into the hands of their enemies The appearances of victory remained with Guise but the admiral whose fate it ever was to be defeated and still to rise more terrible after his misfortunes collected the remains of the army and inspiring his own unconquerable courage and constancy into every breast kept them in a body and subdued some considerable places in Normandy Elizabeth the better to support his cause sent him a new supply of a hundred thousand crowns and offered if he could find merchants to lend him the money to give her bond for another sum of equal amount Forbes vol ii p three hundred twenty Davila lib iii Forbes vol ii p three hundred twenty two three hundred forty seven The expenses incurred by assisting the French Hugonots had emptied the queen s exchequer and in order to obtain supply she found herself under a necessity of summoning a parliament an expedient to which she never willingly had recourse A little before the meeting of this assembly she had fallen into a dangerous illness the small pox and as her life during some time was despaired of the people became the more sensible of their perilous situation derived from the uncertainty which in case of her demise attended the succession of the crown The partisans of the queen of Scots and those of the house of Suffolk already divided the nation into factions and every one foresaw that though it might be possible at present to determine the controversy by law yet if the throne were vacant nothing but the sword would be able to fix a successor The commons therefore on the opening of the session voted an address to the queen in which after enumerating the dangers attending a broken and doubtful succession and mentioning the evils which their fathers had experienced from the contending titles of York and Lancaster they entreated the queen to put an end to their apprehensions by choosing some husband whom they promised whoever he were gratefully to receive and faithfully to serve honor and obey or if she had entertained any reluctance to the married state they desired that the lawful successor might be named at least appointed by act of parliament They remarked that during all the reigns which had passed since the conquest the nation had never before been so unhappy as not to know the person who in case of the sovereign s death was legally entitled to fill the vacant throne And they observed that the fixed order which took place in inheriting the French monarchy was one chief source of the usual tranquillity as well as of the happiness of that kingdom Sir Simon d Ewes s Journ p eighty one This subject though extremely interesting to the nation was very little agreeable to the queen and she was sensible that great difficulties would attend every decision A declaration in favor of the queen of Scots would form a settlement perfectly legal because that princess was commonly allowed to possess the right of blood and the exclusion given by Henry s will deriving its weight chiefly from an act of parliament would lose all authority whenever the queen and parliament had made a new settlement and restored the Scottish line to its place in the succession But she dreaded giving encouragement to the Catholics her secret enemies by this declaration She was sensible that every heir was in some degree a rival much more one who enjoyed a claim for the present possession of the crown and who had already advanced in a very open manner these dangerous pretensions The great power of Mary both from the favor of the Catholic princes and her connections with the house of Guise not to mention the force and situation of Scotland was well known to her and she saw no security that this princess if fortified by a sure prospect of succession would not revive claims which she could never yet be prevailed on formally to relinquish On the other hand the title of the house of Suffolk was supported by the more zealous Protestants only and it was very doubtful whether even a parliamentary declaration in its favor would bestow on it such validity as to give satisfaction to the people The republican part of the constitution had not yet acquired such an ascendant as to control in any degree the ideas of hereditary right and as the legality of Henry s will was still disputed though founded on the utmost authority which a parliament could confer who could be assured that a more recent act would be acknowledged to have greater validity In the frequent revolutions which had of late taken place the right of blood had still prevailed over religious prejudices and the nation had ever shown itself disposed rather to change its faith than the order of succession Even many Protestants declared themselves in favor of Mary s claim of inheritance and nothing would occasion more general disgust than to see the queen openly and without reserve take part against it Keith p three hundred twenty two The Scottish princess also finding herself injured in so sensible a point would thenceforth act as a declared enemy and uniting together her foreign and domestic friends the partisans of her present title and of her eventual succession would soon bring matters to extremities against the present establishment The queen weighing all these inconveniences which were great and urgent was determined to keep both parties in awe by maintaining still an ambiguous conduct and she rather chose that the people should run the hazard of contingent events than that she herself should visibly endanger her throne by employing expedients which at best would not bestow entire security on the nation She gave therefore an evasive answer to the applications of the commons and when the house at the end of the session desired by the mouth of their speaker further satisfaction on that head she could not be prevailed on to make her reply more explicit She only told them contrary to her declarations in the beginning of her reign that she had fixed no absolute resolution against marriage and she added that the difficulties attending the question of the succession were so great that she would be contented for the sake of her people to remain some time longer in this vale of misery and never should depart life with satisfaction till she had laid some solid foundation for their future security The most remarkable law passed this session was that which bore the title of Assurance of the queen s royal power over all states and subjects within her dominions By this act the asserting twice by writing word or deed the pope s authority was subjected to the penalties of treason All persons in holy orders were bound to take the oath of supremacy as also all who were advanced to any degree either in the universities or in common law all schoolmasters officers in court or members of parliament and the penalty of their second refusal was treason The first offence in both cases was punished by banishment and forfeiture This rigorous statute was not extended to any of the degree of a baron because it was not supposed that the queen could entertain any doubt with regard to the fidelity of persons possessed of such high dignity Lord Montacute made opposition to the bill and asserted in favor of the Catholics that they disputed not they preached not they disobeyed not the queen they caused no trouble no tumults among the people It is however probable that some suspicions of their secret conspiracies had made the queen and parliament increase their rigor against them though it is also more than probable that they were mistaken in the remedy There was likewise another point in which the parliament this session showed more the goodness of their intention than the soundness of their judgment They passed a law against fond and fantastical prophecies which had been observed to seduce the people into rebellion and disorder but at the same time they enacted a statute which was most likely to increase these and such like superstitions it was levelled against conjurations enchantments and witchcraft v Sir Simon D Ewes s Journal p seventy five five Eliz c one Strype vol i p two hundred sixty five Eliz c I v five Eliz c sixteen Witchcraft and heresy are two crimes which commonly increase by punishment and never are so effectually suppressed as by being totally neglected After the parliament had granted the queen a supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths the session was finished by a prorogation The convocation likewise voted the queen a subsidy of six shillings in the pound payable in three years While the English parties exerted these calm efforts against each other in parliamentary votes and debates the French factions inflamed to the highest degree of animosity continued that cruel war which their intemperate zeal actuated by the ambition of their leaders had kindled in the kingdom The admiral was successful in reducing the towns of Normandy which held for the king but he frequently complained that the numerous garrison of Havre remained totally inactive and was not employed in any military operation against the common enemy The queen in taking possession of that place had published a manifesto in which she pretended that her concern for the interests of the French king had engaged her in that measure and that her sole intention was to oppose her enemies of the house of Guise who held their prince in captivity and employed his power to the destruction of his best and most faithful subjects It was chiefly her desire to preserve appearances joined to the great frugality of her temper which made her at this critical juncture keep her soldiers in garrison and restrain them from committing further hostilities upon the enemy Forbes vol ii Forbes vol ii p two hundred seventy six two hundred seventy seven The duke of Guise meanwhile was aiming a mortal blow at the power of the Hugonots and had commenced the siege of Orleans of which Andelot was governor and where the constable was detained prisoner He had the prospect of speedy success in this undertaking when he was assassinated by Poltrot a young gentleman whose zeal instigated as is pretended though without any certain foundation by the admiral and Beza a famous preacher led him to attempt that criminal enterprise The death of this gallant prince was a sensible loss to the Catholic party and though the cardinal of Lorraine his brother still supported the interests of the family the danger of their progress appeared not so imminent either to Elizabeth or to the French Protestants The union therefore between these allies which had been cemented by their common fears began thenceforth to be less intimate and the leaders of the Hugonots were persuaded to hearken to terms of a separate accommodation Conde and Montmorency held conferences for settling the peace and as they were both of them impatient to relieve themselves from captivity they soon came to an agreement with regard to the conditions The character of the queen regent whose ends were always violent but who endeavored by subtlety and policy rather than force to attain them led her to embrace any plausible terms and in spite of the protestations of the admiral whose sagacity could easily discover the treachery of the court the articles of agreement were finally settled between the parties A toleration under some restrictions was anew granted to the Protestants a general amnesty was published Conde was reinstated in his offices and governments and after money was advanced for the payment of arrears due to the German troops they were dismissed the kingdom By the agreement between Elizabeth and the prince of Conde it had been stipulated that neither party should conclude peace without the consent of the other but this article was at present but little regarded by the leaders of the French Protestants They only comprehended her so far in the treaty as to obtain a promise that on her relinquishing Havre her charges and the money which she had advanced them should be repaid her by the king of France and that Calais on the expiration of the term should be restored to her But she disdained to accept of these conditions and thinking the possession of Havre a much better pledge for effecting her purpose she sent Warwick orders to prepare himself against an attack from the now united power of the French monarchy The earl of Warwick who commanded a garrison of six thousand men besides seven hundred pioneers had no sooner got possession of Havre than he employed every means for putting it in a posture of defence and after expelling the French from the town he encouraged his soldiers to make the most desperate defence against the enemy The constable commanded the French army the queen regent herself and the king were present in the camp even the prince of Conde joined the king s forces and gave countenance to this enterprise the admiral and Andelot alone anxious still to preserve the friendship of Elizabeth kept at a distance and prudently refused to join their ancient enemies in an attack upon their allies Forbes vol ii p seventy nine Forbes vol ii p one hundred fifty eight From the force and dispositions and situation of both sides it was expected that the siege would be attended with some memorable event yet did France make a much easier acquisition of this important place than was at first apprehended The plague crept in among the English soldiers and being increased by their fatigue and bad diet for they were but ill supplied with provisions it made such ravages that sometimes a hundred men a day died of it and there remained not at last fifteen hundred in a condition to do duty The French meeting with such feeble resistance carried on their attacks successfully and having made two breaches each of them sixty feet wide they prepared for a general assault which must have terminated in the slaughter of the whole garrison Warwick who had frequently warned the English council of the danger and who had loudly demanded a supply of men and provisions found himself obliged to capitulate and to content himself with the liberty of withdrawing his garrison The articles were no sooner signed than Lord Clinton the admiral who had been detained by contrary winds appeared off the harbor with a reenforcement of three thousand men and found the place surrendered to the enemy To increase the misfortune the infected army brought the plague with them into England where it swept off great multitudes particularly in the city of London Above twenty thousand persons there died of it in one year six Forbes vol ii p three hundred seventy seven four hundred ninety eight Forbes vol ii p four hundred fifty four hundred fifty eight Forbes vol ii p four hundred ninety eight See note F at the end of the volume Elizabeth whose usual vigor and foresight had not appeared in this transaction was now glad to compound matters and as the queen regent desired to obtain leisure in order to prepare measures for the extermination of the Hugonots she readily hearkened to any reasonable terms of accommodation with England Davila lib iii It was agreed that the hostages which the French had given for the restitution of Calais should be restored for two hundred and twenty thousand crowns and that both sides should retain all their claims and pretensions The peace still continued with Scotland and even a cordial friendship seemed to have been cemented between Elizabeth and Mary These princesses made profession of the most entire affection wrote amicable letters every week to each other and had adopted in all appearance the sentiments as well as style of sisters Elizabeth punished one Hales who had published a book against Mary s title and as the lord keeper Bacon was thought to have encouraged Hales in this undertaking he fell under her displeasure and it was with some difficulty he was able to give her satisfaction and recover her favor The two queens had agreed in the foregoing summer to an interview at York in order to remove all difficulties with regard to Mary s ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh and to consider of the proper method for settling the succession of England but as Elizabeth carefully avoided touching on this delicate subject she employed a pretence of the wars in France which she said would detain her in London and she delayed till next year the intended interview It is also probable that being well acquainted with the beauty and address and accomplishments of Mary she did not choose to stand the comparison with regard to those exterior qualities in which she was eclipsed by her rival and was unwilling that a princess who had already made great progress in the esteem and affections of the English should have a further opportunity of increasing the number of her partisans Keith p two hundred fifty two Keith p two hundred fifty three Haynes p three hundred eighty eight Mary s close connections with the house of Guise and her devoted attachment to her uncles by whom she had been early educated and constantly protected was the ground of just and insurmountable jealousy to Elizabeth who regarded them as her mortal and declared enemies and was well acquainted with their dangerous character and ambitious projects They had made offer of their niece to Don Carlos Philip s son to the king of Sweden the king of Navarre the archduke Charles the duke of Ferrara the cardinal of Bourbon who had only taken deacon s orders from which he might easily be freed by a dispensation and they were ready to marry her to any one who could strengthen their interests or give inquietude and disturbance to Elizabeth Forbes vol ii p two hundred eighty seven Strype vol i p four hundred Elizabeth on her part was equally vigilant to prevent the execution of their schemes and was particularly anxious lest Mary should form any powerful foreign alliance which might tempt her to revive her pretensions to the crown and to invade the kingdom on the side where it was weakest and lay most exposed As she believed that the marriage with the archduke Charles was the one most likely to have place she used every expedient to prevent it and besides remonstrating against it to Mary herself she endeavored to draw off the archduke from that pursuit by giving him some hopes of success in his pretensions to herself and by inviting him to a renewal of the former treaty of marriage She always told the queen of Scots that nothing would satisfy her but her espousing some English nobleman who would remove all grounds of jealousy and cement the union between the kingdoms and she offered on this condition to have her title examined and to declare her successor to the crown After keeping the matter in these general terms during a twelvemonth she at last named Lord Robert Dudley now created earl of Leicester as the person on whom she desired that Mary s choice should fall Illustration one four hundred fifty three mary stuart jpg MARY STUART The earl of Leicester the great and powerful favorite of Elizabeth possessed all those exterior qualities which are naturally alluring to the fair sex a handsome person a polite address an insinuating behavior and by means of these accomplishments he had been able to blind even the penetration of Elizabeth and conceal from her the great defects or rather odious vices which attended his character He was proud insolent interested ambitious without honor without generosity without humanity and atoned not for these bad qualities by such abilities or courage as could fit him for that high trust and confidence with which she always honored him Her constant and declared attachment to him had naturally emboldened him to aspire to her bed and in order to make way for these nuptials he was universally believed to have murdered in a barbarous manner his wife the heiress of one Robesart The proposal of espousing Mary was by no means agreeable to him and he always ascribed it to the contrivance of Cecil his enemy who he thought intended by that artifice to make him lose the friendship of Mary from the temerity of his pretensions and that of Elizabeth from jealousy of his attachments to another woman Keith p two hundred forty seven two hundred eighty four Melvil p forty one Keith p two hundred thirteen two hundred forty nine two hundred fifty nine two hundred sixty five Camden p three hundred ninety six The queen herself had not any serious intention of effecting this marriage but as she was desirous that the queen of Scots should never have any husband she named a man who she believed was not likely to be accepted of and she hoped by that means to gain time and elude the project of any other alliance The earl of Leicester was too great a favorite to be parted with and when Mary allured by the prospect of being declared successor to the crown seemed at last to hearken to Elizabeth s proposal this princess receded from her offers and withdrew the bait which she had thrown out to her rival This duplicity of conduct joined to some appearance of an imperious superiority assumed by her had drawn a peevish letter from Mary and the seemingly amicable correspondence between the two queens was during some time interrupted In order to make up the breach the queen of Scots despatched Sir James Melvil to London who has given us in his memoirs a particular account of his negotiation Melvil was an agreeable courtier a man of address and conversation and it was recommended to him by his mistress that besides grave reasonings concerning politics and state affairs he should introduce more entertaining topics of conversation suitable to the sprightly character of Elizabeth and should endeavor by that means to insinuate himself into her confidence He succeeded so well that he threw that artful princess entirely off her guard and made her discover the bottom of her heart full of all those levities and follies and ideas of rivalship which possess the youngest and most frivolous of her sex Keith p two hundred sixty nine two hundred seventy Appendix p one hundred fifty eight Strype vol i p four hundred fourteen Haynes p four hundred forty seven He talked to her of his travels and forgot not to mention the different dresses of the ladies in different countries and the particular advantages of each in setting off the beauties of the shape and person The queen said that she had dresses of all countries and she took care thenceforth to meet the ambassador every day apparelled in a different habit sometimes she was dressed in the English garb sometimes in the French sometimes in the Italian and she asked him which of them became her most He answered the Italian a reply that he knew would be agreeable to her because that mode showed to advantage her flowing locks which he remarked though they were more red than yellow she fancied to be the finest in the world She desired to know of him what was reputed the best color of hair she asked whether his queen or she had the finest hair she even inquired which of them he esteemed the fairest person a very delicate question and which he prudently eluded by saying that her majesty was the fairest person in England and his mistress in Scotland She next demanded which of them was tallest he replied his queen Then is she too tall said Elizabeth for I myself am of a just stature Having learned from him that his mistress sometimes recreated herself by playing on the harpsichord an instrument on which she herself excelled she gave orders to Lord Hunsdon that he should lead the ambassador as it were casually into an apartment where he might hear her perform and when Melvil as if ravished with the harmony broke into the queen s apartment she pretended to be displeased with his intrusion but still took care to ask him whether he thought Mary or her the best performer on that instrument From the whole of her behavior Melvil thought he might on his return assure his mistress that she had no reason ever to expect any cordial friendship from Elizabeth and that all her professions of amity were full of falsehood and dissimulation Melvil p forty nine fifty Keith p two hundred sixty four After two years had been spent in evasions and artifices Mary s subjects and counsellors and probably herself began to think it full time that some marriage were concluded and Lord Darnley son of the earl of Lenox was the person in whom most men s opinions and wishes centred He was Mary s cousin german by the lady Margaret Douglas niece to Henry VIII and daughter of the earl of Angus by Margaret queen of Scotland He had been born and educated in England where the earl of Lenox had constantly resided since he had been banished by the prevailing power of the house of Hamilton and as Darnley was now in his twentieth year and was a very comely person tall and delicately shaped it was hoped that he might soon render himself agreeable to the queen of Scots He was also by his father a branch of the same family with herself and would in espousing her preserve the royal dignity in the house of Stuart he was after her next heir to the crown of England and those who pretended to exclude her on account of her being a foreigner had endeavored to recommend his title and give it the preference It seemed no inconsiderable advantage that she could by marrying him unite both their claims and as he was by birth an Englishman and could not by his power or alliances give any ground of suspicion to Elizabeth it was hoped that the proposal of this marriage would not be unacceptable to that jealous princess Elizabeth was well informed of these intentions and was secretly not displeased with the projected marriage between Darnley and the queen of Scots She would rather have wished that Mary had continued forever in a single life but finding little probability of rendering this scheme effectual she was satisfied with a choice which freed her at once from the dread of a foreign alliance and from the necessity of parting with Leicester her favorite In order to pave the way to Darnley s marriage she secretly desired Mary to invite Lenox into Scotland to reverse his attainder and to restore him to his honors and fortune And when her request was complied with she took care in order to preserve the friendship of the Hamiltons and her other partisans in Scotland to blame openly this conduct of Mary Keith p two hundred sixty one Keith p two hundred eighty two hundred eighty two Jebb vol ii p forty six Keith p two hundred fifty five two hundred fifty nine two hundred seventy two Melvil p forty two Hearing that the negotiation for Darnley s marriage advanced apace she gave that nobleman permission on his first application to follow his father into Scotland but no sooner did she learn that the queen of Scots was taken with his figure and person and that all measures were fixed for espousing him than she exclaimed against the marriage sent Throgmorton to order Darnley immediately upon his allegiance to return to England threw the countess of Lenox and her second son into the Tower where they suffered a rigorous confinement seized all Lenox s English estate and though it was impossible for her to assign one single reason for her displeasure she menaced and protested and complained as if she had suffered the most grievous injury in the world Keith p two hundred seventy four two hundred seventy five The politics of Elizabeth though judicious were usually full of duplicity and artifice but never more so than in her transactions with the queen of Scots where there entered so many little passions and narrow jealousies that she durst not avow to the world the reasons of her conduct scarcely to her ministers and scarcely even to herself But besides a womanish rivalship and envy against the marriage of this princess she had some motives of interest for feigning a displeasure on the present occasion It served her as a pretence for refusing to acknowledge Mary s title to the succession of England a point to which for good reasons she was determined never to consent And it was useful to her for a purpose still more unfriendly and dangerous for encouraging the discontents and rebellion of the Scottish nobility and ecclesiastics Nothing can be more unhappy for a people than to be governed by a sovereign attached to a religion different from the established and it is scarcely possible that mutual confidence can ever in such a situation have place between the prince and his subjects Mary s conduct had been hitherto in every respect unexceptionable and even laudable yet had she not made such progress in acquiring popularity as might have been expected from her gracious deportment and agreeable accomplishments Suspicions every moment prevailed on account of her attachment to the Catholic faith and especially to her uncles the open and avowed promoters of the scheme for exterminating the professors of the reformed religion throughout all Europe She still refused to ratify the acts of parliament which had established the reformation she made attempts for restoring to the Catholic bishops some part of their civil jurisdiction and she wrote a letter to the council of Trent in which besides professing her attachment to the Catholic faith she took notice of her title to succeed to the crown of England and expressed her hopes of being able in some period to bring back all her dominions to the bosom of the church The zealots among the Protestants were not wanting in their turn to exercise their insolence against her which tended still more to alienate her from their faith A law was enacted making it capital on the very first offence to say mass any where except in the queen s chapel and it was with difficulty that even this small indulgence was granted her the general assembly importuned her anew to change her religion to renounce the blasphemous idolatry of the mass with the tyranny of the Roman Antichrist and to embrace the true religion of Christ Jesus v Keith p two hundred ninety Spotswood p one hundred ninety eight Father Paul lib vii Keith p two hundred sixty eight v Keith p five hundred forty five Knox p three hundred seventy four As she answered in temper that she was not yet convinced of the falsity of her religion or the impiety of the mass and that her apostasy would lose her the friendship of her allies on the continent they replied by assuring her that their religion was undoubtedly the same which had been revealed by Jesus Christ which had been preached by the apostles and which had been embraced by the faithful in the primitive ages that neither the religion of Turks Jews nor Papists was built on so solid a foundation as theirs that they alone of all the various species of religionists spread over the face of the earth were so happy as to be possessed of the truth that those who hear or rather who gaze on the mass allow sacrilege pronounce blasphemy and commit most abominable idolatry and that the friendship of the King of kings was preferable to all the alliances in the world The marriage of the queen of Scots had kindled afresh the zeal of the reformers because the family of Lenox was believed to adhere to the Catholic faith and though Darnley who now bore the name of King Henry went often to the established church he could not by this exterior compliance gain the confidence and regard of the ecclesiastics They rather laid hold of the opportunity to insult him to his face and Knox scrupled not to tell him from the pulpit that God for punishment of the offences and ingratitude of the people was wont to commit the rule over them to boys and women The populace of Edinburgh instigated by such doctrines began to meet and to associate themselves against the government But what threatened more immediate danger to Mary s authority were the discontents which prevailed among some of the principal nobility Keith p five hundred fifty five hundred fifty one Keith p five hundred forty six Knox p three hundred eighty one Knox p three hundred seventy seven The duke of Chatelrault was displeased with the restoration and still more with the aggrandizement of the family of Lenox his hereditary enemies and entertained fears lest his own eventual succession to the crown of Scotland should be excluded by his rival who had formerly advanced some pretensions to it The earl of Murray found his credit at court much diminished by the interest of Lenox and his son and began to apprehend the revocation of some considerable grants which he had obtained from Mary s bounty The earls of Argyle Rothes and Glencairne the lords Boyde and Ochiltry Kirkaldy of Grange Pittarow were instigated by like motives and as these were the persons who had most zealously promoted the reformation they were disgusted to find that the queen s favor was entirely engrossed by a new cabal the earls of Bothwell Athole Sutherland and Huntley men who were esteemed either lukewarm in religious controversy or inclined to the Catholic party The same ground of discontent which in other courts is the source of intrigue faction and opposition commonly produced in Scotland either projects of assassination or of rebellion and besides mutual accusations of the former kind which it is difficult to clear up seven the malecontent lords as soon as they saw the queen s marriage entirely resolved on entered into a confederacy for taking arms against their sovereign They met at Stirling pretended an anxious concern for the security of religion framed engagements for mutual defence and made applications to Elizabeth for assistance and protection That princess after publishing the expressions of her displeasure against the marriage had secretly ordered her ambassadors Randolf and Throgmorton to give in her name some promises of support to the malecontents and had even sent them a supply of ten thousand pounds to enable them to begin an insurrection Mary was no sooner informed of the meeting at Stirling and the movements of the lords than she summoned them to appear at court in order to answer for their conduct and having levied some forces to execute the laws she obliged the rebels to leave the low countries and take shelter in Argyleshire That she might more effectually cut off their resources she proceeded with the king to Glasgow and forced them from their retreat They appeared at Paisley in the neighborhood with about a thousand horse and passing the queen s army proceeded to Hamilton thence to Edinburgh which they entered without resistance They expected great reenforcements in this place from the efforts of Knox and the seditious preachers and they beat their drums desiring all men to enlist and receive wages for the defence of God s glory See note G at the end of the volume Keith p two hundred ninety three two hundred ninety four three hundred three

rebellion Mary was esteemed and beloved her marriage was not generally disagreeable to the people and the interested views of the malecontent lords were so well known that their pretence of zeal for religion had little influence even on the ignorant populace The king and queen advanced to Edinburgh at the head of their army the rebels were obliged to retire into the south and being pursued by a force which now amounted to eighteen thousand men they found themselves under a necessity of abandoning their country and of taking shelter in England Elizabeth when she found the event so much to disappoint her expectations thought proper to disavow all connections with the Scottish malecontents and to declare every where that she had never given them any encouragement nor any promise of countenance or assistance She even carried further her dissimulation and hypocrisy Murray had come to London with the abbot of Kilwinning agent for Chatelrault and she seduced them by secret assurances of protection to declare before the ambassadors of France and Spain that she had nowise contributed to their insurrection No sooner had she extorted this confession from them than she chased them from her presence called them unworthy traitors declared that their detestable rebellion was of bad example to all princes and assured them that as she had hitherto given them no encouragement so should they never thenceforth receive from her any assistance or protection Throgmorton alone whose honor was equal to his abilities could not be prevailed on to conceal the part which he had acted in the enterprise of the Scottish rebels and being well apprised of the usual character and conduct of Elizabeth he had had the precaution to obtain an order of council to authorize the engagements which he had been obliged to make with them Knox p three hundred eighty three hundred eighty five Knox p three hundred eighty eight Melvil p fifty seven Knox p three hundred eighty

sovereign and after some solicitation and some professions of sincere repentance the duke of Chatelrault obtained his pardon on condition that he should retire into France Mary was more implacable against the ungrateful earl of Murray and the other confederates on whom she threw the chief blame of the enterprise but as she was continually plied with applications from their friends and as some of her most judicious partisans in England thought that nothing would more promote her interests in that kingdom than the gentle treatment of men so celebrated for their zeal against the Catholic religion she agreed to give way to her natural temper which inclined not to severity and she seemed determined to restore them to favor In this interval Rambouillet arrived as ambassador from France and brought her advice from her uncle the cardinal of Lorraine to whose opinion she always paid an extreme deference by no means to pardon these Protestant leaders who had been engaged in a rebellion against her The two religions in France as well as in other parts of Europe were rather irritated than tired with their acts of mutual violence and the peace granted to the Hugonots as had been foreseen by Coligny was intended only to lull them asleep and prepare the way for their final and absolute destruction The queen regent made a pretence of travelling through the kingdom in order to visit the provinces and correct all the abuses arising from the late civil war and after having held some conferences on the frontiers with the duke of Lorraine and the duke of Savoy she came to Bayonne where she was met by her daughter the queen of Spain and the duke of Alva Nothing appeared in the congress of these two splendid courts but gayety festivity love and joy but amidst these smiling appearances were secretly fabricated schemes the most bloody and the most destructive to the repose of mankind that had ever been thought of in any age or nation No less than a total and universal extermination of the Protestants by fire and sword was concerted by Philip and Catharine of Medicis and Alva agreeably to his fierce and sanguinary disposition advised the queen regent to commence the execution of this project by the immediate massacre of all the leaders of the Hugonots Melvil p fifty nine sixty sixty one sixty two sixty three Keith p three hundred twenty two Keith p

resistance The cardinal of Lorraine whose character bore a greater affinity to that of Alva was a chief author of this barbarous association against the reformers and having connected his hopes of success with the aggrandizement of his niece the queen of Scots he took care that her measures should correspond to those violent counsels which were embraced by the other Catholic princes In consequence of this scheme he turned her from the road of clemency which she intended to have followed and made her resolve on the total ruin of the banished lords A parliament was summoned at Edinburgh for attainting them and as their guilt was palpable and avowed no doubt was entertained but sentence would be pronounced against them It was by a sudden and violent incident which in the issue brought on the ruin of Mary herself that they were saved from the rigor of the law The marriage of the queen of Scots with Lord Darnley was so natural and so inviting in all its circumstances that it had been precipitately agreed to by that princess and her council and while she was allured by his youth and beauty and exterior accomplishments she had at first overlooked the qualities of his mind which nowise corresponded to the excellence of his outward figure Violent yet variable in his resolutions insolent yet credulous and easily governed by flatterers he was destitute of all gratitude because he thought no favors equal to his merit and being addicted to low pleasures he was equally incapable of all true sentiments of love and tenderness The queen of Scots in the first effusions of her fondness had taken a pleasure in exalting him beyond measure she had granted him the title of king she had joined his name with her own in all public acts she intended to have procured him from the parliament a matrimonial crown but having leisure afterwards to remark his weakness and vices she began to see the danger of her profuse liberality and was resolved thenceforth to proceed with more reserve in the trust which she should confer upon him His resentment against this prudent conduct served but the more to increase her disgust and the young prince enraged at her imagined neglects pointed his vengeance against every one whom he deemed the cause of this change in her measures and behavior Melvil p sixty three Keith s Append p one hundred seventy six There was in the court one David Rizzio who had of late obtained a very extraordinary degree of confidence and favor with the queen of Scots He was a Piedmontese of mean birth son of a teacher of music himself a musician and finding it difficult to subsist by his art in his own country he had followed into Scotland an ambassador whom the duke of Savoy sent thither to pay his compliments to Mary some time after her first arrival He possessed a good ear and a tolerable voice and as that princess found him useful to complete her band of music she retained him in her service after the departure of his master Her secretary for French despatches having some time after incurred her displeasure she promoted Rizzio to that office which gave him frequent opportunities of approaching her person and insinuating himself into her favor He was shrewd and sensible as well as aspiring much beyond his rank and education and he made so good use of the access which fortune had procured him that he was soon regarded as the chief confidant and even minister of the queen He was consulted on all occasions no favors could be obtained but by his intercession all suitors were obliged to gain him by presents and flattery and the man insolent from his new exaltation as well as rapacious in his acquisitions soon drew on himself the hatred of the nobility and of the whole kingdom He had at first employed his credit to promote Darnley s marriage and a firm friendship seemed to be established between them but on the subsequent change of the queen s sentiments it was easy for Henry s friends to persuade him that Rizzio was the real author of her indifference and even to rouse in his mind jealousies of a more dangerous nature The favorite was of a disagreeable figure but was not past his youth eight and though the opinion of his criminal correspondence with Mary might seem of itself unreasonable if not absurd a suspicious husband could find no other means of accounting for that lavish and imprudent kindness with which she honored him Keith p two hundred eighty two three hundred two Crawford s Memoirs p five Spotswood p one hundred ninety three See note H at the end of the volume The rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics who could admit of no freedoms contributed to spread this opinion among the people and as Rizzio was universally believed to be a pensionary of the pope s and to be deeply engaged in all schemes against the Protestants any story to his and Mary s disadvantage received an easy credit among the zealots of that communion Rizzio who had connected his interests with the Roman Catholics was the declared enemy of the banished lords and by promoting the violent prosecutions against them he had exposed himself to the animosity of their numerous friends and retainers A scheme was also thought to be formed for revoking some exorbitant grants made during the queen s minority and even the nobility who had seized the ecclesiastical benefices began to think themselves less secure in the possession of them The earl of Morton chancellor was affected by all these considerations and still more by a rumor spread abroad that Mary intended to appoint Rizzio chancellor in his place and to bestow that dignity on a mean and upstart foreigner ignorant of the laws and language of the country So indiscreet had this princess been in her kindness to Rizzio that even that strange report met with credit and proved a great means of accelerating the ruin of the favorite Morton insinuating himself into Henry s confidence employed all his art to inflame the discontent and jealousy of that prince and he persuaded him that the only means of freeing himself from the indignities under which he labored was to bring the base stranger to the fate which he had so well merited and which was so passionately desired by the whole nation George Douglas natural brother to the countess of Lenox concurred in the same advice and the Lords Ruthven and Lindesey being consulted offered their assistance in the enterprise nor was even the earl of Lenox the king s father averse to the design But as these conspirators were well acquainted with Henry s levity they engaged him to sign a paper in which he avowed the undertaking as tending to the glory of God and advancement of religion and promised to protect them against every consequence which might ensue upon the assassination of Rizzio All these measures being concerted a messenger was despatched to the banished lords who were hovering near the borders and they were invited by the king to return to their native country Keith p three hundred twenty six Melvil p sixty four Buchanan lib xvii c sixty Crawford p six Spotswood p one hundred ninety four Knox p three hundred ninety three Jebb vol i p four

execution Mary who was in the sixth month of her pregnancy was supping in private and had at table the countess of Argyle her natural sister with Rizzio and others of her servants The king entered the room by a private passage and stood at the back of Mary s chair Lord Ruthven George Douglas and other conspirators being all armed rushed in after him and the queen of Scots terrified with the appearance demanded of them the reason of this rude intrusion They told her that they intended no violence against her person but meant only to bring that villain pointing to Rizzio to his deserved punishment Rizzio aware of the danger ran behind his mistress and seizing her by the waist called aloud to her for protection while she interposed in his behalf with cries and menaces and entreaties The impatient assassins regardless of her efforts rushed upon their prey and by overturning every thing which stood in their way increased the horror and confusion of the scene Douglas seizing Henry s dagger stuck it in the body of Rizzio who screaming with fear and agony was torn from Mary by the other conspirators and pushed into the ante chamber where he was despatched with fifty six wounds Melvil p sixty four Keith p three hundred thirty three hundred thirty one Crawford p nine The unhappy princess informed of his fate immediately dried her tears and said she would weep no more she would now think of revenge The insult indeed upon her person the stain attempted to be fixed on her honor the danger to which her life was exposed on account of her pregnancy were injuries so atrocious and so complicated that they scarcely left room for pardon even from the greatest lenity and mercy The assassins apprehensive of Mary s resentment detained her prisoner in the palace and the king dismissed all who seemed willing to attempt her rescue by telling them that nothing was done without his orders and that he would be careful of the queen s safety Murray and the banished lords appeared two days after and Mary whose anger was now engrossed by injuries more recent and violent was willingly reconciled to them and she even received her brother with tenderness and affection They obtained an acquittal from parliament and were reinstated in their honors and fortunes The accomplices also in Rizzio s murder applied to her for a pardon but she artfully delayed compliance and persuaded them that so long as she was detained in custody and was surrounded by guards any deed which she should sign would have no validity Meanwhile she had gained the confidence of her husband by her persuasion and caresses and no sooner were the guards withdrawn than she engaged him to escape with her in the night time and take shelter in Dunbar Many of her subjects here offered her their services and Mary having collected an army which the conspirators had no power to resist advanced to Edinburgh and obliged them to fly into England where they lived in great poverty and distress They made applications however to the earl of Bothwell a new favorite of Mary s and that nobleman desirous of strengthening his party by the accession of their interest was able to pacify her resentment and he soon after procured them liberty to return into their own country The vengeance of the queen of Scots was implacable against her husband alone whose person was before disagreeable to her and who by his violation of every tie of gratitude and duty had now drawn on him her highest resentment She engaged him to disown all connections with the assassins to deny any concurrence in their crime even to publish a proclamation containing a falsehood so notorious to the whole world and having thus made him expose himself to universal contempt and rendered it impracticable for him ever to acquire the confidence of any party she threw him off with disdain and indignation Melvil p seventy five seventy six Keith p three hundred thirty four Knox p three hundred ninety eight Goodall vol i p two hundred eighty Keith Append p one hundred sixty seven Melvil p sixty six sixty seven As if she had been making an escape from him she suddenly withdrew to Allca a seat of the earl of Marre s and when Henry followed her thither she suddenly returned to Edinburgh and give him every where the strongest proofs of displeasure and even of antipathy She encouraged her courtiers in their neglect of him and she was pleased that his mean equipage and small train of attendants should draw on him the contempt of the very populace He was permitted however to have apartments in the Castle of Edinburgh which Mary had chosen for the place of her delivery She there brought forth a son and as this was very important news to England as well as to Scotland she immediately despatched Sir James Melvil to carry intelligence of the happy event to Elizabeth Melvil tells us that this princess the evening of his arrival in London had given a ball to her court at Greenwich and was displaying all that spirit and alacrity which usually attended her on these occasions but when news arrived of the prince of Scotland s birth all her joy was damped she sunk into melancholy she reclined her head upon her arm and complained to some of her attendants that the queen of Scots was mother of a fair son while she herself was but a barren stock Next day however at the reception of the ambassador she resumed her former dissimulation put on a joyful countenance gave Melvil thanks for the haste he had made in conveying to her the agreeable intelligence and expressed the utmost cordiality and friendship to her sister Some time after she despatched the earl of Bedford with her kinsman George Gary son of Lord Hunsdon in order to officiate at the baptism of the young prince and she sent by them some magnificent presents to the queen of Scots The birth of a son gave additional zeal to Mary s partisans in England and even men of the most opposite parties began to cry aloud for some settlement of the succession These humors broke out with great vehemence in a new session of parliament held after six prorogations The house of peers which had hitherto forborne to touch on this delicate point here took the lead and the house of commons soon after imitated the zeal of the lords Molineux opened the matter in the lower house and proposed that the question of the succession and that of supply should go hand in hand as if it were intended to constrain the queen to a compliance with the request of her parliament The courtiers endeavored to elude the debate Sir Ralph Sadler told the house that he had heard the queen positively affirm that for the good of her people she was determined to marry Secretary Cecil and Sir Francis Knollys gave their testimony to the same purpose as did also Sir Ambrose Cave chancellor of the duchy and Sir Edward Rogers comptroller of the household Melvil p sixty nine seventy Camden p three hundred ninety seven D Ewes p one hundred twenty nine D Ewes p one hundred twenty four Elizabeth s ambitious and masculine character was so well known that few members gave any credit to this intelligence and it was considered merely as an artifice by which she endeavored to retract that positive declaration which she had made in the beginning of her reign that she meant to live and die a virgin The ministers therefore gained nothing further by this piece of policy than only to engage the house for the sake of decency to join the question of the queen s marriage with that of a settlement of the crown and the commons were proceeding with great earnestness in the debate and had even appointed a committee to confer with the lords when express orders were brought them from Elizabeth not to proceed further in the matter Cecil told them that she pledged to the house the word of a queen for her sincerity in her intentions to marry that the appointment of a successor would be attended with great danger to her person that she herself had had experience during the reign of her sister how much court was usually paid to the next heir and what dangerous sacrifices men were commonly disposed to make of their present duty to their future prospects and that she was therefore determined to delay till a more proper opportunity the decision of that important question The house was not satisfied with these reasons and still less with the command prohibiting them all debate on the subject Paul Wentworth a spirited member went so far as to question whether such a prohibition were not an infringement of the liberties and privileges of the house Some even ventured to violate that profound respect which had hitherto been preserved to the queen and they affirmed that she was bound in duty not only to provide for the happiness of her subjects during her own life but also to pay regard to their future security by fixing a successor that by an opposite conduct she showed herself the step mother not the natural parent of her people and would seem desirous that England should no longer subsist than she should enjoy the glory and satisfaction of governing it that none but timorous princes or tyrants or faint hearted women ever stood in fear of their successors and that the affections of the people were a firm and impregnable rampart to every sovereign who laying aside all artifice or by ends had courage and magnanimity to put his sole trust in that honorable and sure defence The queen hearing of these debates sent for the speaker and after reiterating her former prohibition she bade him inform the house that if any member remained still unsatisfied he might appear before the privy council and there give his reasons D Ewes p one hundred twenty seven one hundred twenty eight D Ewes p one hundred twenty eight Camden p four hundred D Ewes p one hundred twenty eight As the members showed a disposition notwithstanding these peremptory orders still to proceed upon the question Elizabeth thought proper by a message to revoke them and to allow the house liberty of debate They were so mollified by this gracious condescension that they thenceforth conducted the matter with more calmness and temper and they even voted her a supply to be levied at three payments of a subsidy and a fifteenth without annexing any condition to it The queen soon after dissolved the parliament and told them with some sharpness in the conclusion that their proceedings had contained much dissimulation and artifice that under the plausible pretences of marriage and succession many of them covered very malevolent intentions towards her but that however she reaped this advantage from the attempts of these men that she could now distinguish her friends from her enemies But do you think added she that I am unmindful of your future security or will be negligent in settling the succession That is the chief object of my concern as I know myself to be liable to mortality Or do you apprehend that I meant to encroach on your liberties No it was never my meaning I only intended to stop you before you approached the precipice All things have their time and though you maybe blessed with a sovereign more wise or more learned than I yet I assure you that no one will ever rule over you who shall be more careful of your safety And therefore henceforward whether I live to see the like assembly or no or whoever holds the reins of government let me warn you to beware of provoking your sovereign s patience so far as you have done mine But I shall now conclude that notwithstanding the disgusts I have received for I mean not to part with you in anger the greater part of you may assure themselves that they go home in their prince s good graces Elizabeth carried further her dignity on this occasion She had received the subsidy without any condition but as it was believed that the commons had given her that gratuity with a view of engaging her to yield to their requests she thought proper on her refusal voluntarily to remit the third payment and she said that money in her subjects purses was as good to her as in her own exchequer D Ewes p one hundred thirty D Ewes p one hundred sixteen one hundred seventeen J Camden p four hundred But though the queen was able to elude for the present the applications of parliament the friends of the queen of Scots multiplied every day in England and besides the Catholics many of whom kept a treasonable correspondence with her and were ready to rise at her command the court itself of Elizabeth was full of her avowed partisans The duke of Norfolk the earls of Leicester Pembroke Bedford Northumberland Sir Nicholas Throgmorton and most of the considerable men in England except Cecil seemed convinced of the necessity of declaring her the successor None but the more zealous Protestants adhered either to the countess of Hertford or to her aunt Eleanor countess of Cumberland and as the marriage of the former seemed liable to some objections and had been declared invalid men were alarmed even on that side with the prospect of new disputes concerning the succession Mary s behavior also so moderate towards the Protestants and so gracious towards all men had procured her universal respect and the public was willing to ascribe any imprudences into which she had fallen to her youth and inexperience But all these flattering prospects were blasted by the subsequent incidents where her egregious indiscretions shall I say or atrocious crimes threw her from the height of her prosperity and involved her in infamy and in ruin The earl of Bothwell was of a considerable family and power in Scotland and though not distinguished by any talents either of a civil or military nature he had made a figure in that party which opposed the greatness of the earl of Murray and the more rigid reformers He was a man of profligate manners had involved his opulent fortune in great debts and even reduced himself to beggary by his profuse expenses and seemed to have no resource but in desperate counsels and enterprises Haynes p four hundred forty six four hundred forty eight Melvil p fifty three sixty one seventy four Keith p two hundred forty He had been accused more than once of an attempt to assassinate Murray and though the frequency of these accusations on all sides diminish somewhat the credit due to any particular imputation they prove sufficiently the prevalence of that detestable practice in Scotland and may in that view serve to render such rumors the more credible This man had of late acquired the favor and entire confidence of Mary and all her measures were directed by his advice and authority Reports were spread of more particular intimacies between them and these reports gained ground from the continuance or rather increase of her hatred towards her husband That young prince was reduced to such a state of desperation by the neglects which he underwent from his queen and the courtiers that he had once resolved to fly secretly into France or Spain and had even provided a vessel for that purpose Some of the most considerable nobility on the other hand observing her rooted aversion to him had proposed some expedients for a divorce and though Mary is said to have spoken honorably on the occasion and to have embraced the proposal no further than it should be found consistent with her own honor and her son s legitimacy men were inclined to believe that the difficulty of finding proper means for effecting that purpose was the real cause of laying aside all further thoughts of it So far were the suspicions against her carried that when Henry discouraged with the continual proofs of her hatred left the court and retired to Glasgow an illness of an extraordinary nature with which he was seized immediately on his arrival in that place was universally ascribed by her enemies to a dose of poison which it was pretended she had administered to him Melvil p sixty six seventy seven Keith p three hundred forty five three hundred forty eight Camden p four hundred four Goodall s Queen Mary vol ii p three hundred seventeen While affairs were in this situation all those who wished well to her character or to public tranquillity were extremely pleased and somewhat surprised to hear that a friendship was again conciliated between them that she had taken a journey to Glasgow on purpose to visit him during his sickness that she behaved towards him with great tenderness that she had brought him along with her and that she appeared thenceforth determined to live with him on a footing more suitable to the connections between them Henry naturally uxorious and not distrusting this sudden reconciliation put himself implicitly into her hands and attended her to Edinburgh She lived in the palace of Holyrood House but as the situation of the palace was low and the concourse of people about the court was necessarily attended with noise which might disturb him in his present infirm state of health these reasons were assigned for fitting up an apartment for him in a solitary house at some distance called the Kirk of Field Mary here gave him marks of kindness and attachment she conversed cordially with him and she lay some nights in a room below his but on the ninth of February she told him that she would pass that night in the palace because the marriage of one of her servants was there to be celebrated in her presence About two o clock in the morning the whole town was much alarmed at hearing a great noise and was still more astonished when it was discovered that the noise came from the king s house which was blown up by gunpowder that his dead body was found at some distance in a neighboring field and that no marks either of fire contusion or violence appeared upon it No doubt could be entertained but Henry was murdered and general conjecture soon pointed towards the earl of Bothwell as the author of the crime But as his favor with Mary was visible and his power great no one ventured to declare openly his sentiments and all men remained in silence and mute astonishment Voices however were heard in the streets during the darkness of the night proclaiming Bothwell and even Mary herself to be murderers of the king bills were secretly affixed on the walls to the same purpose offers were made that upon giving proper securities his guilt should be openly proved but after one proclamation from the court offering a reward and indemnity to any one that would discover the author of that villany greater vigilance was employed in searching out the spreaders of the libels and reports against Bothwell and the queen than in tracing the contrivers of the king s assassination or detecting the regicides The earl of Lenox who lived at a distance from court in poverty and contempt was roused by the report of his son s murder and wrote to the queen imploring speedy justice against the assassins among whom he named the earl of Bothwell Sir James Balfour and Gilbert Balfour his brother David Chalmers and four others of the queen s household all of them persons who had been mentioned in the bills affixed to the walls at Edinburgh It was imagined that Henry had been strangled before the house was blown up But this supposition is contradicted by the confession of the criminals and there is no necessity to admit it in order to account for the condition of his body There are many instances that men s lives have been saved who had been blown up in ships Had Henry fallen on water he had not probably been killed Melvil p seventy eight Cabbala p one hundred

for the examination of this important affair she sent a citation to Lenox requiring him to appear in court and prove his charge against Bothwell This nobleman meanwhile and all the other persons accused by Lenox enjoyed their full liberty Bothwell himself was continually surrounded with armed men took his place in council lived during some time in the house with Mary v and seemed to possess all his wonted confidence and familiarity with her Even the Castle of Edinburgh a place of great consequence in this critical time was intrusted to him and under him to his creature Sir James Balfour who had himself been publicly charged as an accomplice in the king s murder v Lenox who had come as far as Stirling with a view of appearing at the trial was informed of all these circumstances and reflecting on the small train which attended him he began to entertain very just apprehensions from the power insolence and temerity of his enemy He wrote to Mary desiring that the day of trial might be prorogued and conjured her by all the regard which she bore to her own honor to employ more leisure and deliberation in determining a question of such extreme moment v No regard was paid to his application the jury was enclosed of which the earl of Caithness was chancellor and though Lenox foreseeing this precipitation had ordered Cunningham one of his retinue to appear in court and protest in his name against the acquittal of the criminal the jury proceeded to a verdict v The verdict was such as it behoved them to give where neither accuser nor witness appeared and Bothwell was absolved from the king s murder The jury however apprehensive that their verdict would give great scandal and perhaps expose them afterwards to some danger entered a protest in which they represented the necessity of their proceedings v Keith p three hundred seventy three Keith p three hundred seventy four three hundred seventy five Keith p four hundred five Anderson vol i p thirty eight forty fifty

p one hundred six Spotswood p two hundred one v Spotswood p two hundred one Anderson vol i p one hundred thirteen It is remarkable that the indictment was laid against Bothwell for committing the crime on the ninth of February not the tenth the real day on which Henry was assassinated The interpretation generally put upon this error too gross it was thought to have proceeded from mistake was that the secret council by whom Mary was governed not trusting entirely to precipitation violence and authority had provided this plea by which they insured at all adventures a plausible pretence for acquitting Bothwell Two days after this extraordinary transaction a parliament was held and though the verdict in favor of Bothwell was attended with such circumstances as strongly confirmed rather than diminished the general opinion of his guilt he was the person chosen to carry the royal sceptre on the first meeting of that national assembly In this parliament a rigorous act was made against those who set up defamatory bills but no notice was taken of the king s murder The favor which Mary openly bore to Bothwell kept every one in awe and the effects of this terror appeared more plainly in another transaction which ensued immediately upon the dissolution of the parliament A bond or association was framed in which the subscribers after relating the acquittal of Bothwell by a legal trial and mentioning a further offer which he had made to prove his innocence by single combat oblige themselves in case any person should afterwards impute to him the king s murder to defend him with their whole power against such calumniators After this promise which implied no great assurance in Bothwell of his own innocence the subscribers mentioned the necessity of their queen s marriage in order to support the government and they recommended Bothwell to her as a husband This paper was subscribed by all the considerable nobility there present In a country divided by violent factions such a concurrence in favor of one nobleman nowise distinguished above the rest except by his flagitious conduct could never have been obtained had not every one been certain at least firmly persuaded that Mary was fully determined on this measure v nine Nor would such a motive have sufficed to influence men commonly so stubborn and untractable had they not been taken by surprise been ignorant of each other s sentiments and overawed by the present power of the court and by the apprehensions of further violence from persons so little governed by any principles of honor and humanity Even with all these circumstances the subscription to this paper may justly be regarded as a reproach to the nation Keith p three hundred seventy five Anderson vol ii p ninety three Spotswood p two hundred one Keith p seventy eight Crawford p fourteen Keith p three hundred eighty nine Keith p three hundred eighty one v See note I at the end of the volume The subsequent measures of Bothwell were equally precipitate and audacious Mary having gone to Stirling to pay a visit to her son he assembled a body of eight hundred horse on pretence of pursuing some robbers on the borders and having waylaid her on her return he seized her person near Edinburgh and carried her to Dunbar with an avowed design of forcing her to yield to his purpose Sir James Melvil one of her retinue was carried along with her and says not that he saw any signs of reluctance or constraint he was even informed as he tells us by Bothwell s officers that the whole transaction was managed in concert with her A woman indeed of that spirit and resolution which is acknowledged to belong to Mary does not usually on these occasions give such marks of opposition to real violence as can appear any wise doubtful or ambiguous Some of the nobility however in order to put matters to further trial sent her a private message in which they told her that if in reality she lay under force they would use all their efforts to rescue her Her answer was that she had indeed been carried to Dunbar by violence but ever since her arrival had been so well treated that she willingly remained with Bothwell No one gave himself thenceforth any concern to relieve her from a captivity which was believed to proceed entirely from her own approbation and connivance This unusual conduct was at first ascribed to Mary s sense of the infamy attending her purposed marriage and her desire of finding some color to gloss over the irregularity of her conduct But a pardon given to Bothwell a few days after made the public carry their conjectures somewhat further In this deed Bothwell received a pardon for the violence committed on the queen s person and for all other crimes a clause by which the murder of the king was indirectly forgiven The rape was then conjectured to have been only a contrivance in order to afford a pretence for indirectly remitting a crime of which it would have appeared scandalous to make openly any mention Melvil p eighty Spotswood p two hundred two Anderson vol iv part ii p sixty one These events passed with such rapidity that men had no leisure to admire sufficiently one incident when they were surprised with a new one equally rare and uncommon There still however remained one difficulty which it was not easy to foresee how the queen and Bothwell determined as they were to execute their shameful purpose could find expedients to overcome The man who had procured the subscription of the nobility recommending him as a husband to the queen and who had acted this seeming violence on her person in order to force her consent had been married two years before to another woman to a woman of merit of a noble family sister to the earl of Huntley But persons blinded by passion and infatuated with crime soon shake off all appearance of decency A suit was commenced for a divorce between Bothwell and his wife and this suit was opened at the same instant in two different or rather opposite courts in the court of the archbishop of saint Andrew s which was Popish and governed itself by the canon law and in the new consistorial or commissariot court which was Protestant and was regulated by the principles of the reformed teachers The plea advanced in each court was so calculated as to suit the principles which there prevailed in the archbishop s court the pretence of consanguinity was employed because Bothwell was related to his wife in the fourth degree in the commissariot court the accusation of adultery was made use of against him The parties too who applied for the divorce were different in the different courts Bothwell was the person who sued in the former his wife in the latter And the suit in both courts was opened pleaded examined and decided with the utmost precipitation and a sentence of divorce was pronounced in four days Anderson vol ii p two hundred eighty The divorce being thus obtained it was thought proper that Mary should be conducted to Edinburgh and should there appear before the courts of judicature and should acknowledge herself restored to entire freedom This was understood to be contrived in a view of obviating all doubts with regard to the validity of her marriage Orders were then given to publish in the church the banns between the queen and the duke of Orkney for that was the title which he now bore and Craig a minister of Edinburgh was applied to for that purpose This clergyman not content with having refused compliance publicly in his sermons condemned the marriage and exhorted all who had access to the queen to give her their advice against so scandalous an alliance Being called before the council to answer for this liberty he showed a courage which might cover all the nobles with shame on account of their tameness and servility He said that by the rules of the church the earl of Bothwell being convicted of adultery could not be permitted to marry that the divorce between him and his former wife was plainly procured by collusion as appeared by the precipitation of the sentence and the sudden conclusion of his marriage with the queen and that all the suspicions which prevailed with regard to the king s murder and the queen s concurrence in the former rape would thence receive undoubted confirmation He therefore exhorted Bothwell who was present no longer to persevere in his present criminal enterprises and turning his discourse to the other counsellors he charged them to employ all their influence with the queen in order to divert her from a measure which would load her with eternal infamy and dishonor Not satisfied even with this admonition he took the first opportunity of informing the public from the pulpit of the whole transaction and expressed to them his fears that notwithstanding all remonstrances their sovereign was still obstinately bent on her fatal purpose For himself he said he had already discharged his conscience and yet again would take heaven and earth to witness that he abhorred and detested that marriage as scandalous and hateful in the sight of mankind but since the great as he perceived either by their flattery or silence gave countenance to the measure he besought the faithful to pray fervently to the Almighty that a resolution taken contrary to all law reason and good conscience might by the divine blessing be turned to the comfort and benefit of the church and kingdom These speeches offended the court extremely and Craig was anew summoned before the council to answer for his temerity in thus passing the bounds of his commission But he told them that the bounds of his commission were the word of God good laws and natural reason and were the Queen s marriage tried by any of these standards it would appear infamous and dishonorable and would so be esteemed by the whole world The council were so overawed by this heroic behavior in a private clergyman that they dismissed him without further censure or punishment Spotswood p two hundred three Anderson vol ii p two hundred eighty But though this transaction might have recalled Bothwell and the queen of Scots from their infatuation and might have instructed them in the dispositions of the people as well as in their own inability to oppose them they were still resolute to rush forward to their own manifest destruction The marriage was solemnized by the bishop of Orkney a Protestant who was afterwards deposed by the church for this scandalous compliance Few of the nobility appeared at the ceremony they had most of them either from shame or fear retired to their own houses The French ambassador Le Croc an aged gentleman of honor and character could not be prevailed on though a dependent of the house of Guise to countenance the marriage by his presence Elizabeth remonstrated by friendly letters and messages against the marriage The court of France made like opposition but Mary though on all other occasions she was extremely obsequious to the advice of her relations in that country was here determined to pay no regard to their opinion The news of these transactions being carried to foreign countries filled Europe with amazement and threw infamy not only on the principal actors in them but also on the whole nation who seemed by their submission and silence and even by their declared approbation to give their sanction to these scandalous practices The Scots who resided abroad met with such reproaches that they durst nowhere appear in public and they earnestly exhorted their countrymen at home to free them from the public odium by bringing to condign punishment the authors of such atrocious crimes This intelligence with a little more leisure for reflection roused men from their lethargy and the rumors which from the very beginning had been spread against Mary as if she had concurred in the king s murder seemed now by the subsequent transactions to have received a strong confirmation and authority Spotswood p two

sufficient not only to beget suspicion but to produce entire conviction against her that her sudden resolution of being reconciled to her husband whom before she had long and justly hated her bringing him to court from which she had banished him by neglects and rigors her fitting up separate apartments for him were all of them circumstances which though trivial in themselves yet being compared with the subsequent events bore a very unfavorable aspect for her that the least which after the king s murder might have been expected in her situation was a more than usual caution in her measures and an extreme anxiety to punish the real assassins in order to free herself from all reproach and suspicion that no woman who had any regard to her character would allow a man publicly accused of her husband s murder so much as to approach her presence far less give him a share in her councils and endow him with favor and authority that an acquittal merely in the absence of accusers was very ill fitted to satisfy the public especially if that absence proceeded from a designed precipitation of the sentence and from the terror which her known friendship for the criminal had infused into every one that the very mention of her marriage to such a person in such circumstances was horrible and the contrivances of extorting a consent from the nobility and of concerting a rape were gross artifices more proper to discover her guilt than prove her innocence that where a woman thus shows a consciousness of merited reproach and instead of correcting provides only thin glosses to cover her exceptionable conduct she betrays a neglect of fame which must either be the effect or the cause of the most shameful enormities that to espouse a man who had a few days before been so scandalously divorced from his wife who to say the least was believed to have a few months before assassinated her husband was so contrary to the plainest rules of behavior that no pretence of indiscretion or imprudence could account for such a conduct that a woman who so soon after her husband s death though not attended with any extraordinary circumstances contracts a marriage which might in itself be the most blameless cannot escape severe censure but one who overlooks for her pleasure so many other weighty considerations was equally capable in gratifying her appetites to neglect every regard to honor and humanity that Mary was not ignorant of the prevailing opinion of the public with regard to her own guilt and of the inferences which would every where be drawn from her conduct and therefore if she still continued to pursue measures which gave such just offence she ratified by her actions as much as she could by the most formal confession all the surmises and imputations of her enemies that a prince was here murdered in the face of the world Bothwell alone was suspected and accused if he were innocent nothing could absolve him either in Mary s eyes or those of the public but the detection and conviction of the real assassin yet no inquiry was made to that purpose though a parliament had been assembled the sovereign and wife was here plainly silent from guilt the people from terror that the only circumstance which opposed all these presumptions or rather proofs was the benignity and goodness of her preceding behavior which seemed to remove her from all suspicions of such atrocious inhumanity but that the characters of men were extremely variable and persons guilty of the worst actions were not always naturally of the worst and most criminal dispositions that a woman who in a critical and dangerous moment had sacrificed her honor to a man of abandoned principles might thenceforth be led blindfold by him to the commission of the most enormous crimes and was in reality no longer at her own disposal and that though one supposition was still left to alleviate her blame namely that Bothwell presuming on her affection towards him had of himself committed the crime and had never communicated it to her yet such a sudden and passionate love to a man whom she had long known could not easily be accounted for without supposing some degree of preceding guilt and as it appeared that she was not afterwards restrained either by shame or prudence from incurring the highest reproach and danger it was not likely that a sense of duty or humanity would have a more powerful influence over her These were the sentiments which prevailed throughout Scotland and as the Protestant teachers who had great authority had long borne an animosity to Mary the opinion of her guilt was by that means the more widely diffused and made the deeper impression on the people Some attempts made by Bothwell and as is pretended with her consent to get the young prince into his power excited the most serious attention and the principal nobility even many of those who had formerly been constrained to sign the application in favor of Bothwells marriage met at Stirling and formed an association for protecting the prince and punishing the king s murderers Keith p three hundred ninety four The earl of Athole himself a known Catholic was the first author of this confederacy the earls of Argyle Morton Marre Glencairne the lords Boyd Lindesey Hume Semple Kirkaldy of Grange Tulibardine and Secretary Lidington entered zealously into it The earl of Murray foreseeing such turbulent times and being desirous to keep free of these dangerous factions had some time before desired and obtained Mary s permission to retire into France Lord Hume was first in arms and leading a body of eight hundred horse suddenly environed the queen of Scots and Bothwell in the Castle of Borthwick They found means of making their escape to Dunbar while the confederate lords were assembling their troops at Edinburgh and taking measures to effect their purpose Had Bothwell been so prudent as to keep within the fortress of Dunbar his enemies must have dispersed for want of pay and subsistence but hearing that the associated lords were fallen into distress he was so rash as to take the field and advance towards them The armies met at Carberry Hill about six miles from Edinburgh and Mary soon became sensible that her own troops disapproved of her cause and were averse to spill their blood in the quarrel After some bravadoes of Bothwell where he discovered very little courage she saw no resource but that of holding a conference with Kirkaldy of Grange and of putting herself upon some general promises into the hands of the confederates She was conducted to Edinburgh amidst the insults of the populace who reproached her with her crimes and even held before her eyes which way soever she turned a banner on which were painted the murder of her husband and the distress of her infant son Mary overwhelmed with her calamities had recourse to tears and lamentations Meanwhile Bothwell during her conference with Grange fled unattended to Dunbar and fitting out a few small ships set sail for the Orkneys where he subsisted during some time by piracy He was pursued thither by Grange and his ship was taken with several of his servants who afterwards discovered all the circumstances of the king s murder and were punished for the crime Bothwell himself escaped in a boat and found means to get a passage to Denmark where he was thrown into prison lost his senses and died miserably about ten years after an end worthy of his flagitious conduct and behavior Keith p four hundred two Spotswood p two hundred seven Melvil p eighty three eighty four Anderson vol ii p one hundred sixty five one hundred sixty six et cetera The queen of Scots now in the hands of an enraged faction met with such treatment as a sovereign may naturally expect from subjects who have their future security to provide for as well as their present animosity to gratify It is pretended that she behaved with a spirit very little suitable to her condition avowed her inviolable attachment to Bothwell and even wrote him a letter which the lords intercepted wherein she declared that she would endure any extremity nay resign her dignity and crown itself rather than relinquish his affections The malecontents finding the danger to which they were exposed in case Mary should finally prevail thought themselves obliged to proceed with rigor against her and they sent her next day under a guard to the Castle of Lochlevin situated in a lake of that name The mistress of the house was mother to the earl of Murray and as she pretended to have been lawfully married to the late king of Scots she naturally bore an animosity to Mary and treated her with the utmost harshness and severity Keith p four hundred nineteen Melvil p eighty four Elizabeth who was fully informed of all those incidents seemed touched with compassion towards the unfortunate queen and all her fears and jealousies being now laid asleep by the consideration of that ruin and infamy in which Mary s conduct had involved her she began to reflect on the instability of human affairs the precarious state of royal grandeur the danger of encouraging rebellious subjects and she resolved to employ her authority for alleviating the calamities of her unhappy kinswoman She sent Sir Nicholas Throgmorton ambassador to Scotland in order to remonstrate both with Mary and the associated lords and she gave him instructions which though mixed with some lofty pretensions were full of that good sense which was so natural to her and of that generosity which the present interesting conjuncture had called forth She empowered him to declare in her name to Mary that the late conduct of that princess so enormous and in every respect so unjustifiable had given her the highest offence and though she felt the movements of pity towards her she had once determined never to interpose in her affairs either by advice or assistance but to abandon her entirely as a person whose condition was totally desperate and honor irretrievable The reality of this letter appears somewhat disputable chiefly because Murray and his associates never mentioned it in their accusation of her before Queen Elizabeth s commissioners That she was well assured that other foreign princes Mary s near relations had embraced the same resolution but for her part the late events had touched her heart with more tender sympathy and had made her adopt measures more favorable to the liberty and interests of the unhappy queen that she was determined not to see her oppressed by her rebellious subjects but would employ all her good offices and even her power to redeem her from captivity and place her in such a condition as would at once be compatible with her dignity and the safety of her subjects that she conjured her to lay aside all thoughts of revenge except against the murderers of her husband and as she herself was his near relation she was better entitled than the subjects of Mary to interpose her authority on that head and she therefore besought that princess if she had any regard to her own honor and safety not to oppose so just and reasonable a demand that after those two points were provided for her own liberty and the punishment of her husband s assassins the safety of her infant son was next to be considered and there seemed no expedient more proper for that purpose than sending him to be educated in England and that besides the security which would attend his removal from a scene of faction and convulsions there were many other beneficial consequences which it was easy to foresee as the result of his education in that country Keith p four hundred eleven four hundred twelve et cetera The remonstrances which Throgmorton was instructed to make to the associated lords were entirely conformable to these sentiments which Elizabeth entertained in Mary s favor She empowered him to tell them that whatever blame she might throw on Mary s conduct any opposition to their sovereign was totally unjustifiable and incompatible with all order and good government that it belonged not to them to reform much less to punish the maleadministration of their prince and the only arms which subjects could in any case lawfully employ against the supreme authority were entreaties counsels and representations that if these expedients failed they were next to appeal by their prayers to Heaven and to wait with patience till the Almighty in whose hands are the hearts of princes should be pleased to turn them to justice and to mercy That she inculcated not this doctrine because she herself was interested in its observance but because it was universally received in all well governed states and was essential to the preservation of civil society that she required them to restore their queen to liberty and promised in that case to concur with them in all proper expedients for regulating the government for punishing the king s murderers and for guarding the life and liberty of the infant prince and that if the services which she had lately rendered the Scottish nation in protecting them from foreign usurpation were duly considered by them they would repose confidence in her good offices and would esteem themselves blameworthy in having hitherto made no application to her Elizabeth besides these remonstrances sent by Throgmorton some articles of accommodation which he was to propose to both parties as expedients for the settlement of public affairs and though these articles contained some important restraints on the sovereign power they were in the main calculated for Mary s advantage and were sufficiently indulgent to her The associated lords who determined to proceed with greater severity were apprehensive of Elizabeth s partiality and being sensible that Mary would take courage from the protection of that powerful princess they thought proper after several affected delays to refuse the English ambassador all access to her There were four different schemes proposed in Scotland for the treatment of the captive queen one that she should be restored to her authority under very strict limitations the second that she should be obliged to resign her crown to the prince be banished the kingdom and be confined either to France or England with assurances from the sovereign in whose dominions she should reside that she should make no attempts to the disturbance of the established government the third that she should be publicly tried for her crimes of which her enemies pretended to have undoubted proof and be sentenced to perpetual imprisonment the fourth was still more severe and required that after her trial and condemnation capital punishment should be inflicted upon her Throgmorton supported the mildest proposal but though he promised his mistress s guaranty for the performance of articles threatened the ruling party with immediate vengeance in case of refusal v and warned them not to draw on themselves by their violence the public reproach which now lay upon their queen he found that excepting Secretary Lidington he had not the good fortune to convince any of the leaders Keith p four hundred fourteen four hundred fifteen four hundred twenty nine Keith p four hundred sixteen Keith p four hundred twenty seven Keith p four hundred twenty v Keith p four hundred twenty eight All counsels seemed to tend towards the more severe expedients and the preachers in particular drawing their examples from the rigorous maxims of the Old Testament which can only be warranted by particular revelations inflamed the minds of the people against their unhappy sovereign There were several pretenders to the regency of the young prince after the intended deposition of Mary The earl of Lenox claimed that authority as grandfather to the prince the duke of Chatelrault who was absent in France had pretensions as next heir to the crown but the greatest number of the associated lords inclined to the earl of Murray in whose capacity they had entire trust and who possessed the confidence of the preachers and more zealous reformers All measures being therefore concerted three instruments were sent to Mary by the hands of Lord Lindesey and Sir Robert Melvil by one of which she was to resign the crown in favor of her son by another to appoint Murray regent by the third to name a council which should administer the government till his arrival in Scotland The queen of Scots seeing no prospect of relief lying justly under apprehensions for her life and believing that no deed which she executed during her captivity could be valid was prevailed on after a plentiful effusion of tears to sign these three instruments and she took not the trouble of inspecting any one of them In consequence of this forced resignation the young prince was proclaimed king by the name of James VI He was soon after crowned at Stirling and the earl of Morton took in his name the coronation oath in which a promise to extirpate heresy was not forgotten Some republican pretensions in favor of the people s power were countenanced in this ceremony and a coin was soon after struck on which the famous saying of Trajan was inscribed Pro me si merear in me For me if I deserve it against me Throgmorton had orders from his mistress not to assist at the coronation of the king of Scots v Keith p four hundred twenty two four hundred twenty six Melvil p eighty five Spotswood p two hundred eleven Anderson vol iii p nineteen Keith p four hundred thirty nine four hundred forty Keith p four hundred forty Append p one hundred fifty v Keith p four hundred thirty The council of regency had not long occasion to exercise their authority The earl of Murray arrived from France and took possession of his high office He paid a visit to the captive queen and spoke to her in a manner which better suited her past conduct than her present condition This harsh treatment quite extinguished in her breast any remains of affection towards him Murray proceeded afterwards to break in a more public manner all terms of decency with her He summoned a parliament and that assembly after voting that she was undoubtedly an accomplice in her husband s murder condemned her to imprisonment ratified her demission of the crown and acknowledged her son for king and Murray for regent The regent a man of vigor and abilities employed himself successfully in reducing the kingdom He bribed Sir James Balfour to surrender the Castle of Edinburgh he constrained the garrison of Dunbar to open their gates and he demolished that fortress But though every thing thus bore a favorable aspect to the new government and all men seemed to acquiesce in Murray s authority a violent revolution however necessary can never be effected without great discontents and it was not likely that in a country where the government in its most settled state possessed a very disjointed authority a new establishment should meet with no interruption or disturbance Few considerable men of the nation seemed willing to support Mary so long as Bothwell was present but the removal of that obnoxious nobleman had altered the sentiments of many The duke of Chatelrault being disappointed of the regency bore no good will to Murray and the same sentiments were embraced by all his numerous retainers Several of the nobility finding that others had taken the lead among the associators formed a faction apart and opposed the prevailing power and besides their being moved by some remains of duty and affection towards Mary the malecontent lords observing every thing carried to extremity against her were naturally led to embrace her cause and shelter themselves under her authority All who retained any propensity to the Catholic religion were induced to join this party and even the people in general though they had formerly either detested Mary s crimes or blamed her imprudence were now inclined to compassionate her present situation and lamented that a person possessed of so many amiable accomplishments joined to such high dignity should be treated with such extreme severity Melvil p eighty seven Keith p four hundred forty five Anderson vol ii p two hundred six et seq Buchanan lib xviii c fifty three Animated by all these motives many of the principal nobility now adherents to the queen of Scots met at Hamilton and concerted measures for supporting the cause of that princess While these humors were in fermentation Mary was employed in contrivances for effecting her escape and she engaged by her charms and caresses a young gentleman George Douglas brother to the laird of Lochlevin to assist her in that enterprise She even went so far as to give him hopes of espousing her after her marriage with Bothwell should be dissolved on the plea of force and she proposed this expedient to the regent who rejected it Douglas however persevered in his endeavors to free her from captivity and having all opportunities of access to the house he was at last successful in the undertaking He conveyed her in disguise into a small boat and himself rowed her ashore She hastened to Hamilton and the news of her arrival in that place being immediately spread abroad many of the nobility flocked to her with their forces A bond of association for her defence was signed by the earls of Argyle Huntley Eglington Crawford Cassilis Rothes Montrose Sutherland Erroi nine bishops and nine barons besides many of the most considerable gentry And in a few days an army to the number of six thousand men was assembled under her standard Elizabeth was no sooner informed of Mary s escape than she discovered her resolution of persevering in the same generous and friendly measures which she had hitherto pursued If she had not employed force against the regent during the imprisonment of that princess she had been chiefly withheld by the fear of pushing him to greater extremities against her but she had proposed to the court of France an expedient which though less violent would have been no less effectual for her service she desired that France and England should by concert cut off all commerce with the Scots till they should do justice to their injured sovereign Keith p four hundred seventy five Keith p four hundred sixty three Cabala p one hundred forty one Keith p four hundred sixty two She now despatched Leighton into Scotland to offer both her good offices and the assistance of her forces to Mary but as she apprehended the entrance of French troops into the kingdom she desired that the controversy between the queen of Scots and her subjects might by that princess be referred entirely to her arbitration and that no foreign succors should be introduced into Scotland But Elizabeth had not leisure to exert fully her efforts in favor of Mary The regent made haste to assemble forces and notwithstanding that his army was inferior in number to that of the queen of Scots he took the field against her A battle was fought at Langside near Glasgow which was entirely decisive in favor of the regent and though Murray after his victory stopped the bloodshed yet was the action followed by a total dispersion of the queen s party That unhappy princess fled southwards from the field of battle with great precipitation and came with a few attendants to the borders of England She here deliberated concerning her next measures which would probably prove so important to her future happiness or misery She found it impossible to remain in her own kingdom she had an aversion in her present wretched condition to return into France where she had formerly appeared with so much splendor and she was not besides provided with a vessel which could safely convey her thither the late generous behavior of Elizabeth made her hope for protection and even assistance from that quarter and as the present fears from her domestic enemies were the most urgent she overlooked all other considerations and embraced the resolution of taking shelter in England She embarked on board a fishing boat in Galloway and landed the same day at Workington in Cumberland about thirty miles from Carlisle whence she immediately despatched a messenger to London notifying her arrival desiring leave to visit Elizabeth and craving her protection in consequence of former professions of friendship made her by that princess Elizabeth now found herself in a situation when it was become necessary to take some decisive resolution with regard to her treatment of the queen of Scots and as she had hitherto contrary to the opinion of Cecil attended more to the motives of generosity than of policy she was engaged by that prudent minister to weigh anew all the considerations which occurred in this critical conjuncture Keith p four hundred seventy three in the notes Anderson vol iv p twenty six Jebb s Collection vol i p four hundred twenty Cabala p one hundred forty He represented that the party which had dethroned Mary and had at present assumed the government of Scotland were always attached to the English alliance and were engaged by all the motives of religion and of interest to persevere in their connection with Elizabeth that though Murray and his friends might complain of some unkind usage during their banishment in England they would easily forget these grounds of quarrel when they reflected that Elizabeth was the only ally on whom they could safely rely and that their own queen by her attachment to the Catholic faith and by her other connections excluded them entirely from the friendship of France and even from that of Spain that Mary on the other hand even before her violent breach with her Protestant subjects was in secret entirely governed by the counsels of the house of Guise much more would she implicitly comply with their views when by her own ill conduct the power of that family and of the zealous Catholics was become her sole resource and security that her pretensions to the English crown would render her a dangerous instrument in their hands and were she once able to suppress the Protestants in her own kingdom she would unite the Scottish and English Catholics with those of all foreign states in a confederacy against the religion and government of England that it behoved Elizabeth therefore to proceed with caution in the design of restoring her rival to the throne and to take care both that this enterprise if undertaken should be effected by English forces alone and that full securities should beforehand be provided for the reformers and the reformation in Scotland that above all it was necessary to guard carefully the person of that princess lest finding this unexpected reserve in the English friendship she should suddenly take the resolution of flying into France and should attempt by foreign force to recover possession of her authority that her desperate fortunes and broken reputation fitted her for any attempt and her resentment when she should find herself thus deserted by the queen would concur with her ambition and her bigotry and render her an unrelenting as well as powerful enemy to the English government that if she were once abroad in the hands of enterprising Catholics the attack on England would appear to her as easy as that on Scotland and the only method she must imagine of recovering her native kingdom would be to acquire that crown to which she would deem herself equally entitled that a neutrality in such interesting situations though it might be pretended could never without the most extreme danger be upheld by the queen and the detention of Mary was equally requisite whether the power of England were to be employed in her favor or against her that nothing indeed was more becoming a great prince than generosity yet the suggestions of this noble principle could never without imprudence be consulted in such delicate circumstances as those in which the queen was at present placed where her own safety and the interests of her people were intimately concerned in every resolution which she embraced that though the example of successful rebellion especially in a neighboring country could nowise be agreeable to any sovereign yet Mary s imprudence had been so great perhaps her crimes so enormous that the insurrection of subjects after such provocation could no longer be regarded as a precedent against other princes that it was first necessary for Elizabeth to ascertain in a regular and satisfactory manner the extent of Mary s guilt and thence to determine the degree of protection which she ought to afford her against her discontented subjects that as no glory could surpass that of defending oppressed innocence it was equally infamous to patronize vice and murder on the throne and the contagion of such dishonor would extend itself to all who countenanced or supported it and that if the crimes of the Scottish princess should on inquiry appear as great and certain as was affirmed and believed every measure against her which policy should dictate would thence be justified or if she should be found innocent every enterprise which friendship should inspire would be acknowledged laudable and glorious Agreeably to these views Elizabeth resolved to proceed in a seemingly generous but really cautious manner with the queen of Scots and she immediately sent orders to Lady Scrope sister to the duke of Norfolk a lady who lived in the neighborhood to attend on that princess Soon after she despatched to her Lord Scrope himself warden of the marches and Sir Francis Knolles vice chamberlain They found Mary already lodged in the Castle of Carlisle and after expressing the queen s sympathy with her in her late misfortunes they told her that her request of being allowed to visit their sovereign and of being admitted to her presence could not at present be complied with till she had cleared herself of her husband s murder of which she was so strongly accused Elizabeth could not without dishonor show her any countenance or appear indifferent to the assassination of so near a kinsman Anderson vol iv p fifty four sixty six eighty two eighty three eighty six So unexpected a check threw Mary into tears and the necessity of her situation extorted from her a declaration that she would willingly justify herself to her sister from all imputations and would submit her cause to the arbitration of so good a friend Two days after she sent Lord Herreis to London with a letter to the same purpose This concession which Mary could scarcely avoid without an acknowledgment of guilt was the point expected and desired by Elizabeth she immediately despatched Midlemore to the regent of Scotland requiring him both to desist from the further prosecution of his queen s party and to send some persons to London to justify his conduct with regard to her Murray might justly be startled at receiving a message so violent and imperious but as his domestic enemies were numerous and powerful and England was the sole ally which he could expect among foreign nations he was resolved rather to digest the affront than provoke Elizabeth by a refusal He also considered that though that queen had hitherto appeared partial to Mary many political motives evidently engaged her to support the king s cause in Scotland and it was not to be doubted but so penetrating a princess would in the end discover this interest and would at least afford him a patient and equitable hearing He therefore replied that he would himself take a journey to England attended by other commissioners and would willingly submit the determination of his cause to Elizabeth Lord Herreis now perceived that his mistress had advanced too far in her concessions he endeavored to maintain that Mary could not without diminution of her royal dignity submit to a contest with her rebellious subjects before a foreign prince and he required either present aid from England or liberty for his queen to pass over into France Being pressed however with the former agreement before the English council he again renewed his consent but in a few days he began anew to recoil and it was with some difficulty that he was brought to acquiesce in the first determination These fluctuations which were incessantly renewed showed his visible reluctance to the measures pursued by the court of England Anderson vol iv p ten fifty five eighty seven Anderson vol iv p thirteen sixteen Anderson vol iv p sixteen twenty The queen of Scots discovered no less aversion to the trial proposed and it required all the artifice and prudence of Elizabeth to make her persevere in the agreement to which she had at first consented This latter princess still said to her that she desired not without Mary s consent and approbation to enter into the question and pretended only as a friend to hear her justification that she was confident there would be found no difficulty in refuting all the calumnies of her enemies and even if her apology should fall short of full conviction Elizabeth was determined to support her cause and procure her some reasonable terms of accommodation and that it was never meant that she should be cited to a trial on the accusation of her rebellious subjects but on the contrary that they should be summoned to appear and to justify themselves for their conduct towards her Allured by these plausible professions the queen of Scots agreed to vindicate herself by her own commissioners before commissioners appointed by Elizabeth During these transactions Lord Scrope and Sir Francis Knolles who resided with Mary at Carlisle had leisure to study her character and to make report of it to Elizabeth Unbroken by her misfortunes resolute in her purpose active in her enterprises she aspired to nothing but victory and was determined to endure any extremity to undergo any difficulty and to try every fortune rather than abandon her cause or yield the superiority to her enemies Eloquent insinuating affable she had already convinced all those who approached her of the innocence of her past conduct and as she declared her fixed purpose to require aid of her friends all over Europe and even to have recourse to infidels and barbarians rather than fail of vengeance against her persecutors it was easy to foresee the danger to which her charms her spirit her address if allowed to operate with their full force would expose them The court of England therefore who under pretence of guarding her had already in effect detained her prisoner were determined to watch her with still greater vigilance As Carlisle by its situation on the borders afforded her great opportunities of contriving her escape they removed her to Bolton a seat of Lord Scrope s in Yorkshire and the issue of the controversy between her and the Scottish nation was regarded as a subject more momentous to Elizabeth s security and interests than it had hitherto been apprehended Anderson vol iv p eleven twelve thirteen one hundred nine one hundred ten Anderson vol iv p fifty four seventy one seventy two seventy four seventy eight ninety two The Commissioners appointed by the English court for the examination of this great cause were the duke of Norfolk the earl of Sussex and Sir Ralph Sadler and York was named as the place of conference Lesley bishop of Ross the lords Herreis Levingstone and Boyde with three persons more appeared as commissioners from the queen of Scots The earl of Murray regent the earl of Morton the bishop of Orkney Lord Lindesey and the abbot of Dunfermling were appointed commissioners from the king and kingdom of Scotland Secretary Lidington George Buchanan the famous poet and historian with some others were named as their assistants It was a great circumstance in Elizabeth s glory that she was thus chosen umpire between the factions of a neighboring kingdom which had during many centuries entertained the most violent jealousy and animosity against England and her felicity was equally rare in having the fortunes and fame of so dangerous a rival who had long given her the greatest inquietude now entirely at her disposal Some circumstances of her late conduct had discovered a bias towards the side of Mary her prevailing interests led her to favor the enemies of that princess the professions of impartiality which she had made were open and frequent and she had so far succeeded that each side accused her commissioners of partiality towards their adversaries She herself appears by the instructions given them to have fixed no plan for the decision but she knew that the advantages which she should reap must be great whatever issue the cause might take If Mary s crimes could be ascertained by undoubted proof she could forever blast the reputation of that princess and might justifiably detain her forever a prisoner in England if the evidence fell short of conviction it was intended to restore her to the throne but with such strict limitations as would leave Elizabeth perpetual arbiter of all differences between the parties in Scotland and render her in effect absolute mistress of the kingdom Anderson vol iv part ii p forty Anderson vol iv part ii p fourteen fifteen et cetera Goodall vol ii p one hundred ten Mary s commissioners before they gave in their complaint against her enemies in Scotland entered a protest that their appearance in the cause should nowise affect the independence of her crown or be construed as a mark of subordination to England the English commissioners received this protest but with a reserve to the claim of England The complaint of that princess was next read and contained a detail of the injuries which she had suffered since her marriage with Bothwell that her subjects had taken arms against her on pretence of freeing her from captivity that when she put herself into their hands they had committed her to close custody in Lochlevin had placed her son an infant on her throne had again taken arms against her after her deliverance from prison had rejected all her proposals for accommodation had given battle to her troops and had obliged her for the safety of her person to take shelter in England The earl of Murray in answer to this complaint gave a summary and imperfect account of the late transactions that the earl of Bothwell the known murderer of the late king had a little after committing that crime seized the person of the queen and led her to Dunbar that he acquired such influence over her as to gain her consent to marry him and he had accordingly procured a divorce from his former wife and had pretended to celebrate his nuptials with the queen that the scandal of this transaction the dishonor which it brought on the nation the danger to which the infant prince was exposed from the attempts of that audacious man had obliged the nobility to take arms and oppose his criminal enterprises that after Mary in order to save him had thrown herself into their hands she still discovered such a violent attachment to him that they found it necessary for their own and the public safety to confine her person during a season till Bothwell and the other murderers of her husband could be tried and punished for their crimes and that during this confinement she had voluntarily without compulsion or violence merely from disgust at the inquietude and vexations attending power resigned her crown to her only son and had appointed the earl of Murray regent during the minority Anderson vol iv part ii p fifty two Goodall vol ii p one hundred twenty eight Haynes p four hundred seventy eight Anderson vol iv part ii p sixty four et seq Goodall vol ii p one hundred forty four The queen s answer to this apology was obvious that she did not know and never could suspect that Bothwell who had been acquitted by a jury and recommended to her by all the nobility for her husband was the murderer of the king that she ever was and still continues desirous that if he be guilty he may be brought to condign punishment that her resignation of the crown was extorted from her by the well grounded fears of her life and even by direct menaces of violence and that Throgmorton the English ambassador as well as others of her friends had advised her to sign that paper as the only means of saving herself from the last extremity and had assured her that a consent given under these circumstances could never have any validity So far the queen of Scots seemed plainly to have the advantage in the contest and the English commissioners might have been surprised that Murray had made so weak a defence and had suppressed all the material imputations against that princess on which his party had ever so strenuously insisted had not some private conferences previously informed them of the secret Mary s commissioners had boasted that Elizabeth from regard to her kinswoman and from her desire of maintaining the rights of sovereigns was determined how criminal soever the conduct of that princess might appear to restore her to the throne and Murray reflecting on some past measures of the English court began to apprehend that there were but too just grounds for these expectations He believed that Mary if he would agree to conceal the most violent part of the accusation against her would submit to any reasonable terms of accommodation but if he once proceeded so far as to charge her with the whole of her guilt no composition could afterwards take place and should she ever be restored either by the power of Elizabeth or the assistance of her other friends he and his party must be exposed to her severe and implacable vengeance He resolved therefore not to venture rashly on a measure which it would be impossible for him ever to recall and he privately paid a visit to Norfolk and the other English commissioners confessed his scruples laid before them the evidence of the queen s guilt and desired to have some security for Elizabeth s protection in case that evidence should upon examination appear entirely satisfactory Norfolk was not secretly displeased with these scruples of the regent Anderson vol iv part ii p sixty et seq Goodall vol ii p one hundred sixty two Anderson vol iv part ii p forty five Goodall vol ii p one hundred twenty seven Anderson vol iv part ii p forty seven forty eight Goodall vol ii p one hundred fifty nine Crawford

man of singular address and capacity had engaged him to embrace further views in her favor and even to think of espousing her and though that duke confessed that the proofs against Mary seemed to him unquestionable he encouraged Murray in his present resolution not to produce them publicly in the conferences before the English commissioners Norfolk however was obliged to transmit to court the queries proposed by the regent These queries consisted of four particulars Whether the English commissioners had authority from their sovereign to pronounce sentence against Mary in case her guilt should be fully proved before them Whether they would promise to exercise that authority and proceed to an actual sentence Whether the queen of Scots if she were found guilty should be delivered into the hands of the regent or at least be so secured in England that she never should be able to disturb the tranquillity of Scotland and Whether Elizabeth would also in that case promise to acknowledge the young king and protect the regent in his authority Elizabeth when these queries with the other transactions were laid before her began to think that they pointed towards a conclusion more decisive and more advantageous than she had hitherto expected She determined therefore to bring the matter into full light and under pretext that the distance from her person retarded the proceedings of her commissioners she ordered them to come to London and there continue the conferences On their appearance she immediately joined in commission with them some of the most considerable of her council Sir Nicholas Bacon lord keeper the earls of Arundel and Leicester Lord Clinton admiral and Sir William Cecil secretary The queen of Scots who knew nothing of these secret motives and who expected that fear or decency would still restrain Murray from proceeding to any violent accusation against her expressed an entire satisfaction in this adjournment and declared that the affair being under the immediate inspection of Elizabeth was now in the hands where she most desired to rest it v Anderson vol iv part ii p seventy seven Anderson vol iv part ii p fifty seven seventy seven State Trials vol

satisfactory answer to all Murray s demands and declared that though she wished and hoped from the present inquiry to be entirely convinced of Mary s innocence yet if the event should prove contrary and if that princess should appear guilty of her husband s murder she should for her own part deem her ever after unworthy of a throne The regent encouraged by this declaration opened more fully his charge against the queen of Scots and after expressing his reluctance to proceed to that extremity and protesting that nothing but the necessity of self defence which must not be abandoned for any delicacy could have engaged him in such a measure he proceeded to accuse her in plain terms of participation and consent in the assassination of the king The earl of Lenox too appeared before the English commissioners and imploring vengeance for the murder of his son accused Mary as an accomplice with Bothwell in that enormity When this charge was so unexpectedly given in and copies of it were transmitted to the bishop of Ross Lord Herreis and the other commissioners of Mary they absolutely refused to return an answer and they grounded their silence on very extraordinary reasons they had orders they said from their mistress if any thing were advanced that might touch her honor not to make any defence as she was a sovereign princess and could not be subject to any tribunal and they required that she should previously be admitted to Elizabeth s presence to whom and to whom alone she was determined to justify her innocence Goodall vol ii p one hundred ninety nine Anderson vol iv

clear her from the accusations of her enemies that Elizabeth had ever pretended to enter into them only as her friend by her own consent and approbation not as assuming any jurisdiction over her that this princess had from the beginning refused to admit her to her presence till she should vindicate herself from the crimes imputed to her that she had therefore discovered no new signs of partiality by her perseverance in that resolution and that though she had granted an audience to the earl of Murray and his colleagues she had previously conferred the same honor on Mary s commissioners and her conduct was so far entirely equal to both parties eleven As the commissioners of the queen of Scots refused to give in any answer to Murray s charge the necessary consequence seemed to be that there could be no further proceedings in the conference But though this silence might be interpreted as a presumption against her it did not fully answer the purpose of those English ministers who were enemies to that princess They still desired to have in their hands the proofs of her guilt and in order to draw them with decency from the regent a judicious artifice was employed by Elizabeth Murray was called before the English commissioners and reproved by them in the queen s name for the atrocious imputations which he had the temerity to throw upon his sovereign but though the earl of Murray they added and the other commissioners had so far forgotten the duty of allegiance to their prince the queen never would overlook what she owed to her friend her neighbor and her kinswoman and she therefore desired to know what they could say in their own justification Murray thus urged made no difficulty in producing the proofs of his charge against the queen of Scots and among the rest some love letters and sonnets of hers to Bothwell written all in her own hand and two other papers one written in her own hand another subscribed by her and written by the earl of Huntley each of which contained a promise of marriage with Bothwell made before the pretended trial and acquittal of that nobleman Lesley s Negotiations in Anderson vol iii p twenty five Haynes p four hundred eighty seven See note K at the end of the volume Anderson vol iv part ii p one hundred forty seven Goodall vol ii p two hundred thirty three All these important papers had been kept by Bothwell in a silver box or casket which had been given him by Mary and which had belonged to her first husband Francis and though the princess had enjoined him to burn the letters as soon as he had read them he had thought proper carefully to preserve them as pledges of her fidelity and had committed them to the custody of Sir James Balfour deputy governor of the Castle of Edinburgh When that fortress was besieged by the associated lords Bothwell sent a servant to receive the casket from the hands of the deputy governor Balfour delivered it to the messenger but as he had at that time received some disgust from Bothwell and was secretly negotiating an agreement with the ruling party he took care by conveying private intelligence to the earl of Morton to make the papers be intercepted by him They contained incontestable proofs of Mary s criminal correspondence with Bothwell of her consent to the king s murder and of her concurrence in the violence which Bothwell pretended to commit upon her Murray fortified this evidence by some testimonies of corresponding facts and he added some time after the dying confession of one Hubert or French Paris as he was called a servant of Bothwell s who had been executed for the king s murder and who directly charged the queen with her being accessory to that criminal enterprise Mary s commissioners had used every expedient to ward this blow which they saw coming upon them and against which it appears they were not provided with any proper defence As soon as Murray opened his charge they endeavored to turn the conferences from an inquiry into a negotiation and though informed by the English commissioners that nothing could be more dishonorable for their mistress than to enter into a treaty with such undutiful subjects before she had justified herself from those enormous imputations which had been thrown upon her they still insisted that Elizabeth should settle terms of accommodation between Mary and her enemies in Scotland They maintained that till their mistress had given in her answer to Murray s charge his proofs could neither be called for nor produced v and finding that the English commissioners were still determined to proceed in the method which had been projected they finally broke off the conferences and never would make any reply Anderson vol ii p one hundred fifteen Goodall vol ii p one Anderson vol ii part ii

their authenticity are in general of small force but were they ever so specious they cannot now be hearkened to since Mary at the time when the truth could have been fully cleared did in effect ratify the evidence against her by recoiling from the inquiry at the very critical moment and refusing to give an answer to the accusation of her enemies twelve But Elizabeth though she had seen enough for her own satisfaction was determined that the most eminent persons of her court should also be acquainted with these transactions and should be convinced of the equity of her proceedings She ordered her privy council to be assembled and that she might render the matter more solemn and authentic she summoned along with them the earls of Northumberland Westmoreland Shrewsbury Worcester Huntingdon and Warwick All the proceedings of the English commissioners were read to them the evidences produced by Murray were perused a great number of letters written by Mary to Elizabeth were laid before them and the handwriting compared with that of the letters delivered in by the regent the refusal of the queen of Scots commissioners to make any reply was related and on the whole Elizabeth told them that as she had from the first thought it improper that Mary after such horrid crimes were imputed to her should be admitted to her presence before she had in some measure justified herself from the charge so now when her guilt was confirmed by so many evidences and all answer refused she must for her part persevere more steadily in that resolution Elizabeth next called in the queen of Scots commissioners and after observing that she deemed it much more decent for their mistress to continue the conferences than to require the liberty of justifying herself in person she told them that Mary might either send her reply by a person whom she trusted or deliver it herself to some English nobleman whom Elizabeth should appoint to wait upon her but as to her resolution of making no reply at all she must regard it as the strongest confession of guilt nor could they ever be deemed her friends who advised her to that method of proceeding These topics she enforced still more strongly in a letter which she wrote to Mary herself See note L at the end of the volume Anderson vol iv part ii p one hundred seventy et cetera Goodall vol ii p two hundred fifty four Anderson vol iv part ii p one hundred seventy nine et cetera Goodall vol ii p two hundred sixty eight Anderson vol iv part ii p one hundred eighty three Goodall vol ii p two hundred sixty nine The queen of Scots had no other subterfuge from these pressing remonstrances than still to demand a personal interview with Elizabeth a concession which she was sensible would never be granted because Elizabeth knew that this expedient could decide nothing because it brought matters to extremity which that princess desired to avoid and because it had been refused from the beginning even before the commencement of the conferences In order to keep herself better in countenance Mary thought of another device Though the conferences were broken off she ordered her commissioners to accuse the earl of Murray and his associates as the murderers of the king but this accusation coming so late being extorted merely by a complaint of Murray s and being unsupported by any proof could only be regarded as an angry recrimination upon her enemy thirteen She also desired to have copies of the papers given in by the regent but as she still persisted in her resolution to make no reply before the English commissioners this demand was finally refused her fourteen Cabala p one hundred fifty seven Goodall vol ii p two hundred eighty See note M at the end of the volume Goodall vol ii p two hundred fifty

the conferences the regent expressed great impatience to return into Scotland and he complained that his enemies had taken advantage of his absence and had thrown the whole government into confusion Elizabeth therefore dismissed him and granted him a loan of five thousand pounds to bear the charges of his journey During the conferences at York the duke of Chatelrault arrived at London in passing from France and as the queen knew that he was engaged in Mary s party and had very plausible pretensions to the regency of the king of Scots she thought proper to detain him till after Murray s departure But notwithstanding these marks of favor and some other assistance which she secretly gave this latter nobleman she still declined acknowledging the young king or treating with Murray as regent of Scotland Rymer tom xv p six hundred seventy seven MS in the Advocates library A three twenty nine p one hundred twenty eight one hundred twenty nine one hundred thirty from Cott lab Cal c one Orders were given for removing the queen of Scots from Bolton a place surrounded with Catholics to Tutbury in the county of Stafford where she was put under the custody of the earl of Shrewsbury Elizabeth entertained hopes that this princess discouraged by her misfortunes and confounded by the late transactions would be glad to secure a safe retreat from all the tempests with which she had been agitated and she promised to bury every thing in oblivion provided Mary would agree either voluntary to resign her crown or to associate her son with her in the government and the administration to remain during his minority in the hands of the earl of Murray But that high spirited princess refused all treaty upon such terms and declared that her last words should be those of a queen of Scotland Besides many other reasons she said which fixed her in that resolution she knew that if in the present emergence she made such concessions her submission would be universally deemed an acknowledgment of guilt and would ratify all the calumnies of her enemies Goodall vol ii p two hundred ninety five Goodall vol ii p three hundred one Mary still insisted upon this alternative either that Elizabeth should assist her in recovering her authority or should give her liberty to retire into France and make trial of the friendship of other princes and as she asserted that she had come voluntarily into England invited by many former professions of amity she thought that one or other of these requests could not without the most extreme injustice be refused her But Elizabeth sensible of the danger which attended both these proposals was secretly resolved to detain her still a captive and as her retreat into England had been little voluntary her claim upon the queen s generosity appeared much less urgent than she was willing to pretend Necessity it was thought would to the prudent justify her detention her past misconduct would apologize for it to the equitable and though it was foreseen that compassion for Mary s situation joined to her intrigues and insinuating behavior would while she remained in England excite the zeal of her friends especially of the Catholics these inconveniences were deemed much inferior to those which attended any other expedient Elizabeth trusted also to her own address for eluding all these difficulties she purposed to avoid breaking absolutely with the queen of Scots to keep her always in hopes of an accommodation to negotiate perpetually with her and still to throw the blame of not coming to any conclusion either on unforeseen accidents or on the obstinacy and perverseness of others We come now to mention some English affairs which we left behind us that we might not interrupt our narrative of the events in Scotland which formed so material a part of the present reign The term fixed by the treaty of Chateau Cambresis for the restitution of Calais expired in fifteen sixty seven and Elizabeth after making her demand at the gates of that city sent Sir Thomas Smith to Paris and that minister in conjunction with Sir Henry Norris her resident ambassador enforced her pretensions Conferences were held on that head without coming to any conclusion satisfactory to the English The chancellor De L Hospital told the English ambassadors that though France by an article of the treaty was obliged to restore Calais on the expiration of eight years there was another article of the same treaty which now deprived Elizabeth of any right that could accrue to her by that engagement that it was agreed if the English should during the interval commit hostilities upon France they should instantly forfeit all claim to Calais and the taking possession of Havre and Dieppe with whatever pretences that measure might be covered was a plain violation of the peace between the nations that though these places were not entered by force but put into Elizabeth s hands by the governors these governors were rebels and a correspondence with such traitors was the most flagrant injury that could be committed on any sovereign that in the treaty which ensued upon the expulsion of the English from Normandy the French ministers had absolutely refused to make any mention of Calais and had thereby declared their intention to take advantage of the title which had accrued to the crown of France and that though a general clause had been inserted implying a reservation of all claims this concession could not avail the English who at that time possessed no just claim to Calais and had previously forfeited all right to that fortress The queen was nowise surprised at hearing these allegations and as she knew that the French court intended not from the first to make restitution much less after they could justify their refusal by such plausible reasons she thought it better for the present to acquiesce in the loss than to pursue a doubtful title by a war both dangerous and expensive as well as unseasonable Haynes p five hundred eighty seven Camden p four hundred six Elizabeth entered anew into negotiations for espousing the archduke Charles and she seems at this time to have had no great motive of policy which might induce her to make this fallacious offer but as she was very rigorous in the terms insisted on and would not agree that the archduke if he espoused her should enjoy any power or title in England and even refused him the exercise of his religion the treaty came to nothing and that prince despairing of success in his addresses married the daughter of Albert duke of Bavaria Camden p four hundred seven four hundred eight CHAPTER XL ELIZABETH Of all the European churches which shook off the yoke of papal authority no one proceeded with so much reason and moderation as the church of England an advantage which had been derived partly from the interposition of the civil magistrate in this innovation partly from the gradual and slow steps by which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom Rage and animosity against the Catholic religion was as little indulged as could be supposed in such a revolution the fabric of the secular hierarchy was maintained entire the ancient liturgy was preserved so far as was thought consistent with the new principles many ceremonies become venerable from age and preceding use were retained the splendor of the Romish worship though removed had at least given place to order and decency the distinctive habits of the clergy according to their different ranks were continued no innovation was admitted merely from spite and opposition to former usage and the new religion by mitigating the genius of the ancient superstition and rendering it more compatible with the peace and interests of society had preserved itself in that happy medium which wise men have always sought and which the people have so seldom been able to maintain But though such in general was the spirit of the reformation in that country many of the English reformers being men of more warm complexions and more obstinate tempers endeavored to push matters to extremities against the church of Rome and indulged themselves in the most violent contrariety and antipathy to all former practices Among these Hooper who afterwards suffered for his religion with such extraordinary constancy was chiefly distinguished This man was appointed during the reign of Edward to the see of Glocester and made no scruple of accepting the episcopal office but he refused to be consecrated in the episcopal habit the cymar and rochet which had formerly he said been abused to superstition and which were thereby rendered unbecoming a true Christian Cranmer and Ridley were surprised at this objection which opposed the received practice and even the established laws and though young Edward desirous of promoting a man so celebrated for his eloquence his zeal and his morals enjoined them to dispense with this ceremony they were still determined to retain it Hooper then embraced the resolution rather to refuse the bishopric than clothe himself in those hated garments but it was deemed requisite that for the sake of the example he should not escape so easily He was first confined to Cranmer s house then thrown into prison till he should consent to be a bishop on the terms proposed he was plied with conferences and reprimands and arguments Bucer and Peter Martyr and the most celebrated foreign reformers were consulted on this important question and a compromise with great difficulty was at last made that Hooper should not be obliged to wear commonly the obnoxious robes but should agree to be consecrated in them and to use them during cathedral service a condescension not a little extraordinary in a man of so inflexible a spirit as this reformer The same objection which had arisen with regard to the episcopal habit had been moved against the raiment of the inferior clergy and the surplice in particular with the tippet and corner cap was a great object of abhorrence to many of the popular zealots Burnet vol ii p one hundred fifty two Heylin p ninety Strype vol i p four hundred sixteen In vain was it urged that particular habits as well as postures and ceremonies having been constantly used by the clergy and employed in religious service acquire a veneration in the eyes of the people appear sacred in their apprehensions excite their devotion and contract a kind of mysterious virtue which attaches the affections of men to the national and established worship that in order to produce this effect a uniformity in these particulars is requisite and even a perseverance as far as possible in the former practice and that the nation would be happy if by retaining these inoffensive observances the reformers could engage the people to renounce willingly what was absurd or pernicious in the ancient superstition These arguments which had influence with wise men were the very reasons which engaged the violent Protestants to reject the habits They pushed matters to a total opposition with the church of Rome every compliance they said was a symbolizing with Antichrist And this spirit was carried so far by some reformers that in a national remonstrance made afterwards by the church of Scotland against these habits it was asked What has Christ Jesus to do with Belial What has darkness to do with light If surplices corner caps and tippets have been badges cf idolaters in the very act of their idolatry why should the preacher of Christian liberty and the open rebuker of all superstition partake with the dregs of the Romish beast Yea who is there that ought not rather to be afraid of taking in his hand or on his forehead the print and mark of that odious beast But this application was rejected by the English church There was only one instance in which the spirit of contradiction to the Romanists took place universally in England the altar was removed from the wall was placed in the middle of the church and was thenceforth denominated the communion table The reason why this innovation met with such general reception was that the nobility and gentry got thereby a pretence for making spoil of the plate vestures and rich ornaments which belonged to the altars Strype vol i p four hundred sixteen Keith p five hundred sixty five Knox p four hundred two Heylin Preface p three Hist p one hundred six These disputes which had been started during the reign of Edward were carried abroad by the Protestants who fled from the persecutions of Mary and as the zeal of these men had received an increase from the furious cruelty of their enemies they were generally inclined to carry their opposition to the utmost extremity against the practices of the church of Rome Their communication with Calvin and the other reformers who followed the discipline and worship of Geneva confirmed them in this obstinate reluctance and though some of the refugees particularly those who were established at Frankfort still adhered to King Edward s liturgy the prevailing spirit carried these confessors to seek a still further reformation On the accession of Elizabeth they returned to their native country and being regarded with general veneration on account of their zeal and past sufferings they ventured to insist on the establishment of their projected model nor did they want countenance from many considerable persona in the queen s council But the princess herself so far from being willing to despoil religion of the few ornaments and ceremonies which remained in it was rather inclined to bring the public worship still nearer to the Romish ritual and she thought that the reformation had already gone too far in shaking off those forms and observances which without distracting men of more refined apprehensions tend in a very innocent manner to allure and amuse and engage the vulgar When Nowel one of her chaplains had spoken less reverently in a sermon preached before her of the sign of the cross she called aloud to him from her closet window commanding him to retire from the ungodly digression and to return unto his text And on the other side when one of her divines had preached a sermon in defence of the real presence she openly gave him thanks for his pains and piety Heylin p one hundred twenty four She would have absolutely forbidden the marriage of the clergy if Cecil had not interposed Strype s Life of Parker p one hundred seven one hundred eight one hundred nine She was an enemy to sermons and usually said that she thought two or three preachers were sufficient for a whole county It was probably for these reasons that one Doring told her to her face from the pulpit that she was like an untamed heifer that would not be ruled by God s people but obstructed his discipline See Life of Hooker prefixed to his works She took care to have a law for uniformity strictly enacted she was empowered by the parliament to add any new ceremonies which she thought proper and though she was sparing in the exercise of this prerogative she continued rigid in exacting an observance of the established laws and in punishing all nonconformity The zealots therefore who harbored a secret antipathy to the Episcopal order and to the whole liturgy were obliged in a great measure to conceal these sentiments which would have been regarded as highly audacious and criminal and they confined their avowed objections to the surplice the confirmation of children the sign of the cross in baptism the ring in marriage kneeling at the sacrament and bowing at the name of Jesus So fruitless is it for sovereigns to watch with a rigid care over orthodoxy and to employ the sword in religious controversy that the work perpetually renewed is perpetually to begin and a garb a gesture nay a metaphysical or grammatical distinction when rendered important by the disputes of theologians and the zeal of the magistrate is sufficient to destroy the unity of the church and even the peace of society These controversies had already excited such ferment among the people that in some places they refused to frequent the churches where the habits and ceremonies were used would not salute the conforming clergy and proceeded so far as to revile them in the streets to spit in their faces and to use them with all manner of contumely And while the sovereign authority checked these excesses the flame was confined not extinguished and burning fiercer from confinement it burst out in the succeeding reigns to the destruction of the church and monarchy Strype s Life of Whitgift p four hundred sixty All enthusiasts indulging themselves in rapturous flights ecstasies visions inspirations have a natural aversion to episcopal authority to ceremonies rites and forms which they denominate superstition or beggarly elements and which seem to restrain the liberal effusions of their zeal and devotion but there was another set of opinions adopted by these innovators which rendered them in a peculiar manner the object of Elizabeth s aversion The same bold and daring spirit which accompanied them in their addresses to the Divinity appeared in their political speculations and the principles of civil liberty which during some reigns had been little avowed in the nation and which were totally incompatible with the present exorbitant prerogative had been strongly adopted by this new sect Scarcely any sovereign before Elizabeth and none after her carried higher both in speculation and practice the authority of the crown and the Puritans so these sectaries were called on account of their pretending to a superior purity of worship and discipline could not recommend themselves worse to her favor than by inculcating the doctrine of resisting or restraining princes From all these motives the queen neglected no opportunity of depressing those zealous innovators and while they were secretly countenanced by some of her most favored ministers Cecil Leicester Knolles Bedford Walsingham she never was to the end of her life reconciled to their principles and practices We have thought proper to insert in this place an account of the rise and the genius of the Puritans because Camden marks the present year as the period when they began to make themselves considerable in England We now return to our narration The duke of Norfolk was the only peer that enjoyed the highest title of nobility and as there were at present no princes of the blood the splendor of his family the opulence of his fortune and the extent of his influence had rendered him without comparison the first subject in England The qualities of his mind corresponded to his high station beneficent affable generous he had acquired the affections of the people prudent moderate obsequious he possessed without giving her any jealousy the good graces of his sovereign His grandfather and father had long been regarded as the leaders of the Catholics and this hereditary attachment joined to the alliance of blood had procured him the friendship of the most considerable men of that party but as he had been educated among the reformers was sincerely devoted to their principles and maintained that strict decorum and regularity of life by which the Protestants were at that time distinguished he thereby enjoyed the rare felicity of being popular even with the most opposite factions The height of his prosperity alone was the source of his misfortunes and engaged him in attempts from which his virtue and prudence would naturally have forever kept him at a distance Norfolk was at this time a widower and being of a suitable age his marriage with the queen of Scots had appeared so natural that it occurred to several of his friends and those of that princess but the first person who after Secretary Lidington opened the scheme to the duke is said to have been the earl of Murray before his departure for Scotland That nobleman set before Norfolk both the advantage of composing the dissensions in Scotland by an alliance which would be so generally acceptable and the prospect of reaping the succession of England and in order to bind Norfolk s interest the faster with Mary s he proposed that the duke s daughter should also espouse the young king of Scotland The previously obtaining of Elizabeth s consent was regarded both by Murray and Norfolk as a circumstance essential to the success of their project and all terms being adjusted between them Murray took care by means of Sir Robert Melvil to have the design communicated to the queen of Scots This princess replied that the vexations which she had met with in her two last marriages had made her more inclined to lead a single life but she was determined to sacrifice her own inclinations to the public welfare and therefore as soon as she should be legally divorced from Bothwell she would be determined by the opinion of her nobility and people in the choice of another husband Lesley p thirty six eighty seven Lesley p forty forty one It is probable that Murray was not sincere in this proposal He had two motives to engage him to dissimulation Heknew the danger which he must run in his return through the north of England from the power of the earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland Mary s partisans in that country and he dreaded an insurrection in Scotland from the duke of Chatelrault and the earls of Argyle and Huntley whom she had appointed her lieutenants during her absence By these feigned appearances of friendship he both engaged Norfolk to write in his favor to the northern noblemen and he persuaded the queen of Scots to give her lieutenants permission and even advice to conclude a cessation of hostilities with the regent s party The duke of Norfolk though he had agreed that Elizabeth s consent should be previously obtained before the completion of his marriage had reason to apprehend that he never should prevail with her voluntarily to make that concession He knew her perpetual and unrelenting jealousy against her heir and rival he was acquainted with her former reluctance to all proposals of marriage with the queen of Scots he foresaw that this princess s espousing a person of his power and character and interest would give the greatest umbrage and as it would then become necessary to reinstate her in possession of her throne on some tolerable terms and even to endeavor the reestablishing of her character he dreaded lest Elizabeth whose politics had now taken a different turn would never agree to such indulgent and generous conditions He therefore attempted previously to gain the consent and approbation of several of the most considerable nobility and he was successful with the earls of Pembroke Arundel Derby Bedford Shrewsbury Southampton Northumberland Westmoreland Sussex Lord Lumley and Sir Nicholas Throgmorton cordially embraced the proposal even the earl of Leicester Elizabeth s declared favorite who had formerly entertained some views of espousing Mary willingly resigned all his pretensions and seemed to enter zealously into Norfolk s interests There were other motives besides affection to the duke which produced this general combination of the nobility State Trials p seventy six seventy eight Lesley p forty one Lesley p fifty five Camden p four hundred nineteen Spotswood p two hundred thirty Haynes p five hundred thirty five Sir William Cecil secretary of state was the most vigilant active and prudent minister ever known in England and as he was governed by no views but the interests of his sovereign which he had inflexibly pursued his authority over her became every day more predominant Ever cool himself and uninfluenced by prejudice or affection he checked those sallies of passion and sometimes of caprice to which she was subject and if he failed of persuading her in the first movement his perseverance and remonstrances and arguments were sure at last to recommend themselves to her sound discernment The more credit he gained with his mistress the more was he exposed to the envy of her other counsellors and as he had been supposed to adopt the interests of the house of Suffolk whose claim seemed to carry with it no danger to the present establishment his enemies in opposition to him were naturally led to attach themselves to the queen of Scots Elizabeth saw without uneasiness this emulation among her courtiers which served to augment her own authority and though she supported Cecil whenever matters came to extremities and dissipated every conspiracy against him particularly one laid about this time for having him thrown into the Tower on some pretence or other she never gave him such unlimited confidence as might enable him entirely to crush his adversaries Norfolk sensible of the difficulty which he must meet with in controlling Cecil s counsels especially where they concurred with the inclination as well as interest of the queen durst not open to her his intentions of marrying the queen of Scots but proceeded still in the same course of increasing his interest in the kingdom and engaging more of the nobility to take part in his measures A letter was written to Mary by Leicester and signed by several of the first rank recommending Norfolk for her husband and stipulating conditions for the advantage of both kingdoms particularly that she should give sufficient surety to Elizabeth and the heirs of her body for the free enjoyment of the crown of England that a perpetual league offensive and defensive should be made between their realms and subjects that the Protestant religion should be established by law in Scotland and that she should grant an amnesty to her rebels in that kingdom Camden p four hundred seventeen Lesley p fifty Camden p four hundred twenty Haynes p five hundred thirty five five hundred thirty nine When Mary returned a favorable answer to this application Norfolk employed himself with new ardor in the execution of his project and besides securing the interests of many of the considerable gentry and nobility who resided at court he wrote letters to such as lived at their country seats and possessed the greatest authority in the several counties The kings of France and Spain who interested themselves extremely in Mary s cause were secretly consulted and expressed their approbation of these measures And though Elizabeth s consent was always supposed as a previous condition to the finishing of this alliance it was apparently Norfolk s intention when he proceeded such lengths without consulting her to render his party so strong that it should no longer be in her power to refuse it It was impossible that so extensive a conspiracy could entirely escape the queen s vigilance and that of Cecil She dropped several intimations to the duke by which he might learn that she was acquainted with his designs and she frequently warned him to beware on what pillow he reposed his head but he never had the prudence or the courage to open to her his full intentions Certain intelligence of this dangerous combination was given her first by Leicester then by Murray v who if ever he was sincere in promoting Norfolk s marriage which is much to be doubted had at least intended for his own safety and that of his party that Elizabeth should in reality as well as in appearance be entire arbiter of the conditions and should not have her consent extorted by any confederacy of her own subjects This information gave great alarm to the court of England and the more so as those intrigues were attended with other circumstances of which it is probable Elizabeth was not wholly ignorant Lesley p sixty two Lesley p sixty three State Trials vol i p eighty two Camden p four hundred twenty Spotswood p two hundred thirty one v Lesley p seventy one It appears by Haynes p five hundred twenty one five hundred twenty five that Elizabeth had heard rumors of Norfolk s dealing with Murray and charged the latter to inform her of the whole truth which he accordingly did See also the earl of Murray s letter produced on Norfolk s trial Among the nobility and gentry that seemed to enter into Norfolk s views there were many who were zealously attached to the Catholic religion who had no other design than that of restoring Mary to her liberty and who would gladly by a combination with foreign powers or even at the expense of a civil war have placed her on the throne or England The earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland who possessed great power in the north were leaders of this party and the former nobleman made offer to the queen of Scots by Leonard Dacres brother to Lord Dacres that he would free her from confinement and convey her to Scotland or any other place to which she should think proper to retire Sir Thomas and Sir Edward Stanley sons of the earl of Derby Sir Thomas Gerrard Rolstone and other gentlemen whose interest lay in the neighborhood of the place where Mary resided concurred in the same views and required that in order to facilitate the execution of the scheme a diversion should in the mean time be made from the side of Flanders Norfolk discouraged and even in appearance suppressed these conspiracies both because his duty to Elizabeth would not allow him to think of effecting his purpose by rebellion and because he foresaw that if the queen of Scots came into the possession of these men they would rather choose for her husband the king of Spain or some foreign prince who had power as well as inclination to reestablish the Catholic religion Lesley p seventy six Lesley p ninety eight Lesley p seventy seven When men of honor and good principles like the duke of Norfolk engage in dangerous enterprises they are commonly so unfortunate as to be criminal by halves and while they balance between the execution of their designs and their remorses their fear of punishment and their hope of pardon they render themselves an easy prey to their enemies The duke in order to repress the surmises spread against him spoke contemptuously to Elizabeth of the Scottish alliance affirmed that his estate in England was more valuable than the revenue of a kingdom wasted by civil wars and factions and declared that when he amused himself in his own tennis court at Norwich amidst his friends and vassals he deemed himself at least a petty prince and was fully satisfied with his condition Finding that he did not convince her by these asseverations and that he was looked on with a jealous eye by the ministers he retired to his country seat without taking leave He soon after repented of this measure and set out on his return to court with a view of using every expedient to regain the queen s good graces but he was met at saint Albans by Fitz

intended rebellion and the earl of Sussex president of York alarmed with the danger sent for Northumberland and Westmoreland in order to examine them but not finding any proof against them he allowed them to depart The report meanwhile gained ground daily and many appearances of its reality being discovered orders were despatched by Elizabeth to these two noblemen to appear at court and answer for their conduct They had already proceeded so far in their criminal designs that they dared not to trust themselves in her hands they had prepared measures for a rebellion had communicated their design to Mary and her ministers had entered into a correspondence with the duke of Alva governor of the Low Countries had obtained his promise of a reenforcement of troops and of a supply of arms and ammunition and had prevailed on him to send over to London Chiapino Vitelii one of his most famous captains on pretence of adjusting some differences with the queen but in reality with a view of

suspense between opposite dangers when he was informed that some of his enemies were on the way with a commission to arrest him He took horse instantly and hastened to his associate Westmoreland whom he found surrounded with his friends and vassals and deliberating with regard to the measures which he should follow in the present emergence They determined to begin the insurrection without delay and the great credit of these two noblemen with that zeal for the catholic religion which still prevailed in the neighborhood soon drew together multitudes of the common people They published a manifesto in which they declared that they intended to attempt nothing against the queen to whom they vowed unshaken allegiance and that their sole aim was to reestablish the religion of their ancestors to remove evil counsellors and to restore the duke of Norfolk and other faithful peers to their liberty and to the queen s favor The number of the malecontents amounted to four thousand foot and sixteen hundred horse and they expected the concurrence of all the Catholics in England The queen was not negligent in her own defence and she had beforehand from her prudent and wise conduct acquired the general good will of her people the best security of a sovereign insomuch that even the Catholics in most counties expressed an affection for her service and the duke of Norfolk himself though he had lost her favor and lay in confinement was not wanting as far as his situation permitted to promote the levies among his friends and retainers Sussex attended by the earls of Rutland the lords Hunsdon Evers and Willoughby of Parham marched against the rebels at the head of seven thousand men and found them already advanced to the bishopric of Durham of which they had taken possession They retired before him to Hexham and hearing that the earl of Warwick and Lord Clinton were advancing against them with a greater body they found no other resource than to disperse themselves without striking a blow The common people retired to their houses the leaders fled into Scotland Northumberland was found skulking in that country and was confined by Murray in the Castle of Lochlevin Westmoreland received shelter from the chieftains of the Kers and Scots partisans of Mary and persuaded them to make an inroad into England with a view of exciting a quarrel between the two kingdoms After they had committed great ravages they retreated to their own country This sudden and precipitate rebellion was followed soon after by another still more imprudent raised by Leonard Uacres Lord Hunsdon at the head of the garrison of Berwick was able without any other assistance to quell these rebels Great severity was exercised against such as had taken part in these rash enterprises Sixty

behavior that she released him from the Tower allowed him to live though under some show of confinement in his own house and only exacted a promise from him not to proceed any further in his negotiations with the queen of Scots Elizabeth now found that the detention of Mary was attended with all the ill consequences which she had foreseen when she first embraced that measure This latter princess recovering by means of her misfortunes and her own natural good sense from that delirium into which she seems to have been thrown during her attachment to Bothwell had behaved with such modesty and judgment and even dignity that every one who approached her was charmed with her demeanor and her friends were enabled on some plausible grounds to deny the reality of all those crimes which had been imputed to her Lesley p ninety eight Camden p four hundred twenty nine Haynes p five hundred ninety seven Lesley p two hundred thirty two Haynes p five hundred eleven five hundred forty eight Compassion for her situation and the necessity of procuring her liberty proved an incitement among all her partisans to be active in promoting her cause and as her deliverance from captivity it was thought could nowise be effected but by attempts dangerous to the established government Elizabeth had reason to expect little tranquillity so long as the Scottish queen remained a prisoner in her hands But as this inconvenience had been preferred to the danger of allowing that princess to enjoy her liberty and to seek relief in all the Catholic courts of Europe it behoved the queen to support the measure which she had adopted and to guard by every prudent expedient against the mischiefs to which it was exposed She still flattered Mary with hopes of her protection maintained an ambiguous conduct between that queen and her enemies in Scotland negotiated perpetually concerning the terms of her restoration made constant professions of friendship to her and by these artifices endeavored both to prevent her from making any desperate efforts for her deliverance and to satisfy the French and Spanish ambassadors who never intermitted their solicitations sometimes accompanied with menaces in her behalf This deceit was received with the same deceit by the queen of Scots professions of confidence were returned by professions equally insincere and while an appearance of friendship was maintained on both sides the animosity and jealousy which had long prevailed between them became every day more inveterate and incurable These two princesses in address capacity activity and spirit were nearly a match for each other but unhappily Mary besides her present forlorn condition was always inferior in personal conduct and discretion as well as in power to her illustrious rival Elizabeth and Mary wrote at the same time letters to the regent The queen of Scots desired that her marriage with Bothwell might be examined and a divorce be legally pronounced between them The queen of England gave Murray the choice of three conditions that Mary should be restored to her dignity on certain terms that she should be associated with her son and the administration remain in the regent s hands till the young prince should come to years of discretion or that she should be allowed to live at liberty as a private person in Scotland and have an honorable settlement made in her favor Murray summoned a convention of states in order to deliberate on these proposals of the two queens No answer was made by them to Mary s letter on pretence that she had there employed the style of a sovereign addressing herself to her subjects but in reality because they saw that her request was calculated to prepare the way for a marriage with Norfolk or some powerful prince who could support her cause and restore her to the throne They replied to Elizabeth that the two former conditions were so derogatory to the royal authority of their prince that they could not so much as deliberate concerning them the third alone could be the subject of treaty It was evident that Elizabeth in proposing conditions so unequal in their importance invited the Scots to a refusal of those which were most advantageous to Mary and as it was difficult if not impossible to adjust all the terms of the third so as to render it secure and eligible to all parties it was concluded that she was not sincere in any of them MSS in the Advocates Library A three hundred twenty nine p one hundred thirty seven from Cott Lib Catal c one Spotswood p two hundred thirty two hundred thirty one Lesley p seventy one It is pretended that Murray had entered into a private negotiation with the queen to get Mary delivered into his hands and as Elizabeth found the detention of her in England so dangerous it is probable that she would have been pleased on any honorable or safe terms to rid herself of a prisoner who gave her so much inquietude fifteen But all these projects vanished by the sudden death of the regent who was assassinated in revenge of a private injury by a gentleman of the name of Hamilton Murray was a person of considerable vigor abilities and constancy but though he was not unsuccessful during his regency in composing the dissensions in Scotland his talents shone out more eminently in the beginning than in the end of his life His manners were rough and austere and he possessed not that perfect integrity which frequently accompanies and can alone atone for that unamiable character By the death of the regent Scotland relapsed into anarchy Mary s party assembled together and made themselves masters of Edinburgh The castle commanded by Kirkaldy of Grange seemed to favor her cause and as many of the principal nobility had embraced that party it became probable though the people were in general averse to her that her authority might again acquire the ascendant To check its progress Elizabeth despatched Sussex with an army to the north under color of chastising the ravages committed by the borderers He entered Scotland and laid waste the lands of the Kers and Scots seized the Castle of Hume and committed hostilities on all Mary s partisans who he said had offended his mistress by harboring the English rebels Sir William Drury was afterwards sent with a body of troops and he threw down the houses of the Hamiltons who were engaged in the same faction The English armies were afterwards recalled by agreement with the queen of Scots who promised in return that no French troops should be introduced into Scotland and that the English rebels should be delivered up to the queen by her partisans But though the queen covering herself with the pretence of revenging her own quarrel so far contributed to support the party of the young king of Scots she was cautious not to declare openly against Mary and she even sent a request which was equivalent to a command to the enemies of that princess not to elect during some time a regent in the place of Murray Lenox the king s grandfather was therefore chosen temporary governor under the title of lieutenant Camden p four hundred twenty five Lesley p eighty three See note O at the end of the volume Lesley p ninety one Spotswood p two hundred forty Hearing afterwards that Mary s partisans instead of delivering up Westmoreland and the other fugitives as they had promised had allowed them to escape into Flanders she permitted the king s party to give Lenox the title of regent and she sent Randolph as her resident to maintain a correspondence with him But notwithstanding this step taken in favor of Mary s enemies she never laid aside her ambiguous conduct nor quitted the appearance of amity to that princess Being importuned by the bishop of Ross and her other agents as well as by foreign ambassadors she twice procured a suspension of arms between the Scottish factions and by that means stopped the hands of the regent who was likely to obtain advantages over the opposite party By these seeming contrarieties she kept alive the factions in Scotland increased their mutual animosity and rendered the whole country a scene of devastation and of misery She had no intention to conquer the kingdom and consequently no interest or design to instigate the parties against each other but this consequence was an accidental effect of her cautious politics by which she was engaged as far as possible to keep on good terms with the queen of Scots and never to violate the appearances of friendship with her at least those of neutrality sixteen Spotswood p two hundred forty one Spotswood p two hundred forty three Crawford p one hundred thirty six See note P at the end of the volume The better to amuse Mary with the prospect of an accommodation Cecil and Sir Walter Mildmay were sent to her with proposals from Elizabeth The terms were somewhat rigorous such as a captive queen might expect from a jealous rival and they thereby bore the greater appearance of sincerity on the part of the English court It was required that the queen of Scots besides renouncing all title to the crown of England during the lifetime of Elizabeth should make a perpetual league offensive and defensive between the kingdoms that she should marry no Englishman without Elizabeth s consent nor any other person without the consent of the states of Scotland that compensation should be made for the late ravages committed in England that justice should be executed on the murderers of King Henry that the young prince should be sent into England to be educated there and that six hostages all of them noblemen should be delivered to the queen of England with the Castle of Hume and some other fortress for the security of performance Such were the conditions upon which Elizabeth promised to contribute her endeavors towards the restoration of the deposed queen The necessity of Mary s affairs obliged her to consent to them and the kings of France and Spain as well as the pope when consulted by her approved of her conduct chiefly on account of the civil wars by which all Europe was at that time agitated and which incapacitated the Catholic princes from giving her any assistance Elizabeth s commissioners proposed also to Mary a plan of accommodation with her subjects in Scotland and after some reasoning on that head it was agreed that the queen should require Lenox the regent to send commissioners in order to treat of conditions under her mediation The partisans of Mary boasted that all terms were fully settled with the court of England and that the Scottish rebels would soon be constrained to submit to the authority of their sovereign but Elizabeth took care that these rumors should meet with no credit and that the king s party should not be discouraged nor sink too low in their demands Cecil wrote to inform the regent that all the queen of England s proposals so far from being fixed and irrevocable were to be discussed anew in the conference and desired him to send commissioners who should be constant in the king s cause and cautious not to make concessions which might be prejudicial to their party Sussex also in his letters dropped hints to the same purpose and Elizabeth herself said to the abbot of Dunfermling whom Lenox had sent to the court of England that she would not insist on Mary s restoration provided the Scots could make the justice of their cause appear to her satisfaction and that even if their reasons should fall short of full conviction she would take effectual care to provide for their future security Spotswood p two hundred forty five Lesley p one hundred one Lesley p one hundred nine et cetera Spotswood p two hundred forty six Spotswood p two hundred forty seven two hundred forty eight The parliament of Scotland appointed the earl of Morton and Sir James Macgill together with the abbot of Dunfermling to manage the treaty These commissioners presented memorials containing reasons for the deposition of their queen and they seconded their arguments with examples drawn from the Scottish history with the authority of laws and with the sentiments of many famous divines The lofty ideas which Elizabeth had entertained of the absolute indefensible right of sovereigns made her be shocked with these republican topics and she told the Scottish commissioners that she was no wise satisfied with their reasons for justifying the conduct of their countrymen and that they might therefore without attempting any apology proceed to open the conditions which they required for their security They replied that their commission did not empower them to treat of any terms which might infringe the title and sovereignty of their young king but they would gladly hear whatever proposals should be made them by her majesty The conditions recommended by the queen were not disadvantageous to Mary but as the commissioners still insisted that they were not authorized to treat in any manner concerning the restoration of that princess the conferences were necessarily at an end and Elizabeth dismissed the Scottish commissioners with injunctions that they should return after having procured more ample powers from their parliament The bishop of Ross openly complained to the English council that they had abused his mistress by fair promises and professions and Mary herself was no longer at a loss to judge of Elizabeth s insincerity By reason of these disappointments matters came still nearer to extremities between the two princesses and the queen of Scots finding all her hopes eluded was more strongly incited to make at all hazards every possible attempt for her liberty and security An incident also happened about this time which tended to widen the breach between Mary and Elizabeth and to increase the vigilance and jealousy of the latter princess Pope Pius V who had succeeded Paul after having endeavored in vain to conciliate by gentle means the friendship of Elizabeth whom his predecessor s violence had irritated issued at last a bull of excommunication against her deprived her of all title to the crown and absolved her subjects from their oaths of allegiance Spotswood p two hundred forty eight two hundred forty nine Haynes p six hundred twenty three Spotswood p two hundred forty nine two hundred fifty et cetera Lesley p one hundred thirty three one hundred thirty six Camden p four hundred thirty one four hundred thirty two Camden p four hundred twenty seven It seems probable that this attack on the queen s authority was made in concert with Mary who intended by that means to forward the northern rebellion a measure which was at that time in agitation John Felton affixed this bull to the gates of the bishop of London s palace and scorning either to fly or to deny the fact he was seized and condemned and received the crown of martyrdom for which he seems to have entertained so violent an ambition A new parliament after five years interval was assembled at Westminster and as the queen by the rage of the pope against her was become still more the head of the ruling party it might be expected both from this incident and from her own prudent and vigorous conduct that her authority over the two houses would be absolutely uncontrollable It was so in fact yet is it remarkable that it prevailed not without some small opposition and that too arising chiefly from the height of zeal for Protestantism a disposition of the English which in general contributed extremely to increase the queen s popularity We shall be somewhat particular in relating the transactions of this session because they show as well the extent of the royal power during that age as the character of Elizabeth and the genius of her government It will be curious also to observe the faint dawn of the spirit of liberty among the English the jealousy with which that spirit was repressed by the sovereign the imperious conduct which was maintained in opposition to it and the ease with which it was subdued by this arbitrary princess The lord keeper Bacon after the speaker of the commons was elected told the parliament in the queen s name that she enjoined them not to meddle with any matters of state such was his expression by which he probably meant the questions of the queen s marriage and the succession about which they had before given her some uneasiness for as to the other great points of government alliances peace and war or foreign negotiations no parliament in that age ever presumed to take them under consideration or question in these particulars the conduct of their sovereign or of his ministers In the former parliament the Puritans had introduced seven bills for a further reformation in religion but they had not been able to prevail in any one of them This house of commons had sitten a very few days when Stricland a member revived one of the bills that for the amendment of the liturgy v Camden p four hundred forty one from Cajetanus s Life of Pius V Camden p four hundred twenty eight D Ewes p one hundred forty one D Ewes p one hundred eighty five v D Ewes p one hundred fifty six one hundred fifty seven The chief objection which he mentioned was the sign of the cross in baptism Another member added the kneeling at the sacrament and remarked that if a posture of humiliation were requisite in that act of devotion it were better that the communicants should throw themselves prostrate on the ground in order to keep at the widest distance from former superstition Religion was a point of which Elizabeth was if possible still more jealous than of matters of state She pretended that in quality of supreme head or governor of the church she was fully empowered by her prerogative alone to decide all questions which might arise with regard to doctrine discipline or worship and she never would allow her parliaments so much as to take these points into consideration The courtiers did not forget to insist on this topic the treasurer of the household though he allowed that any heresy might be repressed by parliament a concession which seems to have been rash and unguarded since the act investing the crown with the supremacy or rather recognizing that prerogative gave the sovereign full power to reform all heresies yet he affirmed that it belonged to the queen alone as head of the church to regulate every question of ceremony in worship The comptroller seconded this argument insisted on the extent of the queen s prerogative and said that the house might from former examples have taken warning not to meddle with such matters One Pistor opposed these remonstrances of the courtiers He was scandalized he said that affairs of such infinite consequence namely kneeling and making the sign of the cross should be passed over so lightly These questions he added concern the salvation of souls and interest every one more deeply than the monarchy of the whole world This cause he showed to be the cause of God the rest were all but terrene yea trifles in comparison call them ever so great subsidies crowns kingdoms he knew not what weight they had when laid in the balance with subjects of such unspeakable importance Though the zeal of this member seems to have been approved of the house overawed by the prerogative voted upon the question that a petition should be presented to her majesty for her license to proceed further in this bill and in the mean time that they should stop all debate or reasoning concerning it v D Ewes p one hundred sixty seven D Ewes p one hundred fifty eight D Ewes p one hundred sixty six D Ewes p one hundred sixty six v D Ewes p one hundred sixty seven Matters would probably have rested here had not the queen been so highly offended with Stricland s presumption in moving the bill for reformation of the liturgy that she summoned him before the council and prohibited him thenceforth from appearing in the house of commons This act of power was too violent even for the submissive parliament to endure Carleton took notice of the matter complained that the liberties of the house were invaded observed that Stricland was not a private man but represented a multitude and moved that he might be sent for and if he were guilty of any offence might answer for it at the bar of the house which he insinuated to be the only competent tribunal Yelverton enforced the principles of liberty with still greater boldness He said that the precedent was dangerous and though in this happy time of lenity among so many good and honorable personages as were at present invested with authority nothing of extremity or injury was to be apprehended yet the times might alter what now is permitted might hereafter be construed as duty and might be enforced even on the ground of the present permission He added that all matters not treasonable or which implied not too much derogation of the imperial crown might without offence be introduced into parliament where every question that concerned the community must be considered and where even the right of the crown itself must finally be determined He remarked that men sat not in that house in their private capacities but as elected by their country and though it was proper that the prince should retain his prerogative yet was that prerogative limited by law as the sovereign could not of himself make laws neither could he break them merely from his own authority D Ewes p one hundred seventy five D Ewes p one hundred seventy five D Ewes p one hundred seventy five one hundred seventy six These principles were popular and noble and generous but the open assertion of them was at this time somewhat new in England and the courtiers were more warranted by present practice when they advanced a contrary doctrine The treasurer warned the house to be cautious in their proceedings neither to venture further than their assured warrant might extend nor hazard their good opinion with her majesty in any doubtful cause The member he said whose attendance they required was not restrained on account of any liberty of speech but for his exhibiting a bill in the house against the prerogative of the queen a temerity which was not to be tolerated And he concluded with observing that even speeches made in that house had been questioned and examined by the sovereign Cleere another member remarked that the sovereign s prerogative is not so much as disputable and that the safety of the queen is the safety of the subject He added that in questions of divinity every man was for his instruction to repair to his ordinary and he seems to insinuate that the bishops themselves for their instruction must repair to the queen Fleetwood observed that in his memory he knew a man who in the fifth of the present queen had been called to account for a speech in the house But lest this example should be deemed too recent he would inform them from the parliament rolls that in the reign of Henry V a bishop was committed to prison by the king s command on account of his freedom of speech and the parliament presumed not to go further than to be humble suitors for him in the subsequent reign the speaker himself was committed with another member and the house found no other remedy than a like submissive application He advised the house to have recourse to the same expedient and not to presume either to send for their member or demand him as of right During this speech those members of the privy council who sat in the house whispered together upon which the speaker moved that the house should make stay of all further proceedings a motion which was immediately complied with The queen finding that the experiment which she had made was likely to excite a great ferment saved her honor by this silence of the house and lest the question might be resumed she sent next day to Stricland her permission to give his attendance in parliament D Ewes p one hundred seventy five D Ewes p one hundred seventy five D Ewes p one hundred seventy six D Ewes p one hundred seventy six Notwithstanding this rebuke from the throne the zeal of the commons still engaged them to continue the discussion of those other bills which regarded religion but they were interrupted by a still more arbitrary proceeding of the queen in which the lords condescended to be her instruments This house sent a message to the commons desiring that a committee might attend them Some members were appointed for that purpose and the upper house informed them that the queen s majesty being informed of the articles of reformation which they had canvassed approved of them intended to publish them and to make the bishops execute them by virtue of her royal authority as supreme head of the church of England but that she would not permit them to be treated of in parliament The house though they did not entirely stop proceedings on account of this injunction seem to have been nowise offended at such haughty treatment and in the issue all the bills came to nothing A motion made by Robert Bell a Puritan against an exclusive patent granted to a company of merchants in Bristol gave also occasion to several remarkable incidents The queen some days after the motion was made sent orders by the mouth of the speaker commanding the house to spend little time in motions and to avoid long speeches All the members understood that she had been offended because a matter had been moved which seemed to touch her prerogative Fleetwood accordingly spoke of this delicate subject He observed that the queen had a prerogative of granting patents that to question the validity of any patent was to invade the royal prerogative that all foreign trade was entirely subjected to the pleasure of the sovereign that even the statute which gave liberty of commerce admitted of all prohibitions from the crown and that the prince when he granted an exclusive patent only employed the power vested in him and prohibited all others from dealing in any particular branch of commerce He quoted the clerk of the parliament s book to prove that no man might speak in parliament of the statute of wills unless the king first gave license because the royal prerogative in the wards was thereby touched He showed likewise the statutes of Edward I Edward III and Henry IV with a saving of the prerogative And in Edward VI s time the protector was applied to for his allowance to mention matters of prerogative D Ewes p one hundred eighty one hundred eighty five D Ewes p one hundred eighty five D Ewes p one hundred fifty nine D Ewes p one hundred sixty Sir Humphrey Gilbert the gallant and renowned sea adventurer carried these topics still further He endeavored to prove the motion made by Bell to be a vain device and perilous to be treated of since it tended to the derogation of the prerogative imperial which whoever should attempt so much as in fancy could not he said be otherwise accounted than an open enemy For what difference is there between saying that the queen is not to use the privilege of the crown and saying that she is not queen And though experience has shown so much clemency in her majesty as might perhaps make subjects forget their duty it is not good to sport or venture too much with princes He reminded them of the fable of the hare who upon the proclamation that all horned beasts should depart the court immediately fled lest his ears should be construed to be horns and by this apologue he seems to insinuate that even those who heard or permitted such dangerous speeches would not themselves be entirely free from danger He desired them to beware lest if they meddled further with these matters the queen might look to her own power and finding herself able to suppress their challenged liberty and to exert an arbitrary authority might imitate the example of Lewis XI of France who as he termed it delivered the crown from wardship Though this speech gave some disgust nobody at the time replied any thing but that Sir Humphrey mistook the meaning of the house and of the member who made the motion they never had any other purpose than to represent their grievances in due and seemly form unto her majesty But in a subsequent debate Peter Wentworth a man of a superior free spirit called that speech an insult on the house noted Sir Humphrey s disposition to flatter and fawn on the prince compared him to the chameleon which can change itself into all colors except white and recommended to the house a due care of liberty of speech and of the privileges of parliament D Ewes p one hundred sixty eight D Ewes p one hundred seventy five It appears on the whole that the motion against the exclusive patent had no effect Bell the member who first introduced it was sent for by the council and was severely reprimanded for his temerity He returned to the house with such an amazed countenance that all the members well informed of the reason were struck with terror and during some time no one durst rise to speak of any matter of importance for fear of giving offence to the queen and council Even after the fears of the commons were somewhat abated the members spoke with extreme precaution and by employing most of their discourse in preambles and apologies they showed their conscious terror of the rod which hung over them Wherever any delicate point was touched though ever so gently nay seemed to be approached though at ever so great a distance the whisper ran about the house The queen will be offended the council will be extremely displeased and by these surmises men were warned of the danger to which they exposed themselves It is remarkable that the patent which the queen defended with such imperious violence was contrived for the profit of four courtiers and was attended with the utter ruin of seven or eight thousand of her industrious subjects Thus every thing which passed the two houses was extremely respectful and submissive yet did the queen think it incumbent on her at the conclusion of the session to check and that with great severity those feeble efforts of liberty which had appeared in the motions and speeches of some members The lord keeper told the commons in her majesty s name that though the majority of the lower house had shown themselves in their proceedings discreet and dutiful yet a few of them had discovered a contrary character and had justly merited the reproach of audacious arrogant and presumptuous contrary to their duty both as subjects and parliament men nay contrary to the express injunctions given them from the throne at the beginning of the session injunctions which it might well become them to have better attended to they had presumed to call in question her majesty s grants and prerogatives But her majesty warns them that since they thus wilfully forget themselves they are otherwise to be admonished some other species of correction must be found for them since neither the commands of her majesty nor the example of their wiser brethren can reclaim their audacious arrogant and presumptuous folly by which they are thus led to meddle with what nowise belongs to them and what lies beyond the compass of their understanding D Ewes p two hundred forty two D Ewes p one hundred fifty one In all these transactions appears clearly the opinion which Elizabeth had entertained of the duty and authority of parliaments They were not to canvass any matters of state still less were they to meddle with the church Questions of either kind were far above their reach and were appropriated to the prince alone or to those councils and ministers with whom he was pleased to intrust them What then was the office of parliaments They might give directions for the due tanning of leather or milling of cloth for the preservation of pheasants and partridges for the reparation of bridges and highways for the punishment of vagabonds or common beggars Regulations concerning the police of the country came properly under their inspection and the laws of this kind which they prescribed had if not a greater yet a more durable authority than those which were derived solely from the proclamations of the sovereign Precedents or reports could fix a rule for decisions in private property or the punishment of crimes but no alteration or innovation in the municipal law could proceed from any other source than the parliament nor would the courts of justice be induced to change their established practice by an order of council But the most acceptable part of parliamentary proceedings was the granting of subsidies the attainting and punishing of the obnoxious nobility or any minister of state after his fall the countenancing of such great efforts of power as might be deemed somewhat exceptionable when they proceeded entirely from the sovereign The redress of grievances were sometimes promised to the people but seldom could have place while it was an established rule that the prerogatives of the crown must not be abridged or so much as questioned and examined in parliament Even though monopolies and exclusive companies had already reached an enormous height and were every day increasing to the destruction of all liberty and extinction of all industry it was criminal in a member to propose in the most dutiful and regular manner a parliamentary application against any of them These maxims of government were not kept secret by Elizabeth nor smoothed over by any fair appearances or plausible pretences They were openly avowed in her speeches and messages to parliament and were accompanied with all the haughtiness nay sometimes bitterness of expression which the meanest servant could look for from his offended master Yet notwithstanding this conduct Elizabeth continued to be the most popular sovereign that ever swayed the sceptre of England because the maxims of her reign were conformable to the principles of the times and to the opinion generally entertained with regard to the constitution The continued encroachments of popular assemblies on Elizabeth s successors have so changed our ideas in these matters that the passages above mentioned appear to us extremely curious and even at first surprising but they were so little remarked during the time that neither Camden though a contemporary writer nor any other historian has taken any notice of them So absolute indeed was the authority of the crown that the precious spark of liberty had been kindled and was preserved by the Puritans alone and it was to this sect whose principles appear so frivolous and habits so ridiculous that the English owe the whole freedom of their constitution Actuated by that zeal which belongs to innovators and by the courage which enthusiasm inspires they hazarded the utmost indignation of their sovereign and employing all their industry to be elected into parliament a matter not difficult while a seat was rather regarded as a burden than an advantage they first acquired a majority in that assembly and then obtained an ascendent over the church and monarchy The following were the principal laws enacted this session It was declared treason during the lifetime of the queen to affirm that she was not the lawful sovereign or that any other possessed a preferable title or that she was a heretic schismatic or infidel or that the laws and statutes cannot limit and determine the right of the crown and the successor thereof to maintain in writing or printing that any person except the natural issue of her body is or ought to be the queen s heir or successor subjected the person and all his abettors for the first offence to imprisonment during a year and to the forfeiture of half their goods the second offence subjected them to the penalty of a praemunire This law was plainly levelled against the queen of Scots and her partisans and implied an avowal that Elizabeth never intended to declare her successor It may be noted that the usual phrase of lawful issue which the parliament thought indecent towards the queen as if she could be supposed to have any other was changed into that of natural issue But this alteration was the source of pleasantry during the time and some suspected a deeper design as if Leicester intended in case of the queen s demise to produce some bastard of his own and affirm that he was her offspring thirteen Eliz c I Camden p four hundred thirty six It appeared this session that a bribe of four pounds had been given to a mayor for a seat in parliament D Ewes p one hundred eighty one It is probable that the member had no other view than the privilege of being free from arrests It was also enacted that whosoever by bulls should publish absolutions or other rescripts of the pope or should by means of them reconcile any man to the church of Rome such offenders as well as those who were so reconciled should be guilty of treason The penalty of a praemunire was imposed on every one who imported any Agnus Dei crucifix or such other implement of superstition consecrated by the pope The former laws against usury were enforced by a new statute A supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths was granted by parliament The queen as she was determined to yield to them none of her power was very cautious in asking them for any supply She endeavored either by a rigid frugality to make her ordinary revenues suffice for the necessities of the crown or she employed her prerogative and procured money by the granting of patents monopolies or by some such ruinous expedient thirteen Eliz c two thirteen Eliz c eight Though Elizabeth possessed such uncontrolled authority over her parliaments and such extensive influence over her people though during a course of thirteen years she had maintained the public tranquillity which was only interrupted by the hasty and ill concerted insurrection in the north she was still kept in great anxiety and felt her throne perpetually totter under her The violent commotions excited in France and the Low Countries as well as in Scotland seemed in one view to secure her against any disturbance but they served on more reflection to instruct her in the danger of her situation when she remarked that England no less than these neighboring countries contained the seeds of intestine discord the differences of religious opinion and the furious intolerance and animosity of the opposite sectaries The league formed at Bayonne in fifteen sixty six for the extermination of the Protestants had not been concluded so secretly but intelligence of it had reached Conde Coligny and the other leaders of the Hugonots and finding that the measures of the court agreed with their suspicions they determined to prevent the cruel perfidy of their enemies and to strike a blow before the Catholics were aware of the danger The Hugonots though dispersed over the whole kingdom formed a kind of separate empire and being closely united as well by their religious zeal as by the dangers to which they were perpetually exposed they obeyed with entire submission the orders of their leaders and were ready on every signal to fly to arms The king and queen mother were living in great security at Monceaux in Brie when they found themselves surrounded by Protestant troops which had secretly marched thither from all quarters and had not a body of Swiss come speedily to their relief and conducted them with great intrepidity to Paris they must have fallen without resistance into the hands of the malecontents A battle was afterwards fought in the plains of saint Denis where though the old constable Montmorency the general of the Catholics was killed combating bravely at the head of his troops the Hugonots were finally defeated Conde collecting his broken forces and receiving a strong reenforcement from the German Protestants appeared again in the field and laying siege to Chartres a place of great importance obliged the court to agree to a new accommodation So great was the mutual animosity of those religionists that even had the leaders on both sides been ever so sincere in their intentions for peace and reposed ever so much confidence in each other it would have been difficult to retain the people in tranquillity much more where such extreme jealousy prevailed and where the court employed every pacification as a snare for their enemies A plan was laid for seizing the person of the prince and admiral who narrowly escaped to Rochelle and summoned their partisans to their assistance Davila lib iv The civil wars were renewed with greater fury than ever and the parties became still more exasperated against each other The young duke of Anjou brother to the king commanded the forces of the Catholics and fought in fifteen sixty nine a great battle at Jarnac with the Hugonots where the prince of Conde was killed and his army defeated This discomfiture with the loss of so great a leader reduced not the Hugonots to despair The admiral still supported the cause and having placed at the head of the Protestants the prince of Navarre then sixteen years of age and the young prince of Conde he encouraged the party rather to perish bravely in the field than ignominiously by the hands of the executioner He collected such numbers so determined to endure every extremity that he was enabled to make head against the duke of Anjou and being strengthened by a new reenforcement of Germans he obliged that prince to retreat and to divide his forces Coligny then laid siege to Poietiers and as the eyes of all France were fixed on this enterprise the duke of Guise emulous of the renown which his father had acquired by the defence of Metz threw himself into the place and so animated the garrison by his valor and conduct that the admiral was obliged to raise the siege Such was the commencement of that unrivalled fame and grandeur afterwards attained by this duke of Guise The attachment which all the Catholics had borne to his father was immediately transferred to the son and men pleased themselves in comparing all the great and shining qualities which seemed in a manner hereditary in that family Equal in affability in munificence in address in eloquence and in every quality which engages the affections of men equal also in valor in conduct in enterprise in capacity there seemed only this difference between them that the son educated in more turbulent times and finding a greater dissolution of all law and order exceeded the father in ambition and temerity and was engaged in enterprises still more destructive to the authority of his sovereign and to the repose of his native country Elizabeth who kept her attention fixed on the civil commotions of France was nowise pleased with this new rise of her enemies the Guises and being anxious for the fate of the Protestants whose interests were connected with her own she was engaged notwithstanding her aversion from all rebellion and from all opposition to the will of the sovereign to give them secretly some assistance Besides employing her authority with the German princes she lent money to the queen of Navarre and received some jewels as pledges for the loan And she permitted Henry Champernon to levy and transport over into France a regiment of a hundred gentlemen volunteers among whom Walter Raleigh then a young man began to distinguish himself in that great school of military valor Haynes p four hundred seventy one Camden p four hundred twenty three The admiral constrained by the impatience of his troops and by the difficulty of subsisting them fought with the duke of Anjou the battle of Moncontour in Poictou where he was wounded and defeated The court of France notwithstanding their frequent experience of the obstinacy of the Hugonots and the vigor of Coligny vainly flattered themselves that the force of the rebels was at last finally annihilated and they neglected further preparations against a foe who they thought could never more become dangerous They were surprised to hear that this leader had appeared without dismay in another quarter of the kingdom had encouraged the young princes whom he governed to like constancy had assembled an army had taken the field and was even strong enough to threaten Paris The public finances diminished by the continued disorders of the kingdom and wasted by so many fruitless military enterprises could no longer bear the charge of a new armament and the king notwithstanding his extreme animosity against the Hugonots was obliged in fifteen seventy to conclude an accommodation with them to grant them a pardon for all past offences and to renew the edicts for liberty of conscience Though a pacification was seemingly concluded the mind of Charles was nowise reconciled to his rebellious subjects and this accommodation like all the foregoing was nothing but a snare by which the perfidious court had projected to destroy at once without danger all its formidable enemies As the two young princes the admiral and the other leaders of the Hugonots instructed by past experience discovered an extreme distrust of the king s intentions and kept themselves in security at a distance all possible artifices were employed to remove their apprehensions and to convince them of the sincerity of the new counsels which seemed to be embraced The terms of the peace were religiously observed to them the toleration was strictly maintained all attempts made by the zealous Catholics to infringe it were punished with severity offices and favors and honors were bestowed on the principal nobility among the Protestants and the king and council every where declared that tired of civil disorders and convinced of the impossibility of forcing men s consciences they were thenceforth determined to allow every one the free exercise of his religion Among the other artifices employed to lull the Protestants into a fatal security Charles affected to enter into close connections with Elizabeth and as it seemed not the interest of France to forward the union of the two kingdoms of Great Britain that princess the more easily flattered herself that the French monarch would prefer her friendship to that of the queen of Scots The better to deceive her proposals of marriage were made her with the duke of Anjou a prince whose youth beauty and reputation for valor might naturally be supposed to recommend him to a woman who had appeared not altogether insensible to these endowments The queen immediately founded on this offer the project of deceiving the court of France and being intent on that artifice she laid herself the more open to be deceived Negotiations were entered into with regard to the marriage terms of the contract were proposed difficulties started and removed and the two courts equally insincere though not equally culpable seemed to approach every day nearer to each other in their demands and concessions The great obstacle seemed to lie in adjusting the difference of religion because Elizabeth who recommended toleration to Charles was determined not to grant it in her own dominions not even to her husband and the duke of Anjou seemed unwilling to submit for the sake of interest to the dishonor of an apostasy Camden p four hundred thirty three Davila lib v Digger s Complete Ambassador p eighty four one hundred ten one hundred eleven The artificial politics of Elizabeth never triumphed so much in any contrivances as in those which were conjoined with her coquetry and as her character in this particular was generally known the court of France thought that they might without danger of forming any final conclusion venture the further in their concessions and offers to her The queen also had other motives for dissimulation Besides the advantage of discouraging Mary s partisans by the prospect of an alliance between France and England her situation with Philip demanded her utmost vigilance and attention and the violent authority established in the Low Countries made her desirous of fortifying herself even with the bare appearance of a new confederacy The theological controversies which had long agitated Europe had from the beginning penetrated into the Low Countries and as these provinces maintained an extensive commerce they had early received from every kingdom with which they corresponded a tincture of religious innovation An opinion at that time prevailed which had been zealously propagated by priests and implicitly received by sovereigns that heresy was closely connected with rebellion and that every great or violent alteration in the church involved a like revolution in the civil government The forward zeal of the reformers would seldom allow them to wait the consent of the magistrate to their innovations they became less dutiful when opposed and punished and though their pretended spirit of reasoning and inquiry was in reality nothing but a new species of implicit faith the prince took the alarm as if so institutions could be secure from the temerity of their researches The emperor Charles who proposed to augment his authority under pretence of defending the Catholic faith easily adopted these political principles and notwithstanding the limited prerogative which he possessed in the Netherlands he published the most arbitrary severe and tyrannical edicts against the Protestants and he took care that the execution of them should be no less violent and sanguinary He was neither cruel nor bigoted in his natural disposition yet an historian celebrated for moderation and caution has computed that in the several persecutions promoted by that monarch no less than a hundred thousand persons perished by the hands of the executioner But these severe remedies far from answering the purposes intended had rather served to augment the numbers as well as zeal of the reformers and the magistrates of the several towns seeing no end of those barbarous executions felt their humanity rebel against their principles and declined any further persecution of the new doctrines Grotii Annal lib i Father Paul another great authority computes in a passage above cited that fifty thousand persons were put to death in the Low Countries alone When Philip succeeded to his father s dominions the Flemings were justly alarmed with new apprehensions lest their prince observing the lenity of the magistrates should take the execution of the edicts from such remiss hands and should establish the inquisition in the Low Countries accompanied with all the iniquities and barbarities which attended it in Spain The severe and unrelenting character of the man his professed attachment to Spanish manners the inflexible bigotry of his principles all these circumstances increased their terror and when he departed the Netherlands with a known intention never to return the disgust of the inhabitants was extremely augmented and their dread of those tyrannical orders which their sovereign surrounded with Spanish ministers would issue from his cabinet at Madrid He left the duchess of Parma governess of the Low Countries and the plain good sense and good temper of that princess had she been intrusted with the sole power would have preserved the submission of those opulent provinces which were lost from that refinement of treacherous and barbarous politics on which Philip so highly valued himself The Flemings found that the name alone of regent remained with the duchess that Cardinal Granville entirely possessed the king s confidence that attempts were every day made on their liberties that a resolution was taken never more to assemble the states that new bishoprics were arbitrarily erected in order to enforce the execution of the persecuting edicts and that on the whole they must expect to be reduced to the condition of a province under the Spanish monarchy The discontents of the nobility gave countenance to the complaints of the gentry which encouraged the mutiny of the populace and all orders of men showed a strong disposition to revolt Associations were formed tumultuary petitions presented names of distinction assumed badges of party displayed and the current of the people impelled by religious zeal and irritated by feeble resistance rose to such a height that in several towns particularly in Antwerp they made an open invasion on the established worship pillaged the churches and monasteries broke the images and committed the most unwarrantable disorders The wiser part of the nobility particularly the prince of Orange and the counts Egmont and Horn were alarmed at these excesses to which their own discontents had at first given countenance and seconding the wisdom of the governess they suppressed the dangerous insurrections punished the ringleaders and reduced all the provinces to a state of order and submission But Philip was not contented with the reestablishment of his ancient authority he considered that provinces so remote from the seat of government could not be ruled by a limited prerogative and that a prince who must entreat rather than command would necessarily when he resided not among the people feel every day a diminution of his power and influence He determined therefore to lay hold of the late popular disorders as a pretence for entirely abolishing the privileges of the Low Country provinces and for ruling them thenceforth with a military and arbitrary authority In the execution of this violent design he employed a man who was a proper instrument in the hands of such a tyrant Ferdinand of Toledo duke of Alva had been educated amidst arms and having attained a consummate knowledge in the military art his habits led him to transfer into all government the severe discipline of a camp and to conceive no measures between prince and subject but those of rigid command and implicit obedience This general in fifteen sixty eight conducted from Italy to the Low Countries a powerful body of veteran Spaniards and his avowed animosity to the Flemings with his known character struck that whole people with terror and consternation It belongs not to our subject to relate at length those violences which Alva s natural barbarity steeled by reflection and aggravated by insolence exercised on those flourishing provinces It suffices to say that all their privileges the gift of so many princes and the inheritance of so many ages were openly and expressly abolished by edict arbitrary and sanguinary tribunals erected the counts Egmont and Horn in spite of their great merits and past services brought to the scaffold multitudes of all ranks thrown into confinement and thence delivered over to the executioner and notwithstanding the peaceable submission of all men nothing was heard of but confiscation imprisonment exile torture and death Elizabeth was equally displeased to see the progress of that scheme laid for the extermination of the Protestants and to observe the erection of so great a military power in a state situated in so near a neighborhood She gave protection to all the Flemish exiles who took shelter in her dominions and as many of these were the most industrious inhabitants of the Netherlands and had rendered that country celebrated for its arts she reaped the advantage of introducing into England some useful manufactures which were formerly unknown in that kingdom Foreseeing that the violent government of Alva could not long subsist without exciting some commotion she ventured to commit an insult upon him which she would have been cautious not to hazard against a more established authority Some Genoese merchants had engaged by contract with Philip to transport into Flanders the sum of four hundred thousand crowns and the vessels on which this money was embarked had been attacked in the Channel by some privateers equipped by the French Hugonots and had taken shelter in Plymouth and Southampton The commanders of the ships pretended that the money belonged to the king of Spain but the queen finding upon inquiry that it was the property of Genoese merchants took possession of it as a loan and by that means deprived the duke of Alva of this resource in the time of his greatest necessity Alva in revenge seized all the English merchants in the Low Countries threw them into prison and confiscated their effects The queen retaliated by a like violence on the Flemish and Spanish merchants and gave all the English liberty to make reprisals on the subjects of Philip These differences were afterwards accommodated by treaty and mutual reparations were made to the merchants but nothing could repair the loss which so well timed a blow inflicted on the Spanish government in the Low Countries Alva in want of money and dreading the immediate mutiny of his troops to whom great arrears were due imposed by his arbitrary will the most ruinous taxes on the people He not only required the hundredth penny and the twentieth of all immovable goods he also demanded the tenth of all movable goods on every sale an absurd tyranny which would not only have destroyed all arts and commerce but even have restrained the common intercourse of life The people refused compliance the duke had recourse to his usual expedient of the gibbet and thus matters came still nearer the last extremities between the Flemings and the Spaniards All the enemies of Elizabeth in order to revenge themselves for her insults had naturally recourse to one policy the supporting of the cause and pretensions of the queen of Scots and Alva whose measures were ever violent soon opened a secret intercourse with that princess There was one Rodolphi a Florentine merchant who had resided about fifteen years in London and who while he conducted his commerce in England had managed all the correspondence of the court of Rome with the Catholic nobility and gentry Bentivoglio part i lib v Camden p four hundred sixteen Lesley p one hundred twenty three State Trials vol i p eighty seven He had been thrown into prison at the time when the duke of Norfolk s intrigues with Mary had been discovered but either no proof was found against him or the part which he had acted was not very criminal and he soon after recovered his liberty This man zealous for the Catholic faith had formed a scheme in concert with the Spanish ambassador for subverting the government by a foreign invasion and a domestic insurrection and when he communicated his project by letter to Mary he found that as she was now fully convinced of Elizabeth s artifices and despaired of ever recovering her authority or even her liberty by pacific measures she willingly gave her concurrence The great number of discontented Catholics were the chief source of their hopes on the side of England and they also observed that the kingdom was at that time full of indigent gentry chiefly younger brothers who having at present by the late decay of the church and the yet languishing state of commerce no prospect of a livelihood suitable to their birth were ready to throw themselves into any desperate enterprise But in order to inspire life and courage into all these malecontents it was requisite that some great nobleman should put himself at their head and no one appeared to Rodolphi and to the bishop of Ross who entered into all these intrigues so proper both on account of his power and his popularity as the duke of Norfolk This nobleman when released from confinement in the Tower had given his promise that he would drop all intercourse with the queen of Scots but finding that he had lost and as he feared beyond recovery the confidence and favor of Elizabeth and being still in some degree restrained from his liberty he was tempted by impatience and despair to violate his word and to open anew his correspondence with the captive princess A promise of marriage was renewed between them the duke engaged to enter into all her interests and as his remorses gradually diminished in the course of these transactions he was pushed to give his consent to enterprises still more criminal Rodolphi s plan was that the duke of Alva should on some other pretence assemble a great quantity of shipping in the Low Countries should transport a body of six thousand foot and four thousand horse into England should land them at Harwich where the duke of Norfolk was to join them with all his friends should thence march directly to London and oblige the queen to submit to whatever terms the conspirators should please to impose upon her Norfolk expressed his assent to this plan and three letters in consequence of it were written in his name by Rodolphi one to Alva another to the pope and a third to the king of Spain but the duke apprehensive of the danger refused to sign them v Lesley p one hundred twenty three Haynes p five hundred seventy one State Trials vol i p one hundred two Lesley p one hundred fifty five State Trials vol i p eighty six eighty seven v Lesley p one hundred fifty nine one hundred sixty one Camden p four hundred thirty two He only sent to the Spanish ambassador a servant and confidant named Barker as well to notify his concurrence in the plan as to vouch for the authenticity of these letters and Rodolphi having obtained a letter of credence from the ambassador proceeded on his journey to Brussels and to Rome The duke of Alva and the pope embraced the scheme with alacrity Rodolphi informed Norfolk of their intentions and every thing seemed to concur in forwarding the undertaking Norfolk notwithstanding these criminal enterprises had never entirely forgotten his duty to his sovereign his country and his religion and though he had laid the plan both of an invasion and an insurrection he still flattered himself that the innocence of his intentions would justify the violence of his measures and that as he aimed at nothing but the liberty of the queen of Scots and the obtaining of Elizabeth s consent to his marriage he could not justly reproach himself as a rebel and a traitor It is certain however that considering the queen s vigor and spirit the scheme if successful must finally have ended in dethroning her and her authority was here exposed to the utmost danger The conspiracy hitherto had entirely escaped the vigilance of Elizabeth and that of Secretary Cecil who now bore the title of Lord Burleigh It was from another attempt of Norfolk s that they first obtained a hint which being diligently traced led at last to a full discovery Mary had intended to send a sum of money to Lord Herreis and her partisans in Scotland and Norfolk undertook to have it delivered to Bannister a servant of his at that time in the north who was to find some expedient for conveying it to Lord Herreis He intrusted the money to a servant who was not in the secret and told him that the bag contained a sum of money in silver which he was to deliver to Bannister with a letter but the servant conjecturing from the weight and size of the bag that it was full of gold carried the letter to Burleigh who immediately ordered Bannister Barker and Hicford the duke s secretary to be put under arrest and to undergo a severe examination Torture made them confess the whole truth and as Hicford though ordered to burn all papers had carefully kept them concealed under the mats of the duke s chamber and under the tiles of the house full evidence now appeared against his master State Trials vol i p ninety three Lesley p one hundred fifty

guilt by a full confession he persisted in denying every crime with which he was charged The queen always declared that if he had given her this proof of his sincere repentance she would have pardoned all his former offences but finding him obstinate she committed him to the Tower and ordered him to be brought to his trial The bishop of Ross had on some suspicion been committed to custody before the discovery of Norfolk s guilt and every expedient was employed to make him reveal his share in the conspiracy He at first insisted on his privilege but he was told that as his mistress was no longer a sovereign he would not be regarded as an ambassador and that even if that character were allowed it did not warrant him in conspiring against the sovereign at whose court he resided As he still refused to answer interrogatories he was informed of the confession made by Norfolk s servants after which he no longer scrupled to make a full discovery and his evidence put the guilt of that nobleman beyond all question A jury of twenty five peers unanimously passed sentence upon him The trial was quite regular even according to the strict rules observed at present in these matters except that the witnesses gave not their evidence in court and were not confronted with the prisoner a laudable practice which was not at that time observed in trials for high treason The queen still hesitated concerning Norfolk s execution whether that she was really moved by friendship and compassion towards a peer of that rank and merit or that affecting the praise of clemency she only put on the appearance of these sentiments Twice she signed a warrant for his execution and twice revoked the fatal sentence and though her ministers and counsellors pushed her to rigor she still appeared irresolute and undetermined Lesley p one hundred seventy five Lesley p one hundred eighty nine Spotswood Carte p five hundred twenty seven from Fenelon s Despatches Digges p one hundred sixty six Strype vol ii p eighty three After four months hesitation a parliament was assembled and the commons addressed her in strong terms for the execution of the duke a sanction which when added to the greatness and certainty of his guilt would she thought justify in the eyes of all mankind her severity against that nobleman Norfolk died with calmness and constancy and though he cleared himself of any disloyal intentions against the queen s authority he acknowledged the justice of the sentence by which he suffered That we may relate together affairs of a similar nature we shall mention that the earl of Northumberland being delivered up to the queen by the regent of Scotland was also a few months after brought to the scaffold for his rebellion The queen of Scots was either the occasion or the cause of all these disturbances but as she was a sovereign princess and might reasonably from the harsh treatment which she had met with think herself entitled to use any expedient for her relief Elizabeth durst not as yet form any resolution of proceeding to extremities against her She only sent Lord Delawar Sir Ralph Sadler Sir Thomas Bromley and doctor Wilson to expostulate with her and to demand satisfaction for all those parts of her conduct which from the beginning of her life had given displeasure to Elizabeth her assuming the arms of England refusing to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh intending to marry Norfolk without the queen s consent concurring in the northern rebellion practising with Rodolphi to engage the king of Spain in an invasion of England procuring the pope s bull of excommunication and allowing her friends abroad to give her the title of queen of England Mary justified herself from the several articles of the charge either by denying the facts imputed to her or by throwing the blame on others But the queen was little satisfied with her apology and the parliament was so enraged against her that the commons made a direct application for her immediate trial and execution They employed some topics derived from practice and reason and the laws of nations but the chief stress was laid on passages and examples from the Old Testament v which if considered as a general rule of conduct an intention which it is unreasonable to suppose would lead to consequences destructive of all principles of humanity and morality Matters were here carried further than Elizabeth intended and that princess satisfied with showing Mary the disposition of the nation sent to the house her express commands not to deal any further at present with the affair of the Scottish queen v Camden p four hundred forty Strype vol ii App p twenty three Digges p sixteen one hundred seven Strype vol ii p fifty one fifty two Digges p one hundred ninety four two hundred

Nothing could be a stronger proof that the puritanical interest prevailed in the house than the intemperate use of authorities derived from Scripture especially from the Old Testament and the queen was so little a lover of that sect that she was not likely to make any concession merely in deference to their solicitation She showed this session her disapprobation of their schemes in another remarkable instance The commons had passed two bills for regulating ecclesiastical ceremonies but she sent them a like imperious message with her former ones and by the terror of her prerogative she stopped all further proceeding in those matters But though Elizabeth would not carry matters to such extremities against Mary as were recommended by the parliament she was alarmed at the great interest and the restless spirit of that princess as well as her close connections with Spain and she thought it necessary both to increase the rigor and strictness of her confinement and to follow maxims different from those which she had hitherto pursued in her management of Scotland That kingdom remained still in a state of anarchy The Castle of Edinburgh commanded by Kirkaldy of Grange had declared for Mary and the lords of that party encouraged by his countenance had taken possession of the capital and carried on a vigorous war against the regent By a sudden and unexpected inroad they seized that nobleman at Stirling but finding that his friends sallying from the castle were likely to rescue him they instantly put him to death The earl of Marre was chosen regent in his room and found the same difficulties in the government of that divided country He was therefore glad to accept of the mediation offered by the French and English ambassadors and to conclude on equal terms a truce with the queen s party He was a man of free and generous spirit and scorned to submit to any dependence on England and for this reason Elizabeth who had then formed intimate connections with France yielded with less reluctance to the solicitations of that court still maintained the appearance of neutrality between the parties and allowed matters to remain on a balance in Scotland D Ewes p two hundred thirteen two hundred thirty eight Digges p one hundred fifty two Spotswood p two hundred sixty three Digges p one hundred fifty six one hundred sixty five one hundred sixty nine But affairs soon after took a new turn Marre died of melancholy with which the distracted state of the country affected him Morton was chosen regent and as this nobleman had secretly taken all his measures with Elizabeth who no longer relied on the friendship of the French court she resolved to exert herself more effectually for the support of the party which she had always favored She sent Sir Henry Killegrew ambassador to Scotland who found Mary s partisans so discouraged by the discovery and punishment of Norfolk s conspiracy that they were glad to submit to the king s authority and accept of an indemnity for all past offences The duke of Chatelrault and the earl of Huntley with the most considerable of Mary s friends laid down their arms on these conditions The garrison alone of the Castle of Edinburgh continued refractory Kirkaldy s fortunes were desperate and he flattered himself with the hopes of receiving assistance from the kings of France and Spain who encouraged his obstinacy in the view of being able from that quarter to give disturbance to England Elizabeth was alarmed with the danger she no more apprehended making an entire breach with the queen of Scots who she found would not any longer be amused by her artifices she had an implicit reliance on Morton and she saw that by the submission of all the considerable nobility the pacification of Scotland would be an easy as well as a most important undertaking She ordered therefore Sir William Drury governor of Berwick to march with some troops and artillery to Edinburgh and to besiege the castle Spotswood p two hundred sixty eight Camden p four hundred forty three The garrison surrendered at discretion Kirkaldy was delivered into the hands of his countrymen by whom he was tried condemned and executed Secretary Lidington who had taken part with him died soon after a voluntary death as is supposed and Scotland submitting entirely to the regent gave not during a long time any further inquietude to Elizabeth The events which happened in France were not so agreeable to the queen s interests and inclinations The fallacious pacifications which had been so often made with the Hugonots gave them reason to suspect the present intentions of the court and after all the other leaders of that party were deceived into a dangerous credulity the sagacious admiral still remained doubtful and uncertain But his suspicions were at last overcome partly by the profound dissimulation of Charles partly by his own earnest desire to end the miseries of France and return again to the performance of his duty towards his prince and country He considered besides that as the former violent conduct of the court had ever met with such fatal success it was not unlikely that a prince who had newly come to years of discretion and appeared not to be rivetted in any dangerous animosities or prejudices would be induced to govern himself by more moderate maxims And as Charles was young was of a passionate hasty temper and addicted to pleasure such deep perfidy seemed either remote from his character or difficult and almost impossible to be so uniformly supported by him Moved by these considerations the admiral the queen of Navarre and all the Hugonots began to repose themselves in full security and gave credit to the treacherous caresses and professions of the French court Elizabeth herself notwithstanding her great experience and penetration entertained not the least distrust of Charles s sincerity and being pleased to find her enemies of the house of Guise removed from all authority and to observe an animosity every day growing between the French and Spanish monarchs she concluded a defensive league with the former and regarded this alliance as an invincible barrier to her throne Walsingham her ambassador sent her over by every courier the most satisfactory accounts of the honor and plain dealing and fidelity of that perfidious prince Digges p eight thirty nine Camden p four hundred forty three The better to blind the jealous Hugonots and draw their leaders into the snare prepared for them Charles offered his sister Margaret in marriage to the prince of Navarre and the admiral with all the considerable nobility of the party had come to Paris in order to assist at the celebration of these nuptials which it was hoped would finally if not compose the differences at least appease the bloody animosity of the two religions The queen of Navarre was poisoned by orders from the court the admiral was dangerously wounded by an assassin yet Charles redoubling his dissimulation was still able to retain the Hugonots in their security till on the evening of saint Bartholomew a few days after the marriage the signal was given for a general massacre of those religionists and the king himself in person led the way to these assassinations The hatred long entertained by the Parisians against the Protestants made them second without any preparation the fury of the court and persons of every condition age and sex suspected of any propensity to that religion were involved in an undistinguished ruin The admiral his son in law Teligni Soubize Rochefoucault Pardaillon Piles Lavardin men who during the late wars had signalized themselves by the most heroic actions were miserably butchered without resistance the streets of Paris flowed with blood and the people more enraged than satiated with their cruelty as if repining that death had saved their victims from further insult exercised on their dead bodies all the rage of the most licentious brutality About five hundred gentlemen and men of rank perished in this massacre and near ten thousand of inferior condition Orders were instantly despatched to all the provinces for a like general execution of the Protestants and in Rouen Lyons and many other cities the people emulated the fury of the capital Even the murder of the king of Navarre and prince of Conde had been proposed by the duke of Guise but Charles softened by the amiable manners of the king of Navarre and hoping that these young princes might easily be converted to the Catholic faith determined to spare their lives though he obliged them to purchase their safety by a seeming change of their religion Charles in order to cover this barbarous perfidy pretended that a conspiracy of the Hugonots to seize his person had been suddenly detected and that he had been necessitated for his own defence to proceed to this severity against them He sent orders to Fenelon his ambassador in England to ask an audience and to give Elizabeth this account of the late transaction That minister a man of probity abhorred the treachery and cruelty of his court and even scrupled not to declare that he was now ashamed to bear the name of Frenchman yet he was obliged to obey his orders and make use of the apology which had been prescribed to him He met with that reception from all the courtiers which he knew the conduct of his master had so well merited Nothing could be more awful and affecting than the solemnity of his audience A melancholy sorrow sat on every face silence as in the dead of night reigned through all the chambers of the royal apartment the courtiers and ladies clad in deep mourning were ranged on each side and allowed him to pass without affording him one salute or favorable look till he was admitted to the queen herself Davila lib v Digges p twenty four Carte vol iii p five hundred twenty two That princess received him with a more easy if not a more gracious countenance and heard from Fenelon s Despatches his apology without discovering any visible symptoms of indignation She then told him that though on the first rumor of this dreadful intelligence she had been astonished that so many brave men and loyal subjects who rested secure on the faith of their sovereign should have been suddenly butchered in so barbarous a manner she had hitherto suspended her judgment till further and more certain information should be brought her that the account which he had given even if founded on no mistake or bad information though it might alleviate would by no means remove the blame of the king s counsellors or justify the strange irregularity of their proceedings that the same force which without resistance had massacred so many defenceless men could easily have secured their persons and have reserved them for a trial and for punishment by a legal sentence which would have distinguished the innocent from the guilty that the admiral in particular being dangerously wounded and environed by the guards of the king on whose protection he seemed entirely to rely had no means of escape and might surely before his death have been convicted of the crimes imputed to him that it was more worthy of a sovereign to reserve in his own hands the sword of justice than to commit it to bloody murderers who being the declared and mortal enemies of the persons accused employed it without mercy and without distinction that if these sentiments were just even supposing the conspiracy of the Protestants to be real how much more so if that crime was a calumny of their enemies invented for their destruction that if upon inquiry the innocence of these unhappy victims should afterwards appear it was the king s duty to turn his vengeance on their defamers who had thus cruelly abused his confidence had murdered so many of his brave subjects and had done what in them lay to cover him with everlasting dishonor and that for her part she should form her judgment of his intentions by his subsequent conduct and in the mean time should act as desired by the ambassador and rather pity than blame his master for the extremities to which he had been carried Digges p two hundred forty seven two hundred forty eight Elizabeth was fully sensible of the dangerous situation in which she now stood In the massacre of Paris she saw the result of that general conspiracy formed for the extermination of the Protestants and she knew that she herself as the head and protectress of the new religion was exposed to the fury and resentment of the Catholics The violence and cruelty of the Spaniards in the Low Countries was another branch of the same conspiracy and as Charles and Philip two princes nearly allied in perfidy and barbarity as well as in bigotry had now laid aside their pretended quarrel and had avowed the most entire friendship she had reason as soon as they had appeased their domestic commotions to dread the effects of their united counsels The duke of Guise also and his family whom Charles in order to deceive the admiral had hitherto kept at a distance had now acquired an open and entire ascendant in the court of France and she was sensible that these princes from personal as well as political reasons were her declared and implacable enemies The queen of Scots their near relation and close confederate was the pretender to her throne and though detained in custody was actuated by a restless spirit and besides her foreign allies possessed numerous and zealous partisans in the heart of the kingdom For these reasons Elizabeth thought it more prudent not to reject all commerce with the French monarch but still to listen to the professions of friendship which he made her She allowed even the negotiations to be renewed for her marriage with the duke of Alencon Charles s third brother those with the duke of Anjou had already been broken off She sent the earl of Worcester to assist in her name at the baptism of a young princess born to Charles but before she agreed to give him this last mark of condescension she thought it becoming her dignity to renew her expressions of blame and even of detestation against the cruelties exercised on his Protestant subjects Meanwhile she prepared herself for that attack which seemed to threaten her from the combined power and violence of the Romanists she fortified Portsmouth put her fleet in order exercised her militia cultivated popularity with her subjects acted with vigor for the further reduction of Scotland under obedience to the young king and renewed her alliance with the German princes who were no less alarmed than herself at these treacherous and sanguinary measures so universally embraced by the Catholics Digges p two hundred sixty eight two hundred eighty two Digges passim Camden p four hundred forty seven Digges p two hundred ninety seven two hundred ninety eight Camden p four hundred forty seven But though Elizabeth cautiously avoided coming to extremities with Charles the greatest security that she possessed against his violence was derived from the difficulties which the obstinate resistance of the Hugonots still created to him Such of that sect as lived near the frontiers immediately on the first news of the massacres fled into England Germany or Switzerland where they excited the compassion and indignation of the Protestants and prepared themselves with increased forces and redoubled zeal to return into France and avenge the treacherous slaughter of their brethren Those who lived in the middle of the kingdom took shelter in the nearest garrisons occupied by the Hugonots and finding that they could repose no faith in capitulations and expect no clemency were determined to defend themselves to the last extremity The sect which Charles had hoped at one blow to exterminate had now an army of eighteen thousand men on foot and possessed in different parts of the kingdom above a hundred cities castles or fortresses nor could that prince deem himself secure from the invasion threatened him by all the other Protestants in Europe The nobility and gentry of England were roused to such a pitch of resentment that they offered to levy an army of twenty two thousand foot and four thousand horse to transport them into France and to maintain them six months at their own charge but Elizabeth who was cautious in her measures and who feared to inflame further the quarrel between the two religions by these dangerous crusades refused her consent and moderated the zeal of her subjects The German princes less political or more secure from the resentment of France forwarded the levies made by the Protestants and the young prince of Conde having escaped from court put himself at the head of these troops and prepared to invade the kingdom The duke of Alencon the king of Navarre the family of Montmorency and many considerable men even among the Catholics displeased either on a private or public account with the measures of the court favored the progress of the Hugonots and every thing relapsed into confusion The king instead of repenting his violent counsels which had brought matters to such extremities called aloud for new violences nor could even the mortal distemper under which he labored moderate the rage and animosity by which he was actuated He died without male issue at the age of twenty five years a prince whose character containing that unusual mixture of dissimulation and ferocity of quick resentment and unrelenting vengeance executed the greatest mischiefs and threatened still worse both to his native country and to all Europe Digges p three hundred forty three Digges p three hundred thirty five three hundred forty one Davila lib Henry duke of Anjou who had some time before been elected king of Poland no sooner heard of his brother s death than he hastened to take possession of the throne of France and found the kingdom not only involved in the greatest present disorders but exposed to infirmities for which it was extremely difficult to provide any suitable remedy The people were divided into two theological factions furious from their zeal and mutually enraged from the injuries which they had committed or suffered and as all faith had been violated and moderation banished it seemed impracticable to find any terms of composition between them Each party had devoted itself to leaders whose commands had more authority than the will of the sovereign and even the Catholics to whom the king was attached were entirely conducted by the counsels of Guise and his family The religious connections had on both sides superseded the civil or rather for men will always be guided by present interest two empires being secretly formed in the kingdom every individual was engaged by new views of interest to follow those leaders to whom during the course of past convulsions he had been indebted for his honors and preferment Henry observing the low condition of the crown had laid a scheme for restoring his own authority by acting as umpire between the parties by moderating their differences and by reducing both to a dependence upon himself He possessed all the talents of dissimulation requisite for the execution of this delicate plan but being deficient in vigor application and sound judgment instead of acquiring a superiority over both factions he lost the confidence of both and taught the partisans of each to adhere still more closely to their particular leaders whom they found more cordial and sincere in the cause which they espoused The Hugonots were strengthened by the accession of a German army under the prince of Conde and Prince Casimir but much more by the credit and personal virtues of the king of Navarre who having fled from court had placed himself at the head of that formidable party Henry in prosecution of his plan entered into a composition with them and being desirous of preserving a balance between the sects he granted them peace on the most advantageous conditions This was the fifth general peace made with the Hugonots but though it was no more sincere on the part of the court than any of the former it gave the highest disgust to the Catholics and afforded the duke of Guise the desired pretence of declaiming against the measures and maxims and conduct of the king That artful and bold leader took thence an occasion of reducing his party into a more formed and regular body and he laid the first foundations of the famous league which without paying any regard to the royal authority aimed at the entire suppression of the Hugonots Such was the unhappy condition of France from the past severities and violent conduct of its princes that toleration could no longer be admitted and a concession for liberty of conscience which would probably have appeased the reformers excited the greatest resentment in the Catholics Henry in order to divert the force of the league from himself and even to elude its efforts against the Hugonots declared himself the head of that seditious confederacy and took the field as leader of the Romanists But his dilatory and feeble measures betrayed his reluctance to the undertaking and after some unsuccessful attempts he concluded a new peace which though less favorable than the former to the Protestants gave no contentment to the Catholics Mutual diffidence still prevailed between the parties the king s moderation was suspicious to both each faction continued to fortify itself against that breach which they foresaw must speedily ensue theological controversy daily whetted the animosity of the sects and every private injury became the ground of a public quarrel The king hoping by his artifice and subtlety to allure the nation into a love of pleasure and repose was himself caught in the snare and sinking into a dissolute indolence wholly lost the esteem and in a great measure the affections of his people Instead of advancing such men of character and abilities as were neuters between these dangerous factions he gave all his confidence to young agreeable favorites who unable to prop his falling authority leaned entirely upon it and inflamed the general odium against his administration The public burdens increased by his profuse liberality and felt more heavy on a disordered kingdom became another ground of complaint and the uncontrolled animosity of parties joined to the multiplicity of taxes rendered peace more calamitous than any open state of foreign or even domestic hostility The artifices of the king too refined to succeed and too frequent to be concealed and the plain direct and avowed conduct of the duke of Guise on one side and that of the king of Navarre on the other drew by degrees the generality of the nation to devote themselves without reserve to one or the other of those great leaders The civil commotions of France were of too general importance to be overlooked by the other princes of Europe and Elizabeth s foresight and vigilance though somewhat restrained by her frugality led her to take secretly some part in them Besides employing on all occasions her good offices in favor of the Hugonots she had expended no inconsiderable sums in levying that army of Germans which the prince of Conde and Prince Casimir conducted into France and notwithstanding her negotiations with the court and her professions of amity she always considered her own interests as connected with the prosperity of the French Protestants and the depression of the house of Guise Philip on the other hand had declared himself protector of the league had entered into the closest correspondence with Guise and had employed all his authority in supporting the credit of that factious leader This sympathy of religion which of itself begat a connection of interests was one considerable inducement but that monarch had also in view the subduing of his rebellious subjects in the Netherlands who as they received great encouragement from the French Protestants would he hoped finally despair of success after the entire suppression of their friends and confederates Camden p four hundred fifty two The same political views which engaged Elizabeth to support the Hugonots would have led her to assist the distressed Protestants in the Low Countries but the mighty power of Philip the tranquillity of all his other dominions and the great force which he maintained in these mutinous provinces kept her in awe and obliged her notwithstanding all temptations and all provocations to preserve some terms of amity with that monarch The Spanish ambassador represented to her that many of the Flemish exiles who infested the seas and preyed on his master s subjects were received into the harbors of England and were there allowed to dispose of their prizes and by these remonstrances the queen found herself under a necessity of denying them all entrance into her dominions But this measure proved in the issue extremely prejudicial to the interests of Philip These desperate exiles finding no longer any possibility of subsistence were forced to attempt the most perilous enterprises and they made an assault on the Brille a seaport town in Holland where they met with success and after a short resistance became masters of the place Camden p four hundred forty three The duke of Alva was alarmed at the danger and stopping those bloody executions which he was making on the defenceless Flemings he hastened with his army to extinguish the flame which falling on materials so well prepared for combustion seemed to menace a general conflagration His fears soon appeared to be well grounded The people in the neighborhood of the Brille enraged by that complication of cruelty oppression insolence usurpation and persecution under which they and all their countrymen labored flew to arms and in a few days almost all the whole province of Holland and that of Zealand had revolted from the Spaniards and had openly declared against the tyranny of Alva This event happened in the year fifteen seventy two William prince of Orange descended from a sovereign family of great lustre and antiquity in Germany inheriting the possessions of a sovereign family in France had fixed his residence in the Low Countries and on account of his noble birth and immense riches as well as of his personal merit was universally regarded as the greatest subject that lived in those provinces He had opposed by all regular and dutiful means the progress of the Spanish usurpations and when Alva conducted his army into the Netherlands and assumed the government this prince well acquainted with the violent character of the man and the tyrannical spirit of the court of Madrid wisely fled from the danger which threatened him and retired to his paternal estate and dominions in Germany He was cited to appear before Alva s tribunal was condemned in absence was declared a rebel and his ample possessions in the Low Countries were confiscated In revenge he had levied an army of Protestants in the empire and had made some attempts to restore the Flemings to liberty but was still repulsed with loss by the vigilance and military conduct of Alva and by the great bravery as well as discipline of those veteran Spaniards who served under that general The revolt of Holland and Zealand provinces which the prince of Orange had formerly commanded and where he was much beloved called him anew from his retreat and he added conduct no less than spirit to that obstinate resistance which was here made to the Spanish dominion By uniting the revolted cities in a league he laid the foundation of that illustrious commonwealth the offspring of industry and liberty whose arms and policy have long made so signal a figure in every transaction of Europe He inflamed the inhabitants by every motive which religious zeal resentment or love of freedom could inspire Though the present greatness of the Spanish monarchy might deprive them of all courage he still flattered them with the concurrence of the other provinces and with assistance from neighboring states and he exhorted them in defence of their religion their liberties their lives to endure the utmost extremities of war From this spirit proceeded the desperate defence of Harlem a defence which nothing but the most consuming famine could overcome and which the Spaniards revenged by the execution of more than two thousand of the inhabitants This extreme severity instead of striking terror into the Hollanders animated them by despair and the vigorous resistance made at Alemaer where Alva was finally repulsed showed them that their insolent enemies were not invincible The duke finding at last the pernicious effects of his violent counsels solicited to be recalled Medinaceli who was appointed his successor refused to accept the government Requesens commendator of Castile was sent from Italy to replace Alva and this tyrant departed from the Netherlands in fifteen seventy four leaving his name in execration to the inhabitants and boasting in his turn that during the course of five years he had delivered above eighteen thousand of these rebellious heretics into the hands of the executioner Bentivoglio lib vol one Grotius lib ii Requesens though a man of milder dispositions could not appease the violent hatred which the revolted Hollanders had conceived against the Spanish government and the war continued as obstinate as ever In the siege of Leyden under taken by the Spaniards the Dutch opened the dikes and sluices in order to drive them from the enterprise and the very peasants were active in ruining their fields by an inundation rather than fall again under the hated tyranny of Spain But notwithstanding this repulse the governor still pursued the war and the contest seemed too unequal between so mighty a monarchy and two small provinces however fortified by nature and however defended by the desperate resolution of the inhabitants The prince of Orange therefore in fifteen seventy five was resolved to sue for foreign succor and to make applications to one or other of his great neighbors Henry or Elizabeth The court of France was not exempt from the same spirit of tyranny and persecution which prevailed among the Spaniards and that kingdom torn by domestic dissensions seemed not to enjoy at present either leisure or ability to pay regard to foreign interests But England long connected both by commerce and alliance with the Netherlands and now more concerned in the fate of the revolted provinces by sympathy in religion seemed naturally interested in their defence and as Elizabeth had justly entertained great jealousy of Philip and governed her kingdom in perfect tranquillity hopes were entertained that her policy her ambition or her generosity would engage her to support them under their present calamities They sent therefore a solemn embassy to London consisting of saint Aldegonde Douza Nivelle Buys and Melsen and after employing the most humble supplications to the queen they offered her the possession and sovereignty of their provinces if she would exert her power in their defence There were many strong motives which might impel Elizabeth to accept of so liberal an offer She was apprised of the injuries which Philip had done her by his intrigues with the malecontents in England and Ireland she foresaw the danger which she must incur from a total prevalence of the Catholics in the Low Countries and the maritime situation of those provinces as well as their command over the great rivers was an inviting circumstance to a nation like the English who were beginning to cultivate commerce and naval power Digges p seventy three But this princess though magnanimous had never entertained the ambition of making conquests or gaining new acquisitions and the whole purpose of her vigilant and active politics was to maintain by the most frugal and cautious expedients the tranquillity of her own dominions An open war with the Spanish monarchy was the apparent consequence of her accepting the dominion of these provinces and after taking the inhabitants under her protection she could never afterwards in honor abandon them but however desperate their defence might become she must embrace it even further than her convenience or interests would permit For these reasons she refused in positive terms the sovereignty proffered her but told the ambassadors that in return for the good will which the prince of Orange and the states had shown her she would endeavor to mediate an agreement for them on the most reasonable terms that could be obtained Camden p four hundred fifty three four hundred fifty four She sent accordingly Sir Henry Cobham to Philip and represented to him the danger which he would incur of losing entirely the Low Countries if France could obtain the least interval from her intestine disorders and find leisure to offer her protection to those mutinous and discontented provinces Philip seemed to take this remonstrance in good part but no accord ensued and war in the Netherlands continued with the same rage and violence as before It was an accident that delivered the Hollanders from their present desperate situation Requesens the governor dying suddenly the Spanish troops discontented for want of pay and licentious for want of a proper authority to command them broke into a furious mutiny and threw every thing into confusion They sacked and pillaged the cities of Maestricht and Antwerp and executed great slaughter on the inhabitants they threatened the other cities with a like fate and all the provinces excepting Luxembourg united for mutual defence against their violence and called in the prince of Orange and the Hollanders as their protectors A treaty commonly called the Pacification of Ghent was formed by common agreement and the removal of foreign troops with the restoration of their ancient liberties was the object which the provinces mutually stipulated to pursue Don John of Austria natural brother to Philip being appointed governor found on his arrival at Luxembourg that the states had so fortified themselves and that the Spanish troops were so divided by their situation that there was no possibility of resistance and he agreed to the terms required of him The Spaniards evacuated the country and these provinces seemed at last to breathe a little from their calamities But it was not easy to settle entire peace while the thirst of revenge and dominion governed the king of Spain and while the Flemings were so strongly agitated with resentment of past and fear of future injuries The ambition of Don John who coveted this great theatre for his military talents engaged him rather to inflame than appease the quarrel and as he found the states determined to impose very strict limitations on his authority he broke all articles seized Namur and procured the recall of the Spanish army from Italy This prince endowed with a lofty genius and elated by the prosperous successes of his youth had opened his mind to vast undertakings and looking much beyond the conquest of the revolted provinces had projected to espouse the queen of Scots and to acquire in her right the dominion of the British kingdoms Elizabeth was aware of his intentions and seeing now from the union of all the provinces a fair prospect of their making a long and vigorous defence against Spain she no longer scrupled to embrace the protection of their liberties which seemed so intimately connected with her own safety After sending them a sum of money about twenty thousand pounds for the immediate pay of their troops she concluded a treaty with them in which she stipulated to assist them with five thousand foot and a thousand horse at the charge of the Flemings and to lend them a hundred thousand pounds on receiving the bonds of some of the most considerable towns of the Netherlands for her repayment within the year It was further agreed that the commander of the English army should be admitted into the council of the states and nothing be determined concerning war or peace without previously informing the queen or him of it that they should enter into no league without her consent that if any discord arose among themselves it should be referred to her arbitration and that if any prince on any pretext should attempt hostilities against her they should send to her assistance an army equal to that which she had employed in their defence This alliance was signed on the seventh of January fifteen seventy eight Camden p four hundred sixty six Grotius lib iii Camden p four hundred sixty six One considerable inducement to the queen for entering into treaty with the states was to prevent their throwing themselves into the arms of France and she was desirous to make the king of Spain believe that it was her sole motive She represented to him by her ambassador Thomas Wilkes that hitherto she had religiously acted the part of a good neighbor and ally had refused the sovereignty of Holland and Zealand when offered her had advised the prince of Orange to submit to the king and had even accompanied her counsel with menaces in case of his refusal She persevered she said in the same friendly intentions and as a proof of it would venture to interpose with her advice for the composure of the present differences let Don John whom she could not but regard as her mortal enemy be recalled let some other prince more popular be substituted in his room let the Spanish armies be withdrawn let the Flemings be restored to their ancient liberties and privileges and if after these concessions they were still obstinate not to return to their duty she promised to join her arms with those of the king of Spain and force them to compliance Philip dissembled his resentment against the queen and still continued to supply Don John with money and troops That prince though once repulsed at Rimenant by the valor of the English under Norris and though opposed as well by the army of the states as by Prince Casimir who had conducted to the Low Countries a great body of Germans paid by the queen gained a great advantage over the Flemings at Gemblours but was cut off in the midst of his prosperity by poison given him secretly as was suspected by orders from Philip who dreaded his ambition The prince of Parma succeeded to the command who uniting valor and clemency negotiation and military exploits made great progress against the revolted Flemings and advanced the progress of the Spaniards by his arts as well as by his arms During these years while Europe was almost every where in great commotion England enjoyed a profound tranquillity owing chiefly to the prudence and vigor of the queen s administration and to the wise precautions which she employed in all her measures By supporting the zealous Protestants in Scotland she had twice given them the superiority over their antagonists had closely connected their interests with her own and had procured herself entire security from that quarter whence the most dangerous invasions could be made upon her She saw in France her enemies the Guises though extremely powerful yet counterbalanced by the Hugo nots her zealous partisans and even hated by the king who was jealous of their restless and exorbitant ambition The bigotry of Philip gave her just ground of anxiety but the same bigotry had happily excited the most obstinate opposition among his own subjects and had created him enemies whom his arms and policy were not likely soon to subdue The queen of Scots her antagonist and rival and the pretender to her throne was a prisoner in her hands and by her impatience and high spirit had been engaged in practices which afforded the queen a pretence for rendering her confinement more rigorous and for cutting off her communication with her partisans in England Religion was the capital point on which depended all the political transactions of that age and the queen s conduct in this particular making allowance for the prevailing prejudices of the times could scarcely be accused of severity or imprudence She established no inquisition into men s bosoms she imposed no oath of supremacy except on those who received trust or emolument from the public and though the exercise of every religion but the established was prohibited by statute the violation of this law by saying mass and receiving the sacrament in private houses was in many instances connived at while on the other hand the Catholics in the beginning of her reign showed little reluctance against going to church or frequenting the ordinary duties of public worship The pope sensible that this practice would by degrees reconcile all his partisans to the reformed religion hastened the publication of the bull which excommunicated the queen and freed her subjects from their oaths of allegiance and great pains were taken by the emissaries of Rome to render the breach between the two religions as wide as possible and to make the frequenting of Protestant churches appear highly criminal in the Catholics These practices with the rebellion which ensued increased the vigilance and severity of the government but the Romanists if their condition were compared with that of the nonconformists in other countries and with their own maxims where they domineered could not justly complain of violence or persecution Camden p four hundred fifty nine Walsingham s Letter in Burnet vol ii p four hundred eighteen Cabala p four hundred six The queen appeared rather more anxious to keep a strict hand over the Puritans who though their pretensions were not so immediately dangerous to her authority seemed to be actuated by a more unreasonable obstinacy and to retain claims of which both in civil and ecclesiastical matters it was as yet difficult to discern the full scope and intention Some secret attempts of that sect to establish a separate congregation and discipline had been carefully repressed in the beginning of this reign and when any of the established clergy discovered a tendency to their principles by omitting the legal habits or ceremonies the queen had shown a determined resolution to punish them by fines and deprivation though her orders to that purpose had been frequently eluded by the secret protection which these sectaries received from some of her most considerable courtiers But what chiefly tended to gain Elizabeth the hearts of her subjects was her frugality which though carried sometimes to an extreme led her not to amass treasures but only to prevent impositions upon her people who were at that time very little accustomed to bear the burdens of government By means of her rigid economy she paid all the debts which she found on the crown with their full interest though some of these debts had been contracted even during the reign of her father Some loans which she had exacted at the commencement of her reign were repaid by her a practice in that age somewhat unusual and she established her credit on such a footing that no sovereign in Europe could more readily command any sum which the public exigencies might at any time require v During this peaceable and uniform government England furnishes few materials for history and except the small part which Elizabeth took in foreign transactions there scarcely passed any occurrence which requires a particular detail Strype s Life of Parker p three hundred forty two Strype s Life of Grindal p three hundred fifteen Heylin p one hundred sixty five one hundred sixty six D Ewes p two hundred forty five Camden p four hundred forty six D Ewes p two hundred forty five v D Ewes p two hundred forty six The most memorable event in this period was a session of parliament held on the eighth of February fifteen seventy six where debates were started which may appear somewhat curious and singular Peter Wentworth a Puritan who had signalized himself in former parliaments by his free and undaunted spirit opened this session with a premeditated harangue which drew on him the indignation of the house and gave great offence to the queen and the ministers As it seems to contain a rude sketch of those principles of liberty which happily gained afterwards the ascendant in England it may not be improper to give in a few words the substance of it He premised that the very name of liberty is sweet but the thing itself is precious beyond the most inestimable treasures and that it behoved them to be careful lest contenting themselves with the sweetness of the name they forego the substance and abandon what of all earthly possessions was of the highest value to the kingdom He then proceeded to observe that freedom of speech in that house a privilege so useful both to sovereign and subject had been formerly infringed in many essential articles and was at present exposed to the most imminent danger that it was usual when any subject of importance was handled especially if it regarded religion to surmise that these topics were disagreeable to the queen and that the further proceeding in them would draw down her indignation upon their temerity that Solomon had justly affirmed the king s displeasure to be a messenger of death and it was no wonder if men even though urged by motives of conscience and duty should be inclined to stop short when they found themselves exposed to so severe a penalty that by the employing of this argument the house was incapacitated from serving their country and even from serving the queen herself whose ears besieged by pernicious flatterers were thereby rendered inaccessible to the most salutary truths that it was a mockery to call an assembly a parliament yet deny it that privilege which was so essential to its being and without which it must degenerate into an abject school of servility and dissimulation that as the parliament was the great guardian of the laws they ought to have liberty to discharge their trust and to maintain that authority whence even kings themselves derive their being that a king was constituted such by law and though he was not dependent on man yet was he subordinate to God and the law and was obliged to make their prescriptions not his own will the rule of his conduct that even his commission as God s vicegerent enforced instead of loosening this obligation since he was thereby invested with authority to execute on earth the will of God which is nothing but law and justice that though these surmises of displeasing the queen by their proceedings had impeached in a very essential point all freedom of speech a privilege granted them by a special law yet was there a more express and more dangerous invasion made on their liberties by frequent messages from the throne that it had become a practice when the house was entering on any question either ecclesiastical or civil to bring an order from the queen inhibiting them absolutely from treating of such matters and debarring them from all further discussion of these momentous articles that the prelates emboldened by her royal protection had assumed a decisive power in all questions of religion and required that every one should implicitly submit his faith to their arbitrary determinations that the love which he bore his sovereign forbade him to be silent under such abuses or to sacrifice on this important occasion his duty to servile flattery and complaisance and that as no earthly creature was exempt from fault so neither was the queen herself but in imposing this servitude on her faithful commons had committed a great and even dangerous fault against herself and the whole commonwealth It is easy to observe from this speech that in this dawn of liberty the parliamentary style was still crude and unformed and that the proper decorum of attacking ministers and counsellors without interesting the honor of the crown or mentioning the person of the sovereign was not yet entirely established The commons expressed great displeasure at this unusual license they sequestered Wentworth from the house and committed him prisoner to the serjeant at arms They even ordered him to be examined by a committee consisting of all those members who were also members of the privy council and a report to be next day made to the house This committee met in the star chamber and wearing the aspect of that arbitrary court summoned Wentworth to appear before them and answer for his behavior But though the commons had discovered so little delicacy or precaution in thus confounding their own authority with that of the star chamber Wentworth better understood the principles of liberty and refused to give these counsellors any account of his conduct in parliament till he were satisfied that they acted not as members of the privy council but as a committee of the house He justified his liberty of speech by pleading the rigor and hardship of the queen s messages and notwithstanding that the committee showed him by instances in other reigns that the practice of sending such messages was not unprecedented he would not agree to express any sorrow or repentance The issue of the affair was that after a month s confinement the queen sent to the commons informing them that from her special grace and favor she had restored him to his liberty and to his place in the house D Ewes p two hundred thirty six two hundred thirty seven et cetera D Ewes p two hundred forty four D Ewes p two hundred forty one By this seeming lenity she indirectly retained the power which she had assumed of imprisoning the members and obliging them to answer before her for their conduct in parliament And Sir Walter Mildmay endeavored to make the house sensible of her majesty s goodness in so gently remitting the indignation which she might justly conceive at the temerity of their member but he informed them that they had not the liberty of speaking what and of whom they pleased and that indiscreet freedoms used in that house had both in the present and foregoing ages met with a proper chastisement He warned them therefore not to abuse further the queen s clemency lest she be constrained contrary to her inclination to turn an unsuccessful lenity into a necessary severity The behavior of the two houses was in every other respect equally tame and submissive Instead of a bill which was at first introduced for the reformation of the church they were contented to present a petition to her majesty for that purpose and when she told them that she would give orders to her bishops to amend all abuses and if they were negligent she would herself by her supreme power and authority over the church give such redress as would entirely satisfy the nation the parliament willingly acquiesced in this sovereign and peremptory decision Though the commons showed so little spirit in opposing the authority of the crown they maintained this session their dignity against an encroachment of the peers and would not agree to a conference which they thought was demanded of them in an irregular manner They acknowledged however with all humbleness such is their expression the superiority of the lords they only refused to give that house any reason for their proceedings and asserted that where they altered a bill sent them by the peers it belonged to them to desire a conference not to the upper house to require it D Ewes p two hundred fifty nine D Ewes p two hundred fifty two D Ewes p two hundred fifty seven D Ewes p two hundred sixty three The commons granted an aid of one subsidy and two fifteenths Mildmay in order to satisfy the house concerning the reasonableness of this grant entered into a detail of the queen s past expenses in supporting the government and of the increasing charges of the crown from the daily increase in the price of all commodities He did not however forge to admonish them that they were to regard this detail as the pure effect of the queen s condescension since she was not bound to give them any account how she employed her treasure D Ewes p two hundred forty six CHAPTER XLI ELIZABETH The greatest and most absolute security that Elizabeth enjoyed during her whole reign never exempted her from vigilance and attention but the scene began now to be more overcast and dangers gradually multiplied on her from more than one quarter The earl of Morton had hitherto retained Scotland in strict alliance with the queen and had also restored domestic tranquility to that kingdom but it was not to be expected that the factitious and legal authority of a regent would long maintain itself in a country unacquainted with law and order where even the natural dominion of hereditary princes so often met with opposition and control The nobility began anew to break into factions the people were disgusted with some instances of Morton s avarice and the clergy who complained of further encroachments on their narrow revenue joined and increased the discontent of the other orders The regent was sensible of his dangerous situation and having dropped some peevish expressions as if he were willing or desirous to resign the noblemen of the opposite party favorites of the young king laid hold of this concession and required that demission which he seemed so frankly to offer them James was at this time but eleven years of age yet Morton having secured himself as he imagined by a general pardon resigned his authority into the hands of the king who pretended to conduct in his own name the administration of the kingdom The regent retired from the government and seemed to employ himself entirely in the care of his domestic affairs but either tired with this tranquillity which appeared insipid after the agitations of ambition or thinking it time to throw off dissimulation he came again to court acquired an ascendant in the council and though he resumed not the title of regent governed with the same authority as before The opposite party after holding separate conventions took to arms on pretence of delivering their prince from captivity and restoring him to the free exercise of his government Queen Elizabeth interposed by her ambassador Sir Robert Bowes and mediated an agreement between the factions Morton kept possession of the government but his enemies were numerous and vigilant and his authority seemed to become every day more precarious The count d Aubigney of the house of Lenox cousin german to the king s father had been born and educated in France and being a young man of good address and a sweet disposition he appeared to the duke of Guise a proper instrument for detaching James from the English interest and connecting him with his mother and her relations He no sooner appeared at Stirling where James resided than he acquired the affections of the young monarch and joining his interests with those of James Stuart of the house of Ochiltree a man of profligate manners who had acquired the king s favor he employed himself under the appearance of play and amusement in instilling into the tender mind of the prince new sentiments of politics and government He represented to him the injustice which had been done to Mary in her deposition and made him entertain thoughts either of resigning the crown into her hands or of associating her with him in the administration Elizabeth alarmed at the danger which might ensue from the prevalence of this interest in Scotland sent anew Sir Robert Bowes to Stirling and accusing D Aubigney now created earl of Lenox of an attachment to the French warned James against entertaining such suspicious and dangerous connections Digges p four hundred twelve four hundred twenty eight Melvil p one hundred thirty Spotswood p three hundred nine The king excused himself by Sir Alexander Hume his ambassador and Lenox finding that the queen had openly declared against him was further confirmed in his intention of

committed to prison brought to trial and condemned to suffer as a traitor He confessed that Bothwell had communicated to him the design had pleaded Mary s consent and had desired his concurrence but he denied that he himself had ever expressed any approbation of the crime and in excuse for his concealing it he alleged the danger of revealing the secret either to Henry who had no resolution nor constancy or Morton who appeared to be an accomplice in the murder Spotswood p three hundred fourteen Crawford p three hundred thirty three Moyse s Memoirs Spotswood p three hundred twelve t Digge p

function engaged by his persuasion the earls of Argyle Montrose Angus Marre and Glencairne to enter into a confederacy for protecting even by force of arms the life of the prisoner The more to overawe that nobleman s enemies Elizabeth ordered forces to be assembled on the borders of England but this expedient served only to hasten his sentence and execution Morton died with that constancy and resolution which had attended him through all the various events of his life and left a reputation which was less disputed with regard to abilities than probity and virtue But this conclusion of the scene happened not till the subsequent year Elizabeth was during this period extremely anxious on account of every revolution in Scotland both because that country alone not being separated from England by sea and bordering on all the Catholic and malecontent counties afforded her enemies a safe and easy method of attacking her and because she was sensible that Mary thinking herself abandoned by the French monarch had been engaged by the Guises to have recourse to the powerful protection of Philip who though he had not yet come to an open rupture with the queen was every day both by the injuries which he committed and suffered more exasperated against her That he might retaliate the assistance which she gave to his rebels in the Low Countries he had sent under the name of the pope a body of seven hundred Spaniards and Italians into Ireland where the inhabitants always turbulent and discontented with the English government were now more alienated by religious prejudices and were ready to join every invader The Spanish general San Josepho built a fort in Kerry and being there besieged by the earl of Ormond president of Munster who was soon after joined by Lord Gray the deputy he made a weak and cowardly defence After some assaults feebly sustained he surrendered at discretion and Gray who commanded but a small force finding himself encumbered with so many prisoners put all the Spaniards and Italians to the sword without mercy and hanged about fifteen hundred of the Irish a cruelty which gave great displeasure to Elizabeth When the English ambassador made complaints of this invasion he was answered by like complaints of the piracies committed by Francis Drake a bold seaman who had assaulted the Spaniards in the place where they deemed themselves most secure in the new world This man sprung from mean parents in the county of Devon having acquired considerable riches by depredations made in the Isthmus of Panama and having there gotten a sight of the Pacific Ocean was so stimulated by ambition and avarice that he scrupled not to employ his whole fortune in a new adventure through those seas so much unknown at that time to all the European nations By means of Sir Christopher Hatton then vice chamberlain a great favorite of the queen s he obtained her consent and approbation and he set sail from Plymouth in fifteen seventy seven with four ships and a pinnace on board of which were one hundred and sixty four able sailors He passed into the South Sea by the Straits of Magellan and attacking the Spaniards who expected no enemy in those quarters he took many rich prizes and prepared to return with the booty which he had acquired Apprehensive of being intercepted by the enemy if he took the same way homewards by which he had reached the Pacific Ocean he attempted to find a passage by the north of California and failing in that enterprise he set sail for the East Indies and returned safely this year by the Cape of Good Hope He was the first Englishman who sailed round the globe and the first commander in chief for Magellan whose ship executed the same adventure died in his passage His name became celebrated on account of so bold and fortunate an attempt but many apprehending the resentment of the Spaniards endeavored to persuade the queen that it would be more prudent to disavow the enterprise to punish Drake and to restore the treasure But Elizabeth who admired valor and who was allured by the prospect of sharing in the booty determined to countenance that gallant sailor she conferred on him the honor of knighthood and accepted of a banquet from him at Deptford on board the ship which had achieved so memorable a voyage Camden p four hundred seventy five Cox s Hist of Ireland p three hundred sixty eight Camden p four

Mendoza exclaimed against Drake s piracies she told him that the Spaniards by arrogating a right to the whole new world and excluding thence all other European nations who should sail thither even with a view of exercising the most lawful commerce naturally tempted others to make a violent irruption into those countries To pacify however the Catholic monarch she caused part of the booty to be restored to Pedro Sebura a Spaniard who pretended to be agent for the merchants whom Drake had spoiled Having learned afterwards that Philip had seized the money and had employed part of it against herself in Ireland part of it in the pay of the prince of Parma s troops she determined to make no more restitutions There was another cause which induced the queen to take this resolution she was in such want of money that she was obliged to assemble a parliament a measure which as she herself openly declared she never embraced except when constrained by the necessity of her affairs The parliament besides granting her a supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths enacted some statutes for the security of her government chiefly against the attempts of the Catholics Whoever in any way reconciled any one to the church of Rome or was himself reconciled was declared to be guilty of treason to say mass was subjected to the penalty of a year s imprisonment and a fine of two hundred marks the being present was punishable by a year s imprisonment and a fine of a hundred marks a fine of twenty pounds a month was imposed on every one who continued during that time absent from church To utter slanderous or seditious words against the queen was punishable for the first offence with the pillory and loss of ears the second offence was declared felony the writing or printing of such words was felony even on the first offence The Puritans prevailed so far as to have further applications made for reformation in religion and Paul Wentworth brother to the member of that name who had distinguished himself in the preceding session moved that the commons from their own authority should appoint a general fast and prayers a motion to which the house unwarily assented For this presumption they were severely reprimanded by a message from the queen as encroaching on the royal prerogative and supremacy and they were obliged to submit and ask forgiveness v Camden p four hundred eighty twenty three Eliz cap one twenty three Eliz cap two D Ewes p three hundred two v Camden p four hundred seventy seven The queen and parliament were engaged to pass these severe laws against the Catholics by some late discoveries of the treasonable practices of their priests When the ancient worship was suppressed and the reformation introduced into the universities the king of Spain reflected that as some species of literature was necessary for supporting these doctrines and controversies the Romish communion must decay in England if no means were found to give erudition to the ecclesiastics and for this reason he founded a seminary at Douay where the Catholics sent their children chiefly such as were intended for the priesthood in order to receive the rudiments of their education The cardinal of Lorraine imitated this example by erecting a like seminary in his diocese of Rheims and though Rome was somewhat distant the pope would not neglect to adorn by a foundation of the same nature that capital of orthodoxy These seminaries founded with so hostile an intention sent over every year a colony of priests who maintained the Catholic superstition in its full height of bigotry and being educated with a view to the crown of martyrdom were not deterred either by danger or fatigue from maintaining and propagating their principles They infused into all their votaries an extreme hatred against the queen whom they treated as a usurper a schismatic a heretic a persecutor of the orthodox and one solemnly and publicly anathematized by the holy father Sedition rebellion sometimes assassination were the expedients by which they intended to effect their purposes against her and the severe restraint not to say persecution under which the Catholics labored made them the more willingly receive from their ghostly fathers such violent doctrines These seminaries were all of them under the direction of the Jesuits a new order of regular priests erected in Europe when the court of Rome perceived that the lazy monks and beggarly friars who sufficed in times of ignorance were no longer able to defend the ramparts of the church assailed on every side and that the inquisitive spirit of the age required a society more active and more learned to oppose its dangerous progress These men as they stood foremost in the contest against the Protestants drew on them the extreme animosity of that whole sect and by assuming a superiority over the other more numerous and more ancient orders of their own communion were even exposed to the envy of their brethren so that it is no wonder if the blame to which their principles and conduct might be exposed has in many instances been much exaggerated This reproach however they must bear from posterity that by the very nature of their institution they were engaged to pervert learning the only effectual remedy against superstition into a nourishment of that infirmity and as their erudition was chiefly of the ecclesiastical and scholastic kind though a few members have cultivated polite literature they were only the more enabled by that acquisition to refine away the plainest dictates of morality and to erect a regular system of casuistry by which prevarication perjury and every crime when it served their ghostly purposes might be justified and defended The Jesuits as devoted servants to the court of Rome exalted the prerogative of the sovereign pontiff above all earthly power and by maintaining his authority of deposing kings set no bounds either to his spiritual or temporal jurisdiction This doctrine became so prevalent among the zealous Catholics in England that the excommunication fulminated against Elizabeth excited many scruples of a singular kind to which it behoved the holy father to provide a remedy The bull of Pius in absolving the subjects from their oaths of allegiance commanded them to resist the queen s usurpation and many Romanists were apprehensive that by this clause they were obliged in conscience even though no favorable opportunity offered to rebel against her and that no dangers or difficulties could free them from this indispensable duty But Parsons and Campion two Jesuits were sent over with a mitigation and explanation of the doctrine and they taught their disciples that though the bull was forever binding on Elizabeth and her partisans it did not oblige the Catholics to obedience except when the sovereign pontiff should think proper by a new summons to require it Campion was afterwards detected in treasonable practices and being put to the rack and confessing his guilt he was publicly executed His execution was ordered at the very time when the duke of Anjou was in England and prosecuted with the greatest appearance of success his marriage with the queen and this severity was probably intended to appease her Protestant subjects and to satisfy them that whatever measures she might pursue she never would depart from the principles of the reformation The duke of Alencon now created duke of Anjou had never entirely dropped his pretensions to Elizabeth and that princess though her suitor was near twenty five years younger than herself and had no knowledge of her person but by pictures or descriptions was still pleased with the image which his addresses afforded her of love and tenderness The duke in order to forward his suit besides employing his brother s ambassador sent over Simier an agent of his own an artful man of an agreeable conversation who soon remarking the queen s humor amused her with gay discourse and instead of serious political reasonings which he found only awakened her ambition and hurt his master s interests he introduced every moment all the topics of passion and of gallantry The pleasure which she found in this man s company soon produced a familiarity between them and amidst the greatest hurry of business her most confidential ministers had not such ready access to her as had Simier who on pretence of negotiation entertained her with accounts of the tender attachment borne her by the duke of Anjou The earl of Leicester who had never before been alarmed with any courtship paid her and who always trusted that her love of dominion would prevail over her inclination to marriage began to apprehend that she was at last caught in her own snare and that the artful encouragement which she had given to this young suitor had unawares engaged her affections To render Simier odious he availed himself of the credulity of the times and spread reports that that minister had gained an ascendant over the Queen not by any natural principles of her constitution but by incantations and love potions Simier in revenge endeavored to discredit Leicester with the queen and he revealed to her a secret which none of her courtiers dared to disclose that this nobleman was secretly without her consent married to the widow of the earl of Essex an action which the queen interpreted either to proceed from want of respect to her or as a violation of their mutual attachment and which so provoked her that she threatened to send him to the Tower Camden p four hundred seventy one The quarrel went so far between Leicester and the French agent that the former was suspected of having employed one Tudor a bravo to take away the life of his enemy and the queen thought it necessary by proclamation to take Simier under her immediate protection It happened that while Elizabeth was rowed in her barge on the Thames attended by Simier and some of her courtiers a shot was fired which wounded one of the bargemen but the queen finding upon inquiry that the piece had been discharged by accident gave the person his liberty without further punishment So far was she from entertaining any suspicion against her people that she was often heard to say that she would lend credit to nothing against them which parents would not believe of their own children The duke of Anjou encouraged by the accounts sent him of the queen s prepossessions in his favor paid her secretly a visit at Greenwich and after some conference with her the purport of which is not known he departed It appeared that though his figure was not advantageous he had lost no ground by being personally known to her and soon after she commanded Burleigh now treasurer Sussex Leicester Bedford Lincoln Hatton and Secretary Walsingham to concert with the French ambassadors the terms of the intended contract of marriage Henry had sent over on this occasion a splendid embassy consisting of Francis de Bourbon prince of Dauphiny and many considerable noblemen and as the queen had in a manner the power of prescribing what terms she pleased the articles were soon settled with the English commissioners It was agreed that the marriage should be celebrated within six weeks after the ratification of the articles that the duke and his retinue should have the exercise of their religion that after the marriage he should bear the title of king but the administration remain solely in the queen that their children male or female should succeed to the crown of England that if there be two males the elder in case of Henry s death without issue should be king of France the younger of England that if there be but one male and he succeed to the crown of France he should be obliged to reside in England eight months every two years that the laws and customs of England should be preserved inviolate and that no foreigner should be promoted by the duke to any office in England Camden p four hundred seventy one Camden p four hundred eighty four These articles providing for the security of England in case of its annexation to the crown of France opened but a dismal prospect to the English had not the age of Elizabeth who was now in her forty ninth year contributed very much to allay their apprehensions of this nature The queen also as a proof of her still remaining uncertainty added a clause that she was not bound to complete the marriage till further articles which were not specified should be agreed on between the parties and till the king of France be certified of this agreement Soon after the queen sent over Walsingham as ambassador to France in order to form closer connections with Henry and enter into a league offensive and defensive against the increasing power and dangerous usurpations of Spain The French king who had been extremely disturbed with the unquiet spirit the restless ambition the enterprising yet timid and inconstant disposition of Anjou had already sought to free the kingdom from his intrigues by opening a scene for his activity in Flanders and having allowed him to embrace the protection of the states had secretly supplied him with men and money for the undertaking The prospect of settling him in England was for a like reason very agreeable to that monarch and he was desirous to cultivate by every expedient the favorable sentiments which Elizabeth seemed to entertain towards him But this princess though she had gone further in her amorous dalliance than could be justified or accounted for by any principles of policy was not yet determined to carry matters to a final conclusion and she confined Walsingham in his instructions to negotiating conditions of a mutual alliance between France and England Henry with reluctance submitted to hold conferences on that subject but no sooner had Walsingham begun to settle the terms of alliance than he was informed that the queen foreseeing hostility with Spain to be the result of this confederacy had declared that she would prefer the marriage with the war before the war without the marriage The French court pleased with this change of resolution broke off the conferences concerning the league and opened a negotiation for the marriage But matters had not long proceeded in this train before the queen again declared for the league in preference to the marriage and ordered Walsingham to renew the conferences for that purpose Before he had leisure to bring this point to maturity he was interrupted by a new change of resolution v and not only the court of France but Walsingham himself Burleigh and all the wisest ministers of Elizabeth were in amazement doubtful where this contest between inclination and reason love and ambition would at last terminate v

contest between her reason and her ruling passions The duke of Anjou expected from her some money by which he might be enabled to open the campaign in Flanders and the queen herself though her frugality made her long reluctant was sensible that this supply was necessary and she was at last induced after much hesitation to comply with his request She sent him a present of a hundred thousand crowns by which joined to his own demesnes and the assistance of his brother and the queen dowager he levied an army and took the field against the prince of Parma He was successful in raising the siege of Cambray and being chosen by the states governor of the Netherlands he put his army into winter quarters and came over to England in order to prosecute his suit to the queen The reception which he met with made him expect entire success and gave him hopes that Elizabeth had surmounted all scruples and was finally determined to make choice of him for her husband In the midst of the pomp which attended the anniversary of her coronation she was seen after long and intimate discourse with him to take a ring from her own finger and to put it upon his and all the spectators concluded that in this ceremony she had given him a promise of marriage and was even desirous of signifying her intentions to all the world saint Aldegonde ambassador from the states despatched immediately a letter to his masters informing them of this great event and the inhabitants of Antwerp who as well as the other Flemings regarded the queen as a kind of titular divinity testified their joy by bonfires and the discharge of their great ordnance Digges p three hundred fifty seven three hundred eighty seven three hundred eighty eight four hundred nine four hundred twenty six four hundred thirty nine Rymer xv p seven hundred ninety three Camden p four hundred eighty six Thuan lib lxxiv A Puritan of Lincoln s Inn had written a passionate book which he entitled The Gulph in which England will be swallowed by the French Marriage He was apprehended and prosecuted by order of the queen and was condemned to lose his right hand as a libeller Such was the constancy and loyalty of the man that immediately after the sentence was executed he took off his hat with his other hand and waving it over his head cried God save the queen But notwithstanding this attachment which Elizabeth so openly discovered to the duke of Anjou the combat of her sentiments was not entirely over and her ambition as well as prudence rousing itself by intervals still filled her breast with doubt and hesitation Almost all the courtiers whom she trusted and favored Leicester Hatton and Walsingham discovered an extreme aversion to the marriage and the ladies of her bed chamber made no scruple of opposing her resolution with the most zealous remonstrances Camden p four hundred eighty six Among other enemies to the match Sir Philip son of Sir Henry Sidney deputy of Ireland and nephew to Leicester a young man the most accomplished of the age declared himself and he used the freedom to write her a letter in which he dissuaded her from her present resolution with an unusual elegance of expression as well as force of reasoning He told her that the security of her government depended entirely on the affections of her Protestant subjects and she could not by any measure more effectually disgust them than by espousing a prince who was son of the perfidious Catharine brother to the cruel and perfidious Charles and who had himself imbrued his hands in the blood of the innocent and defenceless Protestants that the Catholics were her mortal enemies and believed either that she had originally usurped the crown or was now lawfully deposed by the pope s bull of excommunication and nothing had ever so much elevated their hopes as the prospect of her marriage with the duke of Anjou that her chief security at present against the efforts of so numerous rich and united a faction was that they possessed no head who could conduct their dangerous enterprises and she herself was rashly supplying that defect by giving an interest in the kingdom to a prince whose education had zealously attached him to that communion that though he was a stranger to the blood royal of England the dispositions of men were now such that they preferred the religious to the civil connections and were more influenced by sympathy in theological opinions than by the principles of legal and hereditary government that the duke himself had discovered a very restless and turbulent spirit and having often violated his loyalty to his elder brother and his sovereign there remained no hopes that he would passively submit to a woman whom he might in quality of husband think himself entitled to command that the French nation so populous so much abounding in soldiers so full of nobility who were devoted to arms and for some time accustomed to serve for plunder would supply him with partisans dangerous to a people unwarlike and defenceless like the generality of her subjects that the plain and honorable path which she had followed of cultivating the affections of her people had hitherto rendered her reign secure and happy and however her enemies might seem to multiply upon her the same invincible rampart was still able to protect and defend her that so long as the throne of France was filled by Henry or his posterity it was in vain to hope that the ties of blood would insure the amity of that kingdom preferably to the maxims of policy or the prejudices of religion and if ever the crown devolved on the duke of Anjou the conjunction of France and England would prove a burden rather than a protection to the latter kingdom that the example of her sister Mary was sufficient to instruct her in the danger of such connections and to prove that the affection and confidence of the English could never be maintained where they had such reason to apprehend that their interests would every moment be sacrificed to those of a foreign and hostile nation that notwithstanding these great inconveniences discovered by past experience the house of Burgundy it must be confessed was more popular in the nation than the family of France and what was of chief moment Philip was of the same communion with Mary and was connected with her by this great band of interest and affection and that however the queen might remain childless even though old age should grow upon her the singular felicity and glory of her reign would preserve her from contempt the affections of her subjects and those of all the Protestants in Europe would defend her from danger and her own prudence without other aid or assistance would baffle all the efforts of her most malignant enemies Letters of the Sidneys vol i p two hundred eighty seven et seq Cabala p three hundred sixty three These reflections kept the queen in great anxiety and irresolution and she was observed to pass several nights without any sleep or repose At last her settled habits of prudence and ambition prevailed over her temporary inclination and having sent for the duke of Anjou she had a long conference with him in private where she was supposed to have made him apologies for breaking her former engagements He expressed great disgust on his leaving her threw away the ring which she had given him and uttered many curses on the mutability of women and of islanders Soon after he went over to his government of the Netherlands lost the confidence of the states by a rash and violent attempt on their liberties was expelled that country retired into France and there died The queen by timely reflection saved herself from the numerous mischiefs which must have attended so imprudent a marriage and the distracted state of the French monarchy prevented her from feeling any effects of that resentment which she had reason to dread from the affront so wantonly put upon that royal family The anxiety of the queen from the attempts of the English Catholics never ceased during the whole course of her reign but the variety of revolutions which happened in all the neighboring kingdoms were the source sometimes of her hopes sometimes of her apprehensions This year the affairs of Scotland strongly engaged her attention The influence which the earl of Lenox and James Stuart who now assumed the title of earl of Arran had acquired over the young king was but a slender foundation of authority while the generality of the nobles and all the preachers were so much discontented with their administration The assembly of the church appointed a solemn fast of which one of the avowed reasons was the danger to which the king was exposed from the company of wicked persons and on that day the pulpits resounded with declamations against Lenox Arran and all the present counsellors When the minds of the people were sufficiently prepared by these lectures a conspiracy of the nobility was formed probably with the concurrence of Elizabeth for seizing the person of James at Ruthven a seat of the earl of Gowry s and the design being kept secret succeeded without any opposition Camden p four hundred eighty six Spotswood p three hundred nineteen Spotswood p three hundred twenty The leaders in this enterprise were the earl of Gowry himself the earl of Marre the lords Lindesey and Boyd the masters of Glamis and Oliphant the abbots of Dunfermling Paisley and Cambuskenneth The king wept when he found himself detained a prisoner but the master of Glamis said No matter for his tears better that boys weep than bearded men an expression which James could never afterwards forgive But notwithstanding his resentment he found it necessary to submit to the present necessity He pretended an entire acquiescence in the conduct of the associators acknowledged the detention of his person to be acceptable service and agreed to summon both an assembly of the church and a convention of estates in order to ratify that enterprise The assembly though they had established it as an inviolable rule that the king on no account and under no pretence should ever intermeddle in ecclesiastical matters made no scruple of taking civil affairs under their cognizance and of deciding on this occasion that the attempt of the conspirators was acceptable to all that feared God or tendered the preservation of the king s person and prosperous state of the realm They even enjoined all the clergy to recommend these sentiments from the pulpit and they threatened with ecclesiastical censures every man who should oppose the authority of the confederated lords The convention being composed chiefly of these lords themselves added their sanction to these proceedings Arran was confined a prisoner in his own house Lenox though he had power to resist yet rather than raise a civil war or be the cause of bloodshed chose to retire into France where he soon after died He persevered to the last in the Protestant religion to which James had converted him but which the Scottish clergy could never be persuaded that he had sincerely embraced The king sent for his family restored his son to his paternal honors and estate took care to establish the fortunes of all his other children and to his last moments never forgot the early friendship which he had borne their father a strong proof of the good dispositions of that prince Spotswood p three hundred twenty two Heylin s Hist Presbyter p two hundred twenty seven Spotswood Spotswood p three hundred twenty eight No sooner was this revolution known in England than the queen sent Sir Henry Gary and Sir Robert Bowes to James in order to congratulate him on his deliverance from the pernicious counsels of Lenox and Arran to exhort him not to resent the seeming violence committed on him by the confederated lords and to procure from him permission for the return of the earl of Angus who ever since Morton s fall had lived in England They easily prevailed in procuring the recall of Angus and as James suspected that Elizabeth had not been entirely unacquainted with the project of his detention he thought proper before the English ambassadors to dissemble his resentment against the authors of it Soon after La Mothe Fenelon and Menneville appeared as ambassadors from France their errand was to inquire concerning the situation of the king make professions of their master s friendship confirm the ancient league with France and procure an accommodation between James and the queen of Scots This last proposal gave great umbrage to the clergy and the assembly voted the settling of terms between the mother and son to be a most wicked undertaking The pulpits resounded with declamations against the French ambassadors particularly Fenelon whom they called the messenger of the bloody murderer meaning the duke of Guise and as that minister being knight of the Holy Ghost wore a white cross on his shoulder they commonly denominated it in contempt the badge of Antichrist The king endeavored though in vain to repress these insolent reflections but in order to make the ambassadors some compensation he desired the magistrates of Edinburgh to give them a splendid dinner before their departure To prevent this entertainment the clergy appointed that very day for a public fast and finding that their orders were not regarded they employed their sermons in thundering curses on the magistrates who by the king s direction had put this mark of respect on the ambassadors They even pursued them afterwards with the censures of the church and it was with difficulty they were prevented from issuing the sentence of excommunication against them on account of their submission to royal preferably to clerical authority Spotswood p three hundred twenty four What increased their alarm with regard to an accommodation between James and Mary was that the English ambassadors seemed to concur with the French in this proposal and the clergy were so ignorant as to believe the sincerity of the professions made by the former The queen of Scots had often made overtures to Elizabeth which had been entirely neglected but hearing of James s detention she wrote a letter in a more pathetic and more spirited strain than usual craving the assistance of that princess both for her own and her son s liberty She said that the account of the prince s captivity had excited her most tender concern and the experience which she herself during so many years had of the extreme infelicity attending that situation had made her the more apprehensive lest a like fate should pursue her unhappy offspring that the long train of injustice which she had undergone the calumnies to which she had been exposed were so grievous that finding no place for right or truth among men she was reduced to make her last appeal to Heaven the only competent tribunal between princes of equal jurisdiction degree and dignity that after her rebellious subjects secretly instigated by Elizabeth s ministers had expelled her the throne had confined her in prison had pursued her with arms she had voluntarily thrown herself under the protection of England fatally allured by those reiterated professions of amity which had been made her and by her confidence in the generosity of a friend an ally and a kinswoman that not content with excluding her from her presence with supporting the usurpers of her throne with contributing to the destruction of her faithful subjects Elizabeth had reduced her to a worse captivity than that from which she had escaped and had made her this cruel return for the unlimited confidence which she had reposed in her that though her resentment of such severe usage had never carried her further than to use some disappointed efforts for her deliverance unhappy for herself and fatal to others she found the rigors of confinement daily multiplied upon her and at length carried to such a height that it surpassed the bounds of all human patience any longer to endure them that she was cut off from all communication not only with the rest of mankind but with her only son and her maternal fondness which was now more enlivened by their unhappy sympathy in situation and was her sole remaining attachment to this world deprived even of that melancholy solace which letters or messages could give that the bitterness of her sorrows still more than her close confinement had preyed upon her health and had added the insufferable weight of bodily infirmity to all those other calamities under which she labored that while the daily experience of her maladies opened to her the comfortable prospect of an approaching deliverance into a region where pain and sorrow are no more her enemies envied her that last consolation and having secluded her from every joy on earth had done what in them lay to debar her from all hopes in her future and eternal existence that the exercise of her religion was refused her the use of those sacred rites in which she had been educated the commerce with those holy ministers whom Heaven had appointed to receive the acknowledgment of our transgressions and to seal our penitence by a solemn readmission into heavenly favor and forgiveness that it was in vain to complain of the rigors of persecution exercised in other kingdoms when a queen and an innocent woman was excluded from an indulgence which never yet in the most barbarous countries had been denied to the meanest and most obnoxious malefactor that could she ever be induced to descend from that royal dignity in which Providence had placed her or depart from her appeal to Heaven there was only one other tribunal to which she would appeal from all her enemies to the justice and humanity of Elizabeth s own breast and to that lenity which uninfluenced by malignant counsel she would naturally be induced to exercise towards her and that she finally entreated her to resume her natural disposition and to reflect on the support as well as comfort which she might receive from her son and herself if joining the obligations of gratitude to the ties of blood she would deign to raise them from their present melancholy situation and reinstate them in that liberty and authority to which they were entitled Camden p four hundred eighty nine Elizabeth was engaged to obstruct Mary s restoration chiefly because she foresaw an unhappy alternative attending that event If this princess recovered any considerable share of authority in Scotland her resentment ambition zeal and connections both domestic and foreign might render her a dangerous neighbor to England and enable her after suppressing the Protestant party among her subjects to revive those pretensions which she had formerly advanced to the crown and which her partisans in both kingdoms still supported with great industry and assurance If she were reinstated in power with such strict limitations as could not be broken she might be disgusted with her situation and flying abroad form more desperate attempts than any sovereign who had a crown to hazard would willingly undertake Mary herself sensible of these difficulties and convinced by experience that Elizabeth would forever debar her the throne was now become more humble in her wishes and as age and infirmities had repressed those sentiments of ambition by which she had formerly been so much actuated she was willing to sacrifice all her hopes of grandeur in order to obtain a liberty a blessing to which she naturally aspired with the fondest impatience She proposed therefore that she should be associated with her son in the title to the crown of Scotland but that the administration should remain solely in him and she was content to live in England in a private station and even under a kind of restraint but with some more liberty both for exercise and company than she had enjoyed since the first discovery of her intrigues with the duke of Norfolk But Elizabeth afraid lest such a loose method of guarding her would facilitate her escape into France or Spain or at least would encourage and increase her partisans and enable her to conduct those intrigues to which she had already discovered so strong a propensity was secretly determined to deny her requests and though she feigned to assent to them she well knew how to disappoint the expectations of the unhappy princess While Lenox maintained his authority in Scotland she never gave any reply to all the application made to her by the Scottish queen at present when her own creatures had acquired possession of the government she was resolved to throw the odium of refusal upon them and pretending that nothing further was required to a perfect accommodation than the concurrence of the council of state in Scotland she ordered her ambassador Bowes to open the negotiation for Mary s liberty and her association with her son in the title to the crown Though she seemed to make this concession to Mary she refused her the liberty of sending any ambassador of her own and that princess could easily conjecture from this circumstance what would be the result of the pretended negotiation The privy council of Scotland instigated by the clergy rejected all treaty and James who was now a captive in their hands affirmed that he had never agreed to an association with his mother and that the matter had never gone further than some loose proposals for that purpose MS in the Advocates Library A three twenty eight p four hundred one from the Cott Lib Calig c nine The affairs of Scotland remained not long in the present situation James impatient of restraint made his escape from his keepers and flying to saint Andrews summoned his friends and partisans to attend him The earls of Argyle Marshal Montrose and Rothes hastened to pay their duty to their sovereign and the opposite party found themselves unable to resist so powerful a combination They were offered a pardon upon their submission and an acknowledgment of their fault in seizing the king s person and restraining him from his liberty Some of them accepted of the terms the greater number particularly Angus Hamilton Marre Glamis left the country and took shelter in Ireland or England where they were protected by Elizabeth The earl of Arran was recalled to court and the malecontents who could not brook the authority of Lenox a man of virtue and moderation found that by their resistance they had thrown all power into the hands of a person whose counsels were as violent as his manners were profligate Elizabeth wrote a letter to James in which she quoted a moral sentence from Isocrates and indirectly reproached him with inconstancy and a breach of his engagements James in his reply justified his measures and retaliated by turning two passages of Isocrates against her She next sent Walsingham on an embassy to him and her chief purpose in employing that aged minister in an errand where so little business was to be transacted was to learn from a man of so much penetration and experience the real character of James This young prince possessed good parts though not accompanied with that vigor and industry which his station required and as he excelled in general discourse and conversation Walsingham entertained a higher idea of his talents than he was afterwards found when real business was transacted to have fully merited The account which he gave his mistress induced her to treat James thenceforth with some more regard than she had hitherto been inclined to pay him

scandalous speeches against the king the council or the public measures or to meddle in an improper manner with the affairs of his majesty and the states The clergy finding that the pulpit would be no longer a sanctuary for them were extremely offended they said that the king was become Popish in his heart and they gave their adversaries the epithets of gross libertines belly gods and infamous persons Spotswood p three hundred thirty three Spotswood p three hundred thirty four The violent conduct of Arran soon brought over the popularity to their side The earl of Gowry though pardoned for the late attempt was committed to prison was tried on some new accusations condemned and executed Many innocent persons suffered from the tyranny of this favorite and the banished lords being assisted by Elizabeth now found the time favorable for the recovery of their estates and authority After they had been foiled in one attempt upon Stirling they prevailed in another and being admitted to the king s presence were pardoned and restored to his favor Arran was degraded from authority deprived of that estate and title which he had usurped and the whole country seemed to be composed to tranquillity Elizabeth after opposing during some time the credit of the favorite had found it more expedient before his fall to compound all differences with him by means of Davison a minister whom she sent to Scot land but having more confidence in the lords whom she had helped to restore she was pleased with this alteration of affairs and maintained a good correspondence with the new court and ministry of James These revolutions in Scotland would have been regarded as of small importance to the repose and security of Elizabeth had her own subjects been entirely united and had not the zeal of the Catholics excited by constraint more properly than persecution daily threatened her with some dangerous insurrection The vigilance of the ministers particularly of Burleigh and Walsingham was raised in proportion to the activity of the malecontents and many arts which had been blamable in a more peaceful government were employed in detecting conspiracies and even discovering the secret inclinations of men Counterfeit letters were written in the name of the queen of Scots or of the English exiles and privately conveyed to the houses of the Catholics spies were hired to observe the actions and discourse of suspected persons informers were countenanced and though the sagacity of these two great ministers helped them to distinguish the true from the false intelligence many calumnies were no doubt hearkened to and all the subjects particularly the Catholics kept in the utmost anxiety and inquietude Henry Piercy earl of Northumberland brother to the earl beheaded some years before and Philip Howard earl of Arundel son of the unfortunate duke of Norfolk fell under suspicion and the latter was by order of council confined to his own house Francis Throgmorton a private gentleman was committed to custody on account of a letter which he had written to the queen of Scots and which was intercepted Lord Paget and Charles Arundel who had been engaged with him in treasonable designs immediately withdrew beyond sea Throgmorton confessed that a plan for an invasion and insurrection had been laid and though on his trial he was desirous of retracting this confession and imputing it to the fear of torture he was found guilty and executed Mendoza the Spanish ambassador having promoted this conspiracy was ordered to depart the kingdom and Wade was sent into Spain to excuse his dismission and to desire the king to send another ambassador in his place but Philip would not so much as admit the English ambassador to his presence Creighton a Scottish Jesuit coming over on board a vessel which was seized tore some papers with an intention of throwing them into the sea but the wind blowing them back upon the ship they were pieced together and discovered some dangerous secrets Many of these conspiracies were with great appearance of reason imputed to the intrigues of the queen of Scots and as her name was employed in all of them the council thought that they could not use too many precautions against the danger of her claims and the restless activity of her temper She was removed from under the care of the earl of Shrewsbury who though vigilant and faithful in that trust had also been indulgent to his prisoner particularly with regard to air and exercise and she was committed to the custody of Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drue Drury men of honor but inflexible in their care and attention An association was also set on foot by the earl of Leicester and other courtiers and as Elizabeth was beloved by the whole nation except the more zealous Catholics men of all ranks willingly flocked to the subscription of it The purport of this association was to defend the queen to revenge her death or any injury committed against her and to exclude from the throne all claimants what title soever they might possess by whose suggestion or for whose behoof any violence should be offered to her majesty The queen of Scots was sensible that this association was levelled against her and to remove all suspicion from herself she also desired leave to subscribe it Camden p four hundred ninety nine Strype vol lii p two hundred forty six State Trials vol i p one hundred twenty two one hundred twenty three Elizabeth that she might the more discourage malecontents by showing them the concurrence of the nation in her favor summoned a new parliament and she met with that dutiful attachment which she expected The association was confirmed by parliament and a clause was added by which the queen was empowered to name commissioners for the trial of any pretender to the crown who should attempt or imagine any invasion insurrection or assassination against her upon condemnation pronounced by these commissioners the guilty person was excluded from all claim to the succession and was further punishable as her majesty should direct And for greater security a council of regency in case of the queen s violent death was appointed to govern the kingdom to settle the succession and to take vengeance for that act of treason A severe law was also enacted against Jesuits and Popish priests it was ordained that they should depart the kingdom within forty days that those who should remain beyond that time or should afterwards return should be guilty of treason that those who harbored or relieved them should be guilty of felony that those who were educated in seminaries if they returned not in six months after notice given and submitted not themselves to the queen before a bishop or two justices should be guilty of treason and that if any so submitting themselves should within ten years approach the court or come within ten miles of it their submission should be void By this law the exercise of the Catholic religion which had formerly been prohibited under lighter penalties and which was in many instances connived at was totally suppressed In the subsequent part of the queen s reign the law was sometimes executed by the capital punishment of priests and though the partisans of that princess asserted that they were punished for their treason not their religion the apology must only be understood in this sense that the law was enacted on account of the treasonable views and attempts of the sect not that every individual who suffered the penalty of the law was convicted of treason The Catholics therefore might now with justice complain of a violent persecution which we may safety affirm in spite of the rigid and bigoted maxims of that age not to be the best method of converting them or of reconciling them to the established government and religion twenty seven Eliz cap one twenty seven Eliz cap two Some even of those who defend the queen s measures allow that in ten years fifty priests were executed and fifty five banished Camden p six hundred forty nine The parliament besides arming the queen with these powers granted her a supply of one subsidy and two fifteenths The only circumstance in which their proceedings were disagreeable to her was an application made by the commons for a further reformation in ecclesiastical matters Yet even in this attempt which affected her as well as them in a delicate point they discovered how much they were overawed by her authority The majority of the house were Puritans or inclined to that sect but the severe reprimands which they had already in former sessions met with from the throne deterred them from introducing any bill concerning religion a proceeding which would have been interpreted as an encroachment on the prerogative they were content to proceed by way of humble petition and that not addressed to her majesty which would have given offence but to the house of lords or rather the bishops who had a seat in that house and from whom alone they were willing to receive all advances towards reformation a strange departure from what we now apprehend to be the dignity of the commons Besides the petition after mentioned another proof of the prevalency of the Puritans among the commons was their passing a bill for the reverent observance of Sunday which they termed the Sabbath and the depriving the people of those amusements which they were accustomed to take on that day D Ewes p three hundred thirty five It was a strong symptom of a contrary spirit in the upper house that they proposed to add Wednesday to the fast days and to prohibit entirely the eating of flesh on that day D Ewes p three hundred seventy three D Ewes p three hundred fifty seven The commons desired in their humble petition that no bishop should exercise his function of ordination but with the consent and concurrence of six presbyters but this demand as it really introduced a change of ecclesiastical government was firmly rejected by the prelates They desired that no clergyman should be instituted into any benefice without previous notice being given to the parish that they might examine whether there lay any objection to his life or doctrine an attempt towards a popular model which naturally met with the same fate In another article of the petition they prayed that the bishops should not insist upon every ceremony or deprive incumbents for omitting part of the service as if uniformity in public worship had not been established by law or as if the prelates had been endowed with a dispensing power They complained of abuses which prevailed in pronouncing the sentence of excommunication and they entreated the reverend fathers to think of some law for the remedy of these abuses implying that those matters were too high for the commons of themselves to attempt But the most material article which the commons touched upon in their petition was the court of ecclesiastical commission and the oath ex officio as it was called exacted by that court This is a subject of such importance as to merit some explanation The first primate after the queen s accession was Parker a man rigid in exacting conformity to the established worship and in punishing by fine or deprivation all the Puritanical clergymen who attempted to innovate any thing in the habits ceremonies or liturgy of the church He died in fifteen seventy five and was succeeded by Grindal who as he himself was inclined to the new sect was with great difficulty brought to execute the laws against them or to punish the nonconforming clergy He declined obeying the queen s orders for the suppression of prophesyings or the assemblies of the zealots in private houses which she apprehended had become so many academies of fanaticism and for this offence she had by an order of the star chamber sequestered him from his archiepiscopal function and confined him to his own house Upon his death which happened in fifteen eighty three she determined not to fall into the same error in her next choice and she named Whitgift a zealous Churchman who had already signalized his pen in controversy and who having in vain attempted to convince the Puritans by argument was now resolved to open their eyes by power and by the execution of penal statutes He informed the queen that all the spiritual authority lodged in the prelates was insignificant without the sanction of the crown and as there was no ecclesiastical commission at that time in force he engaged her to issue a new one more arbitrary than any of the former and conveying more unlimited authority Neal s History of the Puritans vol i p four hundred ten She appointed forty four commissioners twelve of whom were ecclesiastics three commissioners made a quorum the jurisdiction of the court extended over the whole kingdom and over all orders of men and every circumstance of its authority and all its methods of proceeding were contrary to the clearest principles of law and natural equity The commissioners were empowered to visit and reform all errors heresies schisms in a word to regulate all opinions as well as to punish all breach of uniformity in the exercise of public worship They were directed to make inquiry not only by the legal methods of juries and witnesses but by all other means and ways which they could devise that is by the rack by torture by inquisition by imprisonment Where they found reason to suspect any person they might administer to him an oath called ex officio by which he was bound to answer all questions and might thereby be obliged to accuse himself or his most intimate friend The fines which they levied were discretionary and often occasioned the total ruin of the offender contrary to the established laws of the kingdom The imprisonment to which they condemned any delinquent was limited by no rule but their own pleasure They assumed a power of imposing on the clergy what new articles of subscription and consequently of faith they thought proper Though all other spiritual courts were subject since the reformation to inhibitions from the supreme courts of law the ecclesiastical commissioners were exempted from that legal jurisdiction and were liable to no control And the more to enlarge their authority they were empowered to punish all incests adulteries fornications all outrages misbehaviors and disorders in marriage and the punishments which they might inflict were according to their wisdom conscience and discretion In a word this court was a real inquisition attended with all the iniquities as well as cruelties inseparable from that tribunal And as the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical court was destructive of all law so its erection was deemed by many a mere usurpation of this imperious princess and had no other foundation than a clause of a statute restoring the supremacy to the crown and empowering the sovereign to appoint commissioners for exercising that prerogative But prerogative in general especially the supremacy was supposed in that age to involve powers which no law precedent or reason could limit and determine But though the commons in their humble petition to the prelates had touched so gently and submissively on the ecclesiastical grievances the queen in a speech from the throne at the end of the session could not forbear taking notice of their presumption and reproving them for those murmurs which for fear of offending her they had pronounced so low as not directly to reach her royal ears After giving them some general thanks for their attachment to her and making professions of affection to her subjects she told them that whoever found fault with the church threw a slander upon her since she was appointed by God supreme ruler over it and no heresies or schisms could prevail in the kingdom but by her permission and negligence that some abuses must necessarily have place in every thing but she warned the prelates to be watchful for if she found them careless of their charge she was fully determined to depose them that she was commonly supposed to have employed herself in many studies particularly philosophical by which I suppose she meant theological and she would confess that few whose leisure had not allowed them to make profession of science had read or reflected more that as she could discern the presumption of many in curiously canvassing the Scriptures and starting innovations she would no longer endure this licentiousness but meant to guide her people by God s rule in the just mean between the corruptions of Rome and the errors of modern sectaries and that as the Romanists were the inveterate enemies of her person so the other innovators were dangerous to all kingly government and under color of preaching the word of God presumed to exercise their private judgment and to censure the actions of the prince From the whole of this transaction we may observe that the commons in making their general application to the prelates as well as in some particular articles of their petition showed themselves wholly ignorant no less than the queen of the principles of liberty and a legal constitution And it may not be unworthy of remark that Elizabeth so far from yielding to the displeasure of the parliament against the ecclesiastical commission granted before the end of her reign a new commission in which she enlarged rather than restrained the powers of the commissioners eighteen See note R at the end of the volume Rymer vol xvi p two hundred ninety two three hundred eighty six four hundred During this session of parliament there was discovered a conspiracy which much increased the general animosity against the Catholics and still further widened the breach between the religious parties William Parry a Catholic gentleman had received the queen s pardon for a crime by which he was exposed to capital punishment and having obtained permission to travel he retired to Milan and made open profession of his religion which he had concealed while he remained in England He was here persuaded by Palmio a Jesuit that he could not perform a more meritorious action than to take away the life of his sovereign and his benefactress the nuncio Campeggio when consulted approved extremely of this pious undertaking and Parry though still agitated with doubts came to Paris with an intention of passing over to England and executing his bloody purpose He was here encouraged in the design by Thomas Morgan a gentleman of great credit in the party and though Watts and some other Catholic priests told him that the enterprise was criminal and impious he preferred the authority of Raggazzoni the nuncio at Paris and determined to persist in his resolution He here wrote a letter to the pope which was conveyed to Cardinal Como he communicated his intention to the holy father and craved his absolution and paternal benediction He received an answer from the cardinal by which he found that his purpose was extremely applauded and he came over to England with a full design of carrying it into execution So deeply are the sentiments of morality engraved in the human breast that it is difficult even for the prejudices of false religion totally to efface them and this bigoted assassin resolved before he came to extremities to try every other expedient for alleviating the persecutions under which the Catholics at that time labored He found means of being introduced to the queen assured her that many conspiracies were formed against her and exhorted her as she tendered her life to give the Romanists some more indulgence in the exercise of their religion but lest he should be tempted by the opportunity to assassinate her he always came to court unprovided with every offensive weapon He even found means to be elected member of parliament and having made a vehement harangue against the severe laws enacted this last session was committed to custody for his freedom and sequestered from the house His failure in these attempts confirmed him the more in his former resolution and he communicated his intentions to Nevil who entered zealously into the design and was determined to have a share in the merits of its execution A book newly published by doctor Allen afterwards created a cardinal served further to efface all their scruples with regard to the murder of an heretical prince and having agreed to shoot the queen while she should be taking the air on horseback they resolved if they could not make their escape to sacrifice their lives in fulfilling a duty so agreeable as they imagined to the will of God and to true religion But while they were watching an opportunity for the execution of their purpose the earl of Westmoreland happened to die in exile and as Nevil was next heir to that family he began to entertain hopes that by doing some acceptable service to the queen he might recover the estate and honors which had been forfeited by the rebellion of the last earl He betrayed the whole conspiracy to the ministers and Parry being thrown into prison confessed the guilt both to them and to the jury who tried him The letter from Cardinal Como being produced in court put Parry s narrative beyond all question and that criminal having received sentence of death suffered the punishment which the law appointed for his treasonable conspiracy nineteen These bloody designs now appeared every where as the result of that bigoted spirit by which the two religions especially the Catholic were at this time actuated Somerville a gentleman of the county of Warwick somewhat disordered in his understanding had heard so much of the merit attending the assassination of heretics and persecutors that he came to London with a view of murdering the queen but having betrayed his design by some extravagances he was thrown into prison and there perished by a voluntary death State Trials vol i p one hundred three et seq Strype vol iii p two hundred fifty five et seq See note S at the end of the volume Camden p four hundred ninety five About the same time Baltazar Gerard a Burgundian undertook and executed the same design against the prince of Orange and that great man perished at Delft by the hands of a desperate assassin who with a resolution worthy of a better cause sacrificed his own life in order to destroy the famous restorer and protector of religious liberty The Flemings who regarded that prince as their father were filled with great sorrow as well when they considered the miserable end of so brave a patriot as their own forlorn condition from the loss of so powerful and prudent a leader and from the rapid progress of the Spanish arms The prince of Parma had made every year great advances upon them had reduced several of the provinces to obedience and had laid close siege to Antwerp the richest and most populous city of the Netherlands whose subjection it was foreseen would give a mortal blow to the already declining affairs of the revolted provinces The only hopes which remained to them arose from the prospect of foreign succor Being well acquainted with the cautious and frugal maxims of Elizabeth they expected better success in France and in the view of engaging Henry to embrace their defence they tendered him the sovereignty of their provinces But the present condition of that monarchy obliged the king to reject so advantageous an offer The duke of Anjou s death which he thought would have tended to restore public tranquillity in delivering him from the intrigues of that prince plunged him into the deepest distress and the king of Navarre a professed Hugonot being next heir to the crown the duke of Guise took thence occasion to revive the Catholic league and to urge Henry by the most violent expedients to seek the exclusion of that brave and virtuous prince Henry himself though a zealous Catholic yet because he declined complying with their precipitate measures became an object of aversion to the league and as his zeal in practising all the superstitious observances of the Romish church was accompanied with a very licentious conduct in private life the Catholic faction in contradiction to universal experience embraced thence the pretext of representing his devotion as mere deceit and hypocrisy Finding his authority to decline he was obliged to declare war against the Hugonots and to put arms into the hands of the league whom both on account of their dangerous pretensions at home and their close alliance with Philip he secretly regarded as his more dangerous enemies Constrained by the same policy he dreaded the danger of associating himself with the revolted Protestants in the Low Countries and was obliged to renounce that inviting opportunity of revenging himself for all the hostile intrigues and enterprises of Philip The states reduced to this extremity sent over a solemn embassy to London and made anew an offer to the queen of acknowledging her for their sovereign on condition of obtaining her protection and assistance Elizabeth s wisest counsellors were divided in opinion with regard to the conduct which she should hold in this critical and important emergence Some advised her to reject the offer of the states and represented the imminent dangers as well as injustice attending the acceptance of it They said that the suppression of rebellious subjects was the common cause of all sovereigns and any encouragement given to the revolt of the Flemings might prove the example of a like pernicious license to the English that though princes were bound by the laws of the Supreme Being not to oppress their subjects the people never were entitled to forget all duty to their sovereign or transfer from every fancy or disgust or even from the justest ground of complaint their obedience to any other master that the queen in the succors hitherto afforded the Flemings had considered them as laboring under oppression not as entitled to freedom and had intended only to admonish Philip not to persevere in his tyranny without any view of ravishing from him those provinces which he enjoyed by hereditary right from his ancestors that her situation in Ireland and even in England would afford that powerful monarch sufficient opportunity of retaliating upon her and she must thenceforth expect that instead of secretly fomenting faction he would openly employ his whole force in the protection and defence of the Catholics that the pope would undoubtedly unite his spiritual arms to the temporal ones of Spain and that the queen would soon repent her making so precarious an acquisition in foreign countries by exposing her own dominions to the most imminent danger Camden p five hundred seven Bentivoglio part ii lib iv Other counsellors of Elizabeth maintained a contrary opinion They asserted that the queen had not even from the beginning of her reign but certainly had not at present the choice whether she would embrace friendship or hostility with Philip that by the whole tenor of that prince s conduct it appeared that his sole aims were the extending of his empire and the entire subjection of the Protestants under the specious pretence of maintaining the Catholic faith that the provocations which she had already given him joined to his general scheme of policy would forever render him her implacable enemy and as soon as he had subdued his revolted subjects he would undoubtedly fall with the whole force of his united empire on her defenceless state that the only question was whether she would maintain a war abroad and supported by allies or wait till the subjection of all the confederates of England should give her enemies leisure to begin their hostilities in the bowels of the kingdom that the revolted provinces though in a declining condition possessed still considerable force and by the assistance of England by the advantages of their situation and by their inveterate antipathy to Philip might still be enabled to maintain the contest against the Spanish monarchy that their maritime power united to the queen s would give her entire security on the side from which alone she could be assaulted and would even enable her to make inroads on Philip s dominions both in Europe and the Indies that a war which was necessary could never be unjust and self defence was concerned as well in preventing certain dangers at a distance as in repelling any immediate invasion and that since hostility with Spain was the unavoidable consequence of the present interests and situations of the two monarchies it were better to compensate that danger and loss by the acquisition of such important provinces to the English empire Camden p five hundred seven Bentivoglio part ii lib iv Amidst these opposite counsels the queen apprehensive of the consequences attending each extreme was inclined to steer a middle course and though such conduct is seldom prudent she was not in this resolution guided by any prejudice or mistaken affection She was determined not to permit without opposition the total subjection of the revolted provinces whose interests she deemed so closely connected with her own but foreseeing that the acceptance of their sovereignty would oblige her to employ her whole force in their defence would give umbrage to her neighbors and would expose her to the reproach of ambition and usurpation imputations which hitherto she had carefully avoided she immediately rejected this offer She concluded a league with the states on the following conditions that she should send over an army to their assistance of five thousand foot and a thousand horse and pay them during the war that the general and two others whom she should appoint should be admitted into the council of the states that neither party should make peace without the consent of the other that her expenses should be refunded after the conclusion of the war and that the towns of Flushing and the Brille with the Castle of Rammekins should in the mean time be consigned into her hands by way of security The queen knew that this measure would immediately engage her in open hostilities with Philip yet was not she terrified with the view of the present greatness of that monarch The continent of Spain was at that time rich and populous and the late addition of Portugal besides securing internal tranquillity had annexed an opulent kingdom to Philip s dominions had made him master of many settlements in the East Indies and of the whole commerce of those regions and had much increased his naval power in which he was before chiefly deficient All the princes of Italy even the pope and the court of Rome were reduced to a kind of subjection under him and seemed to possess their sovereignty on terms somewhat precarious The Austrian branch in Germany with their dependent principalities was closely connected with him and was ready to supply him with troops for every enterprise All the treasures of the West Indies were in his possession and the present scarcity of the precious metals in every country of Europe rendered the influence of his riches the more forcible and extensive The Netherlands seemed on the point of relapsing into servitude and small hopes were entertained of their withstanding those numerous and veteran armies which under the command of the most experienced generals he employed against them Even France which was wont to counterbalance the Austrian greatness had lost all her force from intestine commotions and as the Catholics the ruling party were closely connected with him he rather expected thence an augmentation than a diminution of his power Upon the whole such prepossessions were every where entertained concerning the force of the Spanish monarchy that the king of Sweden when he heard that Elizabeth had openly embraced the defence of the revolted Flemings scrupled not to say that she had now taken the diadem from her head and had adventured it upon the doubtful chance of war Camden p five hundred eight Yet was this princess rather cautious than enterprising in her natural temper she ever needed more to be impelled by the vigor than restrained by the prudence of her ministers but when she saw an evident necessity she braved danger with magnanimous courage and trusting to her own consummate wisdom and to the affections however divided of her people she prepared herself to resist and even to assault the whole force of the Catholic monarch The earl of Leicester was sent over to Holland at the head of the English auxiliary forces He carried with him a splendid retinue being accompanied by the young earl of Essex his son in law the lords Audley and North Sir William Russel Sir Thomas Shirley Sir Arthur Basset Sir Walter Waller Sir Gervase Clifton and a select troop of five hundred gentlemen He was received on his arrival at Flushing by his nephew Sir Philip Sidney the governor and every town through which he passed expressed their joy by acclamations and triumphal arches as if his presence and the queen s protection had brought them the most certain deliverance The states desirous of engaging Elizabeth still further in their defence and knowing the interest which Leicester possessed with her conferred on him the title of governor and captain general of the united provinces appointed a guard to attend him and treated him in some respects as their sovereign But this step had a contrary effect to what they expected The queen was displeased with the artifice of the states and the ambition of Leicester She severely reprimanded both and it was with some difficulty that after many humble admissions they were able to appease her America was regarded as the chief source of Philip s power as well as the most defenceless part of his dominions and Elizabeth finding that an open breach with that monarch was unavoidable resolved not to leave him unmolested in that quarter The great success of the Spaniards and Portuguese in both Indies had excited a spirit of emulation in England and as the progress of commerce still more that of colonies is slow and gradual it was happy that a war in this critical period had opened a more flattering prospect to the avarice and ambition of the English and had tempted them by the view of sudden and exorbitant profit to engage in naval enterprises A fleet of twenty sail was equipped to attack the Spaniards in the West Indies two thousand three hundred volunteers besides seamen engaged on board of it Sir Francis Drake was appointed admiral Christopher Carlisle commander of the land forces They took saint Jago near Cape Verde by surprise and found in it plenty of provisions but no riches They sailed to Hispaniola and easily making themselves masters of saint Domingo by assault obliged the inhabitants to ransom their houses by a sum of money Carthagena fell next into their hands after some more resistance and was treated in the same manner They burnt saint Anthony and saint Helens two towns on the coast of Florida Sailing along the coast of Virginia they found the small remains of a colony which had been planted there by Sir Walter Raleigh and which had gone extremely to decay This was the first attempt of the English to form such settlements and though they have since surpassed all European nations both in the situation of their colonies and in the noble principles of liberty and industry on which they are founded they had here been so unsuccessful that the miserable planters abandoned their settlements and prevailed on Drake to carry them with him to England He returned with so much riches as encouraged the volunteers and with such accounts of the Spanish weakness in those countries as served extremely to inflame the spirits of the nation to future enterprises The great mortality which the climate had produced in his fleet was as is usual but a feeble restraint on the avidity and sanguine hopes of young adventurers It is thought that Drake s fleet first introduced the use of tobacco into England Camden p five hundred nine The enterprises of Leicester were much less successful than those of Drake This man possessed neither courage nor capacity equal to the trust reposed in him by the queen and as he was the only bad choice she made for any considerable employment men naturally believed that she had here been influenced by an affection still more partial than that of friendship He gained at first some advantage in an action against the Spaniards and threw succors into Grave by which that place was enabled to make a vigorous defence but the cowardice of the governor Van Hemert rendered all these efforts useless He capitulated after a feeble resistance and being tried for his conduct suffered a capital punishment from the sentence of a court martial The prince of Parma next undertook the siege of Venlo which was surrendered to him after some resistance The fate of Nuys was more dismal being taken by assault while the garrison was treating of a capitulation Rhimberg which was garrisoned by twelve hundred English under the command of Colonel Morgan was afterwards besieged by the Spaniards and Leicester thinking himself too weak to attempt raising the siege endeavored to draw off the prince of Parma by forming another enterprise He first attacked Doesberg and succeeded he then sat down before Zutphen which the Spanish general thought so important a fortress that he hastened to its relief He made the marquis of Guasto advance with a convoy which he intended to throw into the place They were favored by a fog but falling by accident on a body of English cavalry a furious action ensued in which the Spaniards were worsted and the marquis of Gonzaga an Italian nobleman of great reputation and family was slain The pursuit was stopped by the advance of the prince of Parma with the main body of the Spanish army and the English cavalry on their return from the field found their advantage more than compensated by the loss of Sir Philip Sidney who being mortally wounded in the action was carried off by the soldiers and soon after died This person is described by the writers of that age as the most perfect model of an accomplished gentleman that could be formed even by the wanton imagination of poetry or fiction Virtuous conduct polite conversation heroic valor and elegant erudition all concurred to render him the ornament and delight of the English court and as the credit which he possessed with the queen and the earl of Leicester was wholly employed in the encouragement of genius and literature his praises have been transmitted with advantage to posterity No person was so low as not to become an object of his humanity After this last action while he was lying on the field mangled with wounds a bottle of water was brought him to relieve his thirst but observing a soldier near him in a like miserable condition he said This man s necessity is still greater than mine and resigned to him the bottle of water The king of Scots struck with admiration of Sidney s virtue celebrated his memory in a copy of Latin verses which he composed on the death of that young hero Illustration one five hundred fifty three sidney jpg SIR PHILIP SIDNEY The English though a long peace had deprived them of all experience were strongly possessed of military genius and the advantages gained by the prince of Parma were not attributed to the superior bravery and discipline of the Spaniards but solely to the want of military abilities in Leicester The states were much discontented with his management of the war still more with his arbitrary and imperious conduct and at the end of the campaign they applied to him for a redress of all their grievances But Leicester without giving them any satisfaction departed soon after for England Camden p five hundred twelve Bentivoglio part ii lib iv The queen while she provoked so powerful an enemy as the king of Spain was not forgetful to secure herself on the side of Scotland and she endeavored both to cultivate the friendship and alliance of her kinsman James and to remove all grounds of quarrel between them An attempt which she had made some time before was not well calculated to gain Ihe confidence of that prince She had despatched Wotton as her ambassador to Scotland but though she gave him private instructions with regard to her affairs she informed James that when she had any political business to discuss with him she would employ another minister that this man was not fitted for serious negotiations and that her chief purpose in sending him was to entertain the king with witty and facetious conversation and to partake without reserve of his pleasures and amusements Wotton was master of profound dissimulation and knew how to cover under the appearance of a careless gayety the deepest designs and most dangerous artifices When but a youth of twenty he had been employed by his uncle doctor Wotton ambassador in France during the reign of Mary to insnare the constable Montmorency and had not his purpose been frustrated by pure accident his cunning had prevailed over all the caution and experience of that aged minister It is no wonder that after years had improved him in all the arts of deceit he should gain an ascendant over a young prince of so open and unguarded a temper as James especially when the queen s recommendation prepared the way for his reception He was admitted into all the pleasures of the king made himself master of his secrets and had so much the more authority with him in political transactions as he did not seem to pay the least attention to these matters The Scottish ministers who observed the growing interest of this man endeavored to acquire his friendship and scrupled not to sacrifice to his intrigues the most essential interests of their master Elizabeth s usual jealousies with regard to her heirs began now to be levelled against James and as that prince had attained the years proper for marriage she was apprehensive lest by being strengthened by children and alliances he should acquire the greater interest and authority with her English subjects She directed Wotton to form a secret concert with some Scottish noblemen and to procure their promise that James during three years should not on any account be permitted to marry In consequence of this view they endeavored to embroil him with the king of Denmark who had sent ambassadors to Scotland on pretence of demanding restitution of the Orkneys but really with a view of opening a proposal of marriage between James and his daughter Wotton is said to have employed his intrigues to purposes still more dangerous He formed it is pretended a conspiracy with some malecontents to seize the person of the king and to deliver him into the hands of Elizabeth who would probably have denied all concurrence in the design but would have been sure to retain him in perpetual thraldom if not captivity The conspiracy was detected and Wotton fled hastily from Scotland without taking leave of the king James s situation obliged him to dissemble his resentment of this traitorous attempt and his natural temper inclined him soon to forgive and forget it The queen found no difficulty in renewing the negotiations for a strict alliance between Scotland and England and the more effectually to gain the prince s friendship she granted him a pension equivalent to his claim on the inheritance of his grand mother the countess of Lenox lately deceased A league was formed between Elizabeth and James for the mutual defence of their dominions and of their religion now menaced by the open combination of all the Catholic powers of Europe It was stipulated that if Elizabeth were invaded James should aid her with a body of two thousand horse and five thousand foot that Elizabeth in a like case should send to his assistance three thousand horse and six thousand foot that the charge of these armies should be defrayed by the prince who demanded assistance that if the invasion should be made upon England within sixty miles of the frontiers of Scotland this latter kingdom should march its whole force to the assistance of the former and that the present league should supersede all former alliances of either state with any foreign kingdom so far as religion was concerned Melvil Spotswood p three hundred fifty one Spotswood p three hundred forty nine Camden p five hundred thirteen Rymer tom xv p eight hundred three By this league James secured himself against all attempts from abroad opened a way for acquiring the confidence and affections of the English and might entertain some prospect of domestic tranquillity which while he lived on bad terms with Elizabeth he could never expect long to enjoy Besides the turbulent disposition and inveterate feuds of the nobility ancient maladies of the Scottish government the spirit of fanaticism had introduced a new disorder so much the more dangerous as religion when corrupted by false opinion is not restrained by any rules of morality and is even scarcely to be accounted for in its operations by any principles of ordinary conduct and policy The insolence of the preachers who triumphed in their dominion over the populace had at this time reached an extreme height and they carried their arrogance so far not only against the king but against the whole civil power that they excommunicated the archbishop of saint Andrews because he had been active in parliament for promoting a law which restrained their seditious sermons nor could that prelate save himself by any expedient from this terrible sentence but by renouncing all pretensions to ecclesiastical authority One Gibson said in the pulpit that Captain James Stuart meaning the late earl of Arran and his wife Jezebel had been deemed the chief persecutors of the church but it was now seen that the king himself was the great offender and for this crime the preacher denounced against him the curse which fell on Jeroboam that he should die childless and be the last of his race The secretary Thirlstone perceiving the king so much molested with ecclesiastical affairs and with the refractory disposition of the clergy advised him to leave them to their own courses for that in a short time they would become so intolerable that the people would rise against them and drive them out of the country True replied the king if I purposed to undo the church and religion your counsel were good but my intention is to maintain both therefore cannot I suffer the clergy to follow such a conduct as will in the end bring religion into contempt and derision Spotswood p three hundred forty six three hundred forty six Spotswood p thirty four Spotswood p three hundred forty eight CHAPTER XLII ELIZABETH The dangers which arose from the character principles and pretensions of the queen of Scots had very early engaged Elizabeth to consult in her treatment of that unfortunate princess the dictates of jealousy and politics rather than of friendship or generosity resentment of this usage had pushed Mary into enterprises which had nearly threatened the repose and authority of Elizabeth the rigor and restraint thence redoubled upon the captive queen still impelled her to attempt greater extremities and while her impatience of confinement her revenge twenty and her high spirit concurred with religious zeal and the suggestions of desperate bigots she was at last engaged in designs which afforded her enemies who watched the opportunity a pretence or reason for effecting her final ruin Digges p one hundred thirty nine Haynes p six hundred seven See note T at the end of the volume The English seminary at Rheims had wrought themselves up to a high pitch of rage and animosity against the queen The recent persecutions from which they had escaped the new rigors which they knew awaited them in the course of their missions the liberty which for the present they enjoyed of declaiming against that princess and the contagion of that religious fury which every where surrounded them in France all these causes had obliterated with them every maxim of common sense and every principle of morals or humanity Intoxicated with admiration of the divine power and infallibility of the pope they revered his bull by which he excommunicated and deposed the queen and some of them had gone to that height of extravagance as to assert that that performance had been immediately dictated by the Holy Ghost The assassination of heretical sovereigns and of that princess in particular was represented as the most meritorious of all enterprises and they taught that whoever perished in such pious attempts enjoyed without dispute the glorious and never fading crown of martyrdom By such doctrines they instigated John Savage a man of desperate courage who had served some years in the Low Countries under the prince of Parma to attempt the life of Elizabeth and this assassin having made a vow to persevere in his design was sent over to England and recommended to the confidence of the more zealous Catholics About the same time John Ballard a priest of that seminary had returned to Paris from his mission in England and Scotland and as he had observed a spirit of mutiny and rebellion to be very prevalent among the Catholic devotees in these countries he had founded on that disposition the project of dethroning Elizabeth and of restoring by force of arms the exercise of the ancient religion The situation of affairs abroad seemed favorable to this enterprise the pope the Spaniard the duke of Guise concurring in interests had formed a resolution to make some attempt against England and Mendoza the Spanish ambassador at Paris strongly encouraged Ballard to hope for succors from these princes Charles Paget alone a zealous Catholic and a devoted partisan of the queen of Scots being well acquainted with the prudence vigor and general popularity of Elizabeth always maintained that so long as that princess was allowed to live it was in vain to expect any success from an enterprise upon England Ballard persuaded of this truth saw more clearly the necessity of executing the design formed at Rheims he came over to England in the disguise of a soldier and assumed the name of Captain Fortescue and he bent his endeavors to effect at once the project of an assassination an insurrection and an invasion Murden s State Papers p five hundred seventeen Camden p five hundred fifteen The first person to whom he addressed himself was Anthony Babington of Dethic in the county of Derby This young gentleman was of a good family possessed a plentiful fortune had discovered an excellent capacity and was accomplished in literature beyond most of his years or station Being zealously devoted to the Catholic communion he had secretly made a journey to Paris some time before and had fallen into intimacy with Thomas Morgan a bigoted fugitive from England and with the bishop of Glasgow Mary s ambassador at the court of France By continually extolling the amiable accomplishments and heroical virtues of that princess they impelled the sanguine and unguarded mind of young Babington to make some attempt for her service and they employed every principle of ambition gallantry and religious zeal to give him a contempt of those dangers which attended any enterprise against the vigilant government of Elizabeth Finding him well disposed for their purpose they sent him back to England and secretly unknown to himself recommended him to the queen of Scots as a person worth engaging in her service She wrote him a letter full of friendship and confidence and Babington ardent in his temper and zealous in his principles thought that these advances now bound him in honor to devote himself entirely to the service of that unfortunate princess During some time he had found means of conveying to her all her foreign correspondence but after she was put under the custody of Sir Amias Paulet and reduced to a more rigorous confinement he experienced so much difficulty and danger in rendering her this service that he had desisted from every attempt of that nature When Ballard began to open his intentions to Babington he found his zeal suspended not extinguished his former ardor revived on the mention of any enterprise which seemed to promise success in the cause of Mary and of the Catholic religion He had entertained sentiments conformable to those of Paget and represented the folly of all attempts which during the lifetime of Elizabeth could be formed against the established religion and government of England Ballard encouraged by this hint proceeded to discover to him the design undertaken by Savage and was well pleased to observe that instead of being shocked with the project Babington only thought it not secure enough when intrusted to one single hand and proposed to join five others with Savage in this desperate enterprise Camden p five hundred fifteen State Trials p one hundred fourteen In prosecution of these views Babington employed himself in increasing the number of his associates and he secretly drew into the conspiracy many Catholic gentlemen discontented with the present government Barnwell of a noble family in Ireland Charnoc a gentleman of Lancashire and Abington whose father had been cofferer to the household readily undertook the assassination of the queen Charles Tilney the heir of an ancient family and Titchborne of Southampton when the design was proposed to them expressed some scruples which were removed by the arguments of Babington and Ballard Savage alone refused during some time to share the glory of the enterprise with any others he challenged the whole to himself and it was with some difficulty he was induced to depart from this preposterous ambition State Trials vol i p one hundred eleven The deliverance of the queen of Scots at the very same instant when Elizabeth should be assassinated was requisite for effecting the purpose of the conspirators and Babington undertook with a party of a hundred horse to attack her guards while she should be taking the air on horseback In this enterprise he engaged Edward Windsor brother to the lord of that name Thomas Salisbury Robert Gage John Travers John Jones and Henry Donne most of them men of family and interest The conspirators much wanted but could not find any nobleman of note whom they might place at the head of the enterprise but they trusted that the great events of the queen s death and Mary s deliverance would rouse all the zealous Catholics to arms and that foreign forces taking advantage of the general confusion would easily fix the queen of Scots on the throne and reestablish the ancient religion These desperate projects had not escaped the vigilance of Elizabeth s council particularly of Walsingham secretary of state That artful minister had engaged Maud a Catholic priest whom he retained in pay to attend Ballard in his journey to France and had thereby got a hint of the designs entertained by the fugitives Polly another of his spies had found means to insinuate himself among the conspirators in England and though not entirely trusted had obtained some insight into their dangerous secrets But the bottom of the conspiracy was never fully known till Gifford a seminary priest came over and made a tender of his services to Walsingham By his means the discovery became of the utmost importance and involved the fate of Mary as well as of those zealous partisans of that princess Babington and his associates having laid such a plan as they thought promised infallible success were impatient to communicate the design to the queen of Scots and to obtain her approbation and concurrence For this service they employed Gifford who immediately applied to Walsingham that the interest of that minister might forward his secret correspondence with Mary Walsingham proposed the matter to Paulet and desired him to connive at Gifford s corrupting one of his servants but Paulet averse to the introducing of such a pernicious precedent into his family desired that they would rather think of some other expedient Gifford found a brewer who supplied the family with ale and bribed him to convey letters to the captive queen The letters by Paulet s connivance were thrust through a chink in the wall and answers were returned by the same conveyance Ballard and Babington were at first diffident of Gifford s fidelity and to make trial of him they gave him only blank papers made up like letters but finding by the answers that these had been faithfully delivered they laid aside all further scruple and conveyed by his hands the most criminal and dangerous parts of their conspiracy Babington informed Mary of the design laid for a foreign invasion the plan of an insurrection at home the scheme for her deliverance and the conspiracy for assassinating the usurper by six noble gentlemen as he termed them all of them his private friends who from the zeal which they bore to the Catholic cause and her majesty s service would undertake the tragical execution Mary replied that she approved highly of the design that the gentlemen might expect all the rewards which it should ever be in her power to confer and that the death of Elizabeth was a necessary circumstance before any attempts were made either for her own deliverance or an insurrection State Trials vol i p one hundred thirty five Camden p five hundred fifteen These letters with others to Mendoza Charles Paget the archbishop of Glasgow and Sir Francis Inglefield were carried by Gifford to Secretary Walsingham were deciphered by the art of Philips his clerk and copies taken of them Walsingham employed another artifice in order to obtain full insight into the plot he subjoined to a letter of Mary s a postscript in the same cipher in which he made her desire Babington to inform her of the names of the conspirators The indiscretion of Babington furnished Walsingham with still another means of detection as well as of defence That gentlemen had caused a picture to be drawn where he himself was represented standing amidst the six assassins and a motto was subjoined expressing that their common perils were the band of their confederacy A copy of this picture was brought to Elizabeth that she might know the assassins and guard herself against their approach to her person Meanwhile Babington anxious to insure and hasten the foreign succors resolved to despatch Ballard into France and he procured for him under a feigned name a license to travel In order to remove from himself all suspicion he applied to Walsingharn pretended great zeal for the queen s service offered to go abroad and professed his intentions of employing the confidence which he had gained among the Catholics to the detection and disappointment of their conspiracies Walsingham commended his loyal purposes and promising his own counsel and assistance in the execution of them still fed him with hopes and maintained a close correspondence with him A warrant meanwhile was issued for seizing Ballard and this incident joined to the consciousness of guilt begat in all the conspirators the utmost anxiety and concern Some advised that they should immediately make their escape others proposed that Savage and Charnoc should without delay execute their purpose against Elizabeth and Babington in prosecution of this scheme furnished Savage with money that he might buy good clothes and thereby have more easy access to the queen s person Next day they began to apprehend that they had taken the alarm too hastily and Babington having renewed his correspondence with Walsingham was persuaded by that subtle minister that the seizure of Ballard had proceeded entirely from the usual diligence of informers in the detection of popish and seminary priests He even consented to take lodgings secretly in Walsingham s house that they might have more frequent conferences together before his intended departure for France but observing that he was watched and guarded he made his escape and gave the alarm to the other conspirators They all took to flight covered themselves with several disguises and lay concealed in woods or barns but were soon discovered and thrown into prison In their examinations they contradicted each other and the leaders were obliged to make a full confession of the truth Fourteen were condemned and executed of whom seven acknowledged the crime on their trial the rest were convicted by evidence The lesser conspirators being despatched measures were taken for the trial and conviction of the queen of Scots on whose account and with whose concurrence these attempts had been made against the life of the queen and the tranquillity of the kingdom Some of Elizabeth s counsellors were averse to this procedure and thought that the close confinement of a woman who was become very sickly and who would probably put a speedy period to their anxiety by her natural death might give sufficient security to the government without attempting a measure of which there scarcely remains any example in history Leicester advised that Mary should be secretly despatched by poison and he sent a divine to convince Walsingham of the lawfulness of that action but Walsingham declared his abhorrence of it and still insisted in conjunction with the majority of the counsellors for the open trial of the queen of Scots The situation of England and of the English ministers had indeed been hitherto not a little dangerous No successor of the crown was declared but the heir of blood to whom the people in general were likely to adhere was by education an enemy to the national religion was from multiplied provocations an enemy to the ministers and principal nobility and their personal safety as well as the safety of the public seemed to depend alone on the queen s life who was now somewhat advanced in years No wonder therefore that Elizabeth s counsellors knowing themselves to be so obnoxious to the queen of Scots endeavored to push every measure to extremities against her and were even more anxious than the queen herself to prevent her from ever mounting the throne of England Though all England was acquainted with the detection of Babington s conspiracy every avenue to the queen of Scots had been so strictly guarded that she remained in utter ignorance of the matter and it was a great surprise to her when Sir Thomas Gorges by Elizabeth s orders informed her that all her accomplices were discovered and arrested He chose the time for giving her this intelligence when she was mounted on horseback to go a hunting and she was not permitted to return to her former place of abode but war conducted from one gentleman s house to another till she was lodged in Fotheringay Castle in the County of Northampton which it was determined to make the last stage of her trial and sufferings Her two secretaries Nau a Frenchman and Curle a Scot were immediately arrested all her papers were seized and sent up to the council above sixty different keys to ciphers were discovered there were also found many letters from persons beyond sea and several too from English noblemen containing expressions of respect and attachment The queen took no notice of this latter discovery but the persons themselves knowing their correspondence to be detected though that they had no other means of making atonement for their imprudence than by declaring themselves thenceforth the most inveterate enemies of the queen of Scots Camden p five hundred eighteen It was resolved to try Mary not by the common statute of treasons but by the act which had passed the former year with a view to this very event and the queen in terms of that act appointed a commission consisting of forty noblemen and privy counsellors and empowered them to examine and pass sentence on Mary whom she denominated the late queen of Scots and heir to James V of Scotland The commissioners came to Fotheringay Castle and sent to her Sir Walter Mildmay Sir Amias Paulet and Edward Barker who delivered her a letter from Elizabeth informing her of the commission and of the approaching trial Mary received the intelligence without emotion or astonishment She said however that it seemed strange to her that the queen should command her as a subject to submit to a trial and examination before subjects that she was an absolute independent princess and would yield to nothing which might derogate either from her royal majesty from the state of sovereign princes or from the dignity and rank of her son that however oppressed by misfortunes she was not yet so much broken in spirit as her enemies flattered themselves nor would she on any account be accessary to her own degradation and dishonor that she was ignorant of the laws and statutes of England was utterly destitute of counsel and could not conceive who were entitled to be called her peers or could legally sit as judges on her trial that though she had lived in England for many years she had lived in captivity and not having received the protection of the laws she could not merely by her involuntary residence in the country be supposed to have subjected herself to their jurisdiction that notwithstanding the superiority of her rank she was willing to give an account of her conduct before an English parliament but could not view these commissioners in any other light than as men appointed to justify by some color of legal proceeding her condemnation and execution and that she warned them to look to their conscience and their character in trying an innocent person and to reflect that these transactions would somewhere be subject to revisal and that the theatre of the whole world was much wider than the kingdom of England In return the commissioners sent a new deputation informing her that her plea either from her royal dignity or from her imprisonment could not be admitted and that they were empowered to proceed to her trial even though she should refuse to answer before them Burleigh the treasurer and Bromley the chancellor employed much reasoning to make her submit but the person whose arguments had the chief influence was Sir Christopher Hatton vice chamberlain His speech was to this purpose You are accused madam said he but not condemned of having conspired the destruction of our lady and queen anointed You say you are a queen but in such a crime as this and such a situation as yours the royal dignity itself neither by the civil or canon law nor by the law of nature or of nations is exempt from judgment If you be innocent you wrong your reputation in avoiding a trial We have been present at your protestations of innocence but Queen Elizabeth thinks otherwise and is heartily sorry for the appearances which lie against you To examine therefore your cause she has appointed commissioners honorable persons prudent and upright men who are ready to hear you with equity and even with favor and will rejoice if you can clear yourself of the imputations which have been thrown upon you Believe me madam the queen herself will rejoice who affirmed to me at my departure that nothing which ever befell her had given her so much uneasiness as that you should be suspected of a concurrence in these criminal enterprises Laying aside therefore the fruitless claim of privilege from your royal dignity which can now avail you nothing trust to the better defence of your innocence make it appear in open trial and leave not upon your memory that stain of infamy which must attend your obstinate silence on this occasion Camden p five hundred twenty three By this artful speech Mary was persuaded to answer before the court and thereby gave an appearance of legal procedure to the trial and prevented those difficulties which the commissioners must have fallen into had she persevered in maintaining so specious a plea as that of her sovereign and independent character Her conduct in this particular must be regarded as the more imprudent because formerly when Elizabeth s commissioners pretended not to exercise any jurisdiction over her and only entered into her cause by her own consent and approbation she declined justifying herself when her honor which ought to have been dearer to her than life seemed absolutely to require it On her first appearance before the commissioners Mary either sensible of her imprudence or still unwilling to degrade herself by submitting to a trial renewed her protestation against the authority of her judges the chancellor answered her by pleading the supreme authority of the English laws over every one who resided in England and the commissioners accommodated matters by ordering both her protestation and his answer to be recorded The lawyers of the crown then opened the charge against the queen of Scots They proved by intercepted letters that she had allowed Cardinal Allen and others to treat her as queen of England and that she had kept a correspondence with Lord Paget and Charles Paget in view of engaging the Spaniards to invade the kingdom Mary seemed not anxious to clear herself from either of these imputations She only said that she could not hinder others from using what style they pleased in writing to her and that she might lawfully try every expedient for the recovery of her liberty An intercepted letter of hers to Mendoza was next produced in which she promised to transfer to Philip her right to the kingdom of England if her son should refuse to be converted to the Catholic faith an event she there said of which there was no expectation while he remained in the hands of his Scottish subjects State Trials vol i p one hundred thirty eight Even this part of the charge she took no pains to deny or rather she seemed to acknowledge it She said that she had no kingdoms to dispose of yet was it lawful for her to give at her pleasure what was her own and she was not accountable to any for her actions She added that she had formerly rejected that proposal from Spain but now since all her hopes in England were gone she was fully determined not to refuse foreign assistance There was also produced evidence to prove that Allen and Parsons were at that very time negotiating by her orders at Rome the conditions of transferring her English crown to the king of Spain and of disinheriting her heretical son twenty one It is remarkable that Mary s prejudices against her son were at this time carried so far that she had even entered into a conspiracy against him had appointed Lord Claud Hamilton regent of Scotland and had instigated her adherents to seize James s person and deliver him into the hands of the pope or the king of Spain whence he was never to be delivered but on condition of his becoming Catholic twenty four The only part of the charge which Mary positively denied was her concurrence in the design of assassinating Elizabeth This article indeed was the most heavy and the only one that could fully justify the queen in proceeding to extremities against her In order to prove the accusation there were produced the following evidence copies taken in Secretary Walsingham s office of the intercepted letters between her and Babington in which her approbation of the murder was clearly expressed the evidence of her two secretaries Nau and Curle who had confessed without being put to any torture both that she received these letters from Babington and that they had written the answers by her order the confession of Babington that he had written the letters and received the answers and the confession of Ballard and Savage that Babington had showed them these letters of Mary written in the cipher which had been settled between them See note U at the end of the volume See note X at the end of the volume State Trials vol i p one hundred thirteen It is evident that this complication of evidence though every circumstance corroborates the general conclusion resolves itself finally into the testimony of the two secretaries who alone were certainly acquainted with their mistress s concurrence in Babington s conspiracy but who knew themselves exposed to all the rigors of imprisonment torture and death if they refused to give any evidence which might be required of them In the case of an ordinary criminal this proof with all its disadvantages would be esteemed legal and even satisfactory if not opposed by some other circumstances which shake the credit of the witnesses but on the present trial where the absolute power of the prosecutor concurred with such important interests and such a violent inclination to have the princess condemned the testimony of two witnesses even though men of character ought to be supported by strong probabilities in order to remove all suspicion of tyranny and injustice The proof against Mary it must be confessed is not destitute of this advantage and it is difficult if not impossible to account for Babington s receiving an answer written in her name and in the cipher concerted between them without allowing that the matter had been communicated to that princess Such is the light in which this matter appears even after time has discovered every thing which could guide our judgment with regard to it no wonder therefore that the queen of Scots unassisted by counsel and confounded by so extraordinary a trial found herself incapable of making a satisfactory defence before the commissioners Her reply consisted chiefly in her own denial whatever force may be in that denial was much weakened by her positively affirming that she never had had any correspondence of any kind with Babington a fact however of which there remains not the least question twenty five She asserted that as Nau and Curle had taken an oath of secrecy and fidelity to her their evidence against her ought not to be credited She confessed however that Nau had been in the service of her uncle the cardinal of Lorraine and had been recommended to her by the king of France as a man in whom she might safely confide She also acknowledged Curle to be a very honest man but simple and easily imposed on by Nau If these two men had received any letters or had written any answers without her knowledge the imputation she said could never lie on her And she was the more inclined she added to entertain this suspicion against them because Nau had in other instances been guilty of a like temerity and had ventured to transact business in her name without communicating the matter to her twenty six See note Y at the end of the volume See note Z at the end cf the volume The sole circumstance of her defence which to us may appear to have some force was her requiring that Nau and Cure should be confronted with her and her affirming that they never would to her face persist in their evidence But that demand however equitable was not then supported by law in trials of high treason and was often refused even in other trials where the crown was prosecutor The clause contained in an act of the thirteenth of the queen was a novelty that the species of treason there enumerated must be proved by two witnesses confronted with the criminal But Mary was not tried upon that act and the ministers and crown lawyers of this reign were always sure to refuse every indulgence beyond what the strict letter of the law and the settled practice of the courts of justice required of them Not to mention that these secretaries were not probably at Fotheringay Castle during the time of the trial and could not upon Mary s demand be produced before the commissioners Queen Elizabeth was willing to have allowed Curle and Nau to be produced in the trial and writes to that purpose to Burleigh and Walsingham in her letter of the seventh of October in Forbes s MS collections She only says that she thinks it needless though she was willing to agree to it The not confronting of the witnesses was not the result of design but the practice of the age There passed two incidents in this trial which may be worth observing A letter between Mary and Babington was read in which mention was made of the earl of Arundel and his brothers on hearing their names she broke into a sigh Alas said she what has the noble house of the Howards suffered for my sake She affirmed with regard to the same letter that it was easy to forge the handwriting and cipher of another she was afraid that this was too familiar a practice with Walsingham who she also heard had frequently practised both against her life and her son s Walsingham who was one of the commissioners rose up He protested that in his private capacity he had never acted any thing against the queen of Scots in his public capacity he owned that his concern for his sovereign s safety had made him very diligent in searching out by every expedient all designs against her sacred person or her authority For attaining that end he would not only make use of the assistance of Ballard or any other conspirator he would also reward them for betraying their companions But if he had tampered in any manner unbefitting his character and office why did none of the late criminals either at their trial or execution accuse him of such practices Mary endeavored to pacify him by saying that she spoke from information and she begged him to give thenceforth no more credit to such as slandered her than she should to such as accused him The great character indeed which Sir Francis Walsingham bears for probity and honor should remove from him all suspicion of such base arts as forgery and subornation arts which even the most corrupt ministers in the most corrupt times would scruple to employ Having finished the trial the commissioners adjourned from Fotheringay Castle and met in the star chamber at London where after taking the oaths of Mary s two secretaries who voluntarily without hope or reward vouched the authenticity of those letters before produced they pronounced sentence of death upon the queen of Scots and confirmed it by their seals and subscriptions The same day a declaration was published by the commissioners and the judges that the sentence did nowise derogate from the title and honor of James king of Scotland but that he was in the same place degree and right as if the sentence had never been pronounced Camden p five hundred twenty six The queen had now brought affairs with Mary to that situation which she had long ardently desired and had found a plausible reason for executing vengeance on a competitor whom from the beginning of her reign she had ever equally dreaded and hated But she was restrained from instantly gratifying her resentment by several important considerations She foresaw the invidious colors in which this example of uncommon jurisdiction would be represented by the numerous partisans of Mary and the reproach to which she herself might be exposed with all foreign princes perhaps with all posterity The rights of hospitality of kindred and of royal majesty seemed in one signal instance to be all violated and this sacrifice of generosity to interest of clemency to revenge might appear equally unbecoming a sovereign and a woman Elizabeth therefore who was an excellent hypocrite pretended the utmost reluctance to proceed to the execution of the sentence affected the most tender sympathy with her prisoner displayed all her scruples and difficulties rejected the solicitation of her courtiers and ministers and affirmed that were she not moved by the deepest concern for her people s safety she would not hesitate a moment in pardoning all the injuries which she herself had received from the queen of Scots That the voice of her people might be more audibly heard in the demand of justice upon Mary she summoned a new parliament and she knew both from the usual dispositions of that assembly and from the influence of her ministers over them that she should not want the most earnest solicitation to consent to that measure which was so agreeable to her secret inclinations She did not open this assembly in person but appointed for that purpose three commissioners Bromley the chancellor Burleigh the treasurer and the earl of Derby The reason assigned for this measure was that the queen foreseeing that the affair of the queen of Scots would be canvassed in parliament found her tenderness and delicacy so much hurt by that melancholy incident that she had not the courage to be present while it was under deliberation but withdrew her eyes from what she could not behold without the utmost reluctance and uneasiness She was also willing that by this unusual precaution the people should see the danger to which her person was hourly exposed and should thence be more strongly incited to take vengeance on the criminal whose restless intrigues and bloody conspiracies had so long exposed her to the most imminent perils The parliament answered the queen s expectations the sentence against Mary was unanimously ratified by both houses and an application was voted to obtain Elizabeth s consent to its publication and execution She gave an answer ambiguous embarrassed full of real artifice and seeming irresolution She mentioned the extreme danger to which her life was continually exposed she declared her willingness to die did she not foresee the great calamities which would thence fall upon the nation she made professions of the greatest tenderness to her people she displayed the clemency of her temper and expressed her violent reluctance to execute the sentence against her unhappy kinswoman she affirmed that the late law by which that princess was tried so far from being made to insnare her was only intended to give her warning beforehand not to engage in such attempts as might expose her to the penalties with which she was thus openly menaced and she begged them to think once again whether it were possible to find any expedient besides the death of the queen of Scots for securing the public tranquility D Ewes p three hundred seventy five D Ewes p three hundred seventy nine D Ewes p four hundred two four hundred three The parliament in obedience to her commands took the affair again under consideration but could find no other possible expedient They reiterated their solicitations and entreaties and arguments they even remonstrated that mercy to the queen of Scots was cruelty to them her subjects and children and they affirmed that it were injustice to deny execution of the law to any individual much more to the whole body of the people now unanimously and earnestly suing for this pledge of her parental care and tenderness This second address set the pretended doubts and scruples of Elizabeth anew in agitation she complained of her now unfortunate situation expressed her uneasiness from their importunity renewed the professions of affection to her people and dismissed the committee of parliament in an uncertainty what after all this deliberation might be her final resolution twenty seven But though the queen affected reluctance to execute the sentence against Mary she complied with the request of parliament in publishing it by proclamation and this act seemed to be attended with the unanimous and hearty rejoicings of the people Lord Buckhurst and Beale clerk of the council were sent to the queen of Scots and notified to her the sentence pronounced against her its ratification by parliament and the earnest applications made for its execution by that assembly who thought that their religion could never while she was alive attain a full settlement and security Mary was nowise dismayed at this intelligence on the contrary she joyfully laid hold of the last circumstance mentioned to her and insisted that since her death was demanded by the Protestants for the establishment of their faith she was really a martyr to her religion and was entitled to all the merits attending that glorious character She added that the English had often imbrued their hands in the blood of their sovereigns no wonder they exercised cruelty against her who derived her descent from these monarchs Paulet her keeper received orders to take down her canopy and to serve her no longer with the respect due to sovereign princes He told her that she was now to be considered as a dead person and incapable of any dignity This harsh treatment produced not in her any seeming emotion She only replied that she received her royal character from the hands of the Almighty and no earthly power was ever able to bereave her of it See note AA at the end of the volume Camden p five hundred twenty eight Jebb vol ii p two hundred ninety three The queen of Scots wrote her last letter to Elizabeth full of dignity without departing from that spirit of meekness and of charity which appeared suitable to this concluding scene of her unfortunate life She preferred no petition for averting the fatal sentence on the contrary she expressed her gratitude to Heaven for thus bringing to a speedy period her sad and lamentable pilgrimage She requested some favors of Elizabeth and entreated her that she might be beholden for them to her own goodness alone without making applications to those ministers who had discovered such an extreme malignity against her person and her religion She desired that after her enemies should be satiated with her innocent blood her body which it was determined should never enjoy rest while her soul was united to it might be consigned to her servants and be conveyed by them into France there to repose in a Catholic land with the sacred relics of her mother In Scotland she said the sepulchres of her ancestors were violated and the churches either demolished or profaned and in England where she might be interred among the ancient kings her own and Elizabeth s progenitors she could entertain no hopes of being accompanied to the grave with those rites and ceremonies which her religion required She requested that no one might have the power of inflicting a private death upon her without Elizabeth s knowledge but that her execution should be public and attended by her ancient servants who might bear testimony of her perseverance in the faith and of her submission to the will of Heaven She begged that these servants might afterwards be allowed to depart whithersoever they pleased and might enjoy those legacies which she should bequeath them And she conjured her to grant these favors by their near kindred by the soul and memory of Henry VII the common ancestor of both and by the royal dignity of which they equally participated Elizabeth made no answer to this letter being unwilling to give Mary a refusal in her present situation and foreseeing inconveniencies from granting some of her requests Camden p five hundred twenty nine Jebb vol ii p two hundred ninety five While the queen of Scots thus prepared herself to meet her fate great efforts were made by foreign powers with Elizabeth to prevent the execution of the sentence pronounced against her Besides employing L Aubespine the French resident at London a creature of the house of Guise Henry sent over Bellievre with a professed intention of interceding for the life of Mary The duke of Guise and the league at that time threatened very nearly the king s authority and Elizabeth knew that though that monarch might from decency and policy think himself obliged to interpose publicly in behalf of the queen of Scots he could not secretly be much displeased with the death of a princess on whose fortune and elevation his mortal enemies had always founded so many daring and ambitious projects It is even pretended that Bellievre had orders after making public and vehement remonstrances against the execution of Mary to exhort privately the queen in his master s name not to defer an act of justice so necessary for their common safety But whether the French king s intercession were sincere or not it had no weight with the queen and she still persisted in her former resolution Camden p four hundred ninety four Du Maurier The interposition of the young king of Scots though not able to change Elizabeth s determination seemed on every account to merit more regard As soon as James heard of the trial and condemnation of his mother he sent Sir William Keith a gentleman of his bed chamber to London and wrote a letter to the queen in which he remonstrated in very severe terms against the indignity of the procedure He said that he was astonished to hear of the presumption of English noblemen and counsellors who had dared to sit in judgment and pass sentence upon a queen of Scotland descended from the blood royal of England but he was still more astonished to hear that thoughts were seriously entertained of putting that sentence in execution that he entreated Elizabeth to reflect on the dishonor which she would draw on her name by imbruing her hands in the blood of her near kinswoman a person of the same royal dignity and of the same sex with herself that in this unparalleled attempt she offered an affront to all diadems and even to her own and by reducing sovereigns to a level with other men taught the people to neglect all duty towards those whom Providence had appointed to rule over them that for his part he must deem the injury and insult so enormous as to be incapable of all atonement nor was it possible for him thenceforward to remain in any terms of correspondence with a person who without any pretence of legal authority had deliberately inflicted an ignominious death upon his parent and that even if the sentiments of nature and duty did not inspire him with this purpose of vengeance his honor required it of him nor could he ever acquit himself in the eyes of the world if he did not use every effort and endure every hazard to revenge so great an indignity Soon after James sent the master of Gray and Sir Robert Melvil to enforce the remonstrances of Keith and to employ with the queen every expedient of argument and menaces Elizabeth was at first offended with the sharpness of these applications and she replied in a like strain to the Scottish ambassadors When she afterwards reflected that this earnestness was no more than what duty required of James she was pacified but still retained her resolution of executing the sentence against Mary It is believed that the master of Gray gained by the enemies of that princess secretly gave his advice not to spare her and undertook in all events to pacify his master Spotswood p three hundred fifty one Spotswood p three hundred fifty three The queen also from many considerations was induced to pay small attention to the applications of James and to disregard all the efforts which he could employ in behalf of his mother She was well acquainted with his character and interests the factions which prevailed among his people and the inveterate hatred which the zealous Protestants particularly the preachers bore to the queen of Scots The present incidents set these dispositions of the clergy in a full light James observing the fixed purpose of Elizabeth ordered prayers to be offered up for Mary in all the churches and knowing the captious humor of the ecclesiastics he took care that the form of the petition should be most cautious as well as humane and charitable That it might please God to illuminate Mary with the light of his truth and save her from the apparent danger with which she was threatened But excepting the king s own chaplains and one clergyman more all the preachers refused to pollute their churches by prayers for a Papist and would not so much as prefer a petition for her conversion James unwilling or unable to punish this disobedience and desirous of giving the preachers an opportunity of amending their fault appointed a new day when prayers should be said for his mother and that he might at least secure himself from any insult in his own presence he desired the archbishop of saint Andrews to officiate before him In order to disappoint this purpose the clergy instigated one Couper a young man who had not yet received holy orders to take possession of the pulpit early in the morning and to exclude the prelate When the king came to church and saw the pulpit occupied by Couper he called to him from his seat and told him that the place was destined for another yet since he was there if he would obey the charge given and remember the queen in his prayers he might proceed to divine service The preacher replied that he would do as the Spirit of God should direct him This answer sufficiently instructed James in his purpose and he commanded him to leave the pulpit As Couper seemed not disposed to obey the captain of the guard went to pull him from his place upon which the young man cried aloud that this day would be a witness against the king in the great day of the Lord and he denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of Edinburgh for permitting him to be treated in that manner The audience at first appeared desirous to take part with him but the sermon of the prelate brought them over to a more dutiful and more humane disposition Spotswood p three hundred fifty four Elizabeth when solicited either by James or by foreign princes to pardon the queen of Scots seemed always determined to execute the sentence against her but when her ministers urged her to interpose no more delays her scruples and her hesitation returned her humanity could not allow her to embrace such violent and sanguinary measures and she was touched with compassion for the misfortunes and with respect for the dignity of the unhappy prisoner The courtiers sensible that they could do nothing more acceptable to her than to employ persuasion on this head failed not to enforce every motive for the punishment of Mary and to combat all the objections urged against this act of justice They said that the treatment of that princess in England had been on her first reception such as sound reason and policy required and if she had been governed by principles of equity she would not have refused willingly to acquiesce in it that the obvious inconveniencies either of allowing her to retire into France or of restoring her by force to her throne in opposition to the reformers and the English party in Scotland had obliged the queen to detain her in England till time should offer some opportunity of serving her without danger to the kingdom or to the Protestant religion that her usage there had been such as became her rank her own servants in considerable numbers had been permitted to attend her exercise had been allowed her for health and all access of company for amusement and these indulgences would in time have been carried further if by her subsequent conduct she had appeared worthy of them that after she had instigated the rebellion of Northumberland the conspiracy of Norfolk the bull of excommunication of Pope Pius an invasion from Flanders after she had seduced the queen s friends and incited every enemy foreign and domestic against her it became necessary to treat her as a most dangerous rival and to render her confinement more strict and rigorous that the queen notwithstanding these repeated provocations had in her favor rejected the importunity of her parliaments and the advice of her sagest ministers and was still in hopes of her amendment determined to delay coming to the last extremities against her that Mary even in this forlorn condition retained so high and unconquerable a spirit that she acted as competitor to the crown and allowed her partisans every where and in their very letters addressed to herself to treat her as queen of England that she had carried her animosity so far as to encourage in repeated instances the atrocious design of assassinating the queen and this crime was unquestionably proved upon her by her own letters by the evidence of her secretaries and by the dying confession of her accomplices that she was but a titular queen and at present possessed nowhere any right of sovereignty much less in England where the moment she set foot in the kingdom she voluntarily became subject to the laws and to Elizabeth the only true sovereign that even allowing her to be still the queen s equal in rank and dignity self defence was permitted by a law of nature which could never be abrogated and every one still more a queen had sufficient jurisdiction over an enemy who by open violence and still more who by secret treachery threatened the utmost danger against her life that the general combination of the Catholics to exterminate the Protestants was no longer a secret and as the sole resource of the latter persecuted sect lay in Elizabeth so the chief hope which the former entertained of final success consisted in the person and in the title of the queen of Scots that this very circumstance brought matters to extremity between these princesses and rendering the life of one the death of the other pointed out to Elizabeth the path which either regard to self preservation or to the happiness of her people should direct her to pursue and that necessity more powerful than policy thus demanded of the queen that resolution which equity would authorize and which duty prescribed Digges p two hundred seventy six Strype vol ii p forty eight one hundred thirty five one hundred thirty six one hundred thirty nine Camden p five hundred thirty three When Elizabeth thought that as many importunities had been used and as much delay interposed as decency required she at last determined to carry the sentence into execution but even in this final resolution she could not proceed without displaying a new scene of duplicity and artifice In order to alarm the vulgar rumors were previously dispersed that the Spanish fleet was arrived in Milford Haven that the Scots had made an irruption into England that the duke of Guise was landed in Sussex with a strong army that the queen of Scots was escaped from prison and had raised an army that the northern counties had begun an insurrection that there was a new conspiracy on foot to assassinate the queen and set the city of London on fire nay that the queen was actually assassinated An attempt of this nature was even imputed to L Aubespine the French ambassador and that minister was obliged to leave the kingdom The queen affecting to be in terror and perplexity was observed to sit much alone pensive and silent and sometimes to mutter to herself half sentences importing the difficulty and distress to which she was reduced Camden p five hundred thirty three Camden p five hundred thirty four She at last called Davison a man of parts but easy to be imposed on and who had lately for that very reason been made secretary and she ordered him privately to draw a warrant for the execution of the queen of Scots which she afterwards said she intended to keep by her in case any attempt should be made for the deliverance of that princess She signed the warrant and then commanded Davison to carry it to the chancellor in order to have the great seal appended to it Next day she sent Killigrew to Davison enjoining him to forbear some time executing her former orders and when Davison came and told her that the warrant had already passed the great seal she seemed to be somewhat moved and blamed him for his precipitation Davison being in perplexity acquainted the council with this whole transaction and they endeavored to persuade him to send off Beale with the warrant if the queen should be displeased they promised to justify his conduct and to take on themselves the whole blame of this measure The secretary not sufficiently aware of their intention complied with the advice and the warrant was despatched to the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent and some others ordering them to see the sentence executed upon the queen of Scots The two earls came to Fotheringay Castle and being introduced to Mary informed her of their commission and desired her to prepare for death next morning at eight o clock She seemed nowise terrified though somewhat surprised with the intelligence She said with a cheerful and even a smiling countenance that she did not think the queen her sister would have consented to her death or have executed the sentence against a person not subject to the laws and jurisdiction of England But as such is her will said she death which puts an end to all my miseries shall be to me most welcome nor can I esteem that soul worthy the felicities of heaven which cannot support the body under the horrors of the last passage to these blissful mansions She then requested the two noblemen that they would permit some of her servants and particularly her confessor to attend her but they told her that compliance with this last demand was contrary to their conscience and that doctor Fletcher dean of Peterborough a man of great learning should be present to instruct her in the principles of true religion Her refusal to have any conference with this divine inflamed the zeal of the earl of Kent and he bluntly told her that her death would be the life of their religion as on the contrary her life would have been the death of it Mention being made of Babington she constantly denied his conspiracy to have been at all known to her and the revenge of her wrongs she resigned into the hands of the Almighty It appears by some letters published by Strype vol iii book ii c that Elizabeth had not expressly communicated her intention to any of her ministers not even to Burleigh they were such experienced courtiers that they knew they could not gratify her more than by serving her without waiting till she desired them Camden p five hundred thirty four Jebb vol ii p three hundred one MS in the Advocates Library p two from the Cott Lib Cal c nine Jebb vol ii p three hundred two When the earls had left her she ordered supper to be hastened that she might have the more leisure after it to finish the few affairs which remained to her in this world and to prepare for her passage to another It was necessary for her she said to take some sustenance lest a failure of her bodily strength should depress her spirits on the morrow and lest her behavior should thereby betray a weakness unworthy of herself She supped sparingly as her manner usually was and her wonted cheerfulness did not even desert her on this occasion She comforted her servants under the affliction which overwhelmed them and which was too violent for them to conceal it from her Turning to Burgoin her physician she asked him whether he did not remark the great and invincible force of truth They pretend said she that I must die because I conspired against their queen s life but the earl of Kent avowed that there was no other cause of my death than the apprehensions which if I should live they entertain for their religion My constancy in the faith is my real crime the rest is only a color invented by interested and designing men Towards the end of supper she called in all her servants and drank to them they pledged her in order on their knees and craved her pardon for any past neglect of their duty she deigned in return to ask their pardon for her offences towards them and a plentiful effusion of tears attended this last solemn farewell and exchange of mutual forgiveness Jebb vol ii p four hundred eighty nine Jebb vol ii p three hundred two six hundred twenty six Camden p five hundred thirty four Mary s care of her servants was the sole remaining affair which employed her concern She perused her will in which she had provided for them by legacies she ordered the inventory of her goods clothes and jewels to be brought her and she wrote down the names of those to whom she bequeathed each particular to some she distributed money with her own hands and she adapted the recompense to their different degrees of rank and merit She wrote also letters of recommendation for her servants to the French king and to her cousin the duke of Guise whom she made the chief executor of her testament At her wonted time she went to bed slept some hours and then rising spent the rest of the night in prayer Having foreseen the difficulty of exercising the rites of her religion she had had the precaution to obtain a consecrated host from the hands of Pope Pius and she had reserved the use of it for this last period of her life By this expedient she supplied as much as she could the want of a priest and confessor who was refused her Jebb vol ii p four hundred eighty nine Towards the morning she dressed herself in a rich habit of silk and velvet the only one which she had reserved to herself She told her maids that she would willingly have left them this dress rather than the plain garb which she wore the day before but it was necessary for her to appear at the ensuing solemnity in a decent habit Thomas Andrews sheriff of the county entered the room and informed her that the hour was come and that he must attend her to the place of execution She replied that she was ready and bidding adieu to her servants she leaned on two of Sir Amias Paulet s guards because of an infirmity in her limbs and she followed the sheriff with a serene and composed countenance In passing through a hall adjoining to her chamber she was met by the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent Sir Amias Paulet Sir Drue Drury and many other gentlemen of distinction Here she also found Sir Andrew Melvil her steward who flung himself on his knees before her and wringing his hands cried aloud Ah madam unhappy me what man was ever before the messenger of such heavy tidings as I must carry when I shall return to my native country and shall report that I saw my gracious queen and mistress beheaded in England His tears prevented further speech and Mary too felt herself moved more from sympathy than affliction Cease my good servant said she cease to lament thou hast cause rather to rejoice than to mourn for now shalt thou see the troubles of Mary Stuart receive their long expected period and completion Know continued she good servant that all the world at best is vanity and subject still to more sorrow than a whole ocean of tears is able to bewail But I pray thee carry this message from me that I die a true woman to my religion and unalterable in my affections to Scotland and to France Heaven forgive them that have long desired my end and have thirsted for my blood as the hart panteth after the water brooks O God added she thou art the author of truth and truth itself thou knowest the inmost recesses of my heart thou knowest that I was ever desirous to preserve an entire union between Scotland and England and to obviate the source of all these fatal discords But recommend me Melvil to my son and tell him that notwithstanding all my distresses I have done nothing prejudicial to the state and kingdom of Scotland After these words reclining herself with weeping eyes and face bedewed with tears she kissed him And so said she good Melvil farewell once again farewell good Melvil and grant the assistance of thy prayers to thy queen and mistress MS p four Jebb vol ii p six hundred thirty four Strype vol iii p three hundred eighty four She next turned to the noblemen who attended her and made a petition in behalf of her servants that they might be well treated be allowed to enjoy the presents which she had made them and be sent safely into their own country Having received a favorable answer she preferred another request that they might be permitted to attend her at her death in order said she that their eyes may behold and their hearts bear witness how patiently their queen and mistress can submit to her execution and how constantly she perseveres in her attachment to her religion The earl of Kent opposed this desire and told her that they would be apt by their speeches and cries to disturb both herself and the spectators he was also apprehensive lest they should practise some superstition not meet for him to suffer such as dipping their handkerchiefs in her blood for that was the instance which he made use of My lord said the queen of Scots I will give my word although it be but dead that they shall not incur any blame in any of the actions which you have named But alas poor souls it would be a great consolation to them to bid their mistress farewell And I hope added she that your mistress being a maiden queen would vouchsafe in regard of womanhood that I should have some of my own people about me at my death I know that her majesty hath not given you any such strict command but that you might grant me a request of far greater courtesy even though I were a woman of inferior rank to that which I bear Finding that the earl of Kent persisted still in his refusal her mind which had fortified itself against the terrors of death was affected by this indignity for which she was not prepared I am cousin to your queen cried she and descended from the blood royal of Henry VII and a married queen of France and an anointed queen of Scotland The commissioners perceiving how invidious their obstinacy would appear conferred a little together and agreed that she might carry a few of her servants along with her She made choice of four men and two maid servants for that purpose She then passed into another hall where was erected the scaffold covered with black and she saw with an undismayed countenance the executioners and all the preparations of death The room was crowded with spectators and no one was so steeled against all sentiments of humanity as not to be moved when he reflected on her royal dignity considered the surprising train of her misfortunes beheld her mild but inflexible constancy recalled her amiable accomplishments or surveyed her beauties which though faded by years and yet more by her afflictions still discovered themselves in this fatal moment Here the warrant for her execution was read to her and during this ceremony she was silent but showed in her behavior an indifference and unconcern as if the business had nowise regarded her Before the executioners performed their office the dean of Peterborough stepped forth and though the queen frequently told him that he needed not concern himself about her that she was settled in the ancient Catholic and Roman religion and that she meant to lay down her life in defence of that faith he still thought it his duty to persist in his lectures and exhortations and to endeavor her conversion The terms which he employed were under color of pious instructions cruel insults on her unfortunate situation and besides their own absurdity may be regarded as the most mortifying indignities to which she had ever yet been exposed He told her that the queen of England had on this occasion shown a tender care of her and notwithstanding the punishment justly to be inflicted on her for her manifold trespasses was determined to use every expedient for saving her soul from that destruction with which it was so nearly threatened that she was now standing upon the brink of eternity and had no other means of escaping endless perdition than by repenting her former wickedness by justifying the sentence pronounced against her by acknowledging the queen s favors and by exerting a true and lively faith in Christ Jesus that the Scriptures were the only rule of doctrine the merits of Christ the only means of salvation and if she trusted in the inventions or devices of men she must expect in an instant to fall into utter darkness into a place where shall be weeping howling and gnashing of teeth that the and of death was upon her the axe was laid to the root of the tree the throne of the great Judge of heaven was erected the book of her life was spread wide and the particular sentence and judgment was ready to be pronounced upon her and that it was now during this important moment in her choice either to rise to the resurrection of life and hear that joyful salutation Come ye blessed of my Father or to share the resurrection of condemnation replete with sorrow and anguish and to suffer that dreadful denunciation Go ye cursed into everlasting fire During this discourse Mary could not sometimes forbear betraying her impatience by interrupting the preacher and the dean finding that he had profited nothing by his lecture at last bade her change her opinion repent her of her former wickedness and settle her faith upon this ground that only in Christ Jesus could she hope to be saved She answered again and again with great earnestness Trouble not yourself any more about the matter for I was born in this religion I have lived in this religion and in this religion I am resolved to die Even the two earls perceived that it was fruitless to harass her any further with theological disputes and they ordered the dean to desist from his unseasonable exhortations and to pray for her conversion During the dean s prayer she employed herself in private devotion from the office of the Virgin and after he had finished she pronounced aloud some petitions in English for the afflicted church for an end of her own troubles for her son and for Queen Elizabeth and prayed God that that princess might long prosper and be employed in his service The earl of Kent observing that in her devotions she made frequent use of the crucifix could not forbear reproving her for her attachment to that Popish trumpery as he termed it and he exhorted her to have Christ in her heart not in her hand She replied with presence of mind that it was difficult to hold such an object in her hand without feeling her heart touched with some compunction MS p eight nine ten eleven Strype vol iii p three hundred eighty five MS p fifteen Jebb vol ii p three hundred seven one hundred ninety one six hundred thirty seven Jebb vol ii p three hundred seven four hundred ninety one six hundred thirty seven She now began with the aid of her two women to disrobe herself and the executioner also lent his hand to assist them She smiled and said that she was not accustomed to undress herself before so large a company nor to be served by such valets Her servants seeing her in this condition ready to lay her head upon the block burst into tears and lamentations she turned about to them put her finger upon her lips as a sign of imposing silence upon them and having given them her blessing desired them to pray for her Jebb p three hundred seven four hundred ninety two One of her maids whom she had appointed for that purpose covered her eyes with a handkerchief she laid herself down without any sign of fear or trepidation and her head was severed from her body at two strokes by the executioner He instantly held it up to the spectators streaming with blood and agitated with the convulsions of death the dean of Peterborough alone exclaimed So perish all Queen Elizabeth s enemies the earl of Kent alone replied Amen the attention of all the other spectators was fixed on the melancholy scene before them and zeal and flattery alike gave place to present pity and admiration of the expiring princess Thus perished in the forty fifth year of her age and nineteenth of her captivity in England Mary queen of Scots a woman of great accomplishments both of body and mind natural as well as acquired but unfortunate in her life and during one period very unhappy in her conduct The beauties of her person and graces of her air combined to make her the most amiable of women and the charms of her address and conversation aided the impression which her lovely figure made on the hearts of all beholders Ambitious and active in her temper yet inclined to cheerfulness and society of a lofty spirit constant and even vehement in her purpose yet polite and gentle and affable in her demeanor she seemed to partake only so much of the male virtues as to render her estimable without relinquishing those soft graces which compose the proper ornament of her sex In order to form a just idea of her character we must set aside one part of her conduct while she abandoned herself to the guidance of a profligate man and must consider these faults whether we admit them to be imprudences or crimes as the result of an inexplicable though not uncommon inconstancy in the human mind of the frailty of our nature of the violence of passion and of the influence which situations and sometimes momentary incidents have on persons whose principles are not thoroughly confirmed by experience and reflection Enraged by the ungrateful conduct of her husband seduced by the treacherous counsels of one in whom she reposed confidence transported by the violence of her own temper which never lay sufficiently under the guidance of discretion she was betrayed into actions which may with some difficulty be accounted for but which admit of no apology nor even of alleviation An enumeration of her qualities might carry the appearance of a panegyric an account of her conduct must in some parts wear the aspect of severe satire and invective Jebb p three hundred seven four hundred ninety two Her numerous misfortunes the solitude of her long and tedious captivity and the persecutions to which she had been exposed on account of her religion had wrought her up to a degree of bigotry during her later years and such were the prevalent spirit and principles of the age that it is the less wonder if her zeal her resentment and her interest uniting induced her to give consent to a design which conspirators actuated only by the first of these motives had formed against the life of Elizabeth When the queen was informed of Mary s execution she affected the utmost surprise and indignation Her countenance changed her speech faltered and failed her for a long time her sorrow was so deep that she could not express it but stood fixed like a statue in silence and mute astonishment After her grief was able to find vent it burst out in loud wailings and lamentations she put herself in deep mourning for this deplorable event and she was seen perpetually bathed in tears and surrounded only by her maids and women None of her ministers or counsellors dared to approach her or if any had such temerity she chased them from her with the most violent expressions of rage and resentment they had all of them been guilty of an unpardonable crime in putting to death her dear sister and kinswoman contrary to her fixed purpose of which they were sufficiently apprised and acquainted Camden p five hundred eighty six Strype vol iii Append p one hundred forty six Jebb vol ii p six hundred eight No sooner was her sorrow so much abated as to leave room for reflection than she wrote a letter of apology to the king of Scots and sent it by Sir Robert Cary son of Lord Hunsdon She there told him that she wished he knew but not felt the unutterable grief which she experienced on account of that lamentable accident which without her knowledge much less concurrence had happened in England that as her pen trembled when she attempted to write it she found herself obliged to commit the relation of it to the messenger her kinsman who would likewise inform his majesty of every circumstance attending this dismal and unlooked for misfortune that she appealed to the supreme Judge of heaven and earth for her innocence and was also so happy amidst her other afflictions as to find that many persons in her court could bear witness to her veracity in this protestation that she abhorred dissimulation deemed nothing more worthy of a prince than a sincere and open conduct and could never surely be esteemed so base and poor spirited as that if she had really given orders for this fatal execution she could on any consideration be induced to deny them that though sensible of the justice of the sentence pronounced against the unhappy prisoner she determined from clemency never to carry it into execution and could not but resent the temerity of those who on this occasion had disappointed her intention and that as no one loved him more dearly than herself or bore a more anxious concern for his welfare she hoped that he would consider every one as his enemy who endeavored on account of the present incident to excite any animosity between them In order the better to appease James she committed Davison to prison and ordered him to be tried in the star chamber for his misdemeanor The secretary was confounded and being sensible of the danger which must attend his entering into a contest with the queen he expressed penitence for his error and submitted very patiently to be railed at by those very counsellors whose persuasion had induced him to incur the guilt and who had promised to countenance and protect him He was condemned to imprisonment during the queen s pleasure and to pay a fine of ten thousand pounds He remained a long time in custody and the fine though it reduced him to beggary was rigorously levied upon him All the favor which he could obtain from the queen was sending him small supplies from time to time to keep him from perishing in necessity Camden p five hundred thirty six Spotswood p three hundred fifty eight Camden p five hundred thirty eight He privately wrote an apology to his friend Walsingham which contains many curious particulars The French and Scotch ambassadors he said had been remonstrating with the queen in Mary s behalf and immediately after their departure she commanded him of her own accord to deliver her the warrant for the execution of that princess She signed it readily and ordered it to be sealed with the great seal of England She appeared in such good humour on the occasion that she said to him in a jocular manner Go tell all this to Walsingham who is now sick though I fear he will die of sorrow when he hears of it She added that though she had so long delayed the execution lest she should seem to be actuated by malice or cruelty she was all along sensible of the necessity of it In the same conversation she blamed Drury and Paulet that they had not before eased her of this trouble and she expressed her desire that Walsingham would bring them to compliance in that particular She was so bent on this purpose that some time after she asked Davison whether any letter had come from Paulet with regard to the service expected of him Davison showed her Paulet s letter in which that gentleman positively refused to act any thing inconsistent with the principles of honor and justice The queen fell into a passion and accused Paulet as well as Drury of perjury because having taken the oath of association in which they had bound themselves to avenge her wrongs they had yet refused to lend their hand on this occasion But others she said will be found less scrupulous Davison adds that nothing but the consent and exhortations of the whole council could have engaged him to send off the warrant he was well aware of his danger and remembered that the queen after having ordered the execution of the duke of Norfolk had endeavored in a like manner to throw the whole blame and odium of that action upon Lord Burleigh Camden p five hundred thirty eight Strype vol iii p three hundred seventy five three hundred seventy six MS in the Advocates Library A three twenty eight p seventeen from the Cott Lib Calig c nine Biog Brit p sixteen twenty five sixteen twenty seven Elizabeth s dissimulation was so gross that it could deceive nobody who was not previously resolved to be blinded but as James s concern for his mother was certainly more sincere and cordial he discovered the highest resentment and refused to admit Cary into his presence He recalled his ambassadors from England and seemed to breathe nothing but war and vengeance The states of Scotland being assembled took part in his anger and professed that they were ready to spend their lives and fortunes in revenge of his mother s death and in defence of his title to the crown of England Many of his nobility instigated him to take arms Lord Sinclair when the courtiers appeared in deep mourning presented himself to the king arrayed in complete armor and said that this was the proper mourning for the queen The Catholics took the opportunity of exhorting James to make an alliance with the king of Spain to lay immediate claim to the crown of England and to prevent the ruin which from his mother s example he might conclude would certainly if Elizabeth s power prevailed overwhelm his person and his kingdom The queen was sensible of the danger attending these counsels and after allowing James some decent interval to vent his grief and anger she employed her emissaries to pacify him and to set before him every motive of hope or fear which might induce him to live in amity with her Walsingham wrote to Lord Thirlstone James s secretary a judicious letter to the same purpose He said that he was much surprised to hear of the violent resolutions taken in Scotland and of the passion discovered by a prince of so much judgment and temper as James that a war founded merely on the principle of revenge and that too on account of an act of justice which necessity had extorted would for ever be exposed to censure and could not be excused by any principles of equity or reason that if these views were deemed less momentous among princes policy and interest ought certainly to be attended to and these motives did still more evidently oppose all thoughts of a rupture with Elizabeth and all revival of exploded claims to the English throne that the inequality between the two kingdoms deprived James of any hopes of success if he trusted merely to the force of his own state and had no recourse to foreign powers for assistance that the objections attending the introduction of succors from a more potent monarch appeared so evident from all the transactions of history that they could not escape a person of the king s extensive knowledge but there were in the present case several peculiar circumstances which ought forever to deter him from having recourse to so dangerous an expedient that the French monarch the ancient ally of Scotland might willingly use the assistance of that kingdom against England but would be displeased to see the union of these two kingdoms in the person of James a union which would ever after exclude him from practising that policy formerly so useful to the French and so pernicious to the Scottish nation that Henry besides infested with faction and domestic war was not in a condition of supporting distant allies much less would he expose himself to any hazard or expense in order to aggrandize a near kinsman of the house of Guise the most determined enemies of his repose and authority that the extensive power and exorbitant ambition of the Spanish monarch rendered him a still more dangerous ally to Scotland and as he evidently aspired to a universal monarchy in the west and had in particular advanced some claims to England as if he were descended from the house of Lancaster he was at the same time the common enemy of all princes who wished to maintain their independence and the immediate rival and competitor of the king of Scots that the queen by her own naval power and her alliance with the Hollanders would probably intercept all succors which might be sent to James from abroad and be enabled to decide the controversy in this island with the superior forces of her own kingdom opposed to those of Scotland that if the king revived his mother s pretensions to the crown of England he must also embrace her religion by which alone they could be justified and must thereby undergo the infamy of abandoning those principles in which he had been strictly educated and to which he had hitherto religiously adhered that as he would by such an apostasy totally alienate all the Protestants in Scotland and England he could never gain the confidence of the Catholics who would still entertain reasonable doubts of his sincerity that by advancing a present claim to the crown he forfeited the certain prospect of his succession and revived that national animosity which the late peace and alliance between the kingdoms had happily extinguished that the whole gentry and nobility of England had openly declared themselves for the execution of the queen of Scots and if James showed such violent resentment against that act of justice they would be obliged for their own security to prevent forever so implacable a prince from ruling over them and that however some persons might represent his honor as engaged to seek vengeance for the present affront and injury the true honor of a prince consisted in wisdom and moderation and justice not in following the dictates of blind passion or in pursuing revenge at the expense of every motive and every interest Strype vol iii p three hundred seventy seven Spotswood These considerations joined to the peaceable unambitious temper of the young prince prevailed over his resentment and he fell gradually into a good correspondence with the court of England It is probable that the queen s chief object in her dissimulation with regard to the execution of Mary was that she might thereby afford James a decent pretence for renewing his amity with her on which their mutual interests so much depended While Elizabeth insured tranquillity from the attempts of her nearest neighbor she was not negligent of more distant dangers Hearing that Philip though he seemed to dissemble the daily insults and injuries which he received from the English was secretly preparing a great navy to attack her she sent Sir Francis Drake with a fleet to intercept his supplies to pillage his coast and to destroy his shipping Drake carried out four capital ships of the queen s and twenty six great and small with which the London merchants in hopes of sharing in the plunder had supplied him Having learned from two Dutch ships which he met with in his passage that a Spanish fleet richly laden was lying at Cadiz ready to sail for Lisbon the rendezvous of the intended armada he bent his course to the former harbor and boldly as well as fortunately made an attack on the enemy He obliged six galleys which made head against him to take shelter under the forts he burned about a hundred vessels laden with ammunition and naval stores and he destroyed a great ship of the marquis of Santa Croce Thence he set sail for Cape saint Vincent and took by assault the castle situated on that promontory with three other fortresses He next insulted Lisbon and finding that the merchants who had engaged entirely in expectation of profit were discontented at these military enterprises he set sail for the Terceras with an intention of lying in wait for a rich carrack which was expected in those parts He was so fortunate as to meet with his prize and by this short expedition in which the public bore so small a share the adventurers were encouraged to attempt further enterprises the English seamen learned to despise the great unwieldy ships of the enemy the naval preparations of Spain were destroyed the intended expedition against England was retarded a twelvemonth and the queen thereby had leisure to take more secure measures against that formidable invasion Camden p five hundred forty Sir William Monson s Naval Tracts in Churchill s Voyages vol iii p one hundred fifty six This year Thomas Cavendish a gentleman of Devonshire who had dissipated a good estate by living at court being resolved to repair his fortune at the expense of the Spaniards fitted out three ships at Plymouth one of a hundred and twenty tons another of sixty and a third of forty and with these small vessels he ventured into the South Sea and committed great depredations on the Spaniards He took nineteen vessels some of which were richly laden and returning by the Cape of Good Hope he came to London and entered the river in a kind of triumph His mariners and soldiers were clothed in silk his sails were of damask his topsail cloth of gold and his prizes were esteemed the richest that ever had been brought into England Birch s Memoirs vol i p fifty seven The land enterprises of the English were not during this campaign so advantageous or honorable to the nation The important place of Deventer was intrusted by Leicester to William Stanley with a garrison of twelve hundred English and this gentleman being a Catholic was alarmed at the discovery of Babington s conspiracy and became apprehensive lest every one of his religion should thenceforth be treated with distrust in England He entered into a correspondence with the Spaniards betrayed the city to them for a sum of money and engaged the whole garrison to desert with him to the Spanish service Roland York who commanded a fort near Zutphen imitated his example and the Hollanders formerly disgusted with Leicester and suspicious of the English broke out into loud complaints against the improvidence if not the treachery of his administration Soon after he himself arrived in the Low Countries but his conduct was nowise calculated to give them satisfaction or to remove the suspicions which they had entertained against him The prince of Parma having besieged Sluys Leicester attempted to relieve the place first by sea then by land but failed in both enterprises and as he ascribed his bad success to the ill behavior of the Hollanders they were equally free in reflections upon his conduct The breach between them became wider every day they slighted his authority opposed his measures and neglected his counsels while he endeavored by an imperious behavior and by violence to recover that influence which he had lost by his imprudent and ill concerted measures He was even suspected by the Dutch of a design to usurp upon their liberties and the jealousy entertained against him began to extend towards the queen herself That princess had made some advances towards a peace with Spain a congress had been opened at Bourbourg a village near Graveline and though the two courts especially that of Spain had no other intention than to amuse each of them its enemy by negotiation and mutually relax the preparations for defence or attack the Dutch who were determined on no terms to return under the Spanish yoke became apprehensive lest their liberty should be sacrificed to the political interests of England But the queen who knew the importance of her alliance with the states during the present conjuncture was resolved to give them entire satisfaction by recalling Leicester and commanding him to resign his government Maurice son of the late prince of Orange a youth of twenty years of age was elected by the states governor in his place and Peregrine Lord Willoughby was appointed by the queen commander of the English forces The measures of these two generals were much embarrassed by the malignity of Leicester who had left a faction behind him and who still attempted by means of his emissaries to disturb all the operations of the states As soon as Elizabeth received intelligence of these disorders she took care to redress them and she obliged all the partisans of England to fall into unanimity with Prince Maurice But though her good sense so far prevailed over her partiality to Leicester she never could be made fully sensible of his vices and incapacity the submissions which he made her restored him to her wonted favor and Lord Buckhurst who had accused him of misconduct in Holland lost her confidence for some time and was even committed to custody Bentivoglio part ii lib iv Strype vol iv No two hundred forty six Rymer tom xv p sixty six Sir Christopher Hatton was another favorite who at this time received some marks of her partiality Though he had never followed the profession of the law he was made chancellor in the place of Bromley deceased but notwithstanding all the expectations and perhaps wishes of the lawyers he behaved in a manner not unworthy of that high station his good natural capacity supplied the place of experience and study and his decisions were not found deficient either in point of equity or judgment His enemies had contributed to this promotion in hopes that his absence from court while he attended the business of chancery would gradually estrange the queen from him and give them an opportunity of undermining him in her favor These little intrigues and cabals of the court were silenced by the account which came from all quarters of the vast preparations made by the Spaniards for the invasion of England and for the entire conquest of that kingdom Philip though he had not yet declared war on account of the hostilities which Elizabeth every where committed upon him had long harbored a secret and violent desire of revenge against her His ambition also and the hopes of extending his empire were much encouraged by the present prosperous state of his affairs by the conquest of Portugal the acquisition of the East Indian commerce and settlements and the yearly importation of vast treasures from America The point on which he rested his highest glory the perpetual object of his policy was to support orthodoxy and exterminate heresy and as the power and credit of Elizabeth were the chief bulwark of the Protestants he hoped if he could subdue that princess to acquire the eternal renown of reuniting the whole Christian world in the Catholic communion Above all his indignation against his revolted subjects in the Netherlands instigated him to attack the English who had encouraged that insurrection and who by their vicinity were so well enabled to support the Hollanders that he could never hope to reduce these rebels while the power of that kingdom remained entire and unbroken To subdue England seemed a necessary preparative to the reestablishment of his authority in the Netherlands and notwithstanding appearances the former was in itself as a more important so a more easy undertaking than the latter That kingdom lay nearer Spain than the Low Countries and was more exposed to invasions from that quarter after an enemy had once obtained entrance the difficulty seemed to be over as it was neither fortified by an or nature a long peace had deprived it of all military discipline and experience and the Catholics in which it still abounded would be ready it was hoped to join any invader who should free them from those persecutions under which they labored and should revenge the death of the queen of Scots on whom they had fixed all their affections The fate of England must be decided in one battle at sea and another at land and what comparison between the English and Spaniards either in point of naval force or in the numbers reputation and veteran bravery of their armies Besides the acquisition of so great a kingdom success against England insured the immediate subjection of the Hollanders who attacked on every hand and deprived of all support must yield their stubborn necks to that yoke which they had so long resisted Happily this conquest as it was of the utmost importance to the grandeur of Spain would not at present be opposed by the jealousy of other powers naturally so much interested to prevent the success of the enterprise A truce was lately concluded with the Turks the empire was in the hands of a friend and near ally and France the perpetual rival of Spain was so torn with intestine commotions that she had no leisure to pay attention to her foreign interests This favorable opportunity therefore which might never again present itself must be seized and one bold effort made for acquiring that ascendant in Europe to which the present greatness and prosperity of the Spaniards seemed so fully to entitle them These hopes and motives engaged Philip notwithstanding his cautious temper to undertake this hazardous enterprise and though the prince now created by the pope duke of Parma when consulted opposed the attempt at least represented the necessity of previously getting possession of some seaport town in the Netherlands which might afford a retreat to the Spanish navy it was determined by the Catholic monarch to proceed immediately to the execution of his ambitious project Camden Strype vol iii p five hundred twelve Bentivoglio part ii lib iv During some time he had been secretly making preparations out as soon as the resolution was fully taken every part of his vast empire resounded with the noise of armaments and all his ministers generals and admirals were employed in forwarding the design The marquis of Santa Croce a sea officer of great reputation and experience was destined to command the fleet and by his counsels were the naval equipments conducted In all the ports of Sicily Naples Spain and Portugal artisans were employed in building vessels of uncommon size and force naval stores were bought at a great expense provisions amassed armies levied and quartered in the maritime towns of Spain and plans laid for fitting out such a fleet and embarkation as had never before had its equal in Europe The military preparations in Flanders were no less formidable Troops from all quarters were every moment assembling to reenforce the duke of Parma Capizuchi and Spinelli conducted forces from Italy the marquis of Borgaut a prince of the house of Austria levied troops in Germany the Walloon and Burgundian regiments were completed or augmented the Spanish infantry was supplied with recruits and an army of thirty four thousand men was assembled in the Netherlands and kept in readiness to be transported into England The duke of Parma employed all the carpenters whom he could procure either in Flanders or in Lower Germany and the coasts of the Baltic and he built at Dunkirk and Newport but especially at Antwerp a great number of boats and flat bottomed vessels for the transporting of his infantry and cavalry The most renowned nobility and princes of Italy and Spain were ambitious of sharing in the honor of this great enterprise Don Amadseus of Savoy Don John of Medicis Vespasian Gonzaga duke of Sabionetta and the duke of Pastrana hastened to join the army under the duke of Parma About two thousand volunteers in Spain many of them men of family had enlisted in the service No doubts were entertained but such vast preparations conducted by officers of such consummate skill must finally be successful And the Spaniards ostentatious of their power and elated with vain hopes had already denominated their navy the Invincible Armada News of these extraordinary preparations soon reached the court of London and notwithstanding the secrecy of the Spanish council and their pretending to employ this force in the Indies it was easily concluded that they meant to make some effort against England The queen had foreseen the invasion and finding that she must now contend for her crown with the whole force of Spain she made preparations for resistance nor was she dismayed with that power by which all Europe apprehended she must of necessity be overwhelmed Her force indeed seemed very unequal to resist so potent an enemy All the sailors in England amounted at that time to about fourteen thousand men The size of the English shipping was in general so small that except a few of the queen s ships of war there were not four vessels belonging to the merchants which exceeded four hundred tons The royal navy consisted of only twenty eight sail many of which were of small size none of them exceeded the bulk of our largest frigates and most of them deserved rather the name of pinnaces than of ships Monson p two hundred fifty six Monson p two hundred sixty eight Monson p one hundred fifty seven The only advantage of the English fleet consisted in the dexterity and courage of the seamen who being accustomed to sail in tempestuous seas and expose themselves to all dangers as much exceeded in this particular the Spanish mariners as their vessels were inferior in size and force to those of that nation All the commercial towns of England were required to furnish ships for reenforcing this small navy and they discovered on the present occasion great alacrity in defending their liberty and religion against those imminent perils with which they were menaced The citizens of London in order to show their zeal in the common cause instead of fifteen vessels which they were commanded to equip voluntarily fitted out double the number The gentry and nobility hired and armed and manned forty three ships at their own charge and all the loans of money which the queen demanded were frankly granted by the persons applied to Lord Howard of Effingham a man of courage and capacity was admiral and took on him the command of the navy Drake Hawkins and Frobisher the most renowned seamen in Europe served under him The principal fleet was stationed at Plymouth A smaller squadron consisting of forty vessels English and Flemish was commanded by Lord Seymour second son of Protector Somerset and lay off Dunkirk in order to intercept the duke of Parma Monson p three hundred twenty one Monsm p two hundred sixty seven Lives of the Admirals vol i p four hundred fifty one The land forces of England compared to those of Spain possessed contrary qualities to its naval power they were more numerous than the enemy but much inferior in discipline reputation and experience An army of twenty thousand men was disposed in different bodies along the south coast and orders were given them if they could not prevent the landing of the Spaniards to retire backwards to waste the country around and to wait for reenforcement from the neighboring counties before they approached the enemy A body of twenty two thousand foot and a thousand horse under the command of the earl of Leicester was stationed at Tilbury in order to defend the capital The principal army consisted of thirty four thousand foot and two thousand horse and was commanded by Lord Hunsdon These forces were reserved for guarding the queen s person and were appointed to march whithersoever the enemy should appear The fate of England if all the Spanish armies should be able to land seemed to depend on the issue of a single battle and men of reflection entertained the most dismal apprehensions when they considered the force of fifty thousand veteran Spaniards commanded by experienced officers under the duke of Parma the most consummate general of the age and compared this formidable armament with the military power which England not enervated by peace but long disused to war could muster up against it The chief support of the kingdom seemed to consist in the vigor and prudence of the queen s conduct who undismayed by the present dangers issued all her orders with tranquillity animated her people to a steady resistance and employed every resource which either her domestic situation or her foreign alliances could afford her She sent Sir Robert Sidney into Scotland and exhorted the king to remain attached to her and to consider the danger which at present menaced his sovereignty no less than her own from the ambition of the Spanish tyrant the ambassador found James well disposed to cultivate a union with England and that prince even kept himself prepared to march with the force of his whole kingdom to the assistance of Elizabeth Her authority with the king of Denmark and the tie of their common religion engaged this monarch upon her application to seize a squadron of ships which Philip had bought or hired in the Danish harbors the Hanse Towns though not at that time on good terms with Elizabeth were induced by the same motives to retard so long the equipment of some vessels in their ports that they became useless to the purpose of invading England All the Protestants throughout Europe regarded this enterprise as the critical event which was to decide forever the fate of their religion and though unable by reason of their distance to join their force to that of Elizabeth they kept their eyes fixed on her conduct and fortune and beheld with anxiety mixed with admiration the intrepid countenance with which she encountered that dreadful tempest which was every moment advancing towards her She made him some promises which she never fulfilled to give him a dukedom in England with suitable lands and revenue to settle five thousand pounds a year on him and pay him a guard for the safety of his person From a MS of Lord Hoyston s Strype vol iii p five hundred twenty four The queen also was sensible that next to the general popularity which she enjoyed and the confidence which her subjects reposed in her prudent government the firmest support of her throne consisted in the general zeal of the people for the Protestant religion and the strong prejudices which they had imbibed against Popery She took care on the present occasion to revive in the nation this attachment to their own sect and this abhorrence of the opposite The English were reminded of their former danger from the tyranny of Spain all the barbarities exercised by Mary against the Protestants were ascribed to the counsels of that bigoted and imperious nation the bloody massacres in the Indies the unrelenting executions in the Low Countries the horrid cruelties and iniquities of the inquisition were set before men s eyes a list and description was published and pictures dispersed of the several instruments of torture with which it was pretended the Spanish armada was loaded and every artifice as well as reason was employed to animate the people to a vigorous defence of their religion their laws and their liberties But while the queen in this critical emergence roused the animosity of the nation against Popery she treated the partisans of that sect with moderation and gave not way to an undistinguishing fury against them Though she knew that Sixtus Quintus the present pope famous for his capacity and his tyranny had fulminated a new bull of excommunication against her had deposed her had absolved her subjects from their oaths of allegiance had published a crusade against England and had granted plenary indulgences to every one engaged in the present invasion she would not believe that all her Catholic subjects could be so blinded as to sacrifice to bigotry their duty to their sovereign and the liberty and independence of their native country She rejected all violent counsels by which she was urged to seek pretences for despatching the leaders of that party she would not even confine any considerable number of them and the Catholics sensible of this good usage generally expressed great zeal for the public service Some gentlemen of that sect conscious that they could not justly expect any trust or authority entered themselves as volunteers in the fleet or army some equipped ships at their own charge and gave the command of them to Protestants others were active in animating their tenants and vassals and neighbors to the defence of their country and every rank of men burying for the present all party distinctions seemed to prepare themselves with order as well as vigor to resist the violence of these invaders Stowe p seven hundred forty seven The more to excite the martial spirit of the nation the queen appeared on horseback in the camp at Tilbury and riding through the lines discovered a cheerful and animated countenance exhorted the soldiers to remember their duty to their country and their religion and professed her intention though a woman to lead them herself into the field against the enemy and rather to perish in battle than survive the ruin and slavery of her people twenty eight See note BB at the end of the volume By this spirited behavior she revived the tenderness and admiration of the soldiery an attachment to her person became a kind of enthusiasm among them and they asked one another whether it were possible that Englishmen could abandon this glorious cause could display less fortitude than appeared in the female sex or could ever by any dangers be induced to relinquish the defence of their heroic princess The Spanish armada was ready in the beginning of May but the moment it was preparing to sail the marquis of Santa Croce the admiral was seized with a fever of which he soon after died The vice admiral the duke of Paliano by a strange concurrence of accidents at the very same time suffered the same fate and the king appointed for admiral the duke of Medina Sidonia a nobleman of great family but unexperienced in action and entirely unacquainted with sea affairs Alcarede was appointed vice admiral This misfortune besides the loss of so great an officer as Santa Croce retarded the sailing of the armada and gave the English more time for their preparations to oppose them At last the Spanish fleet full of hopes and alacrity set sail from Lisbon but next day met with a violent tempest which scattered the ships sunk some of the smallest and forced the rest to take shelter in the Groine where they waited till they could be refitted When news of this event was carried to England the queen concluded that the design of an invasion was disappointed for this summer and being always ready to lay hold on every pretence for saving money she made Walsingham write to the admiral directing him to lay up some of the larger ships and to discharge the seamen but Lord Effingham who was not so sanguine in his hopes used the freedom to disobey these orders and he begged leave to retain all the ships in service though it should be at his own expense He took advantage of a north wind and sailed towards the coast of Spain with an intention of attacking the enemy in their harbors but the wind changing to the south he became apprehensive lest they might have set sail and by passing him at sea invade England now exposed by the absence of the fleet He returned therefore with the utmost expedition to Plymouth and lay at anchor in that harbor Meanwhile all the damages of the armada were repaired and the Spaniards with fresh hopes set out again to sea in prosecution of their enterprise The fleet consisted of a hundred and thirty vessels of which near a hundred were galleons and were of greater size than any ever before used in Europe It carried on board nineteen thousand two hundred and ninety five soldiers eight thousand four hundred and fifty six mariners two thousand and eighty eight galley slaves and two thousand six hundred and thirty great pieces of brass ordnance It was victualled for six months and was attended by twenty lesser ships called caravals and ten salves with six oars apiece The plan formed by the king of Spain was that the armada should sail to the coast opposite to Dunkirk and Newport and having chased away all English or Flemish vessels which might obstruct the passage for it was never supposed they could make opposition should join themselves with the duke of Parma should thence make sail to the Thames and having landed the whole Spanish army thus complete at one blow the entire conquest of England In prosecution of this scheme Philip gave orders to the duke of Medina that in passing along the Channel he should sail as near the coast of France as he could with safety that he should by this policy avoid meeting with the English fleet and keeping in view the main enterprise should neglect all smaller successes which might prove an obstacle or even interpose a delay to the acquisition of a kingdom Camden p five hundred forty five Strype vol iii Append p two hundred twenty one Monson p one After the armada was under sail they took a fisherman who informed them that the English admiral had been lately at sea had heard of the tempest which scattered the armada had retired back into Plymouth and no longer expecting an invasion this season had laid up his ships and discharged most of the seamen From this false intelligence the duke of Medina conceived the great facility of attacking and destroying the English ships in harbor and he was tempted by the prospect of so decisive an advantage to break his orders and make sail directly for Plymouth a resolution which proved the safety of England The Lizard was the first land made by the armada about sunset and as the Spaniards took it for the Ram Head near Plymouth they bore out to sea with an intention of returning next day and attacking the English navy They were descried by Fleming a Scottish pirate who was roving in those seas and who immediately set sail to inform the English admiral of their approach another fortunate event which contributed extremely to the safety of the fleet Effingham had just time to get out of port when he saw the Spanish armada coming full sail towards him disposed in the form of a crescent and stretching the distance of seven miles from the extremity of one division to that of the other The writers of that age raise their style by a pompous description of this spectacle the most magnificent that had ever appeared upon the ocean infusing equal terror and admiration into the minds of all beholders The lofty masts the swelling sails and the towering prows of the Spanish galleons seem impossible to be justly painted but by assuming the colors of poetry and an eloquent historian of Italy in imitation of Camden has asserted that the armada though the ships bore every sail yet advanced with a slow motion as if the ocean groaned with supporting and the winds were tired with impelling so enormous a weight The truth however is that the largest of the Spanish vessels would scarcely pass for third rates in the present navy of England yet were they so ill framed or so ill governed that they were quite unwieldy and could not sail upon a wind nor tack on occasion nor be managed in stormy weather by the seamen Neither the mechanics of ship building nor the experience of mariners had attained so great perfection as could serve for the security and government of such bulky vessels and the English who had already had experience how unserviceable they commonly were beheld without dismay their tremendous appearance Monson p one hundred fifty eight Bentivoglio part ii lib iv Effingham gave orders not to come to close fight with the Spaniards where the size of the ships he suspected and the numbers of the soldiers would be a disadvantage to the English but to cannonade them at a distance and to wait the opportunity which winds currents or various accidents must afford him of intercepting some scattered vessels of the enemy Nor was it long before the event answered expectation A great ship of Biscay on board of which was a considerable part of the Spanish money took fire by accident and while all hands were employed in extinguishing the flames she fell behind the rest of the armada the great galleon of Andalusia was detained by the springing of her mast and both these vessels were taken after some resistance by Sir Francis Drake As the armada advanced up the Channel the English hung upon its rear and still infested it with skirmishes Each trial abated the confidence of the Spaniards and added courage to the English and the latter soon found that even in close fight the size of the Spanish ships was no advantage to them Their bulk exposed them the more to the fire of the enemy while their cannon placed too high shot over the heads of the English The alarm having now reached the coast of England the nobility and gentry hastened out with their vessels from every harbor and reenforced the admiral The earls of Oxford Northumberland and Cumberland Sir Thomas Cecil Sir Robert Cecil Sir Walter Raleigh Sir Thomas Vavasor Sir Thomas Gerrard Sir Charles Blount with many others distinguished themselves by this generous and disinterested service of their country The English fleet after the conjunction of those ships amounted to a hundred and forty sail The armada had now reached Calais and cast anchor before that place in expectation that the duke of Parma who had gotten intelligence of their approach would put to sea and join his forces to them The English admiral practised here a successful stratagem upon the Spaniards He took eight of his smaller ships and filling them with all combustible materials sent them one after another into the midst of the enemy The Spaniards fancied that they were fireships of the same contrivance with a famous vessel which had lately done so much execution in the Schelde near Antwerp and they immediately cut their cables and took to flight with the greatest disorder and precipitation The English fell upon them next morning while in confusion and besides doing great damage to other ships they took or destroyed about twelve of the enemy By this time it was become apparent that the intention for which these preparations were made by the Spaniards was entirely frustrated The vessels provided by the duke of Parma were made for transporting soldiers not for fighting and that general when urged to leave the harbor positively refused to expose his flourishing army to such apparent hazard while the English not only were able to keep the sea but seemed even to triumph over their enemy The Spanish admiral found in many rencounters that while he lost so considerable a part of his own navy he had destroyed only one small vessel of the English and he foresaw that by continuing so unequal a combat he must draw inevitable destruction on all the remainder He prepared therefore to return homewards but as the wind was contrary to his passage through the Channel he resolved to sail northwards and making the tour of the island reach the Spanish harbors by the ocean The English fleet followed him during some time and had not their ammunition fallen short by the negligence of the offices in supplying them they had obliged the whole armada to surrender at discretion The duke of Medina had once taken that resolution but was diverted from it by the advice of his confessor This conclusion of the enterprise would have been more glorious to the English but the event proved almost equally fatal to the Spaniards A violent tempest overtook the armada after it passed the Orkneys the ships had already lost their anchors and were obliged to keep to sea the mariners unaccustomed to such hardships and not able to govern such unwieldy vessels yielded to the fury of the storm and allowed their ships to drive either on the western isles of Scotland or on the coast of Ireland where they were miserably wrecked Not a half of the navy returned to Spain and the seamen as well as soldiers who remained were so overcome with hardships and fatigue and so dispirited by their discomfiture that they filled all Spain with accounts of the desperate valor of the English and of the tempestuous violence of that ocean which surrounds them Such was the miserable and dishonorable conclusion of an enterprise which had been preparing for three years which had exhausted the revenue and force of Spain and which had long filled all Europe with anxiety or expectation Philip who was a slave to his ambition but had an entire command over his countenance no sooner heard of the mortifying event which blasted all his hopes than he fell on his knees and rendering thanks for that gracious dispensation of Providence expressed his joy that the calamity was not greater The Spanish priests who had so often blessed this holy crusade and foretold its infallible success were somewhat at a loss to account for the victory gained over the Catholic monarch by excommunicated heretics and an execrable usurper but they at last discovered that all the calamities of the Spaniards had proceeded from their allowing the infidel Moors to live among them twenty nine Soon after the defeat and dispersion of the Spanish armada the queen summoned a new parliament and received from them a supply of two subsidies and four fifteenths payable in four years This is the first instance that subsidies were doubled in one supply and so unusual a concession was probably obtained from the joy of the present success and from the general sense of the queen s necessities Some members objected to this heavy charge on account of the great burden of loans which had lately been imposed upon the nation thirty Elizabeth foresaw that this house of commons like all the foregoing would be governed by the Puritans and therefore to obviate their enterprises she renewed at the beginning of the session her usual injunction that the parliament should not on any account presume to treat of matters ecclesiastical Notwithstanding this strict inhibition the zeal of one Damport moved him to present a bill to the commons for remedying spiritual grievances and for restraining the tyranny of the ecclesiastical commission which were certainly great but when mister Secretary Woley reminded the house of her majesty s commands no one durst second the motion the bill was not so much as read and the speaker returned it to Damport without taking the least notice of it Some members of the house notwithstanding the general submission were even committed to custody on account of this attempt See note CC at the end of the volume See note DD at the end of the volume D Ewes p four hundred thirty eight Strype s Life of Whitgift p two hundred eighty Neal vol i p five hundred The imperious conduct of Elizabeth appeared still more clearly in another parliamentary transaction The right of purveyance was an ancient prerogative by which the officers of the crown could at pleasure take provisions for the household from all the neighboring counties and could make use of the carts and carriages of the farmers and the price of these commodities and services was fixed and stated The payment of the money was often distant and uncertain and the rates being fixed before the discovery of the West Indies were much inferior to the present market price so that purveyance besides the slavery of it was always regarded as a great burden and being arbitrary and casual was liable to great abuses We may fairly presume that the hungry courtiers of Elizabeth supported by her unlimited power would be sure to render this prerogative very oppressive to the people and the commons had last session found it necessary to pass a bill for regulating these exactions but the bill was lost in the house of peers The continuance of the abuses begat a new attempt for redress and the same bill was now revived and again sent up to the house of peers together with a bill for some new regulations in the court of exchequer Soon after the commons received a message from the upper house desiring them to appoint a committee for a conference At this conference the peers informed them that the queen by a message delivered by Lord Burleigh had expressed her displeasure that the commons should presume to touch on her prerogative If there were any abuses she said either in imposing purveyance or in the practice of the court of exchequer her majesty was both able and willing to provide due reformation but would not permit the parliament to intermeddle in these matters D Ewes p four hundred thirty four D Ewes p four hundred forty The commons alarmed at this intelligence appointed another committee to attend the queen and endeavor to satisfy her of their humble and dutiful intentions Elizabeth gave a gracious reception to the committee she expressed her great inestimable loving care towards her loving subjects which she said was greater than of her own self or even than any of them could have of themselves She told them that she had already given orders for an inquiry into the abuses attending purveyance but the dangers of the Spanish invasion had retarded the progress of the design that she had as much skill will and power to rule her household as any subjects whatsoever to govern theirs and needed as little the assistance of her neighbors that the exchequer was her chamber consequently more near to her than even her house bold and therefore the less proper for them to intermeddle with and that she would of herself with advice of her council and the judges redress every grievance in these matters but would not permit the commons by laws moved without her privity to bereave her of the honor attending these regulations The issue of this matter was the same that attended all contests between Elizabeth and her parliaments She seems even to have been more imperious in this particular than her predecessors at least her more remote ones for they often permitted the abuses of purveyance thirty one to be redressed by law Edward III a very arbitrary prince allowed ten several statutes to be enacted for that purpose D Ewes p four hundred forty four Si rixa est ubi tu pulsus ego vapulo tantum

speech which they thought would give the least offence to any of them Sir Edward Hobby showed in the house his extreme grief that by some great personage not a member of the house he had been sharply rebuked for speeches delivered in parliament he craved the favor of the house and desired that some of the members might inform that great personage of his true meaning and intention in these speeches

Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norris were the leaders in this romantic enterprise near twenty thousand volunteers enlisted themselves in the service and ships were hired as well as arms provided at the charge of the adventurers The queen s frugality kept her from contributing more than sixty thousand pounds to the expense and she only allowed six of her ships of war to attend the expedition There was more spirit and bravery than foresight or prudence in the conduct of this enterprise The small stock of the adventurers did not enable them to buy either provisions or ammunition sufficient for such an undertaking they even wanted vessels to stow the numerous volunteers who crowded to them and they were obliged to seize by force some ships of the Hanse Towns which they met with at sea an expedient which set them somewhat at ease in point of room for their men but remedied not the deficiency of their provisions Birch s Memoirs of Queen Elizabeth vol i p sixty one Monson p two hundred sixty seven says that there were only fourteen thousand soldiers and four thousand seamen in the whole on this expedition but the account contained in doctor Birch is given by one of the most considerable of the adventurers Monson p two hundred sixty seven Monson p one hundred fifty nine Had they sailed directly to Portugal it is believed that the good will of the people joined to the defenceless state of the country might have insured them of success but hearing that great preparations were making at the Groine for the invasion of England they were induced to go thither and destroy this new armament of Spain They broke into the harbor burned some ships of war particularly one commanded by Recalde vice admiral of Spain they defeated an army of four or five thousand men which was assembled to oppose them they assaulted the Groine and took the lower town which they pillaged and they would have taken the higher though well fortified had they not found their ammunition and provisions beginning to fail them The young earl of Essex a nobleman of promising hopes who fired with the thirst of military honor had secretly unknown to the queen stolen from England here joined the adventurers and it was then agreed by common consent to make sail for Portugal the main object of their enterprise The English landed at Paniche a seaport town twelve leagues from Lisbon and Norris led the army to that capital while Drake undertook to sail up the river and attack the city with united forces By this time the court of Spain had gotten leisure to prepare against the invasion Forces were thrown into Lisbon the Portuguese were disarmed all suspected persons were taken into custody and thus though the inhabitants bore great affection to Don Antonio none of them durst declare in favor of the invaders The English army however made themselves masters of the suburbs which abounded with riches of all kinds but as they desired to conciliate the affections of the Portuguese and were more intent on honor than profit they observed a strict discipline and abstained from all plunder Meanwhile they found their ammunition and provisions much exhausted they had not a single cannon to make a breach in the walls the admiral had not been able to pass some fortresses which guarded the river there was no appearance of an insurrection in their favor sickness from fatigue hunger and intemperance in wine and fruits had seized the army so that it was found necessary to make all possible haste to reembark They were not pursued by the enemy and finding at the mouth of the river sixty ships laden with naval stores they seized them as lawful prize though they belonged to the Hanse Towns a neutral power They sailed thence to Vigo which they took and burned and having ravaged the country around they set sail and arrived in England Above half of these gallant adventurers perished by sickness famine fatigue and the sword and England reaped more honor than profit from this extraordinary enterprise It is computed that eleven hundred gentlemen embarked on board the fleet and that only three hundred and fifty survived those multiplied disasters Birch s Memoirs vol i p sixty one Birch s Memoirs vol i p sixty one When these ships were on their voyage homewards they met with the earl of Cumberland who was outward bound with a fleet of seven sail all equipped at his own charge except one ship of war which the queen had lent him That nobleman supplied Sir Francis Drake with some provisions a generosity which saved the lives of many of Drake s men but for which the others afterwards suffered severely Cumberland sailed towards the Terceras and took several prizes from the enemy but the richest valued at a hundred thousand pounds perished in her return with all her cargo near saint Michael s Mount in Cornwall Many of these adventurers were killed in a rash attempt at the Terceras a great mortality seized the rest and it was with difficulty that the few hands which remained were able to steer the ships back into harbor Though the signal advantages gained over the Spaniards and the spirit thence infused into the English gave Elizabeth great security during the rest of her reign she could not forbear keeping an anxious eye on Scotland whose situation rendered its revolutions always of importance to her It might have been expected that this high spirited princess who knew so well to brave danger would not have retained that malignant jealousy towards her heir with which during the lifetime of Mary she had been so much agitated James had indeed succeeded to all the claims of his mother but he had not succeeded to the favor of the Catholics which could alone render these claims dangerous and as the queen was now well advanced in years and enjoyed an uncontrolled authority over her subjects it was not likely that the king of Scots who was of an indolent unambitious temper would ever give her any disturbance in her possession of the throne Yet all these circumstances could not remove her timorous suspicions and so far from satisfying the nation by a settlement of the succession or a declaration of James s title she was as anxious to prevent every incident which might anywise raise his credit or procure him the regard of the English as if he had been her immediate rival and competitor Most of his ministers and favorites were her pensioners and as she was desirous to hinder him from marrying and having children she obliged them to throw obstacles in the way of every alliance even the most reasonable which could be offered him and during some years she succeeded in this malignant policy Monson p one hundred sixty one Winwood vol i p forty one Melvil p one hundred sixty six one hundred seventy seven He had fixed on the elder daughter of the king of Denmark who being a remote prince and not powerful could give her no umbrage yet did she so artfully cross this negotiation that the Danish monarch impatient of delay married his daughter to the duke of Brunswick James then renewed his suit to the younger princess and still found obstacles from the intrigues of Elizabeth who merely with a view of interposing delay proposed to him the sister of the king of Navarre a princess much older than himself and entirely destitute of fortune The young king besides the desire of securing himself by the prospect of issue from those traitorous attempts too frequent among his subjects had been so watched by the rigid austerity of the ecclesiastics that he had another inducement to marry which is not so usual with monarchs His impatience therefore broke through all the politics of Elizabeth the articles of marriage were settled the ceremony was performed by proxy and the princess embarked for Scotland but was driven by a storm into a port of Norway This tempest and some others which happened near the same time were universally believed in Scotland and Denmark to have proceeded from a combination of the Scottish and Danish witches and the dying confession of the criminals was supposed to put the accusation beyond all controversy James however though a great believer in sorcery was not deterred by this incident from taking a voyage in order to conduct his bride home he arrived in Norway carried the queen thence to Copenhagen and having passed the winter in that city he brought her next spring to Scotland where they were joyfully received by the people The clergy alone who never neglected an opportunity of vexing their prince made opposition to the queen s coronation on account of the ceremony of anointing her which they alleged was either a Jewish or a Popish rite and therefore utterly antichristian and unlawful But James was as much bent on the ceremony as they were averse to it and after much controversy and many intrigues his authority which had not often happened at last prevailed over their opposition Melvil p one hundred eighty Spotswood p three hundred eighty one CHAPTER XLIII ELIZABETH After a state of great anxiety and many difficulties Elizabeth had at length reached a situation where though her affairs still required attention and found employment for her active spirit she was removed from all danger of any immediate revolution and might regard the efforts of her enemies with some degree of confidence and security Her successful and prudent administration had gained her together with the admiration of foreigners the affections of her own subjects and after the death of the queen of Scots even the Catholics however discontented pretended not to dispute her title or adhere to any other person as her competitor James curbed by his factious nobility and ecclesiastics possessed at home very little authority and was solicitous to remain on good terms with Elizabeth and the English nation in hopes that time aided by his patient tranquillity would secure him that rich succession to which his birth entitled him The Hollanders though overmatched in their contest with Spain still made an obstinate resistance and such was their unconquerable antipathy to their old masters and such the prudent conduct of young Maurice their governor that the subduing of that small territory if at all possible must be the work of years and the result of many and great successes Philip who in his powerful effort against England had been transported by resentment and ambition beyond his usual cautious maxims was now disabled and still more discouraged from adventuring again on such hazardous enterprises The situation also of affairs in France began chiefly to employ his attention but notwithstanding all his artifice and force and expense the events in that kingdom proved every day more contrary to his expectations and more favorable to the friends and confederates of England The violence of the league having constrained Henry to declare war against the Hugonots these religionists seemed exposed to the utmost danger and Elizabeth sensible of the intimate connection between her own interests and those of that party had supported the king of Navarre by her negotiations in Germany and by large sums of money which she remitted for levying forces in that country This great prince not discouraged by the superiority of his enemies took the field and in the year fifteen eighty seven gained at Coutras a complete victory over the army of the French king but as his allies the Germans were at the same time discomfited by the army of the league under the duke of Guise his situation notwithstanding his victory seemed still as desperate as ever The chief advantage which he reaped by this diversity of success arose from the dissensions which by that means took place among his enemies The inhabitants of Paris intoxicated with admiration of Guise and strongly prejudiced against their king whose intentions had become suspicious to them took to arms and obliged Henry to fly for his safety That prince dissembling his resentment entered into a negotiation with the league and having conferred many high offices on Guise and his partisans summoned an assembly of the states at Blois on pretence of finding expedients to support the intended war against the Hugonots The various scenes of perfidy and cruelty which had been exhibited in France had justly begotten a mutual diffidence among all parties yet Guise trusting more to the timidity than honor of the king rashly put himself into the hands of that monarch and expected by the ascendant of his own genius to make him submit to all his exorbitant pretensions Henry though of an easy disposition not steady to his resolutions or even to his promises wanted neither courage nor capacity and finding all his subtleties eluded by the vigor of Guise and even his throne exposed to the most imminent danger he embraced more violent counsels than were natural to him and ordered that prince and his brother the cardinal of Guise to be assassinated in his palace This cruel execution which the necessity of it alone could excuse had nearly proved fatal to the author and seemed at first to plunge him into greater dangers than those which he sought to avoid by taking vengeance on his enemy The partisans of the league were inflamed with the utmost rage against him the populace every where particularly at Paris renounced allegiance to him the ecclesiastics and the preachers filled all places with execrations against his name and the most powerful cities and most opulent provinces appeared to combine in a resolution either of renouncing monarchy or of changing their monarch Henry finding slender resource among his Catholic subjects was constrained to enter into a confederacy with the Hugonots and the king of Navarre he enlisted large bodies of Swiss infantry and German cavalry and being still supported by his chief nobility he assembled by all these means an army of near forty thousand men and advanced to the gates of Paris ready to crush the league and subdue all his enemies The desperate resolution of one man diverted the course of these great events Jaques Clement a Dominican friar inflamed by that bloody spirit of bigotry which distinguishes this century and a great part of the following beyond all ages of the world embraced the resolution of sacrificing his own life in order to save the church from the persecutions of an heretical tyrant and being admitted under some pretext to the king s presence he gave that prince a mortal wound and was immediately put to death by the courtiers who hastily revenged the murder of their sovereign This memorable incident happened on the first of August fifteen eighty nine The king of Navarre next heir to the crown assumed the government by the title of Henry IV but succeeded to much greater difficulties than those which surrounded his predecessor The prejudices entertained against his religion made a great part of the nobility immediately desert him and it was only by his promise of hearkening to conferences and instruction that he could engage any of the Catholics to adhere to his undoubted title The league governed by the duke of Mayenne brother to Guise gathered new force and the king of Spain entertained views either of dismembering the French monarchy or of annexing the whole to his own dominions In these distressful circumstances Henry addressed himself to Elizabeth and found her well disposed to contribute to his assistance and to oppose the progress of the Catholic league and of Philip her inveterate and dangerous enemies To prevent the desertion of his Swiss and German auxiliaries she made him a present of twenty two thousand pounds a greater sum than as he declared he had ever seen before and she sent him a reenforcement of four thousand men under Lord Willoughby an officer of reputation who joined the French at Dieppe Strengthened by these supplies Henry marched directly to Paris and having taken the suburbs sword in hand he abandoned them to be pillaged by his soldiers He employed this body of English in many other enterprises and still found reason to praise their courage and fidelity The time of their service being elapsed he dismissed them with many high commendations Sir William Drury Sir Thomas Baskerville and Sir John Boroughs acquired reputation this campaign and revived in France the ancient fame of English valor The army which Henry next campaign led into the field was much inferior to that of the league but as it was composed of the chief nobility of France he feared not to encounter his enemies in a pitched battle at Yvree and he gained a complete victory over them This success enabled him to blockade Paris and he reduced that capital to the last extremity of famine when the duke of Parma in consequence of orders from Philip marched to the relief of the league and obliged Henry to raise the blockade Having performed this important service he retreated to the Low Countries and by his consummate skill in the art of war performed these long marches in the face of the enemy without affording the French monarch that opportunity which he sought of giving him battle or so much as once putting his army in disorder The only loss which he sustained was in the Low Countries where Prince Maurice took advantage of his absence and recovered some places which the duke of Parma had formerly conquered from the states thirty two See note FF at the end of the volume The situation of Henry s affairs though promising was not so well advanced or established as to make the queen discontinue her succors and she was still more confirmed in the resolution of supporting him by some advantages gained by the king of Spain The duke of Mercoeur governor of Brittany a prince of the house of Lorraine had declared for the league and finding himself hard pressed by Henry s forces he had been obliged in order to secure himself to introduce some Spanish troops into the seaport towns of that province Elizabeth was alarmed at the danger and foresaw that the Spaniards besides infesting the English commerce by privateers might employ these harbors as the seat of their naval preparations and might more easily from that vicinity than from Spain or Portugal project an invasion of England She concluded therefore a new treaty with Henry in which she engaged to send over three thousand men to be employed in the reduction of Brittany and she stipulated that her charges should in a twelvemonth or as soon as the enemy was expelled be refunded her These forces were commanded by Sir John Norris and under him by his brother Henry and by Anthony Shirley Sir Roger Williams was at the head of a small body which garrisoned Dieppe and a squadron of ships under the command of Sir Henry Palmer lay upon the coast of France and intercepted all the vessels belonging to the Spaniards or the leaguers The operations of war can very little be regulated beforehand by any treaty or agreement and Henry who found it necessary to lay aside the projected enterprise against Brittany persuaded the English commanders to join his army and to take a share in the hostilities which he carried into Picardy Notwithstanding the disgust which Elizabeth received from this disappointment he laid before her a plan for expelling the leaguers from Normandy and persuaded her to send over a new body of four thousand men to assist him in that enterprise The earl of Essex was appointed general of these forces a young nobleman who by many exterior accomplishments and still more real merit was daily advancing in favor with Elizabeth and seemed to occupy that place in her affections which Leicester now deceased had so long enjoyed Essex impatient for military fame was extremely uneasy to lie some time at Dieppe unemployed and had not the orders which he received from his mistress been so positive he would gladly have accepted of Henry s invitation and have marched to join the French army now in Champagne This plan of operations was also proposed to Elizabeth by the French ambassador but she rejected it with great displeasure and she threatened immediately to recall her troops if Henry should persevere any longer in his present practice of breaking all concert with her and attending to nothing but his own interests Camden p five hundred sixty one Rymer vol xiv p one hundred sixteen Birch s Negotiations p five Rymer tom xiv p one hundred twenty three one hundred forty Urged by these motives the French king at last led his army into Normandy and laid siege to Rouen which he reduced to great difficulties But the league unable of themselves to take the field against him had again recourse to the duke of Parma who received orders to march to their relief He executed this enterprise with his usual abilities and success and for the present frustrated all the projects of Henry and Elizabeth This princess who kept still in view the interests of her own kingdom in all her foreign transactions was impatient under these disappointments blamed Henry for his negligence in the execution of treaties and complained that the English forces were thrust foremost in every hazardous enterprise It is probable however that their own ardent courage and their desire of distinguishing themselves in so celebrated a theatre of war were the causes why they so often enjoyed this perilous honor Notwithstanding the indifferent success of former enterprises the queen was sensible how necessary it was to support Henry against the league and the Spaniards and she formed a new treaty with him in which they agreed never to make peace with Philip but by common consent she promised to send him a new supply of four thousand men and he stipulated to repay her charges in a twelvemonth to employ these forces joined to a body of French troops in an expedition against Brittany and to consign into her hands a seaport town of that province for a retreat to the English Henry knew the impossibility of executing some of these articles and the imprudence of fulfilling others but finding them rigidly insisted on by Elizabeth he accepted of her succors and trusted that he might easily on some pretence be able to excuse his failure in executing his part of the treaty This campaign was the least successful of all those which he had yet carried on against the league During these military operations in France Elizabeth employed her naval power against Philip and endeavored to intercept his West Indian treasures the source of that greatness which rendered him so formidable to all his neighbors She sent a squadron of seven ships under the command of Lord Thomas Howard for this service but the king of Spain informed of her purpose fitted out a great force of fifty five sail and despatched them to escort the Indian fleet They fell in with the English squadron and by the courageous obstinacy of Sir Richard Greenville the vice admiral who refused to make his escape by flight they took one vessel the first English ship of war that had yet fallen into the hands of the Spaniards thirty three The rest of the squadron returned safely into England frustrated of their expectations but pleasing themselves with the idea that their attempt had not been altogether fruitless in hurting the enemy Camden p five hundred sixty two Rymer vol xvi p one hundred fifty one one hundred sixty eight one hundred seventy one one hundred seventy three See note GG at the end of the volume The Indian fleet had been so long detained in the Havana from the fear of the English that they were obliged at last to set sail in an improper season and most of them perished by shipwreck ere they reached the Spanish harbors The earl of Cumberland made a like unsuccessful enterprise against the Spanish trade He carried out one ship of the queen s and seven others equipped at his own expense but the prizes which he made did not compensate the charges Illustration one five hundred twenty seven raleigh jpg SIR WALTER RALEIGH The spirit of these expensive and hazardous adventures was very prevalent in England Sir Walter Raleigh who had enjoyed great favor with the queen finding his interest to decline determined to recover her good graces by some important undertaking and as his reputation was high among his countrymen he persuaded great numbers to engage with him as volunteers in an attempt on the West Indies The fleet was detained so long in the Channel by contrary winds that the season was lost Raleigh was recalled by the queen Sir Martin Frobisher succeeded to the command and made a privateering voyage against the Spaniards He took one rich carrack near the Island of Flores and destroyed another About the same time Thomas White a Londoner took two Spanish ships which besides fourteen hundred chests of quicksilver contained above two millions of bulls for indulgences a commodity useless to the English but which had cost the king of Spain three hundred thousand florins and would have been sold by him in the Indies for five millions This war did great damage to Spain but it was attended with considerable expense to England and Elizabeth s ministers computed that since the commencement of it she had spent in Flanders and France and on her naval expeditions above one million two hundred thousand pounds a charge which notwithstanding her extreme frugality was too burthensome for her narrow revenues to support Monson p one hundred sixty three Monson p one hundred sixty nine Monson p one hundred sixty five Camden p five hundred sixty nine Strype vol iii She summoned therefore a parliament in order to obtain supply but she either thought her authority so established that she needed to make them no concessions in return or she rated her power and prerogative above money for there never was any parliament whom she treated in a more haughty manner whom she made more sensible of their own weakness or whose privileges she more openly violated When the speaker Sir Edward Coke made the three usual requests of freedom from arrests of access to her person and of liberty of speech she replied to him by the mouth of Puckering lord keeper that liberty of speech was granted to the commons but they must know what liberty they were entitled to not a liberty for every one to speak what he listeth or what cometh in his brain to utter their privilege extended no further than a liberty of aye or no that she enjoined the speaker if he perceived any idle heads so negligent of their own safety as to attempt reforming the church or innovating in the commonwealth that he should refuse the bills exhibited for that purpose till they were examined by such as were fitter to consider of these things and could better judge of them that she would not impeach the freedom of their persons but they must beware lest under color of this privilege they imagined that any neglect of their duty could be covered or protected and that she would not refuse them access to her person provided it were upon urgent and weighty causes and at times convenient and when she might have leisure from other important affairs of the realm Notwithstanding the menacing and contemptuous air of this speech the intrepid and indefatigable Peter Wentworth not discouraged by his former ill success ventured to transgress the imperial orders of Elizabeth He presented to the lord keeper a petition in which he desired the upper house to join with the lower in a supplication to her majesty for entailing the succession of the crown and he declared that he had a bill ready prepared for that purpose This method of proceeding was sufficiently respectful and cautious but the subject was always extremely disagreeable to the queen and what she had expressly prohibited any one from meddling with she sent Wentworth immediately to the Tower committed Sir Thomas Bromley who had seconded him to the Fleet prison together with Stevens and Welsh two members to whom Sir Thomas had communicated his intention D Ewes p four hundred sixty four hundred sixty nine Townsend p thirty seven D Ewes p four hundred seventy Townsend p fifty four About a fortnight after a motion was made in the house to petition the queen for the release of these members but it was answered by all the privy counsellors there present that her majesty had committed them for causes best known to herself and that to press her on that head would only tend to the prejudice of the gentlemen whom they meant to serve she would release them whenever she thought proper and would be better pleased to do it of her own proper motion than from their suggestion The house willingly acquiesced in this reasoning So arbitrary an act at the commencement of the session might well repress all further attempts for freedom but the religious zeal of the puritans was not so easily restrained and it inspired a courage which no human motive was able to surmount Morrice chancellor of the duchy and attorney of the court of wards made a motion for redressing the abuses in the bishops courts but above all in the high commission where subscriptions he said were exacted to articles at the pleasure of the prelates where oaths were imposed obliging persons to answer to all questions without distinction even though they should tend to their own condemnation and where every one who refused entire satisfaction to the commissioners was imprisoned without relief or remedy D Ewes p four hundred ninety seven D Ewes p four hundred seventy four Townsend p sixty This motion was seconded by some members but the ministers and privy counsellors opposed it and foretold the consequences which ensued The queen sent for the speaker and after requiring him to deliver to her Morrice s bill she told him that it was in her power to call parliaments in her power to dissolve them in her power to give assent or dissent to any determination which they should form that her purpose in summoning this parliament was twofold to have laws enacted for the further enforcement of uniformity in religion and to provide for the defence of the nation against the exorbitant power of Spain that these two points ought therefore to be the object of their deliberations she had enjoined them already by the mouth of the lord keeper to meddle neither with matters of state nor of religion and she wondered how any one could be so assuming as to attempt a subject so expressly contrary to her prohibition that she was highly offended with this presumption and took the present opportunity to reiterate the commands given by the keeper and to require that no bill regarding either state affairs or reformation in causes ecclesiastical be exhibited in the house and that in particular she charged the speaker upon his allegiance if any such bills were offered absolutely to refuse them a reading and not so much as permit them to be debated by the members This command from the queen was submitted to without further question Morrice was seized in the house itself by a serjeant at arms discharged from his office of chancellor of the duchy incapacitated from any practice in his profession as a common lawyer and kept some years prisoner in Tilbury Castle The queen having thus expressly pointed out both what the house should and should not do the commons were as obsequious to the one as to the other of her injunctions They passed a law against recusants such a law as was suited to the severe character of Elizabeth and to the persecuting spirit of the age It was entitled An act to retain her majesty s subjects in their due obedience and was meant as the preamble declares to obviate such inconveniencies and perils as might grow from the wicked practices of seditious sectaries and disloyal persons for these two species of criminals were always at that time confounded together as equally dangerous to the peace of society It was enacted that any person above sixteen years of age who obstinately refused during the space of a month to attend public worship should be committed to prison that if after being condemned for this offence he persist three months in his refusal he must abjure the realm and that if he either refuse this condition or return after banishment he should suffer capitally as a felon without benefit of clergy This law bore equally hard upon the Puritans and upon the Catholics and had it not been imposed by the queen s authority was certainly in that respect much contrary to the private sentiments and inclinations of the majority in the house of commons Very little opposition however appears there to have been openly made to it D Ewes p four hundred seventy four four hundred seventy eight Townsend p sixty eight Heylin s History of the Presbyterians p three hundred twenty thirty five Eliz c one After enacting this statute the clergy in order to remove the odium from themselves often took care that recusants should be tried by the civil judges at the assizes rather than by the ecclesiastical commissioners Strype s Ann vol iv p two hundred sixty four The expenses of the war with Spain having reduced the queen to great difficulties the grant of subsidies seems to have been the most important business of this parliament and it was a signal proof of the high spirit of Elizabeth that while conscious of a present dependence on the commons she opened the session with the most haughty treatment of them and covered her weakness under such a lofty appearance of superiority The commons readily voted two subsidies and four fifteenths but this sum not appearing sufficient to the court an unusual expedient was fallen upon to induce them to make an enlargement in their concessions The peers informed the commons in a conference that they could not give their assent to the supply voted thinking it too small for the queen s occasions they therefore proposed a grant of three subsidies and six fifteenths and desired a further conference in order to persuade the commons to agree to this measure The commons who had acquired the privilege of beginning bills of subsidy took offence at this procedure of the lords and at first absolutely rejected the proposal but being afraid on reflection that they had by this refusal given offence to their superiors they both agreed to the conference and afterwards voted the additional subsidy The queen notwithstanding this unusual concession of the commons ended the session with a speech containing some reprimands to them and full of the same high pretensions which she had assumed at the opening of the parliament She took notice by the mouth of the keeper that certain members spent more time than was necessary by indulging themselves in harangues and reasonings and she expressed her displeasure on account of their not paying due reverence to privy counsellors who she told them were not to be accounted as common knights and burgesses of the house who are counsellors but during the parliament whereas the others are standing counsellors and for their wisdom and great service are called to the council of the state D Ewes p four hundred eighty three four hundred eighty seven four hundred eighty eight Townsend p sixty six D Ewes p four hundred sixty six Townsend p seventeen The queen also in her own person made the parliament a spirited harangue in which she spoke of the justice and moderation of her government expressed the small ambition she had ever entertained of making conquests displayed the just grounds of her quarrel with the king of Spain and discovered how little she apprehended the power of that monarch even though he should make a greater effort against her than that of his Invincible Armada But I am informed added she that when he attempted this last invasion some upon the sea coast forsook their towns fled up higher into the country and left all naked and exposed to his entrance but I swear unto you by God if I knew those persons or may know of any that shall do so hereafter I will make them feel what it is to be so fearful in so urgent a cause By this menace she probably gave the people to understand that she would execute martial law upon such cowards for there was no statute by which a man could be punished for changing his place of abode D Ewes p four hundred sixty six Townsend p forty eight The king of France though he had hitherto made war on the league with great bravery and reputation though he had this campaign gained considerable advantages over them and though he was assisted by a considerable body of English under Norris who carried hostilities into the heart of Brittany was become sensible that he never could by force of arms alone render himself master of his kingdom The nearer he seemed by his military successes to approach to a full possession of the throne the more discontent and jealousy arose among those Romanists who adhered to him and a party was formed in his own court to elect some Catholic monarch of the royal blood if Henry should any longer refuse to satisfy them by declaring his conversion This excellent prince was far from being a bigot to his sect and as he deemed these theological disputes entirely subordinate to the public good he had secretly determined from the beginning to come some time or other to the resolution required of him He had found on the death of his predecessor that the Hugonots who formed the bravest and most faithful part of his army were such determined zealots that if he had at that time abjured their faith they would instantly have abandoned him to the pretensions and usurpations of the Catholics The more bigoted Catholics he knew particularly those of the league had entertained such an unsurmountable prejudice against his person and diffidence of his sincerity that even his abjuration would not reconcile them to his title and he must either expect to be entirely excluded from the throne or be admitted to it on such terms as would leave him little more than the mere shadow of royalty In this delicate situation he had resolved to temporize to retain the Hugonots by continuing in the profession of their religion to gain the moderate Catholics by giving them hopes of his conversion to attach both to his person by conduct and success and he hoped either that the animosity arising from war against the league would make them drop gradually the question of religion or that he might in time after some victories over his enemies and some conferences with divines make finally with more decency and dignity that abjuration which must have appeared at first mean as well as suspicious to both parties When the people are attached to any theological tenets merely from a general persuasion or prepossession they are easily induced by any motive or authority to change their faith in these mysterious subjects as appears from the example of the English who during some reigns usually embraced without scruple the still varying religion of their sovereigns But the French nation where principles had so long been displayed as the badges of faction and where each party had fortified its belief by an animosity against the other were not found so pliable or inconstant and Henry was at last convinced that the Catholics of his party would entirely abandon him if he gave them not immediate satisfaction in this particular The Hugonots also taught by experience clearly saw that his desertion of them was become absolutely necessary for the public settlement and so general was this persuasion among them that as the duke of Sully pretends even the divines of that party purposely allowed themselves to be worsted in the disputes and conferences that the king might more readily be convinced of the weakness of their cause and might more cordially and sincerely at least more decently embrace the religion which it was so much his interest to believe If this self denial in so tender a point should appear incredible and supernatural in theologians it will at least be thought very natural that a prince so little instructed in these matters as Henry and desirous to preserve his sincerity should insensibly bend his opinion to the necessity of his affairs and should believe that party to have the best arguments who could alone put him in possession of a kingdom All circumstances therefore being prepared for this great event that monarch renounced the Protestant religion and was solemnly received by the French prelates of his party into the bosom of the church Elizabeth who was herself attached to the Protestants chiefly by her interests and the circumstances of her birth and who seems to have entertained some propensity during her whole life to the Catholic superstition at least to the ancient ceremonies yet pretended to be extremely displeased with this abjuration of Henry and she wrote him an angry letter reproaching him with this interested change of his religion Sensible however that the league and the king of Spain were still their common enemies she hearkened to his apologies continued her succors both of men and money and formed a new treaty in which they mutually stipulated never to make peace but by common agreement The intrigues of Spain were not limited to France and England by means of the never failing pretence of religion joined to the influence of money Philip excited new disorders in Scotland and gave fresh alarms to Elizabeth George Ker brother to Lord Newbottle had been taken while he was passing secretly into Spain and papers were found about him by which a dangerous conspiracy of some Catholic noblemen with Philip was discovered The earls of Angus Errol and Huntley the heads of three potent families had entered into a confederacy with the Spanish monarch and had stipulated to raise all their forces to join them to a body of Spanish troops which Philip promised to send into Scotland and after reestablishing the Catholic religion in that kingdom to march with their united power in order to effect the same purpose in England Graham of Fintry who had also entered into this conspiracy was taken and arraigned and executed Elizabeth sent Lord Borough ambassador into Scotland and exhorted the king to exercise the same severity on the three earls to confiscate their estates and by annexing them to the crown both increase his own demesnes and set an example to all his subjects of the dangers attending treason and rebellion The advice was certainly rational but not easy to be executed by the small revenue and limited authority of James He desired therefore some supply from her of men and money but though she had reason to deem the prosecution of the three Popish earls a common cause she never could be prevailed on to grant him the least assistance The tenth part of the expense which she bestowed in supporting the French king and the states would have sufficed to execute this purpose more immediately essential to her security but she seems ever to have borne some degree of malignity to James whom she hated both as her heir and as the son of Mary her hated rival and competitor Spotswood p three hundred ninety one Rymer tom xvi p one hundred ninety Spotswood p three hundred ninety three Rymer tom xvi p two hundred thirty five So far from giving James assistance to prosecute the Catholic conspirators the queen rather contributed to increase his inquietude by countenancing the turbulent disposition of the earl of Bothwell a nobleman descended from a natural son of James V Both well more than once attempted to render himself master of the king s person and being expelled the kingdom for these traitorous enterprises he took shelter in England was secretly protected by the queen and lurked near the borders where his power lay with a view of still committing some new violence He succeeded at last in an attempt on the king and by the mediation of the English ambassador imposed dishonorable terms upon that prince but James by the authority of the convention of states annulled this agreement as extorted by violence again expelled Bothwell and obliged him to take shelter in England Elizabeth pretending ignorance of the place of his retreat never executed the treaties by which she was bound to deliver up all rebels and fugitives to the king of Scotland Spotswood p two hundred fifty seven two hundred fifty eight During these disorders increased by the refractory disposition of the ecclesiastics the prosecution of the Catholic earls remained in suspense but at last the parliament passed an act of attainder against them and the king prepared himself to execute it by force of arms The noblemen though they obtained a victory over the earl of Argyle who acted by the king s commission found themselves hard pressed by James himself and agreed on certain terms to leave the kingdom Bothwell being defected in a confederacy with them forfeited the favor of Elizabeth and was obliged to take shelter first in France then in Italy where he died some years after in great poverty The established authority of the queen secured her from all such attempts as James was exposed to from the mutinous disposition of his subjects and her enemies found no other means of giving her domestic disturbance than by such traitorous and perfidious machinations as ended in their own disgrace and in the ruin of their criminal instruments Roderigo Lopez a Jew domestic physician to the queen being imprisoned on suspicion confessed that he had received a bribe to poison her from Fuentes and Ibarra who had succeeded Parma lately deceased in the government of the Netherlands but he maintained that he had no other intention than to cheat Philip of his money and never meant to fulfil his engagement He was however executed for the conspiracy and the queen complained to Philip of these dishonorable attempts of his ministers but could obtain no satisfaction York and Williams two English traitors were afterwards executed for a conspiracy with Ibarra equally atrocious Instead of avenging herself by retaliating in a like manner Elizabeth sought a more honorable vengeance by supporting the king of France and assisting him in finally breaking the force of the league which after the conversion of that monarch went daily to decay and was threatened with speedy ruin and dissolution Norris commanded the English forces in Brittany and assisted at the taking of Morlaix Quimpercorentin and Brest towns garrisoned by Spanish forces In every action the English though they had so long enjoyed domestic peace discovered a strong military disposition and the queen though herself a heroine found more frequent occasion to reprove her generals for encouraging their temerity than for countenancing their fear or caution Sir Martin Frobisher her brave admiral perished with many others before Brest Morlaix had been promised to the English for a place of retreat but the duke d Aumont the French general eluded this promise by making it be inserted in the capitulation that none but Catholics should be admitted into that city Camden p five hundred seventy seven Birch s Negot p fifteen Bacon vol iv p three hundred eighty one Camden p five hundred eighty two Camden p five hundred seventy eight Next campaign the French king who had long carried on hostilities with Philip was at last provoked by the taking of Chatelet and Dourlens and the attack of Cambray to declare war against that monarch Elizabeth being threatened with a new invasion in England and with an insurrection in Ireland recalled most of her forces and sent Norris to command in this latter kingdom Finding also that the French league was almost entirely dissolved and that the most considerable leaders had made an accommodation with their prince she thought that he could well support himself by his own force and valor and she began to be more sparing in his cause of the blood and treasure of her subjects Some disgusts which she had received from the states joined to the remonstrances of her frugal minister Burleigh made her also inclined to diminish her charges on that side and she even demanded by her ambassador Sir Thomas Bodley to be reimbursed all the money which she had expended in supporting them The states besides alleging the conditions of the treaty by which they were not bound to repay her till the conclusion of a peace pleaded their present poverty and distress the great superiority of the Spaniards and the difficulty in supporting the war much more in saving money to discharge their encumbrances After much negotiation a new treaty was formed by which the states engaged to free the queen immediately from the charge of the English auxiliaries computed at forty thousand pounds a year to pay her annually twenty thousand pounds for some years to assist her with a certain number of ships and to conclude no peace or treaty without her consent They also bound themselves on finishing a peace with Spain to pay her annually the sum of a hundred thousand pounds for four years but on this condition that the payment should be in lieu of all demands and that they should be supplied though at their own charge with a body of four thousand auxiliaries from England Camden p five hundred eighty six The queen still retained in her hands the cautionary towns which were a great check on the rising power of the states and she committed the important trust of Flushing to Sir Francis Vere a brave officer who had distinguished himself by his valor in the Low Countries She gave him the preference to Essex who expected so honorable a command and though this nobleman was daily rising both in reputation with the people and favor with herself the queen who was commonly reserved in the advancement of her courtiers thought proper on this occasion to give him a refusal Sir Thomas Baskerville was sent over to France at the head of two thousand English with which Elizabeth by a new treaty concluded with Henry engaged to supply that prince Some stipulations for mutual assistance were formed by the treaty and all former engagements were renewed This body of English were maintained at the expense of the French king yet did Henry esteem the supply of considerable advantage on account of the great reputation acquired by the English in so many fortunate enterprises undertaken against the common enemy In the great battle of Tournholt gained this campaign by Prince Maurice the English auxiliaries under Sir Francis Vere and Sir Robert Sidney had acquired honor and the success of that day was universally ascribed to their discipline and valor Though Elizabeth at a considerable expense of blood and treasure made war against Philip in France and the Low Countries the most severe blows which she gave him were by those naval enterprises which either she or her subjects scarcely ever intermitted during one season In fifteen ninety four Richard Hawkins son of Sir John the famous navigator procured the queen s commission and sailed with three ships to the South Sea by the Straits of Magellan but his voyage proved unfortunate and he himself was taken prisoner on the coast of Chili James Lancaster was supplied the same year with three ships and a pinnace by the merchants of London and was more fortunate in his adventure He took thirty nine ships of the enemy and not content with this success he made an attack on Fernambouc in Brazil where he knew great treasures were at that time lodged As he approached the shore he saw it lined with great numbers of the enemy but nowise daunted at this appearance he placed the stoutest of his men in boats and ordered them to row with such violence on the landing place as to split them in pieces By this bold action he both deprived his men of all resource but in victory and terrified the enemy who fled after a short resistance He returned home with the treasure which he had so bravely acquired In fifteen ninety five Sir Walter Raleigh who had anew forfeited the queen s friendship by an intrigue with a maid of honor and who had been thrown into prison for this misdemeanor no sooner recovered his liberty than he was pushed by his active and enterprising genius to attempt some great action The success of the first Spanish adventurers against Mexico and Peru had begotten an extreme avidity in Europe and a prepossession universally took place that in the inland parts of South America called Guiana a country as yet undiscovered there were mines and treasures far exceeding any which Cortes or Pizarro had met with Raleigh whose turn of mind was somewhat romantic and extravagant undertook at his own charge the discovery of this wonderful country Having taken the small town of saint Joseph in the Isle of Trinidado where he found no riches he left his ship and sailed up the River Oroonoko in pinnaces but without meeting any thing to answer his expectations On his return he published an account of the country full of the grossest and most palpable lies that were ever attempted to be imposed on the credulity of mankind The same year Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins undertook a more important expedition against the Spanish settlements in America and they carried with them six ships of the queen s and twenty more which either were fitted out at their own charge or were furnished them by private adventurers Sir Thomas Baskerville was appointed commander of the land forces which they carried on board Their first design was to attempt Porto Rico where they knew a rich carrack was at that time stationed but as they had not preserved the requisite secrecy a pinnace having strayed from the fleet was taken by the Spaniards and betrayed the intentions of the English Preparations were made in that island for their reception and the English fleet notwithstanding the brave assault which they made on the enemy was repulsed with loss Hawkins soon after died and Drake pursued his voyage to Nombre di Dios on the Isthmus of Darien where having landed his men he attempted to pass forward to Panama with a view of plundering that place or if he found such a scheme practicable of keeping and fortifying it But he met not with the same facility which had attended his first enterprises in those parts The Spaniards taught by experience had every where fortified the passes and had stationed troops in the woods who so infested the English by continual alarms and skirmishes that they were obliged to return without being able to effect any thing Drake himself from the intemperance of the climate the fatigues of his journey and the vexation of his disappointment was seized with a distemper of which he soon after died Sir Thomas Baskerville took the command of the fleet which was in a weak condition and after having fought a battle near Cuba with a Spanish fleet of which the event was not decisive he returned to England The Spaniards suffered some loss from this enterprise but the English reaped no profit Camden p five hundred eighty four Monson p one hundred sixty seven The bad success of this enterprise in the Indies made the English rather attempt the Spanish dominions in Europe where they heard Philip was making great preparations for a new invasion of England A powerful fleet was equipped at Plymouth consisting of a hundred and seventy vessels seventeen of which were capital ships of war the rest tenders and small vessels twenty ships were added by the Hollanders In this fleet there were computed to be embarked six thousand three hundred and sixty soldiers a thousand volunteers and six thousand seven hundred and seventy two seamen besides the Dutch The land forces were commanded by the earl of Essex the navy by Lord Effingham high admiral Both these commanders had expended great sums of their own in the armament for such was the spirit of Elizabeth s reign Lord Thomas Howard Sir Walter Raleigh Sir Francis Vere Sir George Carew and Sir Coniers Clifford had commands in this expedition and were appointed council to the general and admiral The fleet set sail on the first of June fifteen ninety six and meeting with a fair wind bent its course to Cadiz at which place by sealed orders delivered to all the captains the general rendezvous was appointed They sent before them some armed tenders which intercepted every ship that could carry intelligence to the enemy and they themselves were so fortunate when they came near Cadiz as to take an Irish vessel by which they learned that that port was full of merchant ships of great value and that the Spaniards lived in perfect security without any apprehensions of an enemy This intelligence much encouraged the English fleet and gave them the prospect of a fortunate issue to the enterprise After a fruitless attempt to land at saint Sebastian s on the western side of the Island of Cadiz it was upon deliberation resolved by the council of war to attack the ships and galleys in the bay This attempt was deemed rash and the admiral himself who was cautious in his temper had entertained great scruples with regard to it but Essex strenuously recommended the enterprise and when he found the resolution at last taken he threw his hat into the sea and gave symptoms of the most extravagant joy He felt however a great mortification when Effingham informed him that the queen anxious for his safety and dreading the effects of his youthful ardor had secretly given orders that he should not be permitted to command the van in the attack Camden p five hundred ninety one Monson p one hundred ninety six That duty was performed by Sir Walter Raleigh and Lord Thomas Howard but Essex no sooner came within reach of the enemy than he forgot the promise which the admiral had exacted from him to keep in the midst of the fleet he broke through and pressed forward into the thickest of the fire Emulation for glory avidity of plunder animosity against the Spaniards proved incentives to every one and the enemy was soon obliged to slip anchor and retreat farther into the bay where they ran many of their ships aground Essex then landed his men at the fort of Puntal and immediately marched to the attack of Cadiz which the impetuous valor of the English soon carried sword in hand The generosity of Essex not inferior to his valor made him stop the slaughter and treat his prisoners with the greatest humanity and even affability and kindness The English made rich plunder in the city but missed of a much richer by the resolution which the duke of Medina the Spanish admiral took of setting fire to the ships in order to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy It was computed that the loss which the Spaniards sustained in this enterprise amounted to twenty millions of ducats besides the indignity which that proud and ambitious people suffered from the sacking of one of their chief cities and destroying in their harbor a fleet of such force and value Essex all on fire for glory regarded this great success only as a step to future achievements he insisted on keeping possession of Cadiz and he undertook with four hundred men and three months provisions to defend the place till succors should arrive from England but all the other seamen and soldiers were satisfied with the honor which they had acquired and were impatient to return home in order to secure their plunder Every other proposal of Essex to annoy the enemy met with a like reception his scheme for intercepting the carracks at the Azores for assaulting the Groine for taking saint Andero and saint Sebastian and the English finding it so difficult to drag this impatient warrior from the enemy at last left him on the Spanish coast attended by very few ships He complained much to the queen of their want of spirit in this enterprise nor was she pleased that they had returned without attempting to intercept the Indian fleet but the great success in the enterprise on Cadiz had covered all their miscarriages and that princess though she admired the lofty genius of Essex could not forbear expressing an esteem for the other officers The admiral was created earl of Nottingham and his promotion gave great disgust to Essex Birch s Memoirs vol ii p ninety seven Birch s Memoirs vol ii p one hundred twenty one Camden p five hundred ninety three Sidney Papers vol ii p seventy seven In the preamble of the patent it was said that the new dignity was conferred on him on account of his good services in taking Cadiz and destroying the Spanish ships a merit which Essex pretended to belong solely to himself and he offered to maintain this plea by single combat against the earl of Nottingham or his sons or any of his kindred The achievements in the subsequent year proved not so fortunate but as the Indian fleet very narrowly escaped the English Philip had still reason to see the great hazard and disadvantage of that war in which he was engaged and the superiority which the English by their naval power and their situation had acquired over him The queen having received intelligence that the Spaniards though their fleets were so much shattered and destroyed by the expedition to Cadiz were preparing a squadron at Ferrol and the Groine and were marching troops thither with a view of making a descent in Ireland was resolved to prevent their enterprise and to destroy the shipping in these harbors She prepared a large fleet of a hundred and twenty sail of which seventeen were her own ships forty three were smaller vessels and the rest tenders and victuallers she embarked on board this fleet five thousand new levied soldiers and added a thousand veteran troops whom Sir Francis Vere brought from the Netherlands The earl of Essex commander in chief both of the land and sea forces was at the head of one squadron Lord Thomas Howard was appointed vice admiral of another Sir Walter Raleigh of the third Lord Mouatjoy commanded the land forces under Essex Vere was appointed marshal Sir George Carew lieutenant of the ordnance and Sir Christopher Blount first colonel The earls of Rutland and Southampton the Lords Grey Cromwell and Rich with several other persona of distinction embarked as volunteers Essex declared his resolution either to destroy the new armada which threatened England or to perish in the attempt This powerful fleet set sail from Plymouth but were no sooner out of harbor than they met with a furious storm which shattered and dispersed them and before they could be refitted Essex found that their provisions were so far spent that it would not be safe to carry so numerous an army along with him He dismissed therefore all the soldiers except the thousand veterans under Vere and laying aside all thoughts of attacking Ferrol or the Groine he confined the object of his expedition to the intercepting of the Indian fleet which had at first been considered only as the second enterprise which he was to attempt The Indian fleet in that age by reason of the imperfection of navigation had a stated course as well as season both in their going out and in their return and there were certain islands at which as at fixed stages they always touched and where they took in water and provisions The Azores being one of these places where about this time the fleet was expected Essex bent his course thither and he informed Raleigh that he on his arrival intended to attack Fayal one of these islands By some accident the squadrons were separated and Raleigh arriving first before Fayal thought it more prudent after waiting some time for the general to begin the attack alone lest the inhabitants should by further delay have leisure to make preparations for their defence He succeeded in the enterprise but Essex jealous of Raleigh expressed great displeasure at his conduct and construed it as an intention of robbing the general of the glory which attended that action he cashiered therefore Sidney Bret Berry and others who had concurred in the attempt and would have proceeded to inflict the same punishment on Raleigh himself had not Lord Thomas Howard interposed with his good offices and persuaded Raleigh though high spirited to make submissions to the general Essex who was placable as well as hasty and passionate was soon appeased and both received Raleigh into favor and restored the other officers to then commands This incident however though the quarrel was seemingly accommodated laid the first foundation of that violent animosity which afterwards took place between these two gallant commanders Essex made next a disposition proper for intercepting the Indian galleons and Sir William Monson whose station was the most remote of the fleet having fallen in with them made the signals which had been agreed on That able officer in his Memoirs ascribes Essex s failure when he was so near attaining so mighty an advantage to his want of experience in seamanship and the account which he gives of the errors committed by that nobleman appears very reasonable as well as candid Monson p one hundred seventy three Monson p one hundred seventy four The Spanish fleet finding that the enemy was upon them made all the sail possible to the Terceras and got into the safe and well fortified harbor of Angra before the English fleet could overtake them Essex intercepted only three ships which however were so rich as to repay all the charges of the expedition The causes of the miscarriage in this enterprise were much canvassed in England upon the return of the fleet and though the courtiers took part differently as they affected either Essex or Raleigh the people in general who bore an extreme regard to the gallantry spirit and generosity of ihe former were inclined to justify every circumstance of his conduct The queen who loved the one as much as she esteemed the other maintained a kind of neutrality and endeavored to share her favors with an impartial hand between the parties Sir Robert Cecil second son of Lord Burleigh was a courtier of promising hopes much connected with Raleigh and she made him secretary of state preferably to Sir Thomas Bodley whom Essex recommended for that office But not to disgust Essex she promoted him to the dignity of earl marshal of England an office which had been vacant since the death of the earl of Shrewsbury Essex might perceive from this conduct that she never intended to give him the entire ascendant over his rivals and might thence learn the necessity of moderation and caution But his temper was too high for submission his behavior too open and candid to practise the arts of a court and his free sallies while they rendered him but more amiable in the eyes of good judges gave his enemies many advantages against him The war with Spain though successful having exhausted the queen s exchequer she was obliged to assemble a parliament where Yelverton a lawyer was chosen speaker of the house of commons thirty four See note HH at the end of the volume Elizabeth took care by the mouth of Sir Thomas Egerton lord keeper to inform this assembly of the necessity of a supply She said that the wars formerly waged in Europe had commonly been conducted by the parties without further view than to gain a few towns or at most a province from each other but the object of the present hostilities on the part of Spain was no other than utterly to bereave England of her religion her liberty and her independence that these blessings however she herself had hitherto been able to preserve in spite of the devil the pope and the Spanish tyrant and all the mischievous designs of all her enemies that in this contest she had disbursed a sum triple to all the parliamentary supplies granted her and besides expending her ordinary revenues had been obliged to sell many of the crown lands and that she could not doubt but her subjects in a cause where their own honor and interests were so deeply concerned would willingly contribute to such moderate taxations as should be found necessary for the common defence The parliament granted her three subsidies and six fifteenths the same supply which had been given four years before but which had then appeared so unusual that they had voted it should never afterwards be regarded as a precedent The commons this session ventured to engage in two controversies about forms with the house of peers a prelude to those encroachments which as they assumed more courage they afterwards made upon the prerogatives of the crown They complained that the lords failed in civility to them by receiving their messages sitting with their hats on and that the keeper returned an answer in the same negligent posture but the upper house proved to their full satisfaction that they were not entitled by custom and the usage of parliament to any more respect Some amendments had been made by the lords to a bill sent up by the commons and these amendments were written on parchment and returned with the bill to the commons The lower house took umbrage at the novelty they pretended that these amendments ought to have been written on paper not on parchment and they complained of this innovation to the peers The peers replied that they expected not such a frivolous objection from the gravity of the house and that it was not material whether the amendments were written on parchment or on paper nor whether the paper were white black or brown The commons were offended at this reply which seemed to contain a mockery of them and they complained of it though without obtaining any satisfaction An application was made by way of petition to the queen from the lower house against monopolies an abuse which had risen to an enormous height and they received a gracious though a general answer for which they returned their thankful acknowledgments D Ewes p five hundred twenty five five hundred twenty seven Townsend p seventy nine D Ewes p five hundred thirty nine five hundred forty five hundred eighty five hundred eighty five Townsend p ninety three ninety four ninety five D Ewes p five hundred seventy six five hundred seventy seven D Ewes p five hundred seventy five hundred seventy three But not to give them too much encouragement in such applications she told them in the speech which she delivered at their dissolution that with regard to these patents she hoped that her dutiful and loving subjects would not take away her prerogative which is the chief flower in her garden and the principal and head pearl in her crown and diadem but that they would rather leave these matters to her disposal The commons also took notice this session of some transactions in the court of high commission but not till they had previously obtained permission from her majesty to that purpose D Ewes p five hundred forty seven D Ewes p five hundred fifty seven five hundred fifty eight Elizabeth had reason to foresee that parliamentary supplies would now become more necessary to her than ever and that the chief burden of the war with Spain would thenceforth lie upon England Henry had received an overture for peace with Philip but before he would proceed to a negotiation he gave intelligence of it to his allies the queen and the states that if possible a general pacification might be made by common agreement These two powers sent ambassadors to France in order to remonstrate against peace the queen Sir Robert Cecil and Henry Herbert the states Justin Nassau and John Barnevelt Henry said to these ministers that his early education had been amidst war and danger and he had passed the whole course of his life either in arms or in military preparations that after the proofs which he had given of his alacrity in the field no one could doubt but he would willingly for his part have continued in a course of life to which he was now habituated till the common enemy were reduced to such a condition as no longer to give umbrage either to him or to his allies that no private interests of his own not even those of his people nothing but the most invincible necessity could ever induce him to think of a separate peace with Philip or make him embrace measures not entirely conformable to the wishes of all his confederates that his kingdom torn with the convulsions and civil wars of near half a century required some interval of repose ere it could reach a condition in which it might sustain itself much more support its allies that after the minds of his subjects were composed to tranquillity and accustomed to obedience after his finances were brought into order and after agriculture and the arts were restored France instead of being a burden as at present to her confederates would be able to lend them effectual succor and amply to repay them all the assistance which she had received during her calamities and that if the ambition of Spain would not at present grant them such terms as they should think reasonable he hoped that in a little time he should attain such a situation as would enable him to mediate more effectually and with more decisive authority in their behalf The ambassadors were sensible that these reasons were no feigned and they therefore remonstrated with the less vehemence against the measures which they saw Henry was determined to pursue The states knew that that monarch was interested never to permit their final ruin and having received private assurances that he would still notwithstanding the peace give them assistance both of men and money they were well pleased to remain on terms of amity with him His greatest concern was to give satisfaction to Elizabeth for this breach of treaty He had a cordial esteem for that princess a sympathy of manners and a gratitude for the extraordinary favors which he had received from her during his greatest difficulties and he used every expedient to apologize and atone for that measure which necessity extorted from him But as Spain refused to treat with the Dutch as a free state and Elizabeth would not negotiate without her ally Henry found himself obliged to conclude at Vervins a separate peace by which he recovered possession of all the places seized by Spain during the course of the civil wars and procured to himself leisure to pursue the domestic settlement of his kingdom His capacity for the arts of peace was not inferior to his military talents and in a little time by his frugality order and wise government he raised France from the desolation and misery in which she was involved to a more flourishing condition than she had ever before enjoyed The queen knew that she could also whenever she pleased finish the war on equitable terms and that Philip having no claims upon her would be glad to free himself from an enemy who had foiled him in every contest and who still had it so much in her power to make him feel the weight of her arms Some of her wisest counsellors particularly the treasurer advised her to embrace pacific measures and set before her the advantages of tranquillity security and frugality as more considerable than any success which could attend the greatest victories But this high spirited princess though at first averse to war seemed now to have attained such an ascendant over the enemy that she was unwilling to stop the course of her prosperous fortune She considered that her situation and her past victories had given her entire security against any dangerous invasion and the war must thenceforth be conducted by sudden enterprises and naval expeditions in which she possessed an undoubted superiority that the weak condition of Philip in the Indies opened to her the view of the most durable advantages and the yearly return of his treasure by sea afforded a continual prospect of important though more temporary successes that after his peace with France if she also should consent to an accommodation he would be able to turn his whole force against the revolted provinces of the Netherlands which though they had surprisingly increased their power by commerce and good government were still unable if not supported by their confederates to maintain war against so potent a monarch and that as her defence of that commonwealth was the original ground of the quarrel it was unsafe as well as dishonorable to abandon its cause till she had placed it in a state of greater security These reasons were frequently inculcated on her by the earl of Essex whose passion for glory as well as his military talents made him earnestly desire the continuance of war from which he expected to reap so much advantage and distinction The rivalship between this nobleman and Lord Burleigh made each of them insist the more strenuously on his own counsel but as Essex s person was agreeable to the queen as well as his advice conformable to her inclinations the favorite seemed daily to acquire an ascendant over the minister Had he beer endowed with caution and self command equal to his shining qualities he would have so rivetted himself in the queen s confidence that none of his enemies had ever been able to impeach his credit but his lofty spirit could ill submit to that implicit deference which her temper required and which she had ever been accustomed to receive from all her subjects Being once engaged in a dispute with her about the choice of a governor for Ireland he was so heated in the argument that he entirely forgot the rules both of duty and civility and turned his back upon her in a contemptuous manner Her anger naturally prompt and violent rose at this provocation and she instantly gave him a box on the ear adding a passionate expression suited to his impertinence Instead of recollecting himself and making the submissions due to her sex and station he clapped his hand to his sword and swore that he would not bear such usage were it from Henry VIII himself and he immediately withdrew from court Egerton the chancellor who loved Essex exhorted him to repair his indiscretion by proper acknowledgments and entreated him not to give that triumph to his enemies that affliction to his friends which must ensue from his supporting a contest with his sovereign and deserting the service of his country but Essex was deeply stung with the dishonor which he had received and seemed to think that an insult which might be pardoned in a woman was become a mortal affront when it came from his sovereign If the vilest of all indignities said he is done me does religion enforce me to sue for pardon Doth God require it Is it impiety not to do it Why Cannot princes err Cannot subjects receive wrong Is an earthly power infinite Pardon me my lord I can never subscribe to these principles Let Solomon s fool laugh when he is stricken let those that mean to make their profit of princes show no sense of princes injuries let them acknowledge an infinite absoluteness on earth that do not believe an absolute infiniteness in heaven alluding probably to the character and conduct of Sir Walter Raleigh who lay under the reproach of impiety As for me continued he I have received wrong I feel it my cause is good I know it and whatsoever happens all the powers on earth can never exert more strength and constancy in oppressing than I can show in suffering every thing that can or shall be imposed upon me Your lordship in the beginning of your letter makes me a player and yourself a looker on and me a player of my own game so you may see more than I but give me leave to tell you that since you do but see and I do suffer I must of necessity feel more than you thirty five See note II at the end of the volume This spirited letter was shown by Essex to his friends and they were so imprudent as to disperse copies of it yet notwithstanding this additional provocation the queen s partiality was so prevalent that she reinstated him in his former favor and her kindness to him appeared rather to have acquired new force from this short interval of anger and resentment The death of Burleigh his antagonist which happened about the same time seemed to insure him constant possession of the queen s confidence and nothing indeed but his own indiscretion could thenceforth have shaken his well established credit Lord Burleigh died in an advanced age and by a rare fortune was equally regretted by his sovereign and the people He rad risen gradually from small beginnings by the mere force of merit and though his authority was never entirely absolute or uncontrolled with the queen he was still during the course of near forty years regarded as her principal minister None of her other inclinations or affections could ever overcome her confidence in so useful a counsellor and as he had had the generosity or good sense to pay assiduous court to her during her sister s reign when it was dangerous to appear her friend she thought herself bound in gratitude when she mounted the throne to persevere in her attachments to him He seems not to have possessed any shining talents of address eloquence or imagination and was chiefly distinguished by solidity of understanding probity of manners and indefatigable application in business virtues which if they do not always enable a man to attain high stations do certainly qualify him best for filling them Of all the queen s ministers he alone left a considerable fortune to his posterity a fortune not acquired by rapine or oppression but gained by the regular profits of his offices and preserved by frugality The last act of this able minister was the concluding of a new treaty with the Dutch who after being in some measure deserted by the king of France were glad to preserve the queen s alliance by submitting to any terms which she pleased to require of them The debt which they owed her was now settled at eight hundred thousand pounds of this sum they agreed to pay during the war thirty thousand pounds a year and these payments were to continue till four hundred thousand pounds of the debt should be extinguished They engaged also during the time that England should continue the war with Spain to pay the garrisons of the cautionary towns They stipulated that if Spain should invade England or the Isle of Wight or Jersey or Scilly they should assist her with a body of five thousand foot and five hundred horse and that in case she undertook any naval armament against Spain they should join an equal number of ships to hers By this treaty the queen was eased of an annual charge of a hundred and twenty thousand pounds Rymer vol xvi p three hundred forty Soon after the death of Burleigh the queen who regretted extremely the loss of so wise and faithful a minister was informed of the death of her capital enemy Philip II who after languishing under many infirmities expired in an advanced age at Madrid This haughty prince desirous of an accommodation with his revolted subjects in the Netherlands but disdaining to make in his own name the concessions necessary for that purpose had transferred to his daughter married to Archduke Albert the title to the Low Country provinces but as it was not expected that this princess could have posterity and as the reversion on failure of her issue was still reserved to the crown of Spain the states considered this deed only as the change of a name and they persisted with equal obstinacy in their resistance to the Spanish arms The other powers also of Europe made no distinction between the courts of Brussels and Madrid and the secret opposition of France as well as the avowed efforts of England continued to operate against the progress of Albert as it had done against that of Philip CHAPTER XLIV ELIZABETH Though the dominion of the English over Ireland had been seemingly established above four centuries it may safely be affirmed that their authority had hitherto been little more than nominal The Irish princes and nobles divided among themselves readily paid the exterior marks of obeisance to a power which they were not able to resist but as no durable force was ever kept on foot to retain them in their duty they relapsed still into their former state of independence Too weak to introduce order and obedience among the rude inhabitants the English authority was yet sufficient to check the growth of any enterprising genius among the natives and though it could bestow no true form of civil government it was able to prevent the rise of any such form from the internal combination or policy of the Irish Sir J Davies p five six seven et cetera Most of the English institutions likewise by which that island was governed were to the last degree absurd and such as no state before had ever thought of for preserving dominion over its conquered provinces The English nation all on fire for the project of subduing France a project whose success was the most improbable and would to them have proved the most pernicious neglected all other enterprises to which their situation so strongly invited them and which in time would have brought them an accession of riches grandeur and security The small army which they maintained in Ireland they never supplied regularly with pay and as no money could be levied on the island which possessed none they gave their soldiers the privilege of free quarter upon the natives Rapine and insolence inflamed the hatred which prevailed between the conquerors and the conquered want of security among the Irish introducing despair nourished still more the sloth natural to that uncultivated people But the English carried further their ill judged tyranny instead of inviting the Irish to adopt the more civilized customs of their conquerors they even refused though earnestly solicited to communicate to them the privilege of their laws and every where marked them out as aliens and as enemies Thrown out of the protection of justice the natives could find no security but in force and flying the neighborhood of cities which they could not approach with safety they sheltered themselves in their marshes and forests from the insolence of their inhuman masters Being treated like wild beasts they became such and joining the ardor of revenge to their yet untamed barbarity they grew every day more intractable and more dangerous As the English princes deemed the conquest of the dispersed Irish to be more the object of time and patience than the source of military glory they willingly delegated that office to private adventurers who enlisting soldiers at their own charge reduced provinces of that island which they converted to their own profit Separate jurisdictions and principalities were established by these lordly conquerors the power of peace and war was assumed military law was exercised over the Irish whom they subdued and by degrees over the English by whose assistance they conquered and after their authority had once taken root deeming the English institutions less favorable to barbarous dominion they degenerated into mere Irish and abandoned the garb language manners and laws of their mother country By all this imprudent conduct of England the natives of its dependent state remained still in that abject condition into which the northern and western parts of Europe were sunk before they received civility and slavery from the refined policy and irresistible bravery of Rome Even at the end of the sixteenth century when every Christian nation was cultivating with ardor every civil art of life that island lying in a temperate climate enjoying a fertile soil accessible in its situation possessed of innumerable harbors was still notwithstanding these advantages inhabited by a people whose customs and manners approached nearer those of savages than of barbarians Sir J Davies p one hundred two one hundred three et cetera Sir J Davies p one hundred thirty three one hundred thirty four et cetera See Spenser s Account of Ireland throughout As the rudeness and ignorance of the Irish were extreme they were sunk below the reach of that curiosity and love of novelty by which every other people in Europe had been seized at the beginning of that century and which had engaged them in innovations and religious disputes with which they were still so violently agitated The ancient superstition the practices and observances of their fathers mingled and polluted with many wild opinions still maintained an unshaken empire over them and the example alone of the English was sufficient to render the reformation odious to the prejudiced and discontented Irish The old opposition of manners laws and interest was now inflamed by religious antipathy and the subduing and civilizing of that country seemed to become every day more difficult and more impracticable The animosity against the English was carried so far by the Irish that in an insurrection raised by two sons of the earl of Clanricarde they put to the sword all the inhabitants of the town of Athenry though Irish because they began to conform themselves to English customs and had embraced a more civilized form of life than had been practised by their ancestors The usual revenue of Ireland amounted only to six thousand pounds a year the queen though with much repining commonly added twenty thousand more which she remitted from England and with this small revenue a body of a thousand men was supported which on extraordinary emergencies was augmented to two thousand No wonder that a force so disproportioned to the object instead of subduing a mutinous kingdom served rather to provoke the natives and to excite those frequent insurrections which still further inflamed the animosity between the two nations and increased the disorders to which the Irish were naturally subject In fifteen sixty Shan O Neale or the great O Neale as the Irish called him because head of that potent clan raised a rebellion in Ulster but after some skirmishes he

eighty five three hundred ninety one three hundred five This impunity tempted him to undertake a new insurrection in fifteen sixty seven but being pushed by Sir Henry Sidney lord deputy he retreated into Clandeboy and rather than submit to the English he put himself into the hands of some Scottish islanders who commonly infested those parts by their incursions The Scots who retained a quarrel against him on account of former injuries violated the laws of hospitality and murdered him at a festival to which they had invited him He was a man equally noted for his pride his violence his debaucheries and his hatred of the English nation He is said to have put some of his followers to death because they endeavored to introduce the use of bread after the English fashion Though so violent an enemy to luxury he was extremely addicted to riot and was accustomed after his intemperance had thrown him into a fever to plunge his body into mire that he might allay the flame which he had raised by former excesses Such was the life led by this haughty barbarian who scorned the title of the earl of Tyrone which Elizabeth intended to have restored to him and who assumed the rank and appellation of king of Ulster He used also to say that though the queen was his sovereign lady he never made peace with her but at her seeking Sir Henry Sidney was one of the wisest and most active governors that Ireland had enjoyed for several reigns and he possessed his authority eleven years during which he struggled with many difficulties and made some progress in repressing those disorders which had become inveterate among the people The earl of Desmond in fifteen sixty nine gave him disturbance from the hereditary animosity which prevailed between that nobleman and the earl of Ormond descended from the only family established in Ireland that had steadily maintained its loyalty to the English crown v The earl of Thomond in fifteen seventy attempted a rebellion in Connaught but was obliged to fly into France before his designs were ripe for execution Stukely another fugitive found such credit with the pope Gregory XIII that he flattered that pontiff with the prospect of making his nephew Buon Compagno king of Ireland and as if this project had already taken effect he accepted the title of marquis of Leinster from the new sovereign v He passed next into Spain and after having received much encouragement and great rewards from Philip who intended to employ him as an instrument in disturbing Elizabeth he was found to possess too little interest for executing those high promises which he had made to that monarch Camden p four hundred nine Camden p four hundred nine Cox p three hundred twenty four Camden p three hundred twenty one Cox p three hundred fifty v Camden p four hundred twenty four v Camden p four hundred thirty Cox p three hundred fifty four He retired into Portugal and following the fortunes of Don Sebastian he perished with that gallant prince in his bold but unfortunate expedition against the Moors Lord Gray after some interval succeeded to the government of Ireland and in fifteen seventy nine suppressed a new rebellion of the earl of Desmond though supported by a body of Spaniards and Italians The rebellion of the Bourks followed a few years after occasioned by the strict and equitable administration of Sir Richard Bingham governor of Connaught who endeavored to repress the tyranny of the chieftains over their vassals The queen finding Ireland so burdensome to her tried several expediants for reducing it to a state of greater order and submission She encouraged the earl of Essex father to that nobleman who was afterwards her favorite to attempt the subduing and planting of Clandeboy Ferny and other territories part of some late forfeitures but that enterprise proved unfortunate and Essex died of a distemper occasioned as is supposed by the vexation which he had conceived from his disappointments A university was founded in Dublin with a view of introducing arts and learning into that kingdom and civilizing the uncultivated manners of the inhabitants But the most unhappy expedient employed in the government of Ireland was that made use of in fifteen eighty five by Sir John Perrot at that time lord deputy he put arms into the hands of the Irish inhabitants of Ulster in order to enable them without the assistance of the government to repress the incursions of the Scottish islanders by which these parts were much infested At the same time the invitations of Philip joined to their zeal for the Catholic religion engaged many of the gentry to serve in the Low Country wars and thus Ireland being provided with officers and soldiers with discipline and arms became formidable to the English and was thenceforth able to maintain a more regular war against her ancient masters Stowe p seven hundred twenty Camden p five hundred sixty six Nanton s Fragmenta Regalia p two hundred three Hugh O Neale nephew to Shan O Neale had been raised by the queen to the dignity of earl of Tyrone but having murdered his cousin son of that rebel and being acknowledged head of his clan he preferred the pride of barbarous license and dominion to the pleasures of opulence and tranquillity and he fomented all those disorders by which he hoped to weaken or overturn the English government He was noted for the vices of perfidy and cruelty so common among uncultivated nations and was also eminent for courage a virtue which their disorderly course of life requires and which notwithstanding being less supported by the principle of honor is commonly more precarious among them than among a civilized people Tyrone actuated by this spirit secretly fomented the discontents of the Maguires O Donnels O Rourks Macmahons and other rebels yet trusting to the influence of his deceitful oaths and professions he put himself into the hands of Sir William Russel who in the year fifteen ninety four was sent over deputy to Ireland Contrary to the advice and protestation of Sir Henry Bagnal marshal of the army he was dismissed and returning to his own country he embraced the resolution of raising an open rebellion and of relying no longer on the lenity or inexperience of the English government He entered into a correspondence with Spain he procured thence a supply of arms and ammunition and having united all the Irish chieftains in a dependence upon himself he began to be regarded as a formidable enemy The native Irish were so poor that their country afforded few other commodities than cattle and oatmeal which were easily concealed or driven away on the approach of the enemy and as Elizabeth was averse to the expense requisite for supporting her armies the English found much difficulty in pushing their advantages and in pursuing the rebels into the bogs woods and other fastnesses to which they retreated These motives rendered Sir John Norris who commanded the English army the more willing to hearken to any proposals of truce or accommodation made him by Tyrone and after the war was spun out by these artifices for some years that gallant Englishman finding that he had been deceived by treacherous promises and that he had performed nothing worthy of his ancient reputation was seized with a languishing distemper and died of vexation and discontent Sir Henry Bagnal who succeeded him in the command was still more unfortunate As he advanced to relieve the fort of Black Water besieged by the rebels he was surrounded in disadvantageous ground his soldiers discouraged by part of their powders accidentally taking fire were put to flight and though the pursuit was stopped by Montacute who commanded the English horse fifteen hundred men together with the general himself were left dead upon the spot This victory so unusual to the Irish roused their courage supplied them with arms and ammunition and raised the reputation of Tyrone who assumed the character of the deliverer of his country and patron of Irish liberty The English council were now sensible that the rebellion of Ireland was come to a dangerous head and that the former temporizing arts of granting truces and pacifications to the rebels and of allowing them to purchase pardons by resigning part of the plunder acquired during their insurrection served only to encourage the spirit of mutiny and disorder among them It was therefore resolved to push the war by more vigorous measures and the queen cast her eye on Charles Blount Lord Mountjoy as a man who though hitherto less accustomed to arms than to books and literature was endowed she thought with talents equal to the undertaking But the young earl of Essex ambitious of fame and desirous of obtaining this government for himself opposed the choice of Mountjoy and represented the necessity of appointing for that important employment some person more experienced in war than this nobleman more practised in business and of higher quality and reputation By this description he was understood to mean himself and no sooner was his desire known than his enemies even more zealously than his friends conspired to gratify his wishes Many of his friends thought that he never ought to consent except for a short time to accept of any employment which must remove him from court and prevent him from cultivating that personal inclination which the queen so visibly bore him Cox p four hundred fifteen Bacon vol iv p five hundred twelve Cabala p seventy nine His enemies hoped that if by his absence she had once leisure to forget the charms of his person and conversation his impatient and lofty demeanor would soon disgust a princess who usually exacted such profound submission and implicit obedience from all her servants But Essex was incapable of entering into such cautious views and even Elizabeth who was extremely desirous of subduing the Irish rebels and who was much prepossessed in favor of Essex s genius readily agreed to appoint him governor of Ireland by the title of lord lieutenant The more to encourage him in his undertaking she granted him by his patent more extensive authority had ever before been conferred on any lieutenant the power of carrying on or finishing the war as he pleased of pardoning the rebels and of filling all the most considerable employments of the kingdom And to insure him of success she levied a numerous army of sixteen thousand foot and thirteen hundred horse which she afterwards augmented to twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse a force which it was apprehended would be able in one campaign to overwhelm the rebels and make an entire conquest of Ireland Nor did Essex s enemies the earl of Nottingham Sir Robert Cecil Sir Walter Raleigh and Lord Cobham throw any obstacles in the way of these preparations but hoped that the higher the queen s expectations of success were raised the more difficult it would be for the event to correspond to them In a like view they rather seconded than opposed those exalted encomiums which Essex s numerous and sanguine friends dispersed of his high genius of his elegant endowments his heroic courage his unbounded generosity and his noble birth nor were they displeased to observe that passionate fondness which the people every where expressed for this nobleman These artful politicians had studied his character and finding that his open and undaunted spirit if taught temper and reserve from opposition must become invincible they resolved rather to give full breath to those sails which were already too much expanded and to push him upon dangers of which he seemed to make such small account And the better to make advantage of his indiscretions spies were set upon all his actions and even expressions and his vehement spirit which while he was in the midst of the court and environed by his rivals was unacquainted with disguise could not fail after he thought himself surrounded by none but friends to give a pretence for malignant suspicions and constructions Rymer tom xvi p three hundred sixty six Camden Osborne p three hundred seventy one Essex left London in the month of March attended with the acclamations of the populace and what did him more honor accompanied by a numerous train of nobility and gentry who from affection to his person had attached themselves to his fortunes and sought fame and military experience under so renowned a commander The first act of authority which he exercised after his arrival in Ireland was an indiscretion but of the generous kind and in both these respects suitable to his character He appointed his intimate friend the earl of Southampton general of the horse a nobleman who had incurred the queen s displeasure by secretly marrying without her consent and whom she had therefore enjoined Essex not to employ in any command under him She no sooner heard of this instance of disobedience than she reprimanded him and ordered him to recall his commission to Southampton But Essex who had imagined that some reasons which he opposed to her first injunctions had satisfied her had the imprudence to remonstrate against these second orders and it was not till she reiterated her commands that he could be prevailed on to displace his friend Essex on his landing at Dublin deliberated with the Irish council concerning the proper methods of carrying on the war against the rebels and here he was guilty of a capital error which was the ruin of his enterprise He had always while in England blamed the conduct of former commanders who artfully protracted the war who harassed their troops in small enterprises and who by agreeing to truces and temporary pacifications with the rebels had given them leisure to recruit their broken forces In conformity to these views he had ever insisted upon leading his forces immediately into Ulster against Tyrone the chief enemy and his instructions had been drawn agreeably to these his declared resolutions But the Irish counsellors persuaded him that the season was too early for the enterprise and that as the morasses in which the northern Irish usually sheltered themselves would not as yet be passable to the English forces it would be better to employ the present time in an expedition into Munster Their secret reason for this advice was that many of them possessed estates in that province and were desirous to have the enemy dislodged from their neighborhood but the same selfish spirit which had induced them to give this counsel made them soon after disown it when they found the bad consequences with which it was attended Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred twenty one four hundred fifty one Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred thirty one Bacon vol iv five hundred twelve Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred forty eight Winwood vol i p one hundred forty Essex obliged all the rebels of Munster either to submit or to fly into the neighboring provinces but as the Irish from the greatness of the queen s preparations had concluded that she intended to reduce them to total subjection or even utterly to exterminate them they considered their defence as a common cause and the English forces were no sooner withdrawn than the inhabitants of Munster relapsed into rebellion and renewed their confederacy with their other countrymen The army meanwhile by the fatigue of long and tedious marches and by the influence of the climate was become sickly and on its return to Dublin about the middle of July was surprisingly diminished in number The courage of the soldiers was even much abated for though they had prevailed in some lesser enterprises against Lord Cahir and others yet had they sometimes met with more stout resistance than they expected from the Irish whom they were wont to despise and as they were raw troops and unexperienced a considerable body of them had been put to flight at the Glins by an inferior number of the enemy Essex was so enraged at this misbehavior that he cashiered all the officers and decimated the private men But this act of seventy though necessary had intimidated the soldiers and increased their aversion to the service The queen was extremely disgusted when she heard that so considerable a part of the season was consumed in these frivolous enterprises and was still more surprised that Essex persevered in the same practice which he had so much condemned in others and which he knew to be so much contrary to her purpose and intention That nobleman in order to give his troops leisure to recruit from their sickness and fatigue left the main army in quarters and marched with a small body of fifteen hundred men into the county of Ophelie against the O Connors and O Mores whom he forced to a submission but on his return to Dublin he found the army so much diminished that he wrote to the English council an account of its condition and informed them that if he did not immediately receive a reenforcement of two thousand men it would be impossible for him this season to attempt any thing against Tyrone That there might be no pretence for further inactivity the queen immediately sent over the number demanded and Essex began at last to assemble his forces for the expedition into Ulster Cox p four hundred twenty one Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred thirty Cox p four hundred twenty one The army was so averse to this enterprise and so terrified with the reputation of Tyrone that many of them counterfeited sickness many of them deserted and Essex found that after leaving the necessary garrisons he could scarcely lead four thousand men against the rebels He marched however with this small army but was soon sensible that in so advanced a season it would be impossible for him to effect any thing against an enemy who though superior in number was determined to avoid every decisive action He hearkened therefore to a message sent him by Tyrone who desired a conference and a place near the two camps was appointed for that purpose The generals met without any of their attendants and a river ran between them into which Tyrone entered to the depth of his saddle but Essex stood on the opposite bank After half an hour s conference where Tyrone behaved with great submission to the lord lieutenant a cessation of arms was concluded to the first of May renewable from six weeks to six weeks but which might be broken off by either party upon a fortnight s warning Essex also received from Tyrone proposals for a peace in which that rebel had inserted many unreasonable and exorbitant conditions and there appeared afterwards some reason to suspect that he had here commenced a very unjustifiable correspondence with the enemy Sydney s Letters vol ii p one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen Sydney s Letters vol ii p one hundred twenty five Winwood vol i p three hundred seven State Trials Bacon vol iv p five hundred fourteen five hundred eighty five five hundred thirty seven So unexpected an issue of an enterprise the greatest and most expensive that Elizabeth had ever undertaken provoked her extremely against Essex and this disgust was much augmented by other circumstances of that nobleman s conduct He wrote many letters to the queen and council full of peevish and impatient expressions complaining of his enemies lamenting that their calumnies should be believed against him and discovering symptoms of a mind equally haughty and discontented She took care to inform him of her dissatisfaction but commanded him to remain in Ireland till further orders Essex heard at once of Elizabeth s anger and of the promotion of his enemy Sir Robert Cecil to the office of master of the wards an office to which he himself aspired and dreading that if he remained any longer absent the queen would be totally alienated from him he hastily embraced a resolution which he knew had once succeeded with the earl of Leicester the former favorite of Elizabeth Leicester being informed while in the Low Countries that his mistress was extremely displeased with his conduct disobeyed her orders by coming over to England and having pacified her by his presence by his apologies and by his flattery and insinuation disappointed all the expectations of his enemies Essex therefore weighing more the similarity of circumstances than the difference of character between himself and Leicester immediately set out for England and making speedy journeys he arrived at court before any one was in the least apprised of his intentions Though besmeared with dirt and sweat he hastened upstairs to the presence chamber thence to the privy chamber nor stopped till he was in the queen s bed chamber who was newly risen and was sitting with her hair about her face He threw himself on his knees kissed her hand and had some private conference with her where he was so graciously received that on his departure he was heard to express great satisfaction and to thank God that though he had suffered much trouble and many storms abroad he found a sweet calm at home Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred fifty three Winwood vol i p one hundred eighteen Sidney s Letters vol ii p one hundred twenty seven But this placability of Elizabeth was merely the result of her surprise and of the momentary satisfaction which she felt on the sudden and unexpected appearance of her favorite after she had leisure for recollection all his faults recurred to her and she thought it necessary by some severe discipline to subdue that haughty imperious spirit who presuming on her partiality had pretended to domineer in her councils to engross all her favor and to act in the most important affairs without regard to her orders and instructions When Essex waited on her in the afternoon he found her extremely altered in her carriage towards him she ordered him to be confined to his chamber to be twice examined by the council and though his answers were calm and submissive she committed him to the custody of Lord Keeper Egerton and held him sequestered from all company even from that of his countess nor was so much as the intercourse of letters permitted between them Essex dropped many expressions of humiliation and sorrow none of resentment he professed an entire submission to the queen s will declared his intention of retiring into the country and of leading thenceforth a private life remote from courts and business but though he affected to be so entirely cured of his aspiring ambition the vexation of this disappointment and of the triumph gained by his enemies preyed upon his haughty spirit and he fell into a distemper which seemed to put his life in danger The queen had always declared to all the world and even to the earl himself that the purpose of her severity was to correct not to ruin him and when she heard of his sickness she was not a little alarmed with his situation She ordered eight physicians of the best reputation and experience to consult of his case and being informed that the issue was much to be apprehended she sent doctor James to him with some broth and desired that physician to deliver him a message which she probably deemed of still greater virtue that if she thought such a step consistent with her honor she would herself pay him a visit The bystanders who carefully observed her countenance remarked that in pronouncing these words her eyes were suffused with tears When these symptoms of the queen s returning affection towards Essex were known they gave a sensible alarm to the faction which had declared their opposition to him Sir Walter Raleigh in particular the most violent as well as the most ambitious of his enemies was so affected with the appearance of this sudden revolution that he was seized with sickness in his turn and the queen was obliged to apply the same salve to his wound and to send him a favorable message expressing her desire of his recovery The medicine which the queen administered to these aspiring rivals was successful with both and Essex being now allowed the company of his countess and having entertained more promising hopes of his future fortunes was so much restored in his health as to be thought past danger A belief was instilled into Elizabeth that his distemper had been entirely counterfeit in order to move her compassion and she relapsed into her former rigor against him He wrote her a letter and sent her a rich present on new year s day as was usual with the courtiers at that time she read the letter but rejected the present v After some interval however of severity she allowed him to retire to his own house and though he remained still under custody and was sequestered from all company he was so grateful for this mark of lenity that he sent her a letter of thanks on the occasion

that blessed day And in expectation of it all my afflictions of body and mind are humbly patiently and cheerfully borne by me The countess of Essex daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham possessed as well as her husband a refined taste in literature and the chief consolation which Essex enjoyed during this period of anxiety and expectation consisted in her company and in reading with her those instructive and entertaining authors which even during the time of his greatest prosperity he had never entirely neglected There were several incidents which kept alive the queen s anger against Essex Every account which she received from Ireland convinced her more and more of his misconduct in that government and of the insignificant purposes to which he had employed so much force and treasure Tyrone so far from being quelled had thought proper in less than three months to break the truce and joining with O Donnel and other rebels had overrun almost the whole kingdom He boasted that he was certain of receiving a supply of men money and arms from Spain he pretended to be champion of the Catholic religion and he openly exulted in the present of a phoenix plume which the pope Clement VIII in order to encourage him in the prosecution of so good a cause had consecrated and had conferred upon him Birch s Memoirs p four hundred forty four Camden p six hundred seventeen The queen that she might check his progress returned to her former intention of appointing Mountjoy lord deputy and though that nobleman who was an intimate friend of Essex and desired his return to the government of Ireland did at first very earnestly excuse himself on account of his bad state of health she obliged him to accept of the employment Mountjoy found the island almost in a desperate condition but being a man of capacity and vigor he was so little discouraged that he immediately advanced against Tyrone in Ulster He penetrated into the heart of that country the chief seat of the rebels he fortified Derry and Mount Norris in order to bridle the Irish he chased them from the field and obliged them to take shelter in the woods and morasses he employed with equal success Sir George Carew in Munster and by these promising enterprises he gave new life to the queen s authority in that island As the comparison of Mountjoy s administration with that of Essex contributed to alienate Elizabeth from her favorite she received additional disgust from the partiality of the people who prepossessed with an extravagant idea of Essex s merit complained of the injustice done him by his removal from court and by his confinement Libels were secretly dispersed against Cecil and Raleigh and all his enemies and his popularity which was always great seemed rather to be increased than diminished by his misfortunes Elizabeth in order to justify to the public her conduct with regard to him had often expressed her intentions of having him tried in the star chamber for his offences but her tenderness for him prevailed at last over her severity and she was contented to have him only examined by the privy council The attorney general Coke opened the cause against him and treated him with the cruelty and insolence which that great lawyer usually exercised against the unfortunate He displayed in the strongest colors all the faults committed by Essex in his administration of Ireland his making Southampton general of the horse contrary to the queen s injunctions his deserting the enterprise against Tyrone and marching to Leinster and Munster his conferring knighthood on too many persons his secret conference with Tyrone and his sudden return from Ireland in contempt of her majesty s commands He also exaggerated the indignity of the conditions which Tyrone had been allowed to propose odious and abominable conditions said he a public toleration of an idolatrous religion pardon for himself and every traitor in Ireland and full restitution of lands and possessions to all of them The solicitor general Fleming insisted upon the wretched situation in which the earl had left that kingdom and Francis son of Sir Nicholas Bacon who had been lord keeper in the beginning of the present reign closed the charge with displaying the undutiful expressions contained in some letters written by the earl Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred forty nine Essex when he came to plead in his own defence renounced with great submission and humility all pretensions to an apology and declared his resolution never on this or any other occasion to have any contest with his sovereign He said that having severed himself from the world and abjured all sentiments of ambition he had no scruple to confess every failing or error into which his youth folly or manifold infirmities might have betrayed him that his inward sorrow for his offences against her majesty was so profound that it exceeded all his outward crosses and afflictions nor had he any scruple of submitting to a public confession of whatever she had been pleased to impute to him that in his acknowledgments he retained only one reserve which he never would relinquish but with his life the assertion of a loyal and unpolluted heart of an unfeigned affection of an earnest desire ever to perform to her majesty the best service which his pool abilities would permit and that if this sentiment were allowed by the council he willingly acquiesced in any condemnation or sentence which they could pronounce against him This submission was uttered with so much eloquence and in so pathetic a manner that it drew tears from many of the audience All the privy counsellors in giving their judgment made no scruple of doing the earl justice with regard to the loyalty of his intentions Even Cecil whom he believed his capital enemy treated him with regard and humanity And the sentence pronounced by the lord keeper to which the council assented was in these words If this cause said he had been heard in the star chamber my sentence must have been for as great a fine as ever was set upon any man s head in that court together with perpetual confinement in that prison which belongeth to a man of his quality the Tower But since we are now in another place and in a course of favor my censure is that the earl of Essex is not to execute the office of a counsellor nor that of earl marshal of England nor of master of the ordnance and to return to his own house there to continue a prisoner till it shall please her majesty to release this and all the rest of his sentence The earl of Cumberland made a slight opposition to this sentence and said that if he thought it would stand he would have required a little more time to deliberate that he deemed it somewhat severe and that any commander in chief might easily incur a like penalty

But however added he in confidence of her majesty s mercy I agree with the rest The earl of Worcester delivered his opinion in a couple of Latin verses importing that where the gods are offended even misfortunes ought to be imputed as crimes and that accident is no excuse for transgressions against the Divinity Bacon so much distinguished afterwards by his high offices and still more by his profound genius for the sciences was nearly allied to the Cecil family being nephew to Lord Burleigh and cousin german to the secretary but notwithstanding his extraordinary talents he had met with so little protection from his powerful relations that he had not yet obtained any preferment in the law which was his profession But Essex who could distinguish merit and who passionately loved it had entered into an intimate friendship with Bacon had zealously attempted though without success to procure him the office of solicitor general and in order to comfort his friend under the disappointment had conferred on him a present of land to the value of eighteen hundred pounds The public could ill excuse Bacon s appearance before the council against so munificent a benefactor though he acted in obedience to the queen s commands but she was so well pleased with his behavior that she imposed on him a new task of drawing a narrative of that day s proceedings in order to satisfy the public of the justice and lenity of her conduct Bacon who wanted firmness of character more than humanity gave to the whole transaction the most favorable turn for Essex and in particular painted out in elaborate expression the dutiful submission which that nobleman discovered in the defence that he made for his conduct When he read the paper to her she smiled at that passage and observed to Bacon that old love she saw could not easily be forgotten He replied that he hoped she meant that of herself All the world indeed expected that Essex would soon be reinstated in his former credit perhaps as is usual in reconcilements founded on inclination would acquire an additional ascendant over the queen and after all his disgraces would again appear more a favorite than ever Cabala p seventy eight Cabala p eighty three Winwood vol i p two hundred fifty four Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred sixty two They were confirmed in this hope when they saw that though he was still prohibited from appearing at court he was continued in his office of master of horse and was restored to his liberty and that all his friends had access to him Essex himself seemed determined to persevere in that conduct which had hitherto been so successful and which the queen by all this discipline had endeavored to render habitual to him he wrote to her that he kissed her majesty s hands and the rod with which she had corrected him but that he could never recover his wonted cheerfulness till she deigned to admit him to that presence which had ever been the chief source of his happiness and enjoyment and that he had now resolved to make amends for his past errors to retire into a country solitude and say with Nebucidnezzar Let my dwelling be with the beasts of the field let me eat grass as an ox and be wet with the dew of heaven till it shall please the queen to restore me to my understanding The queen was much pleased with these sentiments and replied that she heartily wished his actions might correspond with his expressions that he had tried her patience a long time and it was but fitting she should now make some experiment of his submission that her father would never have pardoned so much obstinacy but that if the furnace of affliction produced such good effects she should ever after have the better opinion of her chemistry The earl of Essex possessed a monopoly of sweet wines and as his patent was near expiring he patiently expected that the queen would renew it and he considered this event as the critical circumstance of his life which would determine whether he could ever hope to be reinstated in credit and authority But Elizabeth though gracious in her deportment was of a temper somewhat haughty and severe and being continually surrounded with Essex s enemies means were found to persuade her that his lofty spirit was not yet sufficiently subdued and that he must undergo this further trial before he could again be safely received into favor She therefore denied his request and even added in a contemptuous style that an ungovernable beast must be stinted in his provender Camden p six hundred twenty eight Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred seventy two Camden p six hundred twenty eight This rigor pushed one step too far proved the final ruin of this young nobleman and was the source of infinite sorrow and vexation to the queen herself Essex who had with great difficulty so long subdued his proud spirit and whose patience was now exhausted imagining that the queen was entirely inexorable burst at once all restraints of submission and of prudence and determined to seek relief by proceeding to the utmost extremities against his enemies Even during his greatest favor he had ever been accustomed to carry matters with a high hand towards his sovereign and as this practice gratified his own temper and was sometimes successful he had imprudently imagined that it was the only proper method of managing her but being now reduced to despair he gave entire reins to his violent disposition and threw off all appearance of duty and respect Intoxicated with the public favor which he already possessed he practised anew every art of popularity and endeavored to increase the general good will by a hospitable manner of life little suited to his situation and circumstances His former employments had given him great connections with men of the military profession and he now entertained by additional caresses and civilities a friendship with all desperate adventurers whose attachment he hoped might in his present views prove serviceable to him He secretly courted the confidence of the Catholics but his chief trust lay in the Puritans whom he openly caressed and whose manners he seemed to have entirely adopted He engaged the most celebrated preachers of that sect to resort to Essex House he had daily prayers and sermons in his family and he invited all the zealots in London to attend those pious exercises Such was the disposition now beginning to prevail among the English that instead of feasting and public spectacles the methods anciently practised to gain the populace nothing so effectually ingratiated an ambitious leader with the public as these fanatical entertainments And as the Puritanical preachers frequently inculcated in their sermons the doctrine of resistance to the civil magistrate they prepared the minds of their hearers for those seditious projects which Essex was secretly meditating Cabala p seventy nine Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred sixty three Camden p six hundred thirty But the greatest imprudence of this nobleman proceeded from the openness of his temper by which he was ill qualified to succeed in such difficult and dangerous enterprises He indulged himself in great liberties of speech and was even heard to say of the queen that she was now grown an old woman and was become as crooked in her mind as in her body Some court ladies whose favors Essex had formerly neglected carried her these stories and incensed her to a high degree against him Elizabeth was ever remarkably jealous on this head and though she was now approaching to her seventieth year she allowed her courtiers and even foreign ambassadors to compliment her upon her beauty nor had all her good sense been able to cure her of this preposterous vanity thirty seven Camden p six hundred

vol ii p one hundred seventy one See note KK at the end of the volume There was also an expedient employed by Essex which if possible was more provoking to the queen than those sarcasms on her age and deformity and that was his secret applications to the king of Scots her heir and successor That prince had this year very narrowly escaped a dangerous though ill formed conspiracy of the earl of Gowry and even his deliverance was attended with this disagreeable circumstance that the obstinate ecclesiastics persisted in spite of the most incontestable evidence to maintain to his face that there had been no such conspiracy James harassed with his turbulent and factious subjects cast a wishful eye to the succession of England and in proportion as the queen advanced in years his desire increased of mounting that throne on which besides acquiring a great addition of power and splendor he hoped to govern a people so much more tractable and submissive He negotiated with all the courts of Europe in order to insure himself friends and partisans he even neglected not the court of Rome and that of Spain and though he engaged himself in no positive promise he flattered the Catholics with hopes that in the event of his succession they might expect some more liberty than was at present indulged them Elizabeth was the only sovereign in Europe to whom he never dared to mention his right of succession he knew that though her advanced age might now invite her to think of fixing an heir to the crown she never could bear the prospect of her own death without horror and was determined still to retain him and all other competitors in an entire dependence upon her Essex was descended by females from the royal family and some of his sanguine partisans had been so imprudent as to mention his name among those of other pretenders to the crown but the earl took care by means of Henry Lee whom he secretly sent into Scotland to assure James that so far from entertaining such ambitious views he was determined to use every expedient for extorting an immediate declaration in favor of that monarch s right of succession James willingly hearkened to this proposal but did not approve of the violent methods which Essex intended to employ Essex had communicated his scheme to Mountjoy deputy of Ireland and as no man ever commanded more the cordial affection and attachment of his friends he had even engaged a person of that virtue and prudence to entertain thoughts of bringing over part of his army into England and of forcing the queen to declare the king of Scots her successor And such was Essex s impatient ardor that though James declined this dangerous expedient he still endeavored to persuade Mountjoy not to desist from the project but the deputy who thought that such violence though it might be prudent and even justifiable when supported by a sovereign prince next heir to the crown would be rash and criminal if attempted by subjects absolutely refused his concurrence The correspondence however between Essex and the court of Scotland was still conducted with great secrecy and cordiality and that nobleman besides conciliating the favor of James represented all his own adversaries as enemies to that prince s succession and as men entirely devoted to the interests of Spain and partisans of the chimerical title of the infanta Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred seventy one The infanta and the archduke Albert had made some advances to the queen for peace and Boulogne as a neutral town was chosen for the place of conference Sir Henry Nevil the English resident in France Herbert Edmondes and Beale were sent thither as ambassadors from England and negotiated with Zuniga Carillo Richetrdot and Verheiken ministers of Spain and the archduke but the conferences were soon broken off by disputes with regard to the ceremonial Among the European states England had ever been allowed the precedency above Castile Arragon Portugal and the other kingdoms of which the Spanish monarchy was composed and Elizabeth insisted that this ancient right was not lost on account of the junction of these states and that that monarchy in its present situation though it surpassed the English in extent as well as in power could not be compared with it in point of antiquity the only durable and regular foundation of precedency among kingdoms as well as noble families That she might show however a pacific disposition she was content to yield to an equality but the Spanish ministers as their nation had always disputed precedency even with France to which England yielded would proceed no further in the conference till their superiority of rank were acknowledged During the preparations for this abortive negotiation the earl of Nottingham the admiral Lord Buckhurst treasurer and Secretary Cecil had discovered their inclination to peace but as the English nation flushed with success and sanguine in their hopes of plunder and conquest were in general averse to that measure it was easy for a person so popular as Essex to infuse into the multitude an opinion that these ministers had sacrificed the interests of their country to Spain and would even make no scruple of receiving a sovereign from that hostile nation Winwood s Memorials vol i p one hundred eighty six two hundred twenty six But Essex not content with these arts for decrying his adversaries proceeded to concert more violent methods of ruining them chiefly instigated by Cuffe his secretary a man of a bold and arrogant spirit who had acquired a great ascendant over his patron A select council of malecontents was formed who commonly met at Drury House and were composed of Sir Charles Davers to whom the house belonged the earl of Southampton Sir Ferdinando Gorges Sir Christopher Blount Sir John Davies and John Littleton and Essex who boasted that he had a hundred and twenty barons knights and gentlemen of note at his devotion and who trusted still more to his authority with the populace communicated to his associates those secret designs with which his confidence in so powerful a party had inspired him Among other criminal projects the result of blind rage and despair he deliberated with them concerning the method of taking arms and asked their opinion whether he had best begin with seizing the palace or the Tower or set out with making himself master at once of both places The first enterprise being preferred a method was concerted for executing it It was agreed that Sir Christopher Blount with a choice detachment should possess himself of the palace gates that Davies should seize the hall Davers the guard chamber and presence chamber and that Essex should rush in from the Meuse attended by a body of his partisans should entreat the queen with all demonstrations of humility to remove his enemies should oblige her to assemble a parliament and should with common consent settle a new plan of government Camden p six hundred thirty Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred sixty four State Trials Bacon vol iv p five hundred forty two five hundred forty three While these desperate projects were in agitation many reasons of suspicion were carried to the queen and she sent Robert Sacville son of the treasurer to Essex House on pretence of a visit but in reality with a view of discovering whether there were in that place any unusual concourse of people or any extraordinary preparations which might threaten an insurrection Soon after Essex received a summons to attend the council which met at the treasurer s house and while he was musing on this circumstance and comparing it with the late unexpected visit from Sacville a private note was conveyed to him by which he was warned to provide for his own safety He concluded that all his conspiracy was discovered at least suspected and that the easiest punishment which he had reason to apprehend was a new and more severe confinement he therefore excused himself to the council on pretence of an indisposition and he immediately despatched messages to his more intimate confederates requesting their advice and assistance in the present critical situation of his affairs They deliberated whether they should abandon all their projects and fly the kingdom or instantly seize the palace with the force which they could assemble or rely upon the affections of the citizens who were generally known to have a great attachment to the earl Essex declared against the first expedient and professed himself determined to undergo any fate rather than submit to live the life of a fugitive To seize the palace seemed impracticable without more preparations especially as the queen seemed now aware of their projects and as they heard had used the precaution of doubling her ordinary guards There remained therefore no expedient but that of betaking themselves to the city and while the prudence and feasibility of this resolution was under debate a person arrived who as if he had received a commission for the purpose gave them assurance of the affections of the Londoners and affirmed that they might securely rest any project on that foundation The popularity of Essex had chiefly buoyed him up in all his vain undertakings and he fondly imagined that with no other assistance than the good will of the multitude he might overturn Elizabeth s government confirmed by time revered for wisdom supported by vigor and concurring with the general sentiments of the nation The wild project of raising the city was immediately resolved on the execution of it was decayed till next day and emissaries were despatched to all Essex s friends informing them that Cobham and Raleigh had laid schemes against his life and entreating their presence and assistance Next day there appeared at Essex House the earls of Southampton and Rutland the lords Sandys and Monteagle with about three hundred gentlemen of good quality and fortune and Essex informed them of the danger to which he pretended the machinations of his enemies exposed him To some he said that he would throw himself at the queen s feet and crave her justice and protection to others he boasted of his interest in the city and affirmed that whatever might happen this resource could never fail him The queen was informed of these designs by means of intelligence conveyed as is supposed to Raleigh by Sir Ferdinando Gorges and having ordered the magistrates of London to keep the citizens in readiness she sent Egerton lord keeper to Essex House with the earl of Worcester Sir William Knollys comptroller and Popham chief justice in order to learn the cause of these unusual commotions They were with difficulty admitted through a wicket but all their servants were excluded except the purse bearer After some altercation in which they charged Essex s retainers upon their allegiance to lay down their arms and were menaced in their turn by the angry multitude who surrounded them the earl who found that matters were past recall resolved to leave them prisoners in his house and to proceed to the execution of his former project He sallied forth with about two hundred attendants armed only with walking swords and in his passage to the city was joined by the earl of Bedford and Lord Cromwell He cried aloud For the queen for the queen a plot is laid for my life and then proceeded to the house of Smith the sheriff on whose aid he had great reliance The citizens flocked about him in amazement but though he told them that England was sold to the infanta and exhorted them to arms instantly otherwise they could not do him any service no one showed a disposition to join him The sheriff on the earl s approach to his house stole out at the back door and made the best of his way to the mayor Essex meanwhile observing the coldness of the citizens and hearing that he was proclaimed a traitor by the earl of Cumberland and Lord Burleigh began to despair of success and thought of retreating to his own house He found the streets in his passage barricaded and guarded by the citizens under the command of Sir John Levison In his attempt to force his way Tracy a young gentleman to whom he bore great friendship was killed with two or three of the Londoners and the earl himself attended by a few of his partisans for the greater part began secretly to withdraw themselves retired towards the river and taking boat arrived at Essex House He there found that Gorges whom he had sent before to capitulate with the lord keeper and the other counsellors had given all of them their liberty and had gone to court with them He was now reduced to despair and appeared determined in prosecution of Lord Sandy s advice to defend himself to the last extremity and rather to perish like a brave man with his sword in his hand than basely by the hands of the executioner but after some parley and after demanding in vain first hostages then conditions from the besiegers he surrendered at discretion requesting only civil treatment and a fair and impartial hearing The queen who during all this commotion had behaved with as great tranquillity and security as if there had only passed a fray in the streets in which she was nowise concerned soon gave orders for the trial of the most considerable of the criminals Camden p six hundred thirty two Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred sixty nine The earls of Essex and Southampton were arraigned before a jury of twenty five peers where Buckhurst acted as lord steward The guilt of the prisoners was too apparent to admit of any doubt and besides the insurrection known to every body the treasonable conferences at Drury House were proved by undoubted evidence Sir Ferdinando Gorges was produced in court the confessions of the earl of Rutland of the lords Cromwell Sandys and Monteagle of Davers Blount and Davies were only read to the peers according to the practice of that age Essex s best friends were scandalized at his assurance in insisting so positively on his innocence and the goodness of his intentions and still more at his vindictive disposition in accusing without any appearance of reason Secretary Cecil as a partisan of the infanta s title The secretary who had expected this charge stepped into the court and challenged Essex to produce his authority which on examination was found extremely weak and frivolous Bacon vol iv p five hundred thirty When sentence was pronounced Essex spoke like a man who expected nothing but death but he added that he should be sorry if he were represented to the queen as a person that despised her clemency though he should not he believed make any cringing submissions to obtain it Southampton s behavior was more mild and submissive he entreated the good offices of the peers in so modest and becoming a manner as excited compassion in every one The most remarkable circumstance in Essex s trial was Bacon s appearance against him He was none of the crown lawyers so was not obliged by his office to assist at this trial yet did he not scruple in order to obtain the queen s favor to be active in bereaving of life his friend and patron whose generosity he had often experienced He compared Essex s conduct in pretending to fear the attempts of his adversaries to that of Pisistratus the Athenian who cut and wounded his own body and making the people believe that his enemies had committed the violence obtained a guard for his person by whose assistance he afterwards subdued the liberties of his country After Essex had passed some days in the solitude and reflections of a prison his proud heart was at last subdued not by the fear of death but by the sentiments of religion a principle which he had before attempted to make the instrument of his ambition but which now took a more firm hold of his mind and prevailed over every other motive and consideration His spiritual directors persuaded him that he never could obtain the pardon of Heaven unless he made a full confession of his disloyalty and he gave in to the council an account of all his criminal design as well as of his correspondence with the king of Scots He spared not even his most intimate friends such as Lord Mountjoy whom he had engaged in these conspiracies and he sought to pacify his present remorse by making such atonements as in any other period of his life he would have deemed more blamable than those attempts themselves which were the objects of his penitence Sir Henry Nevil in particular a man of merit he accused of a correspondence with the conspirators though it appears that this gentleman had never assented to the proposals made him and was no further criminal than in not revealing the earl s treason an office to which every man of honor naturally bears the strongest reluctance Nevil was thrown into prison and underwent a severe persecution but as the queen found Mountjoy an able and successful commander she continued him in his government and sacrificed her resentment to the public service Elizabeth affected extremely the praise of clemency and in every great example which she had made during her reign she had always appeared full of reluctance and hesitation but the present situation of Essex called forth all her tender affections and kept her in the most real agitation and irresolution She felt a perpetual combat between resentment and inclination pride and compassion the care of her own safety and concern for her favorite and her situation during this interval was perhaps more an object of pity than that to which Essex himself was reduced She signed the warrant for his execution she countermanded it she again resolved on his death she felt a new return of tenderness Essex s enemies told her that he himself desired to die and had assured her that she could never be in safety while he lived it is likely that this proof of penitence and of concern for her would produce a contrary effect to what they intended and would revive all the fond affection which she had so long indulged towards the unhappy prisoner But what chiefly hardened her heart against him was his supposed obstinacy in never making as she hourly expected any application to her for mercy and she finally gave her consent to his execution He discovered at his death symptoms rather of penitence and piety than of fear and willingly acknowledged the justice of the sentence by which he suffered The execution was private in the Tower agreeably to his own request He was apprehensive he said lest the favor and compassion of the people would too much raise his heart in those moments when humiliation under the afflicting hand of Heaven was the only proper sentiment which he could indulge And the queen no doubt thought that prudence required the removing of so melancholy a spectacle from the public eye Winwood vol i p three hundred Winwood vol i p three hundred two doctor Barlow s Sermon on Essex s Execution Bacon vol iv p five hundred thirty four Sir Walter Raleigh who came to the Tower on purpose and who beheld Essex s execution from a window increased much by this action the general hatred under which he already labored it was thought that his sole intention was to feast his eyes with the death of an enemy and no apology which he could make for so ungenerous a conduct could be accepted by the public The cruelty and animosity with which he urged on Essex s fate even when Cecil relented were still regarded as the principles of this unmanly behavior Murdin p eight hundred eleven The earl of Essex was but thirty four years of age when his rashness imprudence and violence brought him to this untimely end We must here as in many other instances lament the inconstancy of human nature that a person endowed with so many noble virtues generosity sincerity friendship valor eloquence and industry should in the latter period of his life have given reins to his ungovernable passions and involved not only himself but many of his friends in utter ruin The queen s tenderness and passion for him as it was the cause of those premature honors which he attained seems on the whole the chief circumstance which brought on his unhappy fate Confident of her partiality towards him as well as of his own merit he treated her with a haughtiness which neither her love nor her dignity could bear and as her amorous inclinations in so advanced an age would naturally make her appear ridiculous if not odious in his eyes he was engaged by an imprudent openness of which he made profession to discover too easily those sentiments to her The many reconciliations and returns of affection of which he had still made advantage induced him to venture on new provocations till he pushed her beyond all bounds of patience and he forgot that though the sentiments of the woman were ever strong in her those of the sovereign had still in the end appeared predominant Some of Essex s associates Cuffe Davers Blount Meric and Davies were tried and condemned and all of these except Davies were executed The queen pardoned the rest being persuaded that they were drawn in merely from their friendship to that nobleman and their care of his safety and were ignorant of the more criminal part of his intentions Southampton s life was saved with great difficulty but he was detained in prison during the remainder of this reign The king of Scots apprehensive lest his correspondence with Essex might have been discovered and have given offence to Elizabeth sent the earl of Marre and Lord Kinloss as ambassadors to England in order to congratulate the queen on her escape from the late insurrection and conspiracy They were also ordered to make secret inquiry whether any measures had been taken by her for excluding him from the succession as well as to discover the inclinations of the chief nobility and counsellors in case of the queen s demise They found the dispositions of men as favorable as they could wish and they even entered into a correspondence with Secretary Cecil whose influence after the fall of Essex was now uncontrolled and who was resolved by this policy to acquire in time the confidence of the successor He knew how jealous Elizabeth ever was of her authority and he therefore carefully concealed from her his attachment to James but he afterwards asserted that nothing could be more advantageous to her than this correspondence because the king of Scots secure of mounting the throne by his undoubted title aided by those connections with the English ministry was the less likely to give any disturbance to the present sovereign He also persuaded that prince to remain in quiet and patiently to expect that time should open to him the inheritance of the crown without pushing his friends on desperate enterprises which would totally incapacitate them from serving him James s equity as well as his natural facility of disposition easily inclined him to embrace that resolution and in this manner the minds of the English were silently but universally disposed to admit without opposition the succession of the Scottish line the death of Essex by putting an end to faction had been rather favorable than prejudicial to that great event The French king who was little prepossessed in favor of James and who for obvious reasons was averse to the union of England and Scotland made his ambassador drop some hints to Cecil of Henry s willingness to concur in any measure for disappointing the hopes of the Scottish monarch but as Cecil showed an entire disapprobation of such schemes Birch s Memoirs vol ii p five hundred ten Osborne p six hundred fifteen Spotswood p four hundred seventy one four hundred seventy two Winwood vol i p three hundred fifty two The court of France took no further steps in that matter and thus the only foreign power which could give much disturbance to James s succession was induced to acquiesce in it Spotswood p four hundred seventy one Henry made a journey this summer to Calais and the queen hearing of his intentions went to Dover in hopes of having a personal interview with a monarch whom of all others she most loved and most respected The king of France who felt the same sentiments towards her would gladly have accepted of the proposal but as many difficulties occurred it appeared necessary to lay aside by common consent the project of an interview Elizabeth however wrote successively two letters to Henry one by Edmondes another by Sir Robert Sidney in which she expressed a desire of conferring about a business of importance with some minister in whom that prince reposed entire confidence The marquis of Rosni the king s favorite and prime minister came to Dover in disguise and the memoirs of that able statesman contain a full account of his conference with Elizabeth This princess had formed a scheme for establishing in conjunction with Henry a new system in Europe and of fixing a durable balance of power by the erection of new states on the ruins of the house of Austria She had even the prudence to foresee the perils which might ensue from the aggrandizement of her ally and she purposed to unite all the seventeen provinces of the Low Countries in one republic in order to form a perpetual barrier against the dangerous increase of the French as well as of the Spanish monarchy Henry had himself long meditated such a project against the Austrian family and Rosni could not forbear expressing his astonishment when he found that Elizabeth and his master though they had never communicated their sentiments on this subject not only had entered into the same general views but had also formed the same plan for their execution The affairs however of France were not yet brought to a situation which might enable Henry to begin that great enterprise and Rosni satisfied the queen that it would be necessary to postpone for some years their united attack on the house of Austria He departed filled with just admiration at the solidity of Elizabeth s judgment and the greatness of her mind and he owns that she was entirely worthy of that high reputation which she enjoyed in Europe The queen s magnanimity in forming such extensive projects was the more remarkable as besides her having fallen so far into the decline of life the affairs of Ireland though conducted with abilities and success were still in disorder and made a great diversion of her forces The expense incurred by this war lay heavy upon her narrow revenues and her ministers taking advantage of her disposition to frugality proposed to her an expedient of saving which though she at first disapproved of it she was at last induced to embrace It was represented to her that the great sums of money remitted to Ireland for the pay of the English forces came by the necessary course of circulation into the hands of the rebels and enabled them to buy abroad all necessary supplies of arms and ammunition which from the extreme poverty of that kingdom and its want of every useful commodity they could not otherwise find means to purchase It was therefore recommended to her that she should pay her forces in base money and it was asserted that besides the great saving to the revenue this species of coin could never be exported with advantage and would not pass in any foreign market Some of her wiser counsellors maintained that if the pay of the soldiers were raised in proportion the Irish rebels would necessarily reap the same benefit from the base money which would always be taken at a rate suitable to its value if the pay were not raised there would be danger of a mutiny among the troops who whatever names might be affixed to the pieces of metal would soon find from experience that they were defrauded in their income But Elizabeth though she justly valued herself on fixing the standard of the English coin much debased by her predecessors and had innovated very little in that delicate article was seduced by the specious arguments employed by the treasurer on this occasion and she coined a great quantity of base money which he made use of in the pay of her forces in Ireland Camden p six hundred forty three Rymer tom xvi p four hundred fourteen Mountjoy the deputy was a man of abilities and foreseeing the danger of mutiny among the troops he led them instantly into the field and resolved by means of strict discipline and by keeping them employed against the enemy to obviate those inconveniencies which were justly to be apprehended He made military roads and built a fortress at Moghery he drove the Mac Genises out of Lecale he harassed Tyrone in Ulster with inroads and lesser expeditions and by destroying every where and during all seasons the provisions of the Irish he reduced them to perish by famine in the woods and morasses to which they were obliged to retreat At the same time Sir Henry Docwray who commanded another body of troops took the Castle of Derry and put garrisons into Newton and Ainogh and having seized the monastery of Donnegal near Balishannon he threw troops into it and defended it against the assaults of O Donnel and the Irish Nor was Sir George Carew idle in the province of Munster He seized the titular earl of Desmond and sent him over with Florence Macarty another chieftain prisoner to England He arrested many suspected persons and took hostages from others And having got a reenforcement of two thousand men from England he threw himself into Corke which he supplied with arms and provisions and he put every thing in a condition for resisting the Spanish invasion which was daily expected The deputy informed of the danger to which the southern provinces were exposed left the prosecution of the war against Tyrone who was reduced to great extremities and he marched with his army into Munster At last the Spaniards under Don John d Aquila arrived at Kinsale and Sir Richard Piercy who commanded in the town with a small garrison of a hundred and fifty men found himself obliged to abandon it on their appearance These invaders amounted to four thousand men and the Irish discovered a strong propensity to join them in order to free themselves from the English government with which they were extremely discontented One chief ground of their complaint was the introduction of trials by jury an institution abhorred by that people though nothing contributes more to the support of that equity and liberty for which the English laws are so justly celebrated Camden p six hundred forty four The Irish also bore a great favor to the Spaniards having entertained the opinion that they themselves were descended from that nation and their attachment to the Catholic religion proved a new cause of affection to the invaders D Aquila assumed the title of general in the holy war for the preservation of the faith in Ireland and he endeavored to persuade the people that Elizabeth was by several bulls of the pope deprived of her crown that her subjects were absolved from their oaths of allegiance and that the Spaniards were come to deliver the Irish from the dominion of the devil Mountjoy found it necessary to act with vigor in order to prevent a total insurrection of the Irish and having collected his forces he formed the siege of Kinsale by land while Sir Richard Levison with a small squadron blockaded it by sea He had no sooner begun his operations than he heard of the arrival of another body of two thousand Spaniards under the command of Alphonso Ocampo who had taken possession of Baltimore and Berehaven and he was obliged to detach Sir George Carew to oppose their progress Tyrone meanwhile with Randal Mac Surley Tirel baron of Kelley and other chieftains of the Irish had joined Ocampo with all their forces and were marching to the relief of Kinsale The deputy informed of their design by intercepted letters made preparations to receive them and being reenforced by Levison with six hundred marines he posted his troops on an advantageous ground which lay on the passage of the enemy leaving some cavalry to prevent a sally from D Aquila and the Spanish garrison When Tyrone with a detachment of Irish and Spaniards approached he was surprised to find the English so well posted and ranged in good order and he immediately sounded a retreat but the deputy gave orders to pursue him and having thrown these advanced troops into disorder he followed them to the main body whom he also attacked and put to flight with the slaughter of twelve hundred men Ocampo was taken prisoner Tyrone fled into Ulster O Donnel made his escape into Spain and D Aquila finding himself reduced to the greatest difficulties was obliged to capitulate upon such terms as the deputy prescribed to him he surrendered Kinsale and Baltimore and agreed to evacuate the kingdom This great blow joined to other successes gained by Wlimot governor of Kerry and by Roger and Gavin Harvey threw the rebels into dismay and gave a prospect of the final reduction of Ireland The Irish war though successful was extremely burdensome on the queen s revenue and besides the supplies granted by parliament which were indeed very small but which they ever regarded as mighty concessions she had been obliged notwithstanding her great frugality to employ other expedients such as selling the royal demesnes and crown jewels and exacting loans from the people in order to support this cause so essential to the honor and interests of England Camden p six hundred forty five Winwood vol i p three hundred sixty nine D Ewes p six hundred twenty nine D Ewes p six hundred twenty nine The necessity of her affairs obliged her again to summon a parliament and it here appeared that though old age was advancing fast upon her though she had lost much of her popularity by the unfortunate execution of Essex insomuch that when she appeared in public she was not attended with the usual acclamations yet the powers of her prerogative supported by her vigor still remained as high and uncontrollable as ever The active reign of Elizabeth had enabled many persons to distinguish themselves in civil and military employments and the queen who was not able from her revenue to give them any rewards proportioned to their services had made use of an expedient which had been employed by her predecessors but which had never been carried to such an extreme as under her administration She granted her servants and courtiers patents for monopolies and these patents they sold to others who were thereby enabled to raise commodities to what price they pleased and who put invincible restraints upon all commerce industry and emulation in the arts It is astonishing to consider the number and importance of those commodities which were thus assigned over to patentees Currants salt iron powder cards calf skins fells pouldavies ox shin bones train oil lists of cloth potashes aniseseeds vinegar seacoals steel aquavitae brushes pots bottles saltpetre lead accidences oil calamine stone oil of blubber glasses paper starch tin sulphur new drapery dried pilchards transportation of iron ordnance of beer of horn of leather importation of Spanish wool of Irish yarn these are but a part of the commodities which had been appropriated to monopolists When this list was read in the house a member cried Is not bread in the number Bread said every one with astonishment Yes I assure you replied he if affairs go on at this rate we shall have bread reduced to a monopoly before next parliament These monopolists were so exorbitant in their demands that in some places they raised the price of salt from sixteen pence a bushel to fourteen or fifteen shillings D Ewes p six hundred twenty nine Osborne p six hundred four D Ewes p six hundred forty eight six hundred fifty six hundred fifty two D Ewes p six hundred forty eight D Ewes p six hundred forty seven Such high profits naturally begat intruders upon their commerce and in order to secure themselves against encroachments the patentees were armed with high and arbitrary powers from the council by which they were enabled to oppress the people at pleasure and to exact money from such as they thought proper to accuse of interfering with their patent The patentees of saltpetre having the power of entering into every house and of committing what havoc they pleased in stables cellars or wherever they suspected saltpetre might be gathered commonly extorted money from those who desired to free themselves from this damage or trouble And while all domestic intercourse was thus restrained lest any scope should remain for industry almost every species of foreign commerce was confined to exclusive companies who bought and sold at any price that they themselves thought proper to offer or exact These grievances the most intolerable for the present and the most pernicious in their consequences that ever were known in any age or under any government had been mentioned in the last parliament and a petition had even been presented to the queen complaining of the patents but she still persisted in defending her monopolists against her people A bill was now introduced into the lower house abolishing all these monopolies and as the former application had been unsuccessful a law was insisted on as the only certain expedient for correcting these abuses The courtiers on the other hand maintained that this matter regarded the prerogative and that the commons could never hope for success if they did not make application in the most humble and respectful manner to the queen s goodness and beneficence The topics which were advanced in the house and which came equally from the courtiers and the country gentlemen and were admitted by both will appear the most extraordinary to such as are prepossessed with an idea of the privileges enjoyed by the people during that age and of the liberty possessed under the administration of Elizabeth It was asserted that the queen inherited both an enlarging and a restraining power by her prerogative she might set at liberty what was restrained by statute or otherwise and by her prerogative she might restrain what was otherwise at liberty that the royal prerogative was not to be canvassed nor disputed nor examined and did not even admit of any limitation v D Ewes p six hundred forty four six hundred forty six six hundred fifty two D Ewes p six hundred fifty three D Ewes

Turkish divan than of an English house of commons according to our present idea of this assembly the queen who perceived how odious monopolies had become and what heats were likely to arise sent for the speaker and desired him to acquaint the house that she would immediately cancel the most grievous and oppressive of these patents thirty eight The house was struck with astonishment and admiration and gratitude at this extraordinary instance of the queen s goodness and condescension A member said with tears in his eyes that if a sentence of everlasting happiness had been pronounced in his favor he could not have felt more joy than that with which he was at present over whelmed v Another observed that this message from the sacred person of the queen was a kind of gospel or glad tidings and ought to be received as such and be written in the tablets of their hearts v And it was further remarked that in the same manner as the Deity would not give his glory to another so the queen herself was the only agent in their present prosperity and happiness v The house voted that the speaker with a committee should ask permission to wait on her majesty and return thanks to her for her gracious concessions to her people When the speaker with the other members was introduced to the queen they all flung themselves on their knees and remained in that posture a considerable time till she thought proper to express her desire that they should rise v D Ewes p six hundred forty nine D Ewes p six hundred forty nine D Ewes p six hundred forty six hundred forty six See note LL at the end of the

not the power so he relinquished the appearance of despotism Even when Queen Elizabeth was absent those who covered her table though persons of quality neither approached it nor retired from it without kneeling and that often three times The speaker displayed the gratitude of the commons because her sacred ears were ever open to hear them and her blessed hands ever stretched out to relieve them They acknowledged he said in all duty and thankfulness acknowledged that before they called her preventing grace and all deserving goodness watched over them for their good more ready to give than they could desire much less deserve He remarked that the attribute which was most proper to God to perform all he promiseth appertained also to her and that she was all truth all constancy and all goodness And he concluded with these expressions Neither do we present our thanks in words or any outward sign which can be no sufficient retribution for so great goodness but in all duty and thankfulness prostrate at your feet we present our most loyal and thankful hearts even the last drop of blood in our hearts and the last spirit of breath in our nostrils to be poured out to be breathed up for your safety D Ewes p six hundred fifty eight six hundred fifty nine The queen heard very patiently this speech in which she was flattered in phrases appropriated to the Supreme Being and she returned an answer full of such expressions of tenderness towards her people as ought to have appeared fulsome after the late instances of rigor which she had employed and from which nothing but necessity had made her depart Thus was this critical affair happily terminated and Elizabeth by prudently receding in time from part of her prerogative maintained her dignity and preserved the affections of her people The commons granted her a supply quite unprecedented of four subsidies and eight fifteenths and they were so dutiful as to vote this supply before they received any satisfaction in the business of monopolies which they justly considered as of the utmost importance to the interest and happiness of the nation Had they attempted to extort that concession by keeping the supply in suspense so haughty was the queen s disposition that this appearance of constraint and jealousy had been sufficient to have produced a denial of all their requests and to have forced her into some acts of authority still more violent and arbitrary The remaining events of this reign are neither numerous nor important The queen finding that the Spaniards had involved her in so much trouble by fomenting and assisting the Irish rebellion resolved to give them employment at home and she fitted out a squadron of nine ships under Sir Richard Levison admiral and Sir William Monson vice admiral whom she sent on an expedition to the coast of Spain The admiral with part of the squadron met the galleons loaded with treasure but was not strong enough to attack them The vice admiral also fell in with some rich ships but they escaped for a like reason and these two brave officers that their expedition might not prove entirely fruitless resolved to attack the harbor of Cerimbra in Portugal where they received intelligence a very rich carrack had taken shelter The harbor was guarded by a castle there were eleven galleys stationed in it and the militia of the country to the number as was believed of twenty thousand men appeared in arms on the shore yet notwithstanding these obstacles and others derived from the winds and tides the English squadron broke into the harbor dismounted the guns of the castle sunk or burnt or put to flight the galleys and obliged the carrack to surrender They brought her home to England and she was valued at a million of ducats a sensible loss to the Spaniards and a supply still more important to Elizabeth Monson p one hundred eighty one Camden p six hundred forty seven This year the Spaniards began the siege of Ostend which was bravely defended for five months by Sir Francis Vere The states then relieved him by sending a new governor and on the whole the siege lasted three years and is computed to have cost the lives of one hundred thousand men The affairs of Ireland after the defeat of Tyrone and the expulsion of the Spaniards hastened to a settlement Lord Mountjoy divided his army into small parties and harassed the rebels on every side he built Charlemont and many other small forts which were impregnable to the Irish and guarded all the important passes of the country the activity of Sir Henry Docwray and Sir Arthur Chichester permitted no repose or security to the rebels and many of the chieftains after skulking during some time in woods and morasses submitted to mercy and received such conditions as the deputy was pleased to impose upon them Tyrone himself made application by Arthur Mac Baron his brother to be received upon terms but Mountjoy would not admit him except he made an absolute surrender of his life and fortunes to the queen s mercy He appeared before the deputy at Millefont in a habit and posture suitable to his present fortune and after acknowledging his offence in the most humble terms he was committed to custody by Mountjoy who intended to bring him over captive into England to be disposed of at the queen s pleasure But Elizabeth was now incapable of receiving any satisfaction from this fortunate event she had fallen into a profound melancholy which all the advantages of her high fortune all the glories of her prosperous reign were unable in any degree to alleviate or assuage Some ascribed this depression of mind to her repentance of granting a pardon to Tyrone whom she had always resolved to bring to condign punishment for his treasons but who had made such interest with the ministers as to extort a remission from her Others with more likelihood accounted for her dejection by a discovery which she had made of the correspondence maintained in her court with her successor the king of Scots and by the neglect to which on account of her old age and infirmities she imagined herself to be exposed But there is another cause assigned for her melancholy which has long been rejected by historians as romantic but which late discoveries seem to have confirmed some incidents happened which revived her tenderness for Essex and filled her with the deepest sorrow for the consent which she had unwarily given to his execution See the proofs of this remarkable fact collected in Birch s Negotiations p two hundred six And Memoirs vol ii p four hundred eighty one five hundred five five hundred six et cetera The earl of Essex after his return from the fortunate expedition against Cadiz observing the increase of the queen s fond attachment towards him took occasion to regret that the necessity of her service required him often to be absent from her person and exposed him to all those ill offices which his enemies more assiduous in their attendance could employ against him She was moved with this tender jealousy and making him the present of a ring desired him to keep that pledge of her affection and assured him that into whatever disgrace he should fall whatever prejudices she might be induced to entertain against him yet if he sent her that ring she would immediately upon the sight of it recall her former tenderness would afford him a patient hearing and would lend a favorable ear to his apology Essex notwithstanding all his misfortunes reserved this precious gift to the last extremity but after his trial and condemnation he resolved to try the experiment and he committed the ring to the countess of Nottingham whom he desired to deliver it to the queen The countess was prevailed on by her husband the mortal enemy of Essex not to execute the commission and Elizabeth who still expected that her favorite would make this last appeal to her tenderness and who ascribed the neglect of it to his invincible obstinacy was after much delay and many internal combats pushed by resentment and policy to sign the warrant for his execution The countess of Nottingham falling into sickness and affected with the near approach of death was seized with remorse for her conduct and having obtained a visit from the queen she craved her pardon and revealed to her the fatal secret The queen astonished with this incident burst into a furious passion she shook the dying countess in her bed and crying to her that God might pardon her but she never could she broke from her and thenceforth resigned herself over to the deepest and most incurable melancholy She rejected all consolation she even refused food and sustenance and throwing herself on the floor she remained sullen and immovable feeding her thoughts on her afflictions and declaring life and existence an insufferable burden to her Few words she uttered and they were all expressive of some inward grief which she cared not to reveal but sighs and groans were the chief vent which she gave to her despondency and which though they discovered her sorrows were never able to ease or assuage them Ten days and nights she lay upon the carpet leaning on cushions which her maids brought her and her physicians could not persuade her to allow herself to be put to bed much less to make trial of any remedies which they prescribed to her Strype vol iv No two hundred seventy six Her anxious mind at last had so long preyed on her frail body that her end was visibly approaching and the council being assembled sent the keeper admiral and secretary to know her will with regard to her successor She answered with a faint voice that as she had held a regal sceptre she desired no other than a royal successor Cecil requesting her to explain herself more particularly she subjoined that she would have a king to succeed her and who should that be but her nearest kinsman the king of Scots Being then advised by the archbishop of Canterbury to fix her thoughts upon God she replied that she did so nor did her mind in the least wander from him Her voice soon after left her and senses failed she fell into a lethargic slumber which continued some hours and she expired gently without further struggle or convulsion in the seventieth year of her age and forty fifth of her reign So dark a cloud overcast the evening of that day which had shone out with a mighty lustre in the eyes of all Europe There are few great personages in history who have been more exposed to the calumny of enemies and the adulation of friends than Queen Elizabeth and yet there scarcely is any whose reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous consent of posterity The unusual length of her administration and the strong features of her character were able to overcome all prejudices and obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives and her admirers somewhat of their panegyrics have at last in spite of political factions and what is more of religious animosities produced a uniform judgment with regard to her conduct Her vigor her constancy her magnanimity her penetration vigilance address are allowed to merit the highest praises and appear not to have been surpassed by any person that ever filled a throne a conduct less rigorous less imperious more sincere more indulgent to her people would have been requisite to form a perfect character By the force of her mind she controlled all her more active and stronger qualities and prevented them from running into excess her heroism was exempt from temerity her frugality from avarice her friendship from partiality her active temper from turbulency and a vain ambition she guarded not herself with equal care or equal success from lesser infirmities the rivalship of beauty the desire of admiration the jealousy of love and the sallies of anger Her singular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and on her capacity Endowed with a great command over herself she soon obtained an uncontrolled ascendant over her people and while she merited all their esteem by her real virtues she also engaged their affections by her pretended ones Few sovereigns of England succeeded to the throne in more difficult circumstances and none ever conducted the government with such uniform success and felicity Though unacquainted with the practice of toleration the true secret for managing religious factions she preserved her people by her superior prudence from those confusions in which theological controversy had involved all the neighboring nations and though her enemies were the most powerful princes of Europe the most active the most enterprising the least scrupulous she was able by her vigor to make deep impressions on their states her own greatness meanwhile remained untouched and unimpaired The wise ministers and brave warriors who flourished under her reign share the praise of her success but instead of lessening the applause due to her they make great addition to it They owed all of them their advancement to her choice they were supported by her constancy and with all their abilities they were never able to acquire any undue ascendant over her In her family in her court in her kingdom she remained equally mistress the force of the tender passions was great over her but the force of her mind was still superior and the combat which her victory visibly cost her serves only to display the firmness of her resolution and the loftiness of her ambitious sentiments The fame of this princess though it has surmounted the prejudices both of faction and bigotry yet lies still exposed to another prejudice which is more durable because more natural and which according to the different views in which we survey her is capable either of exalting beyond measure or diminishing the lustre of her character This prejudice is founded on the consideration of her sex When we contemplate her as a woman we are apt to be struck with the highest admiration of her great qualities and extensive capacity but we are also apt to require some more softness of disposition some greater lenity of temper some of those amiable weaknesses by which her sex is distinguished But the true method of estimating her merit is to lay aside all these considerations and consider her merely as a rational being placed in authority and intrusted with the government of mankind We may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her as a wife or a mistress but her qualities as a sovereign though with some considerable exceptions are the object of undisputed applause and approbation APPENDIX III The party among us who have distinguished themselves by their adhering to liberty and a popular government have long indulged their prejudices against the succeeding race of princes by bestowing unbounded panegyrics on the virtue and wisdom of Elizabeth They have even been so extremely ignorant of the transactions of this reign as to extol her for a quality which of all others she was the least possessed of a tender regard for the constitution and a concern for the liberties and privileges of her people But as it is scarcely possible for the prepossessions of party to throw a veil much longer over facts so palpable and undeniable there is danger lest the public should run into the opposite extreme and should entertain an aversion to the memory of a princess who exercised the royal authority in a manner so contrary to all the ideas which we at present entertain of a legal constitution But Elizabeth only supported the prerogatives transmitted to her by her predecessors she believed that her subjects were entitled to no more liberty than their ancestors had enjoyed she found that they entirely acquiesced in her arbitrary administration and it was not natural for her to find fault with a form of government by which she herself was invested with such unlimited authority In the particular exertions of power the question ought never to be forgotten What is best But in the general distribution of power among the several members of a constitution there can seldom be admitted any other question than What is established Few examples occur of princes who have willingly resigned their power none of those who have without struggle and reluctance allowed it to be extorted from them If any other rule than established practice be followed factions and dissensions must multiply without end and though many constitutions and none more than the British have been improved even by violent innovations the praise bestowed on those patriots to whom the nation has been indebted for its privileges ought to be given with some reserve and surely without the least rancor against those who adhered to the ancient constitution In order to understand the ancient constitution of England there is not a period which deserves more to be studied than the reign of Elizabeth The prerogatives of this princess were scarcely ever disputed and she therefore employed them without scruple her imperious temper a circumstance in which she went far beyond her successors rendered her exertions of power violent and frequent and discovered the full extent of her authority the great popularity which she enjoyed proves that she did not infringe any established liberties of the people there remains evidence sufficient to ascertain the most noted acts of her administration and though that evidence must be drawn from a source wide of the ordinary historians it becomes only the more authentic on that account and serves as a stronger proof that her particular exertions of power were conceived to be nothing but the ordinary course of administration since they were not thought remarkable enough to be recorded even by contemporary writers If there was any difference in this particular the people in former reigns seem rather to have been more submissive than even during the age of Elizabeth it may not here be improper to recount some of the ancient prerogatives of the crown and lay open the sources of that great power which the English monarchs formerly enjoyed By the ancient constitution is here meant that which prevailed before the settlement of our present plan of liberty There was a more ancient constitution where though the people had perhaps less liberty than under the Tudors yet the king had also less authority the power of the barons was a great check upon him and exercised great tyranny over them But there was still a more ancient constitution viz that before the signing of the charters when neither the people nor the barons had any regular privileges and the power of the government during the reign of an able prince was almost wholly in the king The English constitution like all others has been in a state of continual fluctuation In a memorial of the state of the realm drawn by Secretary Cecil in fifteen sixty nine there is this passage Then followeth the decay of obedience in civil policy which being compared with the fearfulness and reverence of all inferior estates to their superiors in times past will astonish any wise and considerate person to behold the desperation of reformation Haynes p five hundred eighty six Again p five hundred thirty eight One of the most ancient and most established instruments of power was the court of star chamber which possessed an unlimited discretionary authority of fining imprisoning and inflicting corporal punishment and whose jurisdiction extended to all sorts of offences contempts and disorders that lay not within reach of the common law The members of this court consisted of the privy council and the judges men who all of them enjoyed their offices during pleasure and when the prince himself was present he was the sole judge and all the others could only interpose with their advice There needed but this one court in any government to put an end to all regular legal and exact plans of liberty for who durst set himself in opposition to the crown and ministry or aspire to the character of being a patron of freedom while exposed to so arbitrary a jurisdiction I much question whether any of the absolute monarchies in Europe contain at present so illegal and despotic a tribunal The court of high commission was another jurisdiction still more terrible both because the crime of heresy of which it took cognizance was more undefinable than any civil offence and because its methods of inquisition and of administering oaths were more contrary to all the most simple ideas of justice and equity The fines and imprisonments imposed by this court were frequent the deprivations and suspensions of the clergy for nonconformity were also numerous and comprehended at one time the third of all the ecclesiastics of England The queen in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury said expressly that she was resolved that no man should be suffered to decline either on the left or on the right hand from the drawn line limited by authority and by her laws and injunctions But martial law went beyond even these two courts in a prompt and arbitrary and violent method of decision Whenever there was any insurrection or public disorder the crown employed martial law and it was during that time exercised not only over the soldiers but over the whole people any one might be punished as a rebel or an aider and abettor of rebellion whom the provost martial or lieutenant of a county or their deputies pleased to suspect Lord Bacon says that the trial at common law granted to the earl of Essex and his fellow conspirators was a favor for that the case would have borne and required the severity of martial law Neal vol i p four hundred seventy nine Vol iv p five hundred ten Murden p one hundred eighty three We have seen instances of its being employed by Queen Mary in defence of orthodoxy There remains a letter of Queen Elizabeth s to the earl of Sussex after the suppression of the northern rebellion in which she sharply reproves him because she had not heard of his having executed any criminals by martial law though it is probable that near eight hundred persons suffered one way or other on account of that slight insurrection But the kings of England did not always limit the exercise of this law to times of civil war and disorder In fifteen fifty two when there was no rebellion or insurrection King Edward granted a commission of martial law and empowered the commissioners to execute it as should be thought by their discretions most necessary Queen Elizabeth too was not sparing in the use of this law In fifteen seventy three one Peter Burchet a Puritan being persuaded that it was meritorious to kill such as opposed the truth of the gospel ran into the streets and wounded Hawkins the famous sea captain whom he took for Hatton the queen s favorite The queen was so incensed that she ordered him to be punished instantly by martial law but upon the remonstrance of some prudent counsellors who told her that this law was usually confined to turbulent times she recalled her order and delivered over Burchet to the common law But she continued not always so reserved in executing this authority There remains a proclamation of hers in which she orders martial law to be used against all such as import bulls or even forbidden books and pamphlets from abroad and prohibits the questioning of the lieutenants or their deputies for their arbitrary punishment of such offenders any law or statute to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding MS of Lord Royston s from the paper office Strype s Eccles Memoirs vol ii p three hundred seventy three four hundred fifty eight four hundred fifty nine Camden p four hundred forty six Strype vol ii p two hundred eighty eight Strype vol iii p five hundred seventy We have another act of hers still more extraordinary The streets of London were much infested with idle vagabonds and riotous persons the lord mayor had endeavored to repress this disorder the star chamber had exerted its authority and inflicted punishment on these rioters but the queen finding those remedies ineffectual revived martial law and gave Sir Thomas Wilford a commission of provost martial Granting him authority and commanding him upon signification given by the justices of peace in London or the neighboring counties of such offenders worthy to be speedily executed by martial law to attach and take the same persons and in the presence of the said justices according to justice of martial law to execute them upon the gallows or gibbet openly or near to such place where the said rebellious and incorrigible offenders shall be found to have committed the said great offences I suppose it would be difficult to produce an instance of such an act of authority in any place nearer than Muscovy The patent of high constable granted to Earl Rivers by Edward IV proves the nature of the office The powers are unlimited perpetual and remain in force during peace as well as during war and rebellion The parliament in Edward VI s reign acknowledged the jurisdiction of the constable and martial s court to be part of the law of the land The star chamber and high commission and court martial though arbitrary jurisdictions had still some pretence of a trial at least of a sentence but there was a grievous punishment very generally inflicted in that age without any other authority than the warrant of a secretary of state or of the privy council and that was imprisonment in any jail and during any time that the ministers should think proper In suspicious times all the jails were full of prisoners of state and these unhappy victims of public jealousy were sometimes thrown into dungeons and loaded with irons and treated in the most cruel manner without their being able to obtain any remedy from law This practice was an indirect way of employing torture but the rack itself though not admitted in the ordinary execution of justice was frequently used upon any suspicion by authority of a warrant from a secretary or the privy council Even the council in the marches of Wales was empowered by their very commission to make use of torture whenever they thought proper v Rymer vol xvi p two hundred seventy nine seven Edw VI cap twenty See Sir John Davis s Question concerning Impositions p nine In fifteen eighty eight the lord mayor committed several citizens to prison because they refused to pay the loan demanded of them Murden p six hundred thirty two Harrison chap eleven v Haynes p one hundred ninety six See further La Boderie vol i p two hundred eleven There cannot be a stronger proof how lightly the rack was employed than the following story told by Lord Bacon We shall give it in his own words The queen was mightily incensed against Haywarde on account of a book he dedicated to Lord Essex being a story of the first year of Henry IV thinking it a seditious prelude to put into the people s heads boldness and faction she said she had an opinion that there was treason in it and asked me if I could not find any places in it that might be drawn within the case of treason Whereto I answered For treason sure I found none but for felony very many and when her majesty hastily asked me Wherein I told her the author had committed very apparent theft for he had taken most of the sentences of Cornelius Tacitus and translated them into English and put them into his text And another time when the queen could not be persuaded that it was his writing whose name was to it but that it had some more mischievous author and said with great indignation that she would have him racked to produce his author I replied Nay madam he is a doctor never rack his person but rack his style let him have pen ink and paper and help of books and be enjoined to continue the story where it breaketh off and I will undertake by collating the styles to judge whether he were the author or no Thus had it not been for Bacon s humanity or rather his wit this author a man of letters had been put to the rack for a most innocent performance His real offence was his dedicating a book to that munificent patron of the learned the earl of Essex at a time when this nobleman lay under her majesty s displeasure To our apprehension Haywarde s book seems rather to have a contrary tendency For he has there preserved the famous speech of the bishop of Carlisle which contains in the most express terms the doctrine of passive obedience But Queen Elizabeth was very difficult to please on this head Cabala p eighty one anciently common of fining imprisoning or otherwise punishing the jurors merely at the discretion of the court for finding a verdict contrary to the direction of these dependent judges it is obvious that juries were then no manner of security to the liberty of the subject The queen s menace of trying and punishing Haywarde for treason could easily have been executed let his book have been ever so innocent While so many terrors hung over the people no jury durst have acquitted a man when the court was resolved to have him condemned The practice also of not confronting witnesses with the prisoner gave the crown lawyers all imaginable advantage against him And indeed there scarcely occurs an instance during all these reigns that the sovereign or the ministers were ever disappointed in the issue of a prosecution Timid juries and judges who held their offices during pleasure never failed to second all the views of the crown The power of pressing both for sea and land service and obliging any person to accept of any office however mean or unfit for him was another prerogative totally incompatible with freedom Osborne gives the following account of Elizabeth s method of employing this prerogative In case she found any likely to interrupt her occasions says he she did seasonably prevent him by a chargeable employment abroad or putting him upon some service at home which she knew least grateful to the people contrary to a false maxim since practised with far worse success by such princes as thought it better husbandry to buy off enemies than reward friends The practice with which Osborne reproaches the two immediate successors of Elizabeth proceeded partly from the extreme difficulty of their situation partly from the greater lenity of their disposition The power of pressing as may naturally be imagined was often abused in other respects by men of inferior rank and officers often exacted money for freeing persons from the service Page three hundred ninety two Murden p one hundred eighty one The government of England during that age however different in other particulars bore in this respect some resemblance to that of Turkey at present the sovereign possessed every power except that of imposing taxes and in both countries this limitation unsupported by other privileges appears rather prejudicial to the people In Turkey it obliges the sultan to permit the extortion of the pashas and governors of provinces from whom he afterwards squeezes presents or takes forfeitures in England it engaged the queen to erect monopolies and grant patents for exclusive trade an invention so pernicious that had she gone on during a tract of years at her own rate England the seat of riches and arts and commerce would have contained at present as little industry as Morocco or the coast of Barbary We may further observe that this valuable privilege valuable only because it proved afterwards the means by which the parliament extorted all their other privileges was very much encroached on in an indirect manner during the reign of Elizabeth as well as of her predecessors She often exacted loans from her people an arbitrary and unequal kind of imposition and which individuals felt severely for though the money had been regularly repaid which was seldom the case it lay in the prince s hands without interest which was a sensible loss to the persons from whom the money was borrowed There remains a proposal made by Lord Burleigh for levying a general loan on the people equivalent to a subsidy a scheme which would have laid the burden more equally but which was in different words a taxation imposed without consent of parliament It is remarkable that the scheme thus proposed without any visible necessity by that wise minister is the very same which Henry VIII executed and which Charles I enraged by ill usage from his parliament and reduced to the greatest difficulties put afterwards in practice to the great discontent of the nation The demand of benevolence was another invention of that age for taxing the people This practice was so little conceived to be irregular that the commons in fifteen eighty five offered the queen a benevolence which she very generously refused as having no occasion at that time for money Queen Mary also by an order of council increased the customs in some branches and her sister imitated the example v There was a species of ship money imposed at the time of the Spanish invasion the several ports were required to equip a certain number of vessels at their own charge and such was the alacrity of the people for the public defence that some of the ports particularly London sent double the number demanded of them v Bacon vol iv p three hundred sixty two In the second of Richard II it was enacted that in loans which the king shall require of his subjects upon letters of privy seal such as have reasonable excuse of not lending may there be received without further summons travel or grief See Cotton s Abridg p one hundred seventy By this law the king s prerogative of exacting loans was ratified and what ought to be deemed a reasonable excuse was still left in his own breast to determine Haynes p five hundred eighteen five hundred nineteen D Ewes p four hundred ninety four v Bacon vol iv p three hundred sixty two v Monson p two hundred sixty seven When any levies were made for Ireland France or the Low Countries the queen obliged the counties to levy the soldiers to arm and clothe them and carry them to the seaports at their own charge New year s gifts were at that time expected from the nobility and from the more considerable gentry Purveyance and preemption were also methods of taxation unequal arbitrary and oppressive The whole kingdom sensibly felt the burden of those impositions and it was regarded as a great privilege conferred on Oxford and Cambridge to prohibit the purveyors from taking any commodities within five miles of these universities The queen victualled her navy by means of this prerogative during the first years of he reign Wardship was the most regular and legal of all these impositions by prerogative yet was it a great badge of slavery and oppressive to all the considerable families When an estate devolved to a female the sovereign obliged her to marry anyone he pleased whether the heir were male or female the crown enjoyed the whole profit of the estate during the minority The giving of a rich wardship was a usual method of rewarding a courtier or favorite The inventions were endless which arbitrary power might employ for the extorting of money while the people imagined that their property was secured by the crown s being debarred from imposing taxes Strype has preserved a speech of Lord Burleigh to the queen and council in which are contained some particulars not a little extraordinary Strype s Memoirs vol i p one hundred thirty seven Camden p three hundred eighty eight Annals vol iv p two hundred thirty four et seq Burleigh proposes that she should erect a court for the correction of all abuses and should confer on the commissioners a general inquisitorial power over the whole kingdom He sets before her the example of her wise grandfather Henry VII who by such methods extremely augmented his revenue and he recommends that this new court should proceed as well by the direction and ordinary course of the laws as by virtue of her majesty s supreme regiment and absolute power from whence law proceeded In a word he expects from this institution greater accession to the royal treasure than Henry VIII derived from the abolition of the abbeys and all the forfeitures of ecclesiastical revenues This project of Lord Burleigh s needs not I think any comment A form of government must be very arbitrary indeed where a wise and good minister could make such a proposal to the sovereign Embargoes on merchandise was another engine of royal power by which the English princes were able to extort money from the people We have seen instances in the reign of Mary Elizabeth before her coronation issued an order to the custom house prohibiting the sale of all crimson silks which should be imported till the court were first supplied She expected no doubt a good pennyworth from the merchants while they lay under this restraint The parliament pretended to the right of enacting laws as well as of granting subsidies but this privilege was during that age still more insignificant than the other Queen Elizabeth expressly prohibited them from meddling either with state matters or ecclesiastical causes and she openly sent the members to prison who dared to transgress her imperial edict in these particulars There passed few sessions of parliament during her reign where there occur not instances of this arbitrary conduct But the legislative power of the parliament was a mere fallacy while the sovereign was universally acknowledged to possess a dispensing power by which all the laws could be invalidated and rendered of no effect The exercise of this power was also an indirect method practised for erecting monopolies Where the statutes laid any branch of manufacture under restrictions the sovereign by exempting one person from the laws gave him in effect the monopoly of that commodity There was no grievance at that time more universally complained of than the frequent dispensing with the penal laws But in reality the crown possessed the full legislative power by means of proclamations which might affect any matter even of the greatest importance and which the star chamber took care to see more rigorously executed than the laws themselves The motives for these proclamations were sometimes frivolous and even ridiculous Queen Elizabeth had taken offence at the smell of woad and she issued an edict prohibiting any one from cultivating that useful plant Strype vol i p twenty seven Rymer tom xv p seven hundred fifty six D Ewes p six hundred forty five Murden p three hundred twenty five Townsend s Journals p two hundred fifty Stow s Annals She was also pleased to take offence at the long swords and high ruffs then in fashion she sent about her officers to break every man s sword and clip every man s ruff which was beyond a certain dimension This practice resembles the method employed by the great Czar Peter to make his subjects change their garb The queen s prohibition of the prophesyings or the assemblies instituted for fanatical prayers and conferences was founded on a better reason but shows still the unlimited extent of her prerogative Any number of persons could not meet together in order to read the Scriptures and confer about religion though in ever so orthodox a manner without her permission There were many other branches of prerogative incompatible with an exact or regular enjoyment of liberty None of the nobility could marry without permission from the sovereign The queen detained the earl of Southampton long in prison because he privately married the earl of Essex s cousin No man could travel without the consent of the prince Sir William Evers underwent a severe persecution because he had presumed to pay a private visit to the king of Scots The sovereign even assumed a supreme and uncontrolled authority over all foreign trade and neither allowed any person to enter or depart the kingdom nor any commodity to be imported or exported without his consent The parliament in the thirteenth of the queen praised her for not imitating the practice usual among her predecessors of stopping the course of justice by particular warrants v There could not possibly be a greater abuse nor a stronger mark of arbitrary power and the queen in refraining from it was very laudable But she was by no means constant in this reserve There remain in the public records some warrants of hers for exempting particular persons from all law suits and prosecutions v If and these warrants she says she grants from her royal prerogative which she will not allow to be disputed Townsend s Journals p two hundred fifty Stow s Annals Strype vol i p six hundred three Birch s Memoirs vol ii p four hundred twenty two Birch s Memoirs vol ii p five hundred eleven Sir John Davis s Question concerning Impositions passim v D Ewes p one hundred forty one v Rymer tom xv p six hundred fifty two seven hundred eight seven hundred seventy seven It was very usual in Queen Elizabeth s reign and probably in all the preceding reigns for noblemen or privy counsellors to commit to prison any one who had happened to displease them by suing for his just debts and the unhappy person though he gained his cause in the courts of justice was commonly obliged to relinquish his property in order to obtain his liberty Some likewise who had been delivered from prison by the judges were again committed to custody in secret places without any possibility of obtaining relief and even the officers and serjeants of the courts of law were punished for executing the writs in favor of these persons Nay it was usual to send for people by pursuivants a kind of harpies who then attended the orders of the council and high commission and they were brought up to London and constrained by imprisonment not only to withdraw their lawful suits but also to pay the pursuivants great sums of money The judges in the thirty fourth of the queen complain to her majesty of the frequency of this practice It is probable that so egregious a tyranny was carried no farther down than the reign of Elizabeth since the parliament who presented the petition of right found no later instances of it And even these very judges of Elizabeth who thus protect the people against the tyranny of the great expressly allow that a person committed by special command of the queen is not bailable It is easy to imagine that in such a government no justice could by course of law be obtained of the sovereign unless he were willing to allow it In the naval expedition undertaken by Raleigh and Frobisher against the Spaniards in the year fifteen ninety two a very rich carrack was taken worth two hundred thousand pounds The queen s share in the adventure was only a tenth but as the prize was so great and exceeded so much the expectation of all the adventurers she was determined not to rest contented with her share Raleigh humbly and earnestly begged her to accept of a hundred thousand pounds in lieu of all demands or rather extortions and says that the present which the proprietors were willing to make her of eighty thousand pounds was the greatest that ever prince received from a subject Rushworth vol i p five hundred eleven Franklyn s Annals p two hundred fifty two hundred fifty one Strype vol iv p one hundred twenty eight one hundred twenty nine But it is no wonder the queen in her administration should pay so little regard to liberty while the parliament itself in enacting laws was entirely negligent of it The persecuting statutes which they passed against Papists and Puritans are extremely contrary to the genius of freedom and by exposing such multitudes to the tyranny of priests and bigots accustomed the people to the most disgraceful subjection Their conferring an unlimited supremacy on the queen or what is worse acknowledging her inherent right to it was another proof of their voluntary servitude The law of the twenty third of her reign making seditious words against the queen capital is also a very tyrannical statute and a use no less tyrannical was sometimes made of it The case of Udal a Puritanical clergyman seems singular even in those arbitrary times This man had published a book called a Demonstration of Discipline in which he inveighed against the government of bishops and though he had carefully endeavored to conceal his name he was thrown into prison upon suspicion and brought to a trial for this offence It was pretended that the bishops were part of the queen s political body and to speak against them was really to attack her and was therefore felony by the statute This was not the only iniquity to which Udal was exposed The judges would not allow the jury to determine any thing but the fact whether Udal had written the book or not without examining his intention or the import of the words In order to prove the fact the crown lawyers did not produce a single witness to the court they only read the testimony of two persons absent one of whom said that Udal had told him he was the author another that a friend of Udal s had said so They would not allow Udal to produce any exculpatory evidence which they said was never to be permitted against the crown And they tendered him an oath by which he was required to depose that he was not the author of the book and his refusal to make that deposition was employed as the strongest proof of his guilt It is almost needless to add that notwithstanding these multiplied iniquities a verdict of death was given by the jury against Udal for as the queen was extremely bent upon his prosecution it was impossible he could escape He died in prison before execution of the sentence It was never fully established that the prisoner could legally produce evidence against the crown till after the revolution See Blackstone s Commentaries vol iv p three hundred fifty two State Trials vol i p one hundred forty four Strype voL iv p twenty one Strype s Life of Whitgift p three hundred forty three The case of Penry was if possible still hardier This man was a zealous Puritan or rather a Brownist a small sect which afterwards increased and received the name of Independents He had written against the hierarchy several tracts such as Martin Marprelate Theses Martinianae and other compositions full of low scurrility and petulant satire After concealing himself for some years he was seized and as the statute against seditious words required that the criminal should be tried within a year after committing the offence he could not be indicted for his printed books He was therefore tried for some papers found in his pocket as if he had thereby scattered sedition It was also imputed to him by the lord keeper Puckering that in some of these papers he had only acknowledged her majesty s royal power to establish laws ecclesiastical and civil but had avoided the usual terms of making enacting decreeing and ordaining laws which imply says the lord keeper a most absolute authority Penry for these offences was condemned and executed Thus we have seen that the most absolute authority of the sovereign to make use of the lord keeper s expression was established on above twenty branches of prerogative which are now abolished and which were every one of them totally incompatible with the liberty of the subject But what insured more effectually the slavery of the people than even these branches of prerogative was the established principles of the times which attributed to the prince such an unlimited and indefeasible power as was supposed to be the origin of all law and could be circumscribed by none The homilies published for the use of the clergy and which they were enjoined to read every Sunday in all the churches inculcate every where a blind and unlimited passive obedience to the prince which on no account and under no pretence is it ever lawful for subjects in the smallest article to depart from or infringe Much noise has been made because some court chaplains during the succeeding reigns were permitted to preach such doctrines but there is a great difference between these sermons and discourses published by authority avowed by the prince and council and promulgated to the whole nation Strype s Life of Whitgift book iv chap eleven Neal vol i p five hundred sixty four Strype s Annals vol iv p one hundred seventy seven Gifford a clergyman was suspended in the year fifteen eighty four for preaching up a limited obedience to the civil magistrate Neal vol i p four hundred thirty five So thoroughly were these principles imbibed by the people during the reigns of Elizabeth and her predecessors that opposition to them was regarded as the most flagrant sedition and was not even rewarded by that public praise and approbation which can alone support men under such dangers and difficulties as attend the resistance of tyrannical authority It was only during the next generation that the noble principles of liberty took root and spreading themselves under the shelter of Puritanical absurdities became fashionable among the people It is worth remarking that the advantage usually ascribed to absolute monarchy a greater regularity of police and a more strict execution of the laws did not attend the former English government though in many respects it fell under that denomination A demonstration of this truth is contained in a judicious paper which is preserved by Strype and which was written by an eminent justice of peace of Somersetshire in the year fifteen ninety six near the end of the queen s reign when the authority of that princess may be supposed to be fully corroborated by time and her maxims of government improved by long practice It is remarkable that in all the historical plays of Shakspeare where the manners and characters and even the transactions of the several reigns are so exactly copied there is scarcely any mention of civil liberty which some pretended historians have imagined to be the object of all the ancient quarrels insurrections and civil wars In the elaborate panegyric of England contained in the tragedy of Richard II and the detail of its advantages not a word of its civil constitution as anywise different from or superior to that of other European kingdoms an omission which cannot be supposed in any English author that wrote since the restoration at least since the revolution Annals vol iv p two hundred ninety This paper contains an account of the disorders which then prevailed in the county of Somerset The author says that forty persons had there been executed in a year for robberies thefts and other felonies thirty five burnt in the hand thirty seven whipped one hundred and eighty three discharged that those who were discharged were most wicked and desperate persons who never could come to any good because they would not work and none would take them into service that notwithstanding this great number of indictments the fifth part of the felonies committed in the county were not brought to trial the greater number escaped censure either from the superior cunning of the felons the remissness of the magistrates or the foolish lenity of the people that the rapines committed by the infinite number of wicked wandering idle people were intolerable to the poor countrymen and obliged them to keep a perpetual watch over their sheepfolds their pastures their woods and their cornfields that the other counties of England were in no better condition than Somersetshire and many of them were even in a worse that there were at least three or four hundred able bodied vagabonds in every county who lived by theft and rapine and who sometimes met in troops to the number of sixty and committed spoil on the inhabitants that if all the felons of this kind were assembled they would be able if reduced to good subjection to give the greatest enemy her majesty has a strong battle and that the magistrates themselves were intimidated from executing the laws upon them and there were instances of justices of peace who after giving sentence against rogues had interposed to stop the execution of their own sentence on account of the danger which hung over them from the confederates of these felons In the year fifteen seventy five the queen complained in parliament of the bad execution of the laws and threatened that if the magistrates were not for the future more vigilant she would intrust authority to indigent and needy persons who would find an interest in a more exact administration of justice It appears that she was as good as her word For in the year sixteen oh one there were great complaints made in parliament of the rapine of justices of peace and a member said that this magistrate was an animal who for half a dozen of chickens would dispense with a dozen of penal statutes It is not easy to account for this relaxation of government and neglect of police during a reign of so much vigor as that of Elizabeth The small revenue of the crown is the most likely cause that can be assigned The queen had it not in her power to interest a great number in assisting her to execute the laws thirty nine D Ewes p two hundred thirty four D Ewes p six hundred sixty one six hundred ninety four See note MM at the end of the volume On the whole the English have no reason from the example of their ancestors to be in love with the picture of absolute monarchy or to prefer the unlimited authority of the prince and his unbounded prerogatives to that noble liberty that sweet equality and that happy security by which they are at present distinguished above all nations in the universe The utmost that can be said in favor of the government of that age and perhaps it may be said with truth is that the power of the prince though really unlimited was exercised after the European manner and entered not into every part of the administration that the instances of a high exerted prerogative were not so frequent as to render property sensibly insecure or reduce the people to a total servitude that the freedom from faction the quickness of execution and the promptitude of those measures which could be taken for offence or defence made some compensation for the want of a legal and determinate liberty that as the prince commanded no mercenary army there was a tacit check on him which maintained the government in that medium to which the people had been accustomed and that this situation of England though seemingly it approached nearer was in reality more remote from a despotic and Eastern monarchy than the present government of that kingdom where the people though guarded by multiplied laws are totally naked defenceless and disarmed and besides are not secured by any middle power or independent powerful nobility interposed between them and the monarch We shall close the present Appendix with a brief account of the revenues the military force the commerce the arts and the learning of England during this period Queen Elizabeth s economy was remarkable and in some instances seemed to border on avarice The smallest expense if it could possibly be spared appeared considerable in her eyes and even the charge of an express during the most delicate transactions was not below her notice She was also attentive to every profit and embraced opportunities of gain which may appear somewhat extraordinary She kept for instance the see of Ely vacant nineteen years in order to retain the revenue and it was usual with her when she promoted a bishop to take the opportunity of pillaging the see of some of its manors Birch s Negot p twenty one Strype vol iv p three hundred fifty one Strype vol iv p two hundred fifteen There is a curious letter of the queen s written to a bishop of Ely and preserved in the register of that see It is in these words Proud prelate I understand you are backward in complying with your agreement but I would have you know that I who made you what you are can unmake you and if you do not forthwith fulfil your engagement by God I will immediately unfrock you Yours as you demean yourself Elizabeth The bishop it seems had promised to exchange some part of the land belonging to the see for a pretended equivalent and did so but it was in consequence of the above letter Annual Register seventeen sixty one p fifteen But that in reality there was little of no avarice in the queen s temper appears from this circumstance that she never amassed any treasure and even refused subsidies from the parliament when she had no present occasion for them Yet we must not conclude from this circumstance that her economy proceeded from a tender concern for her people she loaded them with monopolies and exclusive patents which are much more oppressive than the most heavy taxes levied in an equal and regular manner The real source of her frugal conduct was derived from her desire of independency and her care to preserve her dignity which would have been endangered had she reduced herself to the necessity of having frequent recourse to parliamentary supplies In consequence of this motive the queen though engaged in successful and necessary wars thought it more prudent to make a continual dilapidation of the royal demesnes than demand the most moderate supplies from the commons As she lived unmarried and had no posterity she was content to serve her present turn though at the expense of her successors who by reason of this policy joined to other circumstances found themselves on a sudden reduced to the most extreme indigence The splendor of a court was during this age a great part of the public charge and as Elizabeth was a single woman and expensive in no kind of magnificence except clothes this circumstance enabled her to perform great things by her narrow revenue She is said to have paid four millions of debt left on the crown by her father brother and sister an incredible sum for that age The states at the time of her death owed her about eight hundred thousand pounds and the king of France four hundred and fifty thousand Rymer tom xvi p one hundred forty one D Ewes p one hundred fifty one billion four hundred fifty seven million five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred twenty nine Bacon vol iv p three hundred sixty three D Ewes p four hundred seventy three I think it impossible to reconcile this account of the public debts with that given by Strype Eccles Mem vol ii p three hundred forty four that in the year fifteen fifty three the crown owed but three hundred thousand pounds I own that this last sum appears a great deal more likely The whole revenue of Queen Elizabeth would not in ten years have paid four millions Winwood vol i p twenty nine fifty four Though that prince was extremely frugal and after the peace of Vervins was continually amassing treasure the queen never could by the most pressing importunities prevail on him to make payment of those sums which she had so generously advanced him during his greatest distresses One payment of twenty thousand crowns and another of fifty thousand were all she could obtain by the strongest representations she could make of the difficulties to which the rebellion in Ireland had reduced her The queen expended on the wars with Spain between the years fifteen eighty nine and fifteen ninety three the sum of one million three hundred thousand pounds besides the pittance of a double subsidy amounting to two hundred and eighty thousand pounds granted her by parliament In the year fifteen ninety nine she spent six hundred thousand pounds in six months on the service of Ireland Sir Robert Cecil affirmed that in ten years Ireland cost her three millions four hundred thousand pounds She gave the earl of Essex a present of thirty thousand pounds upon his departure for the government of that kingdom v Lord Burleigh computed that the value of the gifts conferred on that favorite amounted to three hundred thousand pounds a sum which though probably exaggerated is a proof of her strong affection towards him It was a common saying during this reign The queen pays bountifully though she rewards sparingly v It is difficult to compute exactly the queen s ordinary revenue but it certainly fell much short of five hundred thousand pounds a year v In the year fifteen ninety she raised the customs from fourteen thousand pounds a year to fifty thousand and obliged Sir Thomas Smith who had farmed them to refund some of his former profits v Winwood vol i p one hundred seventeen one hundred ninety five D Ewes p four hundred eighty three Camden p one hundred sixty seven Appendix to the Earl of Essex s Apology v Birch s Memoirs vol ii v Nanton s Regalia chap one v Franklyn in his Annals p nine says that the profit of the kingdom besides wards and the duchy of Lancaster which amounted to about one hundred and twenty thousand pounds was one hundred and eighty eight thousand one hundred and ninety seven pounds the crown lands seem to be comprehended in this computation v Camden p five hundred fifty eight This account of Camden is difficult or impossible to be reconciled to the state of the customs in the beginning of the subsequent reign as they appear in the journals of the commons See Hist of James chap forty six This improvement of the revenue was owing to the suggestions of one Caermarthen and was opposed by Burleigh Leicester and Walsingham but the queen s perseverance overcame all their opposition The great undertakings which she executed with so narrow a revenue and with such small supplies from her people prove the mighty effects of wisdom and economy She received from the parliament during the course of her whole reign only twenty subsidies and thirty nine fifteenths I pretend not to determine exactly the amount of these supplies because the value of a subsidy was continually falling and in the end of her reign it amounted only to eighty thousand pounds though in the beginning it had been a hundred and twenty thousand If we suppose that the supplies granted Elizabeth during a reign of forty five years amounted to three millions we shall not probably be much wide of the truth This sum makes only sixty six thousand six hundred and sixty six pounds a year and it is surprising that while the queen s demands were so moderate and her expenses so well regulated she should ever have found any difficulty in obtaining a supply from parliament or be reduced to make sale of the crown lands But such was the extreme I had almost said absurd parsimony of the parliaments during that period D Ewes p six hundred thirty Lord Salisbury computed these supplies only at two millions eight hundred thousand pounds Journ seventeenth Feb sixteen oh nine King James was certainly mistaken when he estimated the queen s annual supplies at one hundred and thirty seven thousand pounds Franklyn p forty four It is curious to observe that the minister in the war begun in seventeen fifty four was in some periods allowed to lavish in two months as great a sum as was granted by parliament to Queen Elizabeth in forty five years The extreme frivolous object of the late war and the great importance of hers set this matter in still a stronger light Money too we may observe was in most particulars of the same value in both periods she paid eight pence a day to every foot soldier But our late delusions have much exceeded any thing known in history not even excepting those of the crusades For I suppose there is no mathematical still less an arithmetical demonstration that the road to the Holy Land was not the road to paradise as there is that the endless increase of national debts is the direct road to national ruin But having now completely reached that goal it is needless at present to reflect on the past It will be found in the present year seventeen seventy six that all the revenues of this island north of Trent and west of Reading are mortgaged or anticipated forever Could the small remainder be in a worse condition were those provinces seized by Austria and Prussia There is only this difference that some event might happen in Europe which would oblige these great monarchs to disgorge their acquisitions But no imagination can figure a situation which will induce our creditors to relinquish their claims or the public to seize their revenues So egregious indeed has been our folly that we have even lost all title to compassion in the numberless calamities that are awaiting us They valued nothing in comparison of their money the members had no connection with the court and the very idea which they conceived of the trust committed to them was to reduce the demands of the crown and to grant as few supplies as possible The crown on the other hand conceived the parliament in no other light than as a means of supply Queen Elizabeth made a merit to her people of seldom summoning parliaments No redress of grievances was expected from these assemblies they were supposed to meet for no other purpose than to impose taxes Before the reign of Elizabeth the English princes had usually recourse to the city of Antwerp for voluntary loans and their credit was so low that besides paying the high interest of ten or twelve per cent they were obliged to make the city of London join in the security Sir Thomas Gresham that great and enterprising merchant one of the chief ornaments of this reign engaged the company of merchant adventurers to grant a loan to the queen and as the money was regularly repaid her credit by degrees established itself in the city and she shook off this dependence on foreigners In the year fifteen fifty nine however the queen employed Gresham to borrow for her two hundred thousand pounds at Antwerp in order to enable her to reform the coin which was at that time extremely debased She was so impolitic as to make herself an innovation in the coin by dividing a pound of silver into sixty two shillings instead of sixty the former standard This is the last time that the coin has been tampered with in England Strype vol iv p one hundred twenty four Stowe s Survey of London book i p two hundred eighty six MS of Lord Royston s from the paper office p two hundred ninety five Queen Elizabeth sensible how much the defence of her kingdom depended on its naval power was desirous to encourage commerce and navigation but as her monopolies tended to extinguish all domestic industry which is much more valuable than foreign trade and is the foundation of it the general train of her conduct was ill calculated to serve the purpose at which she aimed much less to promote the riches of her people The exclusive companies also were an immediate check on foreign trade Yet notwithstanding these discouragements the spirit of the age was strongly bent on naval enterprises and besides the military expeditions against the Spaniards many attempts were made for new discoveries and many new branches of foreign commerce were opened by the English Sir Martin Frobisher undertook three fruitless voyages to discover the north west passage Davis not discouraged by this ill success made a new attempt when he discovered the straits which pass by his name In the year sixteen hundred the queen granted the first patent to the East India Company the stock of that company was seventy two thousand pounds and they fitted out four ships under the command of James Lancaster for this new branch of trade The adventure was successful and the ships returning with a rich cargo encouraged the company to continue the commerce The communication with Muscovy had been opened in Queen Mary s time by the discovery of the passage to Archangel but the commerce to that country did not begin to be carried on to a great extent till about the year fifteen sixty nine The queen obtained from the czar an exclusive patent to the English for the whole trade of Muscovy and she entered into a personal as well as national alliance with him This czar was named John Basilides a furious tyrant who continually suspecting the revolt of his subjects stipulated to have a safe retreat and protection in England In order the better to insure this resource he purposed to marry an English woman and the queen intended to have sent him Lady Anne Hastings daughter of the earl of Huntingdon but when the lady was informed of the barbarous manners of the country she wisely declined purchasing an empire at the expense of her ease and safety The English encouraged by the privileges which they had obtained from Basilides ventured farther into those countries than any Europeans had formerly done They transported their goods along the River Dwina in boats made of one entire tree which they towed and rowed up the stream as far as Walogda Thence they carried their commodities seven days journey by land to Yeraslau and then down the Volga to Astracan At Astracan they built ships crossed the Caspian Sea and distributed their manufactures into Persia But this bold attempt met with such discouragements that it was never renewed Camden p four hundred eight Camden p four hundred ninety three Camden p four hundred eighteen After the death of John Basilides his son Theodore revoked the patent which the English enjoyed for a monopoly of the Russian trade when the queen remonstrated against this innovation he told her ministers that princes must carry an indifferent hand as well between their subjects as between foreigners and not convert trade which by the laws of nations ought to be common to all into a monopoly for the private gain of a few So much juster notions of commerce were entertained by this barbarian than appear in the conduct of the renowned Queen Elizabeth Theodore however continued some privileges to the English on account of their being the discoverers of the communication between Europe and his country The trade to Turkey commenced about the year fifteen eighty three and that commerce was immediately confined to a company by Queen Elizabeth Before that time the grand seignior had always conceived England to be a dependent province of France but having heard of the queen s power and reputation he gave a good reception to the English and even granted them larger privileges than he had given to the French Camden p four hundred ninety three Birch s Memoirs vol i p thirty six The merchants of the Hanse Towns complained loudly in the beginning of Elizabeth s reign of the treatment which they had received in the reigns of Edward and Mary She prudently replied that as she would not innovate any thing she would still protect them in the immunities and privileges of which she found them possessed This answer not contenting them their commerce was soon after suspended for a time to the great advantage of the English merchants who tried what they could themselves effect for promoting their commerce They took the whole trade into their own hands and their returns proving successful they divided themselves into staplers and merchant adventurers the former residing constantly at one place the latter trying their fortunes in other towns and states abroad with cloth and other manufactures This success so enraged the Hanse Towns that they tried all the methods which a discontented people could devise to draw upon the English merchants the ill opinion of other nations and states They prevailed so far as to obtain an imperial edict by which the English were prohibited all commerce in the empire the queen by way of retaliation retained sixty of their ships which had been seized in the River Tagus with contraband goods of the Spaniards These ships the queen intended to have restored as desiring to have compromised all differences with those trading cities but when she was informed that a general assembly was held at Lubec in order to concert measures for distressing the English trade she caused the ships and cargoes to be confiscated only two of them were released to carry home the news and to inform these states that she had the greatest contempt imaginable for all their proceedings Henry VIII in order to fit out a navy was obliged to hire ships from Hamburgh Lubec Dantzic Genoa and Venice but Elizabeth very early in her reign put affairs upon a better footing both by building some ships of her own and by encouraging the merchants to build large trading vessels which on occasion were converted into ships of war In the year fifteen eighty two the seamen in England were found to be fourteen thousand two hundred and ninety five men the number of vessels twelve hundred and thirty two of which there were only two hundred and seventeen above eighty tons Monson pretends that though navigation decayed in the first years of James I by the practice of the merchants who carried on their trade in foreign bottoms yet before the year sixteen forty this number of seamen was tripled in England v The navy which the queen left at her decease appears considerable when we reflect only on the number of vessels which were forty two but when we consider that none of these ships carried above forty guns that four only came up to that number that there were but two ships of a thousand tons and twenty three below five hundred some of fifty and some even of twenty tons and that the whole number of guns belonging to the fleet was seven hundred and seventy four v we must entertain a contemptible idea of the English navy compared to the force which it has now attained In the year fifteen eighty eight there were not above five vessels fitted out by the noblemen and seaports which exceeded two hundred tons v forty Lives of the Admirals vol i p four hundred seventy Camden p three

higher idea of the power of England than this sudden armament In the year fifteen seventy five all the militia in the kingdom were computed at a hundred and eighty two thousand nine hundred and twenty nine A distribution was made in the year fifteen ninety five of a hundred and forty thousand men besides those which Wales could supply These armies were formidable by their numbers but their discipline and experience were not proportionate Small bodies from Dunkirk and Newport frequently ran over and plundered the east coast so unfit was the militia as it was then constituted for the defence of the kingdom The lord lieutenants were first appointed to the counties in this reign mister Murden has published from the Salisbury collections a paper which contains the military force of the nation at the time of the Spanish armada and which is somewhat different from the account given by our ordinary historians It makes all the able bodied men of the kingdom amount to a hundred and eleven thousand five hundred and thirteen those armed to eighty thousand eight hundred and seventy five of whom forty four thousand seven hundred and twenty seven were trained It must be supposed that these able bodied men consisted of such only as were registered otherwise the small number is not to be accounted for Yet Sir Edward Coke said in the house of commons that he was employed about the same time together with Popham chief justice to take a survey of all the people of England and that they found them to be nine hundred thousand of all sorts This number by the ordinary rules of computation supposes that there were above two hundred thousand men able to bear arms Yet even this number is surprisingly small Can we suppose that the kingdom is six or seven times more populous at present and that Murden s was the real number of men excluding Catholics and children and infirm persons Lives of the Admirals vol i p four hundred thirty two Strype vol iv p two hundred twenty one Page six hundred eight Journ twenty five April sixteen twenty one Harrison says that in the musters taken in the years fifteen seventy four and fifteen seventy five the men fit for service amounted to one million one hundred and seventy two thousand six hundred and seventy four yet was it believed that a full third was omitted Such uncertainty and contradiction are there in all these accounts Notwithstanding the greatness of this number the same author complains much of the decay of populousness a vulgar complaint in all places and all ages Guicciardini makes the inhabitants of England in this reign amount to two millions Whatever opinion we may form of the comparative populousness of England in different periods it must be allowed that abstracting from the national debt there is a prodigious increase of power in that more perhaps than in any other European state since the beginning of the last century It would be no paradox to affirm that Ireland alone could at present exert a greater force than all the three kingdoms were capable of at the death of Queen Elizabeth And we might go further and assert that one good county in England is able to make at least to support a greater effort than the whole kingdom was capable of in the reign of Henry V when the maintenance of a garrison in a small town like Calais formed more than a third of the ordinary national expense Such are the effects of liberty industry and good government The state of the English manufactures was at this time very low and foreign wares of almost all kinds had the preference About the year fifteen ninety there were in London four persons only rated in the subsidy books so high as four hundred pounds This computation is not indeed to be deemed an exact estimate of their wealth In fifteen sixty seven there were found on inquiry to be four thousand eight hundred and fifty one strangers of all nations in London of whom three thousand eight hundred and thirty eight were Flemings and only fifty eight Scots The persecutions in France and the Low Countries drove afterwards a greater number of foreigners into England and the commerce as well as manufactures of that kingdom was very much improved by them It was then that Sir Thomas Gresham built at his own charge the magnificent fabric of the Exchange for the reception of the merchants the queen visited it and gave it the appellation of the Royal Exchange D Ewes p five hundred five D Ewes p four hundred ninety seven Haynes p four hundred sixty one four hundred sixty two Stowe p six hundred sixty eight By a lucky accident in

the great advance of France above England in commerce doctor Howell says that Queen Elizabeth in the third of her reign was presented with a pair of black silk knit stockings by her silk woman and never wore cloth hose any more The author of the Present State of England says that about fifteen seventy seven pocket watches were first brought into England from Germany They are thought to have been invented at Nurem berg About fifteen eighty the use of coaches was introduced by the earl of Arundel Before that time the queen on public occasions rode behind her chamberlain Camden says that in fifteen eighty one Randolph so much employed by the queen in foreign embassies possessed the office of postmaster general of England It appears therefore that posts were then established though from Charles I s regulations in sixteen thirty five it would seem that few post houses were erected before that time In a remonstrance of the Hanse Towns to the diet of the empire in fifteen eighty two it is affirmed that England exported annually about two hundred thousand pieces of cloth This number seems to be much exaggerated In the fifth of this reign was enacted the first law for the relief of the poor A judicious author of that age confirms the vulgar observation that the kingdom was depopulating from the increase of enclosures and decay of tillage and he ascribes the reason very justly to the restraints put oh the exportation of corn while full liberty was allowed to export all the produce of pasturage such as wool hides leather tallow et cetera These prohibitions of exportation were derived from the prerogative and were very injudicious The queen once on the commencement of her reign had tried a contrary practice and with good success From the same author we learn that the complaints renewed in our time were then very common concerning the high prices of every thing History of the World vol ii p two hundred twenty two Anderson vol i p four hundred twenty one Anderson

commodities had in general risen fifty per cent some more Cannot you neighbor remember say she that indeed to have been two periods in which prices rose remarkably in England namely that in Queen Elizabeth s reign when they are computed to have doubled and that in the present age Between the two there seems to have been a stagnation It would appear that industry during that intermediate period increased as fast as gold and silver and kept commodities nearly at a par with money There were two attempts made in this reign to settle colonies in America one by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in Newfoundland another by Sir Walter Raleigh in Virginia but neither of these projects proved successful All those noble settlements were made in the following reigns The current specie of the kingdom in the end of this reign is computed at four millions The earl of Leicester desired Sir Francis Walsingham then ambassador in France to provide him with a riding master in that country to whom he promises a hundred pounds a year besides maintaining himself and servant and a couple of horses I know adds the earl that such a man as I want may receive higher wages in France but let him consider that a shilling in England goes as far as two shillings in France It is known that every thing is much changed since that time The nobility in this age still supported in some degree the ancient magnificence in their hospitality and in the numbers of their retainers and the queen found it prudent to retrench by proclamation their expenses in this last particular The expense of hospitality she somewhat encouraged by the frequent visits she paid her nobility and the sumptuous feasts which she received from them I could in this town buy the best pig or goose I could lay my hands on for

earl had fortified this castle at great expense and it contained arms for ten thousand men The earl of Derby had a family consisting of two hundred and forty servants Stowe remarks it as a singular proof of beneficence in this nobleman that he was contented with his rent from his tenants and exacted not any extraordinary services from them a proof that the great power of the sovereign what was almost unavoidable had very generally countenanced the nobility in tyrannizing over the people Burleigh though he was frugal and had no paternal estate kept a family consisting of a hundred servants He had a standing table for gentlemen and two other tables for persons of meaner condition which were always served alike whether he were in town or in the country About his person he had people of great distinction insomuch that he could reckon up twenty gentlemen retainers who had each a thousand pounds a year and as many among his ordinary servants who were worth from a thousand pounds to three five ten and twenty thousand pounds v It is to be remarked that though the revenues of the crown were at that time very small the ministers and courtiers sometimes found means by employing the boundless prerogative to acquire greater fortunes than it is possible for them at present to amass from their larger salaries and more limited authority Burleigh entertained the queen twelve several times in his country house where she remained three four or five weeks at a time Each visit cost him two or three thousand pounds v The quantity of silver plate possessed by this nobleman is surprising no less than fourteen or fifteen thousand pounds weight v which besides the fashion would be above forty two thousand pounds sterling in value Yet Burleigh left only four thousand pounds a year in land and eleven thousand pounds in money and as land was then commonly sold at ten years purchase his plate was nearly equal to all the rest of his fortune It appears that little value was

forty But though there were preserved great remains of the ancient customs the nobility were by degrees acquiring a taste for elegant luxury and many edifices in particular were built by them neat large and sumptuous to the great ornament of the kingdom says Camden forty one but to the no less decay of the glorious hospitality of the nation It is however more reasonable to think that this new turn of expense promoted arts and industry while the ancient hospitality was the source of vice disorder sedition and idleness Among the other species of luxury that of apparel began much to increase during this age and the queen thought proper to restrain it by proclamation Her example was very little conformable to her edicts As no woman was ever more conceited of her beauty or more desirous of making impression on the hearts of beholders no one ever went to a greater extravagance in apparel or studied more the variety and richness of her dresses She appeared almost every day in a different habit and tried all the several modes by which she hoped to render herself agreeable She was also so fond of her clothes that she never could part with any of them and at her death she had in her wardrobe all the different habits to the number of three thousand which she had ever worn in her lifetime forty two See note OO at the end of the volume This appears from Burleigh s will he specifies only the number of ounces to be given to each legatee and appoints a goldsmith to see it weighed out to them without making any distinction of the pieces See note PP at the end of the volume The retrenchment of the ancient hospitality and the diminution of retainers were favorable to the prerogative of the sovereign and by disabling the great noblemen from resistance promoted the execution of the laws and extended the authority of the courts of justice There were many peculiar causes in the situation and character of Henry VII which augmented the authority of the crown most of these causes concurred in succeeding princes together with the factions in religion and the acquisition of the supremacy a most important article of prerogative but the manners of the age were a general cause which operated during this whole period and which continually tended to diminish the riches and still more the influence of the aristocracy anciently so formidable to the crown The habits of luxury dissipated the immense fortunes of the ancient barons and as the new methods of expense gave subsistence to mechanics and merchants who lived in an independent manner on the fruits of their own industry a nobleman instead of that unlimited ascendant which he was wont to assume over those who were maintained at his board or subsisted by salaries conferred on them retained only that moderate influence which customers have over tradesmen and which can never be dangerous to civil government The landed proprietors also having a greater demand for money than for men endeavored to turn their lands to the best account with regard to profit and either enclosing their fields or joining many small farms into a few large ones dismissed those useless hands which formerly were always at their call in every attempt to subvert the government or oppose a neighboring baron By all these means the cities increased the middle rank of men began to be rich and powerful the prince who in effect was the same with the law was implicitly obeyed and though the further progress of the same causes begat a new plan of liberty founded on the privileges of the commons yet in the interval between the fall of the nobles and the rise of this order the sovereign took advantage of the present situation and assumed an authority almost absolute Whatever may be commonly imagined from the authority of Lord Bacon and from that of Harrington and later authors the laws of Henry VII contributed very little towards the great revolution which happened about this period in the English constitution The practice of breaking entails by a fine and recovery had been introduced in the preceding reigns and this prince only gave indirectly a legal sanction to the practice by reforming some abuses which attended it But the settled authority which he acquired to the crown enabled the sovereign to encroach on the separate jurisdictions of the barons and produced a more general and regular execution of the laws The counties palatine underwent the same fate as the feudal powers and by a statute of Henry VIII the jurisdiction of these counties was annexed to the crown and all writs were ordained to run in the king s name But the change of manners was the chief cause of the secret revolution of government and subverted the power of the barons There appear still in this reign some remains of the ancient slavery of the boors and peasants but none afterwards Learning on its revival was held in high estimation by the English princes and nobles and as it was not yet prostituted by being too common even the great deemed it an object of ambition to attain a character for literature The four successive sovereigns Henry Edward Mary and Elizabeth may on one account or other be admitted into the class of authors Queen Catharine Parr translated a book Lady Jane Gray considering her age and her sex and her station may be regarded as a prodigy of literature Sir Thomas Smith was raised from being professor in Cambridge first to be ambassador to France then secretary of state The despatches of those times and among others those of Burleigh himself are frequently interlarded with quotations from the Greek and Latin classics Even the ladies of the court valued themselves on knowledge Lady Burleigh Lady Bacon and their two sisters were mistresses of the ancient as well as modern languages and placed more pride in their erudition than in their rank and quality Queen Elizabeth wrote and translated several books and she was familiarly acquainted with the Greek as well as Latin tongue forty three twenty seven Henry VIII c twenty four See note QQ at the end of the volume It is pretended that she made an extemporary reply in Greek to the university of Cambridge who had addressed her in that language It is certain that she answered in Latin without premeditation and in a very spirited manner to the Polish ambassador who had been wanting in respect to her When she had finished she turned about to her courtiers and said God s death my lords for she was much addicted to swearing I have been forced this day to scour up my old Latin that hath long lain rusting Speed Elizabeth even after she was queen did not entirely drop the ambition of appearing as an author and next to her desire of admiration for beauty this seems to have been the chief object of her vanity She translated Boethius of the Consolation of Philosophy in order as she pretended to allay her grief for Henry IV s change of religion As far us we can judge from Elizabeth s compositions we may pronounce that notwithstanding her application and her excellent parts her taste in literature was but indifferent she was much inferior to her successor in this particular who was himself no perfect model of eloquence Unhappily for literature at least for the learned of this age the queen s vanity lay more in shining by her own learning than in encouraging men of genius by her liberality Spenser himself the finest English writer of his age was long neglected and after the death of Sir Philip Sidney his patron was allowed to die almost for want This poet contains great beauties a sweet and harmonious versification easy elocution a fine imagination yet does the perusal of his work become so tedious that one never finishes it from the mere pleasure which it affords it soon becomes a kind of task reading and it requires some effort and resolution to carry us on to the end of his long performance This effect of which every one is conscious is usually ascribed to the change of manners but manners have more changed since Homer s age and yet that poet remains still the favorite of every reader of taste and judgment Homer copied true natural manners which however rough or uncultivated will always form an agreeable and interesting picture but the pencil of the English poet was employed in drawing the affectations and conceits and fopperies of chivalry which appear ridiculous as soon as they lose the recommendation of the mode The tediousness of continued allegory and that too seldom striking or ingenious has also contributed to render the Fairy Queen peculiarly tiresome not to mention the too great frequency of its descriptions and the languor of its stanza Upon the whole Spenser maintains his place upon the shelves among our English classics but he is seldom seen on the table and there is scarcely any one if he dares to be ingenuous but will confess that notwithstanding all the merit of the poet he affords an entertainment with which the palate is soon satiated Several writers of late have amused themselves in copying the style of Spenser and no imitation has been so indifferent as not to bear a great resemblance to the original his manner is so peculiar that it is almost impossible not to transfer some of it into the copy CHAPTER XLV Illustration one five hundred sixty jamesone jpg JAMES I JAMES I The crown of England was never transmitted from father to son with greater tranquillity than it passed from the family of Tudor to that of Stuart During the whole reign of Elizabeth the eyes of men had been employed in search of her successor and when old age made the prospect of her death more immediate there appeared none but the king of Scots who could advance any just claim or pretension to the throne He was great grandson of Margaret elder daughter of Henry VII and on the failure of the male line his hereditary right remained unquestionable If the religion of Mary queen of Scots and the other prejudices contracted against her had formed any considerable obstacle to her succession these objections being entirely personal had no place with regard to her son Men also considered that though the title derived from blood had been frequently violated since the Norman conquest such licenses had proceeded more from force or intrigue than from any deliberate maxims of government The lineal heir had still in the end prevailed and both his exclusion and restoration had been commonly attended with such convulsions as were sufficient to warn all prudent men not lightly to give way to such irregularities If the will of Henry VIII authorized by act of parliament had tacitly excluded the Scottish line the tyranny and caprices of that monarch had been so signal that a settlement of this nature unsupported by any just reason had no authority with the people Queen Elizabeth too with her dying breath had recognized the undoubted title of her kinsman James and the whole nation seemed to dispose themselves with joy and pleasure for his reception Though born and educated amidst a foreign and hostile people men hoped from his character of moderation and wisdom that he would embrace the maxims of an English monarch and the prudent foresaw greater advantages resulting from a union with Scotland than disadvantages from submitting to a prince of that nation The alacrity with which the English looked towards the successor had appeared so evident to Elizabeth that concurring with other causes it affected her with the deepest melancholy and that wise princess whose penetration and experience had given her the greatest insight into human affairs had not yet sufficiently weighed the ingratitude of courtiers and levity of the people As victory abroad and tranquillity at home had attended this princess she left the nation in such flourishing circumstances that her successor possessed every advantage except that of comparison with her illustrious name when he mounted the throne of England The king s journey from Edinburgh to London immediately afforded to the inquisitive some circumstances of comparison which even the natural partiality in favor of their new sovereign could not interpret to his advantage As he passed along all ranks of men flocked about him from every quarter allured by interest or curiosity Great were the rejoicings and loud and hearty the acclamations which resounded from all sides and every one could remember how the affability and popular manners of their queen displayed themselves amidst such concourse and exultation of her subjects But James though sociable and familiar with his friends and courtiers hated the bustle of a mixed multitude and though far from disliking flattery yet was he still fonder of tranquillity and ease He issued therefore a proclamation forbidding this resort of people on pretence of the scarcity of provisions and other inconveniencies which he said would necessarily attend it Kennet p six hundred sixty two He was not however insensible to the great flow of affection which appeared in his new subjects and being himself of an affectionate temper he seems to have been in haste to make them some return of kindness and good offices To this motive probably we are to ascribe that profusion of titles which was observed in the beginning of his reign when in six weeks time after his entrance into the kingdom he is computed to have bestowed knighthood on no less than two hundred and thirty seven persons If Elizabeth s frugality of honors as well as of money had formerly been repined at it began now to be valued and esteemed and every one was sensible that the king by his lavish and premature conferring of favors had failed of obliging the persons on whom he bestowed them Titles of all kinds became so common that they were scarcely marks of distinction and being distributed without choice or deliberation to persons unknown to the prince were regarded more as the proofs of facility and good nature than of any determined friendship or esteem A pasquinade was affixed to saint Paul s in which an art was promised to be taught very necessary to assist frail memories in retaining the names of the new nobility We may presume that the English would have thrown less blame on the king s facility in bestowing favors had these been confined entirely to their own nation and had not been shared out in too unequal proportions to his old subjects James who through his whole reign was more guided by temper and inclination than by the rules of political prudence had brought with him great numbers of his Scottish courtiers whose impatience and importunity were apt in many particulars to impose on the easy nature of their master and extort favors of which it is natural to imagine his English subjects would loudly complain The duke of Lenox the earl of Marre Lord Hume Lord Kinloss Sir George Hume Secretary Elphinstone were immediately added to the English privy council Sir George Hume whom he created earl of Dunbar was his declared favorite as long as that nobleman lived and was one of the wisest and most virtuous though the least powerful of all those whom the king ever honored with that distinction Hay some time after was created Viscount Doncaster then earl of Carlisle and got an immense fortune from the crown all which he spent in a splendid and courtly manner Ramsay obtained the title of earl of Holderness and many others being raised on a sudden to the highest elevation increased by their insolence that envy which naturally attended them as strangers and ancient enemies Wilson in Kennet p six hundred sixty five Wilson in Kennet p six hundred sixty two It must however be owned in justice to James that he left almost all the chief offices in the hands of Elizabeth s ministers and trusted the conduct of political concerns both foreign and domestic to his English subjects Among these Secretary Cecil created successively Lord Effindon Viscount Cranborne and earl of Salisbury was always regarded as his prime minister and chief counsellor Though the capacity and penetration of this minister were sufficiently known his favor with the king created surprise on the accession of that monarch The secret correspondence into which he had entered with James and which had sensibly contributed to the easy reception of that prince in England laid the foundation of Cecil s credit and while all his former associates Sir Walter Raleigh Lord Grey Lord Cobham were discountenanced on account of their animosity against Essex as well as for other reasons this minister was continued in employment and treated with the greatest confidence and regard The capacity of James and his ministers in negotiation was immediately put to trial on the appearance of ambassadors from almost all the princes and states of Europe in order to congratulate him on his accession and form with him new treaties and alliances Besides ministers from Venice Denmark the Palatinate Henry Frederic of Nassau assisted by Barnevelt the pensionary of Holland was ambassador from the states of the United Provinces Aremberg was sent by Archduke Albert and Taxis was expected in a little time from Spain But he who most excited the attention of the public both on account of his own merit and that of his master was the marquis of Rosni afterwards duke of Sully prime minister and favorite of Henry IV of France When the dominions of the house of Austria devolved on Philip II all Europe was struck with terror lest the power of a family which had been raised by fortune should now be carried to an immeasurable height by the wisdom and conduct of this monarch But never were apprehensions found in the event to be more groundless Slow without prudence ambitious without enterprise false without deceiving any body and refined without any true judgment such was the character of Philip and such the character which during his lifetime and after his death he impressed on the Spanish councils Revolted or depopulated provinces discontented or indolent inhabitants were the spectacles which those dominions lying in every climate of the globe presented to Philip III a weak prince and to the duke of Lerma a minister weak and odious But though military discipline which still remained was what alone gave some appearance of life and vigor to that languishing body yet so great was the terror produced by former power and ambition that the reduction of the house of Austria was the object of men s vows throughout all the states of Christendom It was not perceived that the French empire now united in domestic peace and governed by the most heroic and most amiable prince that adorns modern story was become of itself a sufficient counterpoise to the Spanish greatness Perhaps that prince himself did not perceive it when he proposed by his minister a league with James in conjunction with Venice the United Provinces and the northern crowns in order to attack the Austrian dominions on every side and depress the exorbitant power of that ambitious family But the genius of the English monarch was not equal to such vast enterprises The love of peace was his ruling passion and it was his peculiar felicity that the conjunctures of the times rendered the same object which was agreeable to him in the highest degree advantageous to his people The French ambassador therefore was obliged to depart from these extensive views and to concert with James the means of providing for the safety of the United Provinces nor was this object altogether without its difficulties The king before his accession had entertained scruples with regard to the revolt of the Low Countries and being commonly open and sincere he had on many occasions gone so far as to give to the Dutch the appellation of rebels but having conversed more fully with English ministers and courtiers he found their attachment to that republic so strong and their opinion of common interest so established that he was obliged to sacrifice to politics his sense of justice a quality which even when erroneous is respectable as well as rare in a monarch Sully s Memoirs La Boderie voL i p one hundred twenty Winwood vol ii p fifty five He therefore agreed with Rosni to support secretly the states general in concert with the king of France lest their weakness and despair should oblige them to submit to their old master The articles of the treaty were few and simple It was stipulated that the two kings should allow the Dutch to levy forces in their respective dominions and should underhand remit to that republic the sum of one million four hundred thousand livres a year for the pay of these forces that the whole sum should be advanced by the king of France but that the third of it should be deducted from the debt due by him to Queen Elizabeth And if the Spaniards attacked either of the princes they agreed to assist each other Henry with a force of ten thousand men James with that of six This treaty one of the wisest and most equitable concluded by James during the course of his reign was more the work of the prince himself than any of his ministers Amidst the great tranquillity both foreign and domestic with which the nation was blest nothing could be more surprising than the discovery of a conspiracy to subvert the government and to fix on the throne Arabella Stuart a near relation of the king s by the family of Lenox and descended equally from Henry VII Every thing remains still mysterious in this conspiracy and history can give us no clew to unravel it Watson and Clarke two Catholic priests were accused of the plot Lord Grey a Puritan Lord Cobham a thoughtless man of no fixed principle and Sir Walter Raleigh suspected to be of that philosophical sect who were then extremely rare in England and who have since received the appellation of Free thinkers together with these mister Broke brother to Lord Cobham Sir Griffin Markham mister Copeley Sir Edward Parham What cement could unite men of such discordant principles in so dangerous a combination what end they proposed or what means proportioned to an undertaking of this nature has never yet been explained and cannot easily be imagined As Raleigh Grey and Cobham were commonly believed after the queen s death to have opposed proclaiming the king till conditions should be made with him they were upon that account extremely obnoxious to the court and ministry and people were apt at first to suspect that the plot was merely a contrivance of Secretary Cecil to get rid of his old confederates now become his most inveterate enemies But the confession as well as trial of the criminals put the matter beyond doubt And though no one could find any marks of a concerted enterprise it appeared that men of furious and ambitious spirits meeting frequently together and believing all the world discontented like themselves had entertained very criminal projects and had even entered some of them at least into a correspondence with Aremberg the Flemish ambassador in order to give disturbance to the new settlement Sully s Memoirs State Trials p one hundred eighty twod edit Winwood vol ii p eight hundred eleven The two priests and Broke were executed Cobham Grey and Markham were pardoned after they had laid their heads upon the block Raleigh too was reprieved not pardoned and he remained in confinement many years afterwards It appears from Sully s Memoirs that Raleigh secretly offered his services to the French ambassador and we may thence presume that meeting with a repulse from that quarter he had recourse for the same unwarrantable purposes to the Flemish minister Such a conjecture we are now enabled to form but it must be confessed that on his trial there appeared no proof of this transaction nor indeed any circumstance which could justify his condemnation He was accused by Cobham alone in a sudden fit of passion upon hearing that Raleigh when examined had pointed out some circumstances by which Cobham s guilt might be known and ascertained This accusation Cobham afterwards retracted and soon after he retracted his retractation Yet upon the written evidence of this single witness a man of no honor or understanding and so contradictory in his testimony not confronted with Raleigh not supported by any concurring circumstance was that great man contrary to all law and equity found guilty by the jury His name was at that time extremely odious in England and every man was pleased to give sentence against the capital enemy of Essex the favorite of the people Sir Edward Coke the famous lawyer then attorney general managed the cause for the crown and threw out on Raleigh such gross abuse as may be deemed a great reflection not only on his own memory but even in some degree on the manners of the age Traitor monster viper and spider of hell are the terms which he employs against one of the most illustrious men of the kingdom who was under trial for life and

hundred seventy seven one hundred eighty two The next occupation of the king was entirely according to his heart s content He was employed in dictating magisterially to an assembly of divines concerning points of faith and discipline and in receiving the applauses of these holy men for his superior zeal and learning The religious disputes between the church and the Puritans had induced him to call a conference at Hampton Court on pretence of finding expedients which might reconcile both parties Though the severities of Elizabeth towards the Catholics had much weakened that party whose genius was opposite to the prevailing spirit of the nation like severities had had so little influence on the Puritans who were encouraged by that spirit that no less than seven hundred and fifty clergymen of that party signed a petition to the king on his accession and many more seemed willing to adhere to it Fuller book x Collier vol ii p six hundred seventy two They all hoped that James having received his education in Scotland and having sometimes professed an attachment to the church established there would at least abate the rigor of the laws enacted in support of the ceremonies and against Puritans if he did not show more particular grace and encouragement to that sect But the king s disposition had taken strongly a contrary bias The more he knew the Puritanical clergy the less favor he bore to them He had remarked in their Scottish brethren a violent turn towards republicanism and a zealous attachment to civil liberty principles nearly allied to that religious enthusiasm with which they were actuated He had found that being mostly persons of low birth and mean education the same lofty pretensions which attended them in their familiar addresses to their Maker of whom they believed themselves the peculiar favorites induced them to use the utmost freedoms with their earthly sovereign In both capacities of monarch and of theologian he had experienced the little complaisance which they were disposed to show him whilst they controlled his commands disputed his tenets and to his face before the whole people censured his conduct and behavior If he had submitted to the indignity of courting their favor he treasured up on that account the stronger resentment against them and was determined to make them feel in their turn the weight of his authority Though he had often met with resistance and faction and obstinacy in the Scottish nobility he retained no ill will to that order or rather showed them favor and kindness in England beyond what reason and sound policy could well justify but the ascendant which the Presbyterian clergy had assumed over him was what his monarchical pride could never thoroughly digest James ventured to say in his Basilicon Duron published while he was in Scotland I protest before the great God and since I am here as upon my Testament it is no place for me to lie in that ye shall never find with any highland or borderer thieves greater in gratitude and more lies and vile perjuries than with these fanatic spirits and suffer not the principal of them to brook your land King James s Works p one hundred sixty one He dreaded likewise the popularity which attended this order of men in both kingdoms As useless austerities and self denial are imagined in many religions to render us acceptable to a benevolent Being who created us solely for happiness James remarked that the rustic severity of these clergymen and of their whole sect had given them in the eyes of the multitude the appearance of sanctity and virtue Strongly inclined himself to mirth and wine and sports of all kinds he apprehended their censure for his manner of life free and disengaged And being thus averse from temper as well as policy to the sect of Puritans he was resolved if possible to prevent its further growth in England But it was the character of James s councils throughout his whole reign that they were more wise and equitable in their end than prudent and political in the means Though justly sensible that no part of civil administration required greater care or a nicer judgment than the conduct of religious parties he had not perceived that in the same proportion as this practical knowledge of theology is requisite the speculative refinements in it are mean and even dangerous in a monarch By entering zealously into frivolous disputes James gave them an air of importance and dignity which they could not otherwise have acquired and being himself enlisted in the quarrel he could no longer have recourse to contempt and ridicule the only proper method of appeasing it The church of England had not yet abandoned the rigid doctrines of grace and pre destination the puritans had not yet separated themselves from the church nor openly renounced Episcopacy Though the spirit of the parties was considerably different the only appearing subjects of dispute were concerning the cross in baptism the ring in marriage the use of the surplice and the bowing at the name of Jesus These were the mighty questions which were solemnly agitated in the conference at Hampton Court between some bishops and dignified clergymen on the one hand and some leaders of the Puritanical party on the other the king and his ministers being present The Puritans were here so unreasonable as to complain of a partial and unfair management of the dispute as if the search after truth were in any degree the object of such conferences and a candid indifference so rare even among private inquirers in philosophical questions could ever be expected among princes and prelates in a theological controversy The king it must be confessed from the beginning of the conference showed the strongest propensity to the established church and frequently inculcated a maxim which though it has some foundation is to be received with great limitations No bishop no king The bishops in their turn were very liberal of their praises towards the royal disputant and the archbishop of Canterbury said that undoubtedly his majesty spake by the special assistance of God s Spirit A few alterations in the liturgy were agreed to and both parties separated with mutual dissatisfaction It had frequently been the practice of the Puritans to form certain assemblies which they called prophesyings where alternately as moved by the spirit they displayed their pious zeal in prayers and exhortations and raised their own enthusiasm as well as that of their audience to the highest pitch from that social contagion which has so mighty an influence on holy fervors and from the mutual emulation which arose in those trials of religious eloquence Such dangerous societies had been suppressed by Elizabeth and the ministers in this conference moved the king for their revival But James sharply replied If you aim at a Scottish presbytery it agrees as well with monarchy as God and the devil There Jack and Tom and Will and Dick shall meet and censure me and my council Therefore I reiterate my former speech Le roi s avisera Stay I pray for one seven years before you demand and then if you find me grow pursy and fat I may perchance hearken unto you For that government will keep me in breath and give me work enough Such were the political considerations which determined the king in his choice among religious parties Fuller s Ecclesiastical History Kennet p six hundred sixty five Fuller s Ecclesiastical History The next assembly in which James displayed his learning and eloquence was one that showed more spirit of liberty than appeared among his bishops and theologians The parliament was now ready to assemble being so long delayed on account of the plague which had broken out in London and raged to such a degree that above thirty thousand persons are computed to have died of it in a year though the city contained at that time little more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants The speech which the king made on opening the parliament fully displays his character and proves him to have possessed more knowledge and better parts than prudence or any just sense of decorum and propriety Though few productions of the age surpass this performance either in style or matter it wants that majestic brevity and reserve which become a king in his addresses to the great council of the nation It contains however a remarkable stroke of candor where he confesses his too great facility in yielding to the solicitations of suitors a fault which he promises to correct but which adhered to him and distressed him during the whole course of his reign The first business in which the commons were engaged was of the utmost importance to the preservation of their privileges and neither temper nor resolution was wanting in their conduct of it In the former periods of the English government the house of commons was of so small weight in the balance of the constitution that little attention had been given either by the crown the people or the house itself to the choice and continuance of the members It had been usual after parliaments were prolonged beyond one session for the chancellor to exert a discretionary authority of issuing new writs to supply the place of any members whom he judged incapable of attending either on account of their employment their sickness or other impediment This practice gave that minister and consequently the prince an unlimited power of modelling at pleasure the representatives of the nation yet so little jealousy had it created that the commons of themselves without any court influence or intrigue and contrary to some former votes of their own confirmed it in the twenty third of Elizabeth King James s Works p four hundred eighty four four hundred eighty five et cetera Journ twenty twod March sixteen oh three Kennet p six hundred sixty eight King James s Works p four hundred ninety five four hundred ninety six Journ January nineteenth fifteen eighty At that time though some members whose places had been supplied on account of sickness having now recovered their health appeared in the house and claimed their seat such was the authority of the chancellor that merely out of respect to him his sentence was adhered to and the new members were continued in their places Here a most dangerous prerogative was conferred on the crown but to show the genius of that age or rather the channels in which power then ran the crown put very little value on this authority insomuch that two days afterwards the chancellor of himself resigned it back to the commons and gave them power to judge of a particular vacancy in their house And when the question concerning the chancellor s new writs was again brought on the carpet towards the end of the session the commons were so little alarmed at the precedent that though they readmitted some old members whose seats had been vacated on account of slight indispositions yet they confirmed the chancellor s sentence in instances where the distemper appeared to have been dangerous and incurable Journ March eighteenth fifteen eighty See further D Ewes p four hundred thirty Nor did they proceed any further in vindication of their privileges than to vote That during the sitting of parliament there do not at any time any writ go out for choosing or returning any member without the warrant of the house In Elizabeth s reign we may remark and the reigns preceding sessions of parliament were not usually the twelfth part so long as the vacations and during the latter the chancellor s power if he pleased to exert it was confirmed at least left by this vote as unlimited and unrestrained as ever In a subsequent parliament the absolute authority of the queen was exerted in a manner still more open and began for the first time to give alarm to the commons New writs having been issued by the chancellor when there was no vacancy and a controversy arising upon that incident the queen sent a message to the house informing them that it were impertinent for them to deal in such matters These questions she said belonged only to the chancellor and she had appointed him to confer with the judges in order to settle all disputes with regard to elections The commons had the courage a few days after to vote That it was a most perilous precedent where two knights of a county were duly elected if any new writ should issue out for a second election without order of the house itself that the discussing and adjudging of this and such like differences belonged only to the house and that there should be no message sent to the lord chancellor not so much as to inquire what he had done in the matter because it was conceived to be a matter derogatory to the power and privilege of the house This is the most considerable and almost only instance of parliamentary liberty which occurs during the reign of that princess Outlaws whether on account of debts or crimes had been declared by the judges incapable of enjoying a seat in the house where they must themselves be lawgivers but this opinion of the judges had been frequently overruled I find however in the case of Vaughan who was questioned for an outlawry that having proved all his debts to have been contracted by suretyship and to have been most of them honestly compounded he was allowed on account of these favorable circumstances to keep his seat which plainly supposes that otherwise it would have been vacated on account of the outlawry When James summoned this parliament he issued a proclamation in which among many general advices which like a kind tutor he bestowed on his people he strictly enjoins them not to choose any outlaw for their representative And he adds If any person take upon him the place of knight citizen or burgess not being duly elected according to the laws and statutes in that behalf provided and according to the purport effect and true meaning of this our proclamation then every person so offending to be fined or imprisoned for the same A proclamation here was plainly put on the same footing with a law and that in so delicate a point as the right of elections most alarming circumstances had there not been reason to believe that this measure being entered into so early in the king s reign proceeded more from precipitation and mistake than from any serious design of invading the privileges of parliament v D Ewes p three hundred ninety seven thirty nine H six Journ Feb eighth fifteen eighty In a subsequent parliament that of the thirty fifth of the queen the commons after a great debate expressly voted that a person outlawed might be elected D Ewes p five hundred eighteen But as the matter had been much contested the king might think the vote of the house no law and might esteem his own decision of more weight than theirs We may also suppose that he was not acquainted with this vote Queen Elizabeth in her speech to her last parliament complained of their admitting outlaws and represents that conduct of the house as a great abuse v Jan eleventh sixteen oh four Rymer tom xvi p five hundred sixty one Sir Francis Goodwin was chosen member for the county of Bucks and his return as usual was made into chancery The chancellor pronouncing him an outlaw vacated his seat and issued writs for a new election Sir John Fortescue was chosen in his place by the county but the first act of the house was to reverse the chancellor s sentence and restore Sir Francis to his seat At the king s suggestion the lords desired a conference on the subject but were absolutely refused by the commons as the question entirely regarded their own privileges The commons however agreed to make a remonstrance to the king by the mouth of their speaker in which they maintained that though the returns were by form made into chancery yet the sole right of judging with regard to elections belonged to the house itself not to the chancellor James was not satisfied and ordered a conference between the house and the judges whose opinion in this case was opposite to that of the commons This conference he said he commanded as an absolute king an epithet we are apt to imagine not very grateful to English ears but one to which they had already been somewhat accustomed from the mouth of Elizabeth v forty four He added That all their privileges were derived from his grant and hoped they would not turn them against him v a sentiment which from her conduct it is certain that princess had also entertained and which was the reigning principle of her courtiers and ministers and the spring of all her administration The duke of Sully tells us that it was a maxim of James that no prince in the first year of his reign should begin any considerable undertaking a maxim reasonable in itself and very suitable to his cautious not to say timid character The facility with which he departed from this pretension is another proof that his meaning was innocent But had the privileges of parliament been at that time exactly ascertained or royal power fully limited could such an imagination ever have been entertained by him as to think that his proclamations could regulate parliamentary elections Winwood vol ii p eighteen nineteen Journ twenty sixth March sixteen oh four Journ threed April sixteen oh four v See note RR at the end of the volume v Camden in Kennet p three hundred seventy five The commons were in some perplexity Their eyes were now opened and they saw the consequences of that power which had been assumed by the chancellor and to which their predecessors had in some instances blindly submitted By this course said a member the free election of the counties is taken away and none shall be chosen but such as shall please the king and council Let us therefore with fortitude understanding and sincerity seek to maintain our privilege This cannot be construed any contempt in us but merely a maintenance of our common rights which our ancestors have left us and which it is just and fit for us to transmit to our posterity Another said This may be called a quo warranto to seize all our liberties A chancellor added a third by this course may call a parliament consisting of what persons he pleases Any suggestion by any person may be the cause of sending a new writ It is come to this plain question whether the chancery or parliament ought to have authority Notwithstanding this watchful spirit of liberty which now appeared in the commons their deference for majesty was so great that they appointed a committee to confer with the judges before the king and council There the question of law began to appear in James s eyes a little more doubtful than he had hitherto imagined it and in order to extricate himself with some honor he proposed that both Goodwin and Fortescue should be set aside and a writ be issued by warrant of the house for a new election Goodwin gave his consent and the commons embraced the expedient but in such a manner that while they showed their regard for the king they secured for the future the free possession of their seats and the right which they claimed of judging solely in their own elections and returns forty five A power like this so essential to the exercise of all their other powers themselves so essential to public liberty cannot fairly be deemed an encroachment in the commons but must be regarded as an inherent privilege happily rescued from that ambiguity which the negligence of some former parliaments had thrown upon it At the same time the commons in the case of Sir Thomas Shirley established their power of punishing as well the persons at whose suit any member is arrested as the officers who either arrest or detain him Their asserting of this privilege admits of the same reflection v Journ thirtieth March sixteen oh four Journ thirtieth March sixteen oh four Journ thirtieth March sixteen oh four See note SS at the end of the volume v Journ sixth and seventh May sixteen oh four About this period the minds of men throughout Europe especially in England seem to have undergone a general but insensible revolution Though letters had been revived in the preceding age they were chiefly cultivated by those of sedentary professions nor had they till now begun to spread themselves in any degree among men of the world Arts both mechanical and liberal were every day receiving great improvements Navigation had extended itself over the whole globe Travelling was secure and agreeable And the general system of politics in Europe was become more enlarged and comprehensive In consequence of this universal fermentation the ideas of men enlarged themselves on all sides and the several constituent parts of the Gothic governments which seem to have lain long inactive began everywhere to operate and encroach on each other On the continent where the necessity of discipline had begotten standing armies the princes commonly established an unlimited authority and overpowered by force or intrigue the liberties of the people In England the love of freedom which unless checked flourishes extremely in all liberal natures acquired new force and was regulated by more enlarged views suitable to that cultivated understanding which became every day more common among men of birth and education A familiar acquaintance with the precious remains of antiquity excited in every generous breast a passion for a limited constitution and begat an emulation of those manly virtues which the Greek and Roman authors by such animating examples as well as pathetic expressions recommend to us The severe though popular government of Elizabeth had confined this rising spirit within very narrow bounds but when a new and a foreign family succeeded to the throne and a prince less dreaded and less beloved symptoms immediately appeared of a more free and independent genius in the nation Happily this prince possessed neither sufficient capacity to perceive the alteration nor sufficient art and vigor to check it in its early advances Jealous of regal because conscious of little personal authority he had established within his own mind a speculative system of absolute government which few of his subjects he believed and none but traitors and rebels would make any scruple to admit On whichever side he cast his eye every thing concurred to encourage his prejudices When he compared himself with the other hereditary sovereigns of Europe he imagined that as he bore the same rank he was entitled to equal prerogatives not considering the innovations lately introduced by them and the military force by which their authority was supported In England that power almost unlimited which had been exercised for above a century especially during the late reign he ascribed solely to royal birth and title not to the prudence and spirit of the monarchs nor to the conjunctures of the times Even the opposition which he had struggled with in Scotland encouraged him still further in his favorite notions while he there saw that the same resistance which opposed regal authority violated all law and order and made way either for the ravages of a barbarous nobility or for the more intolerable insolence of seditious preachers In his own person therefore he thought all legal power to be centred by an hereditary and a divine right and this opinion might have proved dangerous if not fatal to liberty had not the firmness of the persuasion and its seeming evidence induced him to trust solely to his right without making the smallest provision either of force or politics in order to support it Such were the opposite dispositions of parliament and prince at the commencement of the Scottish line dispositions just beginning to exist and to appear in the parliament forty six but thoroughly established and openly avowed on the part of the prince See note TT at the end of the volume The spirit and judgment of the house of commons appeared not only in defence of their own privileges but also in their endeavor though at this time in vain to free trade from those shackles which the high exerted prerogative and even in this respect the ill judged tyranny of Elizabeth had imposed upon it James had already of his own accord called in and annulled all the numerous patents for monopolies which had been granted by his predecessor and which extremely fettered every species of domestic industry but the exclusive companies still remained another species of monopoly by which almost all foreign trade except that to France was brought into the hands of a few rapacious engrossers and all prospect of future improvement in commerce was forever sacrificed to a little temporary advantage of the sovereign These companies though arbitrarily erected had carried their privileges so far that almost all the commerce of England was centred in London and it appears that the customs of that port amounted to one hundred and ten thousand pounds a year while those of all the kingdom beside yielded only seventeen thousand Nay the whole trade of London was confined to about two hundred citizens who were easily enabled by combining among themselves to fix whatever price they pleased both to the exports and imports of the nation The committee appointed to consider this enormous grievance one of the greatest which we read of in English story insist on it as a fact well known and avowed however contrary to present received opinion that shipping and seamen had insensibly decayed during all the preceding reign And though nothing be more common than complaints of the decay of trade even during the most flourishing periods yet is this a consequence which might naturally result from such arbitrary establishments at a time when the commerce of all the other nations of Europe except that of Scotland enjoyed full liberty and indulgence While the commons were thus attempting to give liberty to the trading part of the nation they also endeavored to free the landed property from the burden of wardships and to remove those remains of the feudal tenures under which the nation still labored A just regard was shown to the crown in the conduct of this affair nor was the remedy sought for considered as a matter of right but merely of grace and favor The profit which the king reaped both from wards and from respite of homage was estimated and it was intended to compound for these prerogatives by a secure and independent revenue But after some debates in the house and some conferences with the lords the affair was found to contain more difficulties than could easily at that time be surmounted and it was not then brought to any conclusion The same fate attended an attempt of a like nature to free the nation from the burden of purveyance This prerogative had been much abused by the purveyors v and the commons showed some intention to offer the king fifty thousand pounds a year for the abolition of it Journ twenty first May sixteen oh four Journ twenty first May sixteen oh four A remonstrance from the Trinity House in sixteen oh two says that in a little above twelve years after fifteen eighty eight the shipping and number of seamen in England decayed about a third Anglesey s Happy Future State of England p one hundred twenty eight from Sir Julius Caesar s Collections See Journ twenty first May sixteen oh four Journ first June sixteen oh four v Journ thirtieth April sixteen oh four Another affair of the utmost consequence was brought before the parliament where the commons showed a greater spirit of independence than any true judgment of national interest The union of the two kingdoms was zealously and even impatiently urged by the king He justly regarded it as the peculiar felicity of his reign that he had terminated the bloody animosities of these hostile nations and had reduced the whole island under one government enjoying tranquillity within itself and security from all foreign invasions He hoped that while his subjects of both kingdoms reflected on past disasters besides regarding his person as infinitely precious they would entertain the strongest desire of securing themselves against the return of like calamities by a thorough union of laws parliaments and privileges He considered not that this very reflection operated as yet in a contrary manner on men s prejudices and kept alive that mutual hatred between the nations which had been carried to the greatest extremities and required time to allay it The more urgent the king appeared in promoting so useful a measure the more backward was the English parliament in concurring with him while they ascribed his excessive zeal to that partiality in favor of his ancient subjects of which they thought that on other occasions they had reason to complain Their complaisance for the king therefore carried them no further than to appoint forty four English to meet with thirty one Scottish commissioners in order to deliberate concerning the terms of a union but without any power of making advances towards the establishment of it Journ twenty first April first May sixteen oh four Parliamentary History vol v p ninety one Journ seventh June sixteen oh four Kennet p six hundred seventy three The same spirit of independence and perhaps not better judgment appeared in the house of commons when the question of supply was brought before them by some members attached to the court In vain was it urged that though the king received a supply which had been voted to Elizabeth and which had not been collected before her death yet he found it burdened with a debt contracted by the queen equal to the full amount of it that peace was not yet thoroughly concluded with Spain and that Ireland was still expensive On his journey from Scotland amidst such a concourse of people and on that of the queen and royal family he had expended considerable sums and that as the courtiers had looked for greater liberalities from the prince on his accession and had imposed on his generous nature so the prince in his turn would expect at the beginning some mark of duty and attachment from his people and some consideration of his necessities No impression was made on the house of commons by these topics and the majority appeared fully determined to refuse all supply The burden of government at that time lay surprisingly light upon the people and that very reason which to us at this distance may seem a motive of generosity was the real cause why the parliament was on all occasions so remarkably frugal and reserved They were not as yet accustomed to open their purses in so liberal a manner as their successors in order to supply the wants of their sovereign and the smallest demand however requisite appeared in their eyes unreasonable and exorbitant The commons seem also to have been desirous of reducing the crown to still further necessities by their refusing a bill sent down to them by the lords for entailing the crown lands forever on the king s heirs and successors The dissipation made by Elizabeth had probably taught James the necessity of this law and shown them the advantage of refusing it In order to cover a disappointment with regard to supply which might bear a bad construction both at home and abroad James sent a message to the house in which he told them that he desired no supply and he was very forward in refusing what was never offered him Parliamentary Hist vol v p one hundred eight Soon after he prorogued the parliament not without discovering in his speech visible marks of dissatisfaction Even so early in his reign he saw reason to make public complaints of the restless and encroaching spirit of the Puritanical party and of the malevolence with which they endeavored to inspire the commons Nor were his complaints without foundation or the Puritans without interest since the commons now finding themselves free from the arbitrary government of Elizabeth made application for a conference with the lords and presented a petition to the king the purport of both which was to procure in favor of the Puritans a relaxation of the ecclesiastical laws The use of the surplice and of the cross in baptism is there chiefly complained of but the remedy seems to have been expected solely from the king s dispensing power In the papers which contain this application and petition we may also see proofs of the violent animosity of the commons against the Catholics together with the intolerating spirit of that assembly forty seven This summer the peace with Spain was finally concluded and was signed by the Spanish ministers at London In the conferences previous to this treaty the nations were found to have so few claims on each other that except on account of the support given by England to the Low Country provinces the war might appear to have been continued more on account of personal animosity between Philip and Elizabeth than any contrariety of political interests between their subjects Some articles in the treaty which seemed prejudicial to the Dutch commonwealth were never executed by the king and as the Spaniards made no complaints on that head it appeared that by secret agreement the king had expressly reserved the power of sending assistance to the Hollanders v The constable of Castile came into England to ratify the peace and on the part of England the earl of Hertford was sent into the Low Countries for the same purpose and the earl of Nottingham high admiral into Spain The train of the latter was numerous and splendid and the Spaniards it is said were extremely surprised when they beheld the blooming countenances and graceful appearance of the English whom their bigotry inflamed by the priests had represented as so many monsters and infernal demons La Boderie the French ambassador says that the house of commons Greek Greek was composed mostly of Puritans Vol i p eighty one Parl

Though England by means of her naval force was perfectly secure during the latter years of the Spanish war James showed an impatience to put an end to hostilities and soon after his accession before any terms of peace were concerted or even proposed by Spain he recalled all the letters of marque In this respect James s peace was more honorable than that which Henry IV himself made with Spain This latter prince stipulated not to assist the Dutch and the supplies which he secretly sent them were in direct contravention to the treaty which had been granted by Queen Elizabeth Archduke Albert had made some advances of a like nature which invited the king to take this friendly step But what is remarkable in James s proclamation for that purpose he plainly supposes that as he had himself while king of Scotland always lived in amity with Spain peace was attached to his person and that merely by his accession to the crown of England without any articles of treaty or agreement he had ended the war between the kingdoms This ignorance of the law of nations may appear surprising in a prince who was thirty six years of age and who had reigned from his infancy did we not consider that a king of Scotland who lives in close friendship with England has few transactions to manage with foreign princes and has little opportunity of acquiring experience Unhappily for James his timidity his prejudices his indolence his love of amusement particularly of hunting to which he was much addicted ever prevented him from making any progress in the knowledge or practice of foreign politics and in a little time diminished that regard which all the neighboring nations had paid to England during the reign of his predecessor twenty threed June sixteen oh three Grotii Annal lib xii See

and containing at once a singular proof both of the strength and weakness of the human mind its widest departure from morals and most steady attachment to religious prejudices It is the gunpowder treason of which I speak a fact as certain as it appears incredible The Roman Catholics had expected great favor and indulgence on the accession of James both as he was descended from Mary whose life they believed to have been sacrificed to their cause and as he himself in his early youth was imagined to have shown some partiality towards them which nothing they thought but interest and necessity had since restrained It is pretended that he had even entered into positive engagements to tolerate their religion as soon as he should mount the throne of England whether their credulity had interpreted in this sense some obliging expressions of the king s or that he had employed such an artifice in order to render them favorable to his title State Trials vol ii p two hundred one two hundred two two hundred three Winwood vol ii p forty nine Very soon they discovered their mistake and were at once surprised and enraged to find James on all occasions express his intention of strictly executing the laws enacted against them and of persevering in all the rigorous measures of Elizabeth Catesby a gentleman of good parts and of an ancient family first thought of a most extraordinary method of revenge and he opened his intention to Piercy a descendant of the illustrious house of Northumberland In one of their conversations with regard to the distressed condition of the Catholics Piercy having broken into a sally of passion and mentioned assassinating the king Catesby took the opportunity of revealing to him a nobler and more extensive plan of treason which not only included a sure execution of vengeance but afforded some hopes of restoring the Catholic religion in England In vain said he would you put an end to the king s life he has children who would succeed both to his crown and to his maxims of government In vain would you extinguish the whole royal family the nobility the gentry the parliament are all infected with the same heresy and could raise to the throne another prince and another family who besides their hatred to our religion would be animated with revenge for the tragical death of their predecessors To serve any good purpose we must destroy at one blow the king the royal family the lords the commons and bury all our enemies in one common ruin Happily they are all assembled on the first meeting of the parliament and afford us the opportunity of glorious and useful vengeance Great preparations will not be requisite A few of us combining may run a mine below the hall in which they meet and choosing the very moment when the king harangues both houses consign over to destruction these determined foes to all piety and religion Meanwhile we ourselves standing aloof safe and unsuspected shall triumph in being the instruments of divine wrath and shall behold with pleasure those sacrilegious walls in which were passed the edicts for proscribing our church and butchering her children tossed into a thousand fragments while their impious inhabitants meditating perhaps still new persecutions against us pass from flames above to flames below there forever to endure the torments due to their offences Piercy was charmed with this project of Catesby and they agreed to communicate the matter to a few more and among the rest to Thomas Winter whom they sent over to Flanders in quest of Fawkes an officer in the Spanish service with whose zeal and courage they were all thoroughly acquainted When they enlisted any new conspirator in order to bind him to secrecy they always together with an oath employed the communion the most sacred rite of their religion And it is remarkable that no one of these pious devotees ever entertained the least compunction with regard to the cruel massacre which they projected of whatever was great and eminent in the nation Some of them only were startled by the reflection that of necessity many Catholics must be present as spectators or attendants on the king or as having seats in the house of peers but Tesmond a Jesuit and Garnet superior of that order in England removed these scruples and showed them how the interests of religion required that the innocent should here be sacrificed with the guilty History of the Gunpowder Treason State Trials vol i p one hundred ninety one hundred ninety eight two hundred ten All this passed in the spring and summer of the year sixteen oh four when the conspirators also hired a house in Piercy s name adjoining to that in which the parliament was to assemble Towards the end of that year they began their operations That they might be less interrupted and give less suspicion to the neighborhood they carried in store of provisions with them and never desisted from their labor Obstinate in their purpose and confirmed by passion by principle and by mutual exhortation they little feared death in comparison of a disappointment and having provided arms together with the instruments of their labor they resolved there to perish in case of a discovery Their perseverance advanced the work and they soon pierced the wall though three yards in thickness but on approaching the other side they were somewhat startled at hearing a noise which they knew not how to account for Upon inquiry they found that it came from the vault below the house of lords that a magazine of coals had been kept there and that as the coals were selling off the vault would be let to the highest bidder The opportunity was immediately seized the place hired by Piercy thirty six barrels of powder lodged in it the whole covered up with fagots and billets the doors of the cellar boldly flung open and every body admitted as if it contained nothing dangerous Confident of success they now began to look forward and to plan the remaining part of their project The king the queen Prince Henry were all expected to be present at the opening of parliament The duke by reason of his tender age would be absent and it was resolved that Piercy should seize him or assassinate him The princess Elizabeth a child likewise was kept at Lord Harrington s house in Warwickshire and Sir Everard Digby Rookwood Grant being let into the conspiracy engaged to assemble their friends on pretence of a hunting match and seizing that princess immediately to proclaim her queen So transported were they with rage against their adversaries and so charmed with the prospect of revenge that they forgot all care of their own safety and trusting to the general confusion which must result from so unexpected a blow they foresaw not that the fury of the people now unrestrained by any authority must have turned against them and would probably have satiated itself by a universal massacre of the Catholics The day so long wished for now approached on which the parliament was appointed to assemble The dreadful secret though communicated to above twenty persons had been religiously kept during the space of near a year and a half No remorse no pity no fear of punishment no hope of reward had as yet induced any one conspirator either to abandon the enterprise or make a discovery of it The holy fury had extinguished in their breast every other motive and it was an indiscretion at last proceeding chiefly from these very bigoted prejudices and partialities which saved the nation Ten days before the meeting of parliament Lord Monteagle a Catholic son to Lord Morley received the following letter which had been delivered to his servant by an unknown hand My Lord Out of the love I bear to some of your friends I have a care of your preservation Therefore I would advise you as you tender your life to devise some excuse to shift off your attendance at this parliament For God and man have concurred to punish the wickedness of this time And think not slightly of this advertisement but retire yourself into your country where you may expect the event in safety For though there be no appearance of any stir yet I say they will receive a terrible blow this parliament and yet they shall not see who hurts them This counsel is not to be contemned because it may do you good and can do you no harm for the danger is past as soon as you have burned the letter And I hope God will give you the grace to make good use of it unto whose holy protection I commend you King James s Works p two hundred twenty seven Monteagle knew not what to make of this letter and though inclined to think it a foolish attempt to frighten and ridicule him he judged it safest to carry it to Lord Salisbury secretary of state Though Salisbury too was inclined to pay little attention to it he thought proper to lay it before the king who came to town a few days after To the king it appeared not so light a matter and from the serious earnest style of the letter he conjectured that it implied something dangerous and important A terrible blow and yet the authors concealed a danger so sudden and yet so great these circumstances seemed all to denote some contrivance by gun powder and it was thought advisable to inspect all the vaults below the houses of parliament This care belonged to the earl of Suffolk lord chamberlain who purposely delayed the search till the day before the meeting of parliament He remarked those great piles of wood and fagots which lay in the vault under the upper house and he cast his eye upon Fawkes who stood in a dark corner and passed himself for Piercy s servant That daring and determined courage which so much distinguished this conspirator even among those heroes in villany was fully painted in his countenance and was not passed unnoticed by the chamberlain Such a quantity also of fuel for the use of one who lived so little in town as Piercy appeared a little extraordinary and upon comparing all circumstances it was resolved that a more thorough inspection should be made About midnight Sir Thomas Knevet a justice of peace was sent with proper attendants and before the door of the vault finding Fawkes who had just finished all his preparations he immediately seized him and turning over the fagots discovered the powder The matches and every thing proper for setting fire to the train were taken in Fawkes s pocket who finding his guilt now apparent and seeing no refuge but in boldness and despair expressed the utmost regret that he had lost the opportunity of firing the powder at once and of sweetening his own death by that of his enemies Before the council he displayed the same intrepid firmness mixed even with scorn and disdain refusing to discover his accomplices and showing no concern but for the failure of the enterprise This obstinacy lasted two or three days but being confined to the Tower left to reflect on his guilt and danger and the rack being just shown to him his courage fatigued with so long an effort and unsupported by hope or society at last failed him and he made a full discovery of all the conspirators v King James s Works p two hundred twenty

the other criminals who were in London though they had heard of the alarm taken at a letter sent to Monteagle though they had heard of the chamberlain s search yet were resolved to persist to the utmost and never abandon their hopes of success fifty But at last hearing that Fawkes was arrested they hurried down to Warwickshire where Sir Everard Digby thinking himself assured that success had attended his confederates was already in arms in order to seize the princess Elizabeth She had escaped into Coventry and they were obliged to put themselves on their defence against the country who were raised from all quarters and armed by the sheriff The conspirators with all their attendants never exceeded the number of eighty persons and being surrounded on every side could no longer entertain hopes either of prevailing or escaping Having therefore confessed themselves and received absolution they boldly prepared for death and resolved to sell their lives as dear as possible to the assailants But even this miserable consolation was denied them Some of their powder took fire and disabled them for defence The people rushed in upon them Piercy and Catesby were killed by one shot Digby Rookwood Winter and others being taken prisoners were tried confessed their guilt and died as well as Garnet by the hands of the executioner Notwithstanding this horrid crime the bigoted Catholics were so devoted to Garnet that they fancied miracles to be wrought by his blood and in Spain he was regarded as a martyr Neither had the desperate fortune of the conspirators urged them to this enterprise nor had the former profligacy of their lives prepared them for so great a crime Before that audacious attempt their conduct seems in general to be liable to no reproach Catesby s character had entitled him to such regard that Rookwood and Digby were seduced by their implicit trust in his judgment and they declared that from the motive alone of friendship to him they were ready on any occasion to have sacrificed their lives v Digby himself was as highly esteemed and beloved as any man in England and he had been particularly honored with the good opinion of Queen Elizabeth See note XX at the end of the volume State Trials vol i p one hundred ninety nine Discourse of the Manner et cetera p sixty nine seventy Winwood vol ii p three hundred Winwood vol ii p three hundred v State Trials vol i p two hundred one It was bigoted zeal alone the most absurd of prejudices masked with reason the most criminal of passions covered with the appearance of duty which seduced them into measures that were fatal to themselves and had so nearly proved fatal to their country The lords Mordaunt and Stourton two Catholics were fined the former ten thousand pounds the latter four thousand by the star chamber because their absence from parliament had begotten a suspicion of their being acquainted with the conspiracy The earl of Northumberland was fined thirty thousand pounds and detained several years prisoner in the Tower because not to mention other grounds of suspicion he had admitted Piercy into the number of gentlemen pensioners without his taking the requisite oaths The king in his speech to the parliament observed that though religion had engaged the conspirators in so criminal an attempt yet ought we not to involve all the Roman Catholics in the same guilt or suppose them equally disposed to commit such enormous barbarities Many holy men he said and our ancestors among the rest had been seduced to concur with that church in her scholastic doctrines who yet had never admitted her seditious principles concerning the pope s power of dethroning kings or sanctifying assassination The wrath of Heaven is denounced against crimes but innocent error may obtain its favor and nothing can be more hateful than the uncharitableness of the Puritans who condemn alike to eternal torments even the most inoffensive partisans of Popery For his part he added that conspiracy however atrocious should never alter in the least his plan of government while with one hand he punished guilt with the other he would still support and protect innocence After this speech he prorogued the parliament till the twenty second of January Digby after his condemnation said in a letter to his wife Now for my intention let me tell you that if I had thought there had been the least sin in the plot I would not have been of it for all the world and no other cause drew me to hazard my fortune and life but zeal to God s religion He expresses his surprise to hear that any Catholics had condemned it Digby s Papers published by Secretary Coventry Camden in Kennet p six hundred ninety two King James s Works p five hundred three five hundred four The parliament this session passed an act obliging every one to take the oath of allegiance a very moderate test since it decided no controverted points between the two religions and only engaged the persons who took it to abjure the pope s power of dethroning kings See King James s Works p two hundred fifty The moderation and I may say magnanimity of the king immediately after so narrow an escape from a most detestable conspiracy was nowise agreeable to his subjects Their animosity against Popery even before this provocation has risen to a great pitch and it had perhaps been more prudent in James by a little dissimulation to have conformed himself to it His theological learning confirmed by disputation has happily fixed his judgment in the Protestant faith yet was his heart a little biased by the allurements of Rome and he had been well pleased if the making of some advances could have effected a union with that ancient mother church He strove to abate the acrimony of his own subjects against the religion of their fathers he became himself the object of their diffidence and aversion Whatever measures he embraced in Scotland to introduce prelacy in England to enforce the authority of the established church and support its rites and ceremonies were interpreted as so many steps towards Popery and were represented by the Puritans as symptoms of idolatry and superstition Ignorant of the consequences or unwilling to sacrifice to politics his inclination which he called his conscience he persevered in the same measures and gave trust and preferment almost indifferently to his Catholic and Protestant subjects And finding his person as well as his title less obnoxious to the church of Rome than those of Elizabeth he gradually abated the rigor of those laws which had been enacted against that church and which were so acceptable to his bigoted subjects But the effects of these dispositions on both sides became not very sensible till towards the conclusion of his reign At this time James seems to have possessed the affections even of his English subjects and in a tolerable degree their esteem and regard Hitherto their complaints were chiefly levelled against his too great constancy in his early friendships a quality which had it been attended with more economy the wise would have excused and the candid would even perhaps have applauded His parts which were not despicable and his learning which was great being highly extolled by his courtiers and gownmen and not yet tried in the management of any delicate affairs for which he was unfit raised a high idea of him in the world nor was it always through flattery or insincerity that he received the title of the second Solomon A report which was suddenly spread about this time of his being assassinated visibly struck a great consternation into all orders of men The commons also abated this session somewhat of their excessive frugality and granted him an aid payable in four years of three subsidies and six fifteenths which Sir Francis Bacon said in the house might amount to about four hundred thousand pounds and for once the king and parliament parted in friendship and good humor The hatred which the Catholics so visibly bore him gave him at this time an additional value in the eyes of his people The only considerable point in which the commons incurred his displeasure was by discovering their constant good will to the Puritans in whose favor they desired a conference with the lords which was rejected The chief affair transacted next session was the intended union of the two kingdoms Nothing could exceed the king s passion and zeal for this noble enterprise but the parliament s prejudice and reluctance against it There remain two excellent speeches in favor of the union which it would not be improper to compare together that of the king v and that of Sir Francis Bacon Those who affect in every thing such an extreme contempt for James will be surprised to find that his discourse both for good reasoning and elegant composition approaches very near that of a man who was undoubtedly at that time one of the greatest geniuses in Europe A few trivial indiscretions and indecorums may be said to characterize the harangue of the monarch and mark it for his own And in general so open and avowed a declaration in favor of a measure while he had taken no care by any precaution or intrigue to insure success may safely be pronounced an indiscretion But the art of managing parliaments by private interest or cabal being found hitherto of little use or necessity had not as yet become a part of English politics In the common course of affairs government could be conducted without their assistance and when their concurrence became necessary to the measures of the crown it was generally speaking except in times of great faction and discontent obtained without much difficulty Kennet p six hundred ninety six Journ twentieth May sixteen oh six Journ fifth April sixteen oh six Kennet p six hundred seventy six v King James s Works p five hundred nine The king s influence seems to have rendered the Scottish parliament cordial in all the steps which they took towards the union Though the advantages which Scotland might hope from that measure were more considerable yet were the objections too with regard to that kingdom more striking and obvious The benefit which must have resulted to England both by accession of strength and security was riot despicable and as the English were by far the greater nation and possessed the seat of government the objections either from the point of honor or from jealousy could not reasonably have any place among them The English parliament indeed seem to have been swayed merely by the vulgar motive of national antipathy And they persisted so obstinately in their prejudices that all the efforts for a thorough union and incorporation ended only in the abolition of the hostile laws formerly enacted between the kingdoms The commons were even so averse to the union that they had complained in the former session to the lords of the bishop of Bristol for writing a book in favor of it and the prelate was obliged to make submissions for this offence The crime imputed to him seems to have consisted in his treating of a subject which lay before the parliament so little notion had they as yet of general liberty See Parliamentary History vol v p one hundred eight one hundred nine one hundred ten Some precipitate steps which the king a little after his accession had taken in order to promote his favorite project had been here observed to do more injury than service From his own authority he had assumed the title of king of Great Britain and had quartered the arms of Scotland with those of England in all coins flags and ensigns He had also engaged the judges to make a declaration that all those who after the union of the crowns should be born in either kingdom were for that reason alone naturalized in both This was a nice question and according to the ideas of those times susceptible of subtle reasoning on both sides The king was the same the parliaments were different To render the people therefore the same we must suppose that the sovereign authority resided chiefly in the prince and that these popular assemblies were rather instituted to assist with money and advice than endowed with any controlling or active powers in the government It is evident says Bacon in his pleadings on this subject that all other commonwealths monarchies only excepted do subsist by a law precedent For where authority is divided amongst many officers and they not perpetual but annual or temporary and not to receive their authority but by election and certain persons to have voices only in that election and the like these are busy and curious frames which of necessity do presuppose a law precedent written or unwritten to guide and direct them but in monarchies especially hereditary that is when several families or lineages of people do submit themselves to one line imperial or royal the submission is more natural and simple which afterwards by law subsequent is perfected and made more formal but that is grounded upon nature It would seem from this reasoning that the idea of an hereditary limited monarchy though implicitly supposed in many public transactions had scarcely ever as yet been expressly formed by any English lawyer or politician Except the obstinacy of the parliament with regard to the union and an attempt on the king s ecclesiastical jurisdiction most of their measures during this session were sufficiently respectful and obliging though they still discover a vigilant spirit and a careful attention towards national liberty The votes also of the commons show that the house contained a mixture of Puritans who had acquired great authority among them and who together with religious prejudices were continually suggesting ideas more suitable to a popular than a monarchical form of government The natural appetite for rule made the commons lend a willing ear to every doctrine which tended to augment their own power and influence A petition was moved in the lower house for a more rigorous execution of the laws against Popish recusants and an abatement towards Protestant clergymen who scrupled to observe the ceremonies Both these points were equally unacceptable to the king and he sent orders to the house to proceed no further in that matter The commons were inclined at first to consider these orders as a breach of privilege but they soon acquiesced when told that this measure of the king s was supported by many precedents during the reign of Elizabeth Had they been always disposed to make the precedents of that reign the rule of their conduct they needed never have had any quarrel with any of their monarchs The complaints of Spanish depredations were very loud among the English merchants The lower house sent a message to the lords desiring a conference with them in order to their presenting a joint petition to the king on the subject Bacon s Works vol iv p one hundred ninety one hundred ninety one edit seventeen thirty Journ twod December fifth March sixteen oh six twenty fifth twenty sixth June sixteen oh seven Journ twenty sixth February fourth seventh March sixteen oh six twod May seventeenth June sixteen oh seven Journ sixteenth seventeenth June sixteen oh seven The lords took some time to deliberate on this message because they said the matter was weighty and rare It probably occurred to them at first that the parliament s interposing in affairs of state would appear unusual and extraordinary And to show that in this sentiment they were not guided by court influence after they had deliberated they agreed to the conference The house of commons began now to feel themselves of such importance that on the motion of Sir Edwin Sandys a member of great authority they entered for the first time an order for the regular keeping of their journals When all business was finished the king prorogued the parliament Journ threed July sixteen oh seven About this time there was an insurrection of the country people in Northamptonshire headed by one Reynolds a man of low condition They went about destroying enclosures but carefully avoided committing any other outrage This insurrection was easily suppressed and though great lenity was used towards the rioters yet were some of the ringleaders punished The chief cause of that trivial commotion seems to have been of itself far from trivial The practice still continued in England of disusing tillage and throwing the land into enclosures for the sake of pasture By this means the kingdom was depopulated at least prevented from increasing so much in people as might have been expected from the daily increase of industry and commerce Next year presents us with nothing memorable but in the spring of the subsequent after a long negotiation was concluded by a truce of twelve years that war which for near half a century had been carried on with such fury between Spain and the states of the United Provinces Never contest seemed at first more unequal never contest was finished with more honor to the weaker party On the side of Spain were numbers riches authority discipline on the side of the revolted provinces were found the attachment to liberty and the enthusiasm of religion By her naval enterprises the republic maintained her armies and joining peaceful industry to military valor she was enabled by her own force to support herself and gradually rely less on those neighboring princes who from jealousy to Spain were at first prompted to encourage her revolt Long had the pride of that monarchy prevailed over her interest and prevented her from hearkening to any terms of accommodation with her rebellious subjects But finding all intercourse cut off between her provinces by the maritime force of the states she at last agreed to treat with them as a free people and solemnly to renounce all claim and pretension to their sovereignty This chief point being gained the treaty was easily brought to a conclusion under the joint mediation and guaranty of France and England All exterior appearances of honor were paid equally to both crowns but very different were the sentiments which the states as well as all Europe entertained of the princes who wore them Frugality and vigor the chief circumstances which procure regard among foreign nations shone out as conspicuously in Henry as they were deficient in James To a contempt of the English monarch Henry seems to have added a considerable degree of jealousy and aversion which were sentiments altogether without foundation James was just and fair in all transactions with his allies but it appears from the memoirs of those times that each side deemed him partial towards their adversary and fancied that he had entered into secret measures against them so little equity have men in their judgments of their own affairs and so dangerous is that entire neutrality affected by the king of England The little concern which James took in foreign affairs renders the domestic occurrences particularly those of parliament the most interesting of his reign A new session was held this spring the king full of hopes of receiving supply the commons of circumscribing his prerogative The earl of Salisbury now created treasurer on the death of the earl of Dorset laid open the king s necessities first to the peers then to a committee of the lower house The plan of accommodation which James recommended is found in Winwood vol ii p four hundred twenty nine four hundred thirty and is the same that was recommended by Henry as we learn from Jeanin tom iii p four hundred sixteen four hundred seventeen It had long been imagined by historians from Jeanin s authority that James had declared to the court of Spain that he would not support the Dutch in their pretensions to liberty and independence But it has since been discovered by Winwood s Memorials vol ii p four hundred fifty six four hundred sixty six four hundred sixty nine four hundred seventy five four hundred seventy six that that report was founded on a lie of President Richardot s Winwood and Jeanin passim Journ seventeenth Feb sixteen oh nine Kennet p six hundred eighty one He insisted on the unavoidable expense incurred in supporting the navy and in suppressing a late insurrection in Ireland he mentioned three numerous courts which the king was obliged to maintain for himself for the queen and for the prince of Wales he observed that Queen Elizabeth though a single woman had received very large supplies in the years preceding her death which alone were expensive to her and he remarked that during her reign she had alienated many of the crown lands an expedient which though it supplied her present necessities without laying burdens on her people extremely multiplied the necessities of her successor From all these causes he thought it nowise strange that the king s income should fall short so great a sum as eighty one thousand pounds of his stated and regular expense without mentioning contingencies which ought always to be esteemed a fourth of the yearly charges And as the crown was now necessarily burdened with a great and urgent debt of three hundred thousand pounds he thence inferred the absolute necessity of an immediate and large supply from the people To all these reasons which James likewise urged in a speech addressed to both houses the commons remained inexorable But not to shock the king with an absolute refusal they granted him one subsidy and one fifteenth which would scarcely amount to a hundred thousand pounds And James received the mortification of discovering in vain all his wants and of begging aid of subjects who had no reasonable indulgence or consideration for him Among the many causes of disgust and quarrel which now daily and unavoidably multiplied between prince and parliament this article of money is to be regarded as none of the least considerable After the discovery and conquest of the West Indies gold and silver became every day more plentiful in England as well as in the rest of Europe and the price of all commodities and provisions rose to a height beyond what had been known since the declension of the Roman empire As the revenue of the crown rose not in proportion the prince was insensibly reduced to poverty amidst the general riches of his subjects and required additional funds in order to support the same magnificence and force which had been maintained by former monarchs But while money thus flowed into England we may observe that at the same time and probably from that very cause arts and industry of all kinds received a mighty increase and elegance in every enjoyment of life became better known and more cultivated among all ranks of people Besides the great alienation of the crown lands the fee farm rents never increased and the other lands were let on long leases and at a great undervalue little or nothing above the old rent The king s servants both civil and military his courtiers his ministers demanded more ample supplies from the impoverished prince and were not contented with the same simplicity of living which had satisfied their ancestors The prince himself began to regard an increase of pomp and splendor as requisite to support the dignity of his character and to preserve the same superiority above his subjects which his predecessors had enjoyed Some equality too and proportion to the other sovereigns of Europe it was natural for him to desire and as they had universally enlarged their revenue and multiplied their taxes the king of England deemed it reasonable that his subjects who were generally as rich as theirs should bear with patience some additional burdens and impositions Unhappily for the king those very riches with the increasing knowledge of the age bred opposite sentiments in his subjects and begetting a spirit of freedom and independence disposed them to pay little regard either to the entreaties or menaces of their sovereign While the barons possessed their former immense property and extensive jurisdictions they were apt at every disgust to endanger the monarch and throw the whole government into confusion but this confusion often in its turn proved favorable to the monarch and made the nation again submit to him in order to reestablish justice and tranquillity After the power of alienations as well as the increase of commerce had thrown the balance of property into the hands of the commons the situation of affairs and the dispositions of men became susceptible of a more regular plan of liberty and the laws were not supported singly by the authority of the sovereign And though in that interval after the decline of the peers and before the people had yet experienced their force the princes assumed an exorbitant power and had almost annihilated the constitution under the weight of their prerogative as soon as the commons recovered from their lethargy they seem to have been astonished at the danger and were resolved to secure liberty by firmer barriers than their ancestors had hitherto provided for it Had James possessed a very rigid frugality he might have warded off this crisis somewhat longer and waiting patiently for a favorable opportunity to increase and fix his revenue might have secured the extensive authority transmitted to him On the other hand had the commons been inclined to act with more generosity and kindness towards their prince they might probably have turned his necessities to good account and have bribed him to depart peaceably from the more dangerous articles of his prerogative But he was a foreigner and ignorant of the arts of popularity they were soured by religious prejudices and tenacious of their money and in this situation it is no wonder that during this whole reign we scarcely find an interval of mutual confidence and friendship between prince and parliament The king by his prerogative alone had some years before altered the rates of the customs and had established higher impositions on several kinds of merchandise This exercise of power will naturally to us appear arbitrary and illegal yet according to the principles and practices of that time it might admit of some apology The duties of tonnage and poundage were at first granted to the crown by a vote of parliament and for a limited time and as the grant frequently expired and was renewed there could not then arise any doubt concerning the origin of the king s right to levy these duties and this imposition like all others was plainly derived from the voluntary consent of the people But as Henry V and all the succeeding sovereigns had the revenue conferred on them for life the prince so long in possession of these duties began gradually to consider them as his own proper right and inheritance and regarded the vote of parliament as a mere formality which rather expressed the acquiescence of the people in his prerogative than bestowed any new gift or revenue upon him The parliament when it first granted poundage to the crown had fixed no particular rates the imposition was given as a shilling in a pound or five percent on all commodities it was left to the king himself and the privy council aided by the advice of such merchants as they should think proper to consult to fix the value of goods and thereby the rates of the customs and as that value had been settled before the discovery of the West Indies it was become much inferior to the prices which almost all commodities bore in every market in Europe and consequently the customs on many goods though supposed to be five per cent was in reality much inferior The king therefore was naturally led to think that rates which were now plainly false ought to be corrected that a valuation of commodities fixed by one act of the privy council might be amended by another that if his right to poundage were inherent in the crown he should also possess of himself the right of correcting its inequalities if this duty were granted by the people he should at least support the spirit of the law by fixing a new and a juster valuation of all commodities But besides this reasoning which seems plausible if not solid the king was supported in that act of power by direct precedents some in the reign of Mary some in the beginning of Elizabeth Both these princesses had without consent of parliament altered the rates of commodities and as their impositions had all along been submitted to without a murmur and still continued to be levied the king had no reason to apprehend that a further exertion of the same authority would give any occasion of complaint That less umbrage might be taken he was moderate in the new rates which he established the customs during his whole reign rose only from one hundred and twenty seven thousand pounds a year to one hundred and ninety thousand though besides the increase of the rates there was a sensible increase of commerce and industry during that period every commodity besides which might serve to the subsistence of the people or might be considered as a material of manufactures was exempted from the new impositions of James but all this caution could not prevent the complaints of the commons Winwood vol ii p four hundred thirty eight Journ eighteenth April fifth and tenth May sixteen fourteen et cetera twentieth February sixteen twenty five See also Sir John Davis s Question concerning Impositions p one hundred twenty seven one hundred twenty eight Sir John Davis s Question concerning Impositions A spirit of liberty had now taken possession of the house the leading members men of an independent genius and large views began to regulate their opinions more by the future consequences which they foresaw than by the former precedents which were set before them and they less aspired at maintaining the ancient constitution than at establishing a new one and a freer and a better In their remonstrances to the king on this occasion they observed it to be a general opinion That the reasons of that practice might be extended much further even to the utter ruin of the ancient liberty of the kingdom and the subjects right of property in their lands and goods Though expressly forbidden by the king to touch his prerogative they passed a bill abolishing these impositions which was rejected by the house of lords In another address to the king they objected to the practice of borrowing upon privy seals and desired that the subjects should not be forced to lend money to his majesty nor give a reason for their refusal Some murmurs likewise were thrown out in the house against a new monopoly of the license of wines It must be confessed that forced loans and monopolies were established on many and ancient as well as recent precedents though diametrically opposite to all the principles of a free government fifty one The house likewise discovered some discontent against the king s proclamations James told them That though he well knew by the constitution and policy of the kingdom that proclamations were not of equal force with laws yet he thought it a duty incumbent on him and a power inseparably annexed to the crown to restrain and prevent such mischiefs and inconveniencies as he saw growing on the state against which no certain law was extant and which might tend to the great detriment of the subject if there should be no remedy provided till the meeting of a parliament And this prerogative he adds our progenitors have in all times used and enjoyed The intervals between sessions we may observe were frequently so long as to render it necessary for a prince to interpose by his prerogative The legality of this exertion was established by uniform and undisputed practice and was even acknowledged by lawyers who made however this difference between laws and proclamations that the authority of the former was perpetual that of the latter expired with the sovereign who emitted them v But what the authority could be which bound the subject yet was different from the authority of laws and inferior to it seems inexplicable by any maxims of reason or politics and in this instance as in many others it is easy to see how inaccurate the English constitution was before the parliament was enabled by continued acquisitions or encroachments to establish it on fixed principles of liberty Journ twenty eighth May sixteen ten Parliament Hist vol v p two hundred forty one See note YY at the end of the volume Parliament Hist vol v p two hundred fifty v Journ twelfth May sixteen twenty four Upon the settlement of the reformation that extensive branch of power which regards ecclesiastical matters being then without an owner seemed to belong to the first occupant and Henry VIII failed not immediately to seize it and to exert it even to the utmost degree of tyranny The possession of it was continued with Edward and recovered by Elizabeth and that ambitious princess was so remarkably jealous of this flower of her crown that she severely reprimanded the parliament if they ever presumed to intermeddle in these matters and they were so overawed by her authority as to submit and to ask pardon on these occasions But James s parliaments were much less obsequious They ventured to lift up their eyes and to consider this prerogative They there saw a large province of government possessed by the king alone and scarcely ever communicated with the parliament They were sensible that this province admitted not of any exact boundary or circumscription They had felt that the Roman pontiff in former ages under pretence of religion was gradually making advances to usurp the whole civil power They dreaded still more dangerous consequences from the claims of their own sovereign who resided among them and who in many other respects possessed such unlimited authority They therefore deemed it absolutely necessary to circumscribe this branch of prerogative and accordingly in the preceding session they passed a bill against the establishment of any ecclesiastical canons without consent of parliament But the house of lords as is usual defended the barriers of the throne and rejected the bill In this session the commons after passing anew the same bill made remonstrances against the proceedings of the high commission court It required no great penetration to see the extreme danger to liberty arising in a regal government from such large discretionary powers as were exercised by that court But James refused compliance with the application of the commons He was probably sensible that besides the diminution of his authority many inconveniencies must necessarily result from the abolishing of all discretionary power in every magistrate and that the laws were they ever so carefully framed and digested could not possibly provide against every contingency much less where they had not as yet attained a sufficient degree of accuracy and refinement Journ twod eleventh December fifth March sixteen oh six Parliament Hist vol v p two hundred forty seven Kennet p six hundred eighty one But the business which chiefly occupied the commons during this session was the abolition of wardships and purveyance prerogatives which had been more or less touched on every session during the whole reign of James In this affair the commons employed the proper means which might entitle them to success they offered the king a settled revenue as an equivalent for the powers which he should part with and the king was willing to hearken to terms After much dispute he agreed to give up these prerogatives for two hundred thousand pounds a year which they agreed to confer upon him And nothing remained towards closing the bargain but that the commons should determine the funds by which this sum should be levied This session was too far advanced to bring so difficult a matter to a full conclusion and though the parliament met again towards the end of the year and resumed the question they were never able to terminate an affair upon which they seemed so intent The journals of that session are lost and as the historians of this reign are very negligent in relating parliamentary affairs of whose importance they were not sufficiently apprised we know not exactly the reason of this failure It only appears that the king was extremely dissatisfied with the conduct of the parliament and soon after dissolved it This was his first parliament and it sat near seven years We learn from Winwood s Memorials vol ii p one hundred ninety three the reason assigned for this particular sum From thence my lord treasurer came to the price and here he said that the king would no more rise and fall like a merchant That he would not have a flower of his crown meaning the court of wards so much tossed that it was too dainty to be so handled and then he said that he must deliver the very countenance and character of the king s mind out of his own handwriting which before he read he said he would acquaint us with a pleasant conceit of his majesty As concerning the number of ninescore thousand pounds which was our number he could not affect because nine was the number of the poets who were always beggars though they served so many muses and eleven was the number of the apostles when the traitor Judas was away and therefore might best be affected by his majesty but there was a mean number which might accord us both and that was ten which says my lord treasurer is a sacred number for so many were God s commandments which tend to virtue and edification If the commons really voted twenty thousand pounds a year more on account of this pleasant conceit of the king and the treasurer it was certainly the best paid wit for its goodness that ever was in the world Amidst all these attacks some more some less violent on royal prerogative the king displayed as openly as ever all his exalted notions of monarchy and the authority of princes Even in a speech to the parliament where he begged for supply and where he should naturally have used every art to ingratiate himself with that assembly he expressed himself in these terms I conclude then the point touching the power of kings with this axiom of divinity that as to dispute what God may do is blasphemy but what God wills that divines may lawfully and do ordinarily dispute and discuss So is it sedition in subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height of his power But just kings will ever be willing to declare what they will do if they will not incur the curse of God I will not be content that my power be disputed upon but I shall ever be willing to make the reason appear of my doings and rule my actions according to my laws Notwithstanding the great extent of prerogative in that age these expressions would probably give some offence But we may observe that as the king s despotism was more speculative than practical so the independency of the commons was at this time the reverse and though strongly supported by their present situation as well as disposition was too new and recent to be as yet founded on systematical principles and opinions fifty two This year was distinguished by a memorable event which gave great alarm and concern in England the murder of the French monarch by the poniard of the fanatical Ravaillac With his death the glory of the French monarchy suffered an eclipse for some years and as that kingdom fell under an administration weak and bigoted factious and disorderly the Austrian greatness began anew to appear formidable to Europe In England the antipathy to the Catholics revived a little upon this tragical event and some of the laws which had formerly been enacted in order to keep these religionists in awe began now to be executed with greater rigor and severity King James s Works p five hundred thirty one See note ZZ at the end of the volume Kennet p six hundred eighty four Though James s timidity and indolence fixed him during most of his reign in a very prudent inattention to foreign affairs there happened this year an event in Europe of such mighty consequence as to rouse him from his lethargy and summon up all his zeal and enterprise A professor of divinity named Vorstius the disciple of Arminius was called from a German to a Dutch university and as he differed from his Britannic majesty in some nice questions concerning the intimate essence and secret decrees of God he was considered as a dangerous rival in scholastic fame and was at last obliged to yield to the legions of that royal doctor whose syllogisms he might have refuted or eluded If vigor was wanting in other incidents of James s reign here he behaved even with haughtiness and insolence and the states were obliged after several remonstrances to deprive Vorstius of his chair and to banish him their dominions The king carried no further his animosity against that professor though he had very charitably hinted to the states That as to the burning of Vorstius for his blasphemies and atheism he left them to their own Christian wisdom but surely never heretic better deserved the flames It is to be remarked that at this period all over Europe except in Holland alone the practice of burning heretics still prevailed even in Protestant countries and instances were not wanting in England during the reign of James To consider James in a more advantageous light we must take a view of him as the legislator of Ireland and most of the institutions which he had framed for civilizing that kingdom being finished about this period it may not here be improper to give some account of them He frequently boasts of the management of Ireland as his masterpiece and it will appear upon inquiry that his vanity in this particular was not altogether without foundation After the subjection of Ireland by Elizabeth the more difficult task still remained to civilize the inhabitants to reconcile them to laws and industry and to render their subjection durable and useful to the crown of England James proceeded in this work by a steady regular and well concerted plan and in the space of nine years according to Sir John Davis he made greater advances towards the reformation of that kingdom than had been made in the four hundred and forty years which had elapsed since the conquest was first attempted Kennet p seven hundred fifteen King James s Works p three hundred fifty five King James s Works p two hundred fifty nine edit sixteen thirteen It was previously necessary to abolish the Irish customs which supplied the place of laws and which were calculated to keep that people forever in a state of barbarism and disorder By the Brehon law or custom every crime however enormous was punished not with death but by a fine or pecuniary mulct which was levied upon the criminal Murder itself as among all the ancient barbarous nations was atoned for in this manner and each man according to his rank had a different rate or value affixed to him which if any one were willing to pay he needed not fear assassinating his enemy This rate was called his eric When Sir William Fitzwilliams being lord deputy told Maguire that he was to send a sheriff into Fermannah which a little before had been made a county and subjected to the English law Your sheriff said Maguire shall be welcome to me but let me know beforehand his eric or the price of his head that if my people cut it off I may levy the money upon the county As for oppression extortion and other trespasses so little were they regarded that no penalty was affixed to them and no redress for such offences could ever be obtained The customs of gavelkinde and tanistry were attended with the same absurdity in the distribution of property The land by the custom of gavelkinde was divided among all the males of the sept or family both bastard and legitimate and after partition made if any of the sept died his portion was not shared out among his sons but the chieftain at his discretion made a new partition of all the lands belonging to that sept and gave every one his share As no man by reason of this custom enjoyed the fixed property of any land to build to plant to enclose to cultivate to improve would have been so much lost labor The chieftains and the tanists though drawn from the principal families were not hereditary but were established by election or more properly speaking by force and violence Their authority was almost absolute and notwithstanding that certain lands were assigned to the office its chief profit resulted from exactions dues assessments for which there was no fixed law and which were levied at pleasure Sir John Davis p one hundred sixty six Sir John Davis p one hundred sixty seven Sir John Davis p one hundred seventy three Hence arose that common by word among the Irish That they dwelt westward of the law which dwelt beyond the river of the Barrow meaning the country where the English inhabited and which extended not beyond the compass of twenty miles lying in the neighborhood of Dublin After abolishing these Irish customs and substituting English law in their place James having taken all the natives under his protection and declared them free citizens proceeded to govern them by a regular administration military at well as civil A small army was maintained its discipline inspected and its pay transmitted from England in order to keep the soldiers from preying upon the country as had been usual in former reigns When Odoghartie raised an insurrection a reenforcement was sent over and the flames of that rebellion were immediately extinguished All minds being first quieted by a general indemnity circuits were established justice administered oppression banished and crimes and disorders of every kind severely punished As the Irish had been universally engaged in the rebellion against Elizabeth a resignation of all the rights which had been formerly granted them to separate jurisdictions was rigorously exacted and no authority but that of the king and the law was permitted throughout the kingdom A resignation of all private estates was even required and when they were restored the proprietors received them under such conditions as might prevent for the future all tyranny and oppression over the common people The value of the dues which the nobles usually claimed from their vassals was estimated at a fixed sum and all further arbitrary exactions prohibited under severe penalties v The whole province of Ulster having fallen to the crown by the attainder of rebels a company was established in London for planting new colonies in that fertile country the property was divided into moderate shares the largest not exceeding two thousand acres tenants were brought over from England and Scotland the Irish were removed from the hills and fastnesses and settled in the open country husbandry and the arts were taught them a fixed habitation secured plunder and robbery punished and by these means Ulster from being the most wild and disorderly province of all Ireland soon became the best cultivated and most civilized v Sir John Davis p two hundred thirty

eight Such were the arts by which James introduced humanity and justice among a people who had ever been buried in the most profound barbarism Noble cares much superior to the vain and criminal glory of conquests but requiring ages of perseverance and attention to perfect what had been so happily begun A laudable act of justice was about this time executed in England upon Lord Sanqubir a Scottish nobleman who had been guilty of the base assassination of Turner a fencing master The English nation who were generally dissatisfied with the Scots were enraged at this crime equally mean and atrocious but James appeased them by preferring the severity of law to the intercession of the friends and family of the criminal Kennet p six hundred eighty eight CHAPTER XLVII JAMES I This year the sudden death of Henry prince of Wales diffused a universal grief throughout the nation Though youth and royal birth both of them strong allurements prepossess men mightily in favor of the early age of princes it is with peculiar fondness that historians mention Henry and in every respect his merit seems to have been extraordinary He had not reached his eighteenth year and he already possessed more dignity in his behavior and commanded more respect than his father with all his age learning and experience Neither his high fortune nor his youth had seduced him into any irregular pleasures business and ambition seem to have been his sole passion His inclinations as well as exercises were martial The French ambassador taking leave of him and asking his commands for France found him employed in the exercise of the pike Tell your king said he in what occupation you left me engaged He had conceived great affection and esteem for the brave Sir Walter Raleigh It was his saying Sure no king but my father would keep such a bird in a cage The French monarch had given particular orders to his ministers to cultivate the prince s friendship who must soon said he have chief authority in England where the king and queen are held in so little estimation See Dep de la Boderie vol i p four hundred two four hundred fifteen vol ii p sixteen three hundred forty nine Coke s Detection p thirty seven He seems indeed to have nourished too violent a contempt for the king on account of his pedantry and pusillanimity and by that means struck in with the restless and martial spirit of the English nation Had he lived he had probably promoted the glory perhaps not the felicity of his people The unhappy prepossession which men commonly entertain in favor of ambition courage enterprise and other warlike virtues engages generous natures who always love fame in such pursuits all destroy their own peace and that of the rest of mankind Violent reports were propagated as if Henry had been carried off by poison but the physicians on opening his body found no symptoms to confirm such an opinion The bold and criminal malignity of men s tongues and pens spared not even the king on the occasion But that prince s character seems rather to have failed in the extreme of facility and humanity than in that of cruelty and violence His indulgence to Henry was great and perhaps imprudent by giving him a large and independent settlement even in so early youth Kennet p six hundred ninety Coke p thirty seven Welwood p two hundred seventy two The marriage of the princess Elizabeth with Frederic elector palatine was finished some time after the death of the prince and served to dissipate the grief which arose on that melancholy event But this marriage though celebrated with great joy and festivity proved itself an unhappy event to the king as well as to his son in law and had ill consequences on the reputation and fortunes of both The elector trusting to so great an alliance engaged in enterprises beyond his strength and the king not being able to support him in his distress lost entirely in the end of his life what remained of the affections and esteem of his own subjects Except during sessions of parliament the history of this reign may more properly be called the history of the court than that of the nation An interesting object had for some years engaged the attention of the court it was a favorite and one beloved by James with so profuse and unlimited an affection as left no room for any rival or competitor About the end of the year sixteen oh nine Robert Carre a youth of twenty years of age and of a good family in Scotland arrived in London after having passed some time in his travels All his natural accomplishments consisted in good looks all his acquired abilities in an easy air and graceful demeanor He had letters of recommendation to his countryman Lord Hay and that nobleman no sooner cast his eye upon him than he discovered talents sufficient to entitle him immediately to make a great figure in the government Apprised of the king s passion for youth and beauty and exterior appearance he studied how matters might be so managed that this new object should make the strongest impression upon him Without mentioning him at court he assigned him the office at a match of tilting of presenting to the king his buckler and device and hoped that he would attract the attention of the monarch Fortune proved favorable to his design by an incident which bore at first a contrary aspect When Carre was advancing to execute his office his unruly horse flung him and broke his leg in the king s presence James approached him with pity and concern love and affection arose on the sight of his beauty and tender years and the prince ordered him immediately to be lodged in the palace and to be carefully attended He himself after the tilting paid him a visit in his chamber and frequently returned during his confinement The ignorance and simplicity of the boy finished the conquest begun by his exterior graces and accomplishments Other princes have been fond of choosing their favorites from among the lower ranks of their subjects and have reposed themselves on them with the more unreserved confidence and affection because the object has been beholden to their bounty for every honor and acquisition James was desirous that his favorite should also derive from him all his sense experience and knowledge Highly conceited of his own wisdom he pleased himself with the fancy that this raw youth by his lessons and instructions would in a little time be equal to his sagest ministers and be initiated into all the profound mysteries of government on which he set so high a value And as this kind of creation was more perfectly his own work than any other he seems to have indulged an unlimited fondness for his minion beyond even that which he bore to his own children He soon knighted him created him Viscount Rochester gave him the garter brought him into the privy council and though at first without assigning him any particular office bestowed on him the supreme direction of all his business and political concerns Agreeable to this rapid advancement in confidence and honor were the riches heaped upon the needy favorite and while Salisbury and all the wisest ministers could scarcely find expedients sufficient to keep in motion the overburdened machine of government James with unsparing hand loaded with treasures this insignificant and useless pageant Kennet p six hundred eighty five six hundred eighty six et cetera It is said that the king found his pupil so ill educated as to be ignorant even of the lowest rudiments of the Latin tongue and that the monarch laying aside the sceptre took the birch into his royal hand and instructed him in the principles of grammar During the intervals of this noble occupation affairs of state would be introduced and the stripling by the ascendant which he had acquired was now enabled to repay on political what he had received in grammatical instruction Such scenes and such incidents are the more ridiculous though the less odious as the passion of James seems not to have contained in it any thing criminal or flagitious History charges herself willingly with a relation of the great crimes and still more with that of the great virtues of mankind but she appears to fall from her dignity when necessitated to dwell on such frivolous events and ignoble personages The favorite was not at first so intoxicated with advancement as not to be sensible of his own ignorance and inexperience He had recourse to the assistance and advice of a friend and he was more fortunate in his choice than is usual with such pampered minions In Sir Thomas Overbury he met with a judicious and sincere counsellor who building all hopes of his own preferment on that of the young favorite endeavored to instil into him the principles of prudence and discretion By zealously serving every body Carre was taught to abate the envy which might attend his sudden elevation by showing a preference for the English he learned to escape the prejudices which prevailed against his country And so long as he was content to be ruled by Overbury s friendly counsels he enjoyed what is rare the highest favor of the prince without being hated by the people To complete the measure of courtly happiness nought was wanting but a kind mistress and where high fortune concurred with all the graces of youth and beauty this circumstance could not be difficult to attain But it was here that the favorite met with that rock on which all his fortunes were wrecked and which plunged him forever into an abyss of infamy guilt and misery No sooner had James mounted the throne of England than he remembered his friendship for the unfortunate families of Howard and Devereux who had suffered for their attachment to the cause of Mary and to his own Having restored young Essex to his blood and dignity and conferred the titles of Suffolk and Northampton on two brothers of the house of Norfolk he sought the further pleasure of uniting these families by the marriage of the earl of Essex with Lady Frances Howard daughter of the earl of Suffolk She was only thirteen he fourteen years of age and it was thought proper till both should attain the age of puberty that he should go abroad and pass some time in his travels He returned into England after four years absence and was pleased to find his countess in the full lustre of beauty and possessed of the love and admiration of the whole court But when the earl approached and claimed the privileges of a husband he met with nothing but symptoms of aversion and disgust and a flat refusal of any further familiarities He applied to her parents who constrained her to attend him into the country and to partake of his bed but nothing could overcome her rigid sullenness and obstinacy and she still rose from his side without having shared the nuptial pleasures Disgusted with reiterated denials he at last gave over the pursuit and separating himself from her thenceforth abandoned her conduct to her own will and discretion Such coldness and aversion in Lady Essex arose not without an attachment to another object The favorite had opened his addresses and had been too successful in making impression on the tender heart of the young countess She imagined that so long as she refused the embraces of Essex she never could be deemed his wife and that a separation and divorce might still open the way for a new marriage with her beloved Rochester Though their passion was so violent and their opportunities of intercourse so frequent that they had already indulged themselves in all the gratifications of love they still lamented their unhappy fate while the union between them was not entire and indissoluble And the lover as well as his mistress was impatient till their mutual ardor should be crowned by marriage Kennet p six hundred eighty six Kennet p six hundred eighty seven State Trials vol i p two hundred twenty eight So momentous an affair could not be concluded without consulting Overbury with whom Rochester was accustomed to share all his secrets While that faithful friend had considered his patron s attachment to the countess of Essex merely as an affair of gallantry he had favored its progress and it was partly owing to the ingenious and passionate letters which he dictated that Rochester had met with such success in his addresses Like an experienced courtier he thought that a conquest of this nature would throw a lustre on the young favorite and would tend still further to endear him to James who was charmed to hear of the amours of his court and listened with attention to every tale of gallantry But great was Overbury s alarm when Rochester mentioned his design of marrying the countess and he used every method to dissuade his friend from so foolish an attempt He represented how invidious how difficult an enterprise to procure her a divorce from her husband how dangerous how shameful to take into his own bed a profligate woman who being married to a young nobleman of the first rank had not scrupled to prostitute her character and to bestow favors on the object of a capricious and momentary passion And in the zeal of friendship he went so far as to threaten Rochester that he would separate himself forever from him if he could so far forget his honor and his interest as to prosecute the intended marriage Rochester had the weakness to reveal this conversation to the countess of Essex and when her rage and fury broke out against Overbury he had also the weakness to enter into her vindictive projects and to swear vengeance against his friend for the utmost instance which he could receive of his faithful friendship Some contrivance was necessary for the execution of their purpose Rochester addressed himself to the king and after complaining that his own indulgence to Overbury had begotten in him a degree of arrogance which was extremely disagreeable he procured a commission for his embassy to Russia which he represented as a retreat for his friend both profitable and honorable When consulted by Overbury he earnestly dissuaded him from accepting this offer and took on himself the office of satisfying the king if he should be anywise displeased with the refusal To the king again he aggravated the insolence of Overbury s conduct and obtained a warrant for committing him to the Tower which James intended as a slight punishment for his disobedience The lieutenant of the Tower was a creature of Rochester s and had lately been put into the office for this very purpose he confined Overbury so strictly that the unhappy prisoner was debarred the sight even of his nearest relations and no communication of any kind was allowed with him during near six months which he lived in prison State Trials vol i p two hundred thirty five two hundred thirty six two hundred fifty two Franklyn p fourteen State Trials vol i p two hundred thirty six two hundred thirty seven et cetera This obstacle being removed the lovers pursued their purpose and the king himself forgetting the dignity of his character and his friendship for the family of Essex entered zealously into the project of procuring the countess a divorce from her husband Essex also embraced the opportunity of separating himself from a bad woman by whom he was hated and he was willing to favor their success by any honorable expedient The pretence for a divorce was his incapacity to fulfil the conjugal duties and he confessed that with regard to the countess he was conscious of such an infirmity though he was not sensible of it with regard to any other woman In her place too it is said a young virgin was substituted under a mask to undergo a legal inspection by a jury of matrons After such a trial seconded by court influence and supported by the ridiculous opinion of fascination or witchcraft the sentence of divorce was pronounced between the earl of Essex and his countess And to crown the scene the king solicitous lest the lady should lose any rank by her new marriage bestowed on his minion the title of earl of Somerset Notwithstanding this success the countess of Somerset was not satisfied till she should further satiate her revenge on Overbury and she engaged her husband as well as her uncle the earl of Northampton in the atrocious design of taking him off secretly by poison Fruitless attempts were reiterated by weak poisons but at last they gave him one so sudden and violent that the symptoms were apparent to every one who approached him His interment was hurried on with the greatest precipitation and though a strong suspicion immediately prevailed in the public the full proof of the crime was not brought to light till some years after State Trials vol i p two hundred twenty three two hundred twenty four et cetera Franklyn s Annais p two three et cetera The fatal catastrophe of Overbury increased or begot the suspicion that the prince of Wales had been carried off by poison given him by Somerset Men considered not that the contrary inference was much juster If Somerset was so great a novice in this detestable art that during the course of five months a man who was his prisoner and attended by none but his emissaries could not be despatched but in so bungling a manner how could it be imagined that a young prince living in his own court surrounded by his own friends and domestics could be exposed to Somerset s attempts and be taken off by so subtile a poison if such a one exist as could elude the skill of the most experienced physicians The ablest minister that James ever possessed the earl of Salisbury was dead Suffolk a man of slender capacity had succeeded him in his office and it was now his task to supply from an exhausted treasury the profusion of James and of his young favorite The title of baronet invented by Salisbury was sold and two hundred patents of that species of knighthood were disposed of for so many thousand pounds each rank of nobility had also its price affixed to it privy seals were circulated to the amount of two hundred thousand pounds benevolences were exacted to the amount of fifty two thousand pounds and some monopolies of no great value were erected But all these expedients proved insufficient to supply the king s necessities even though he began to enter into some schemes for retrenching his expenses However small the hopes of success a new parliament must be summoned and this dangerous expedient for such it was now become once more be put to trial When the commons were assembled they discovered an extraordinary alarm on account of the rumor which was spread abroad concerning undertakers v It was reported that several persons attached to the king had entered into a confederacy and having laid a regular plan for the new elections had distributed their interest all over England and had undertaken to secure a majority for the court So ignorant were the commons that they knew not this incident to be the first infallible symptom of any regular or established liberty Had they been contented to follow the maxims of their predecessors who as the earl of Salisbury said to the last parliament never but thrice in six hundred years refused a supply v they needed not dread that the crown should ever interest itself in their elections Formerly the kings even insisted that none of their household should be elected members and though the charter was afterwards declared void Henry VI from his great favor to the city of York conferred a peculiar privilege on its citizens that they should be exempted from this trouble v fourteenth of May sixteen twelve Franklyn p

Franklyn p forty eight v Journ seventeenth Feb sixteen oh nine It appears however that Salisbury was somewhat mistaken in this fact and if the kings were not oftener refused supply by the parliament it was only because they would not often expose themselves to the hazard of being refused but it in certain that English parliaments did anciently carry their frugality to an extreme and seldom could be prevailed upon to give the necessary support to government v Coke s Institutes part iv chap I of Charters of Exemption It is well known that in ancient times a seat in the house being considered as a burden attended neither with honor nor profit it was requisite for the counties and boroughs to pay fees to their representatives About this time a seat began to be regarded as an honor and the country gentlemen contended for it though the practice of levying wages for the parliament men was not altogether discontinued It was not till long after when liberty was thoroughly established and popular assemblies entered into every branch of public business that the members began to join profit to honor and the crown found it necessary to distribute among them all the considerable offices of the kingdom So little skill or so small means had the courtiers in James s reign for managing elections that this house of commons showed rather a stronger spirit of liberty than the foregoing and instead of entering upon the business of supply as urged by the king who made them several liberal offers of grace they immediately resumed the subject which had been opened last parliament and disputed his majesty s power of levying new customs and impositions by the mere authority of his prerogative It is remarkable that in their debates on this subject the courtiers frequently pleaded as a precedent the example of all the other hereditary monarchs in Europe and particularly mentioned the kings of France and Spain nor was this reasoning received by the house either with surprise or indignation The members of the opposite party either contented themselves with denying the justness of the inference or they disputed the truth of the observation And a patriot member in particular Sir Roger Owen even in arguing against the impositions frankly allowed that the king of England was endowed with as ample a power and prerogative as any prince in Christendom The nations on the continent we may observe enjoyed still in that age some small remains of liberty and the English were possessed of little more Journ eleventh April sixteen fourteen Journ twenty first May sixteen fourteen Journ twelfth twenty first May sixteen fourteen Journ eighteenth April sixteen fourteen The commons applied to the lords for a conference with regard to the new impositions A speech of Neile bishop of Lincoln reflecting on the lower house begat some altercation with the peers fifty three and the king seized the opportunity of dissolving immediately with great indignation a parliament which had shown so firm a resolution of retrenching his prerogative without communicating in return the smallest supply to his necessities He carried his resentment so far as even to throw into prison some of the members who had been the most forward in their opposition to his measures In vain did he plead in excuse for this violence the example of Elizabeth and other princes of the line of Tudor as well as Plantagenet The people and the parliament without abandoning forever all their liberties and privileges could acquiesce in none of these precedents how ancient and frequent soever And were the authority of such precedents admitted the utmost that could be inferred is that the constitution of England was at that time an inconsistent fabric whose jarring and discordant parts must soon destroy each other and from the dissolution of the old beget some new form of civil government more uniform and consistent See note AAA at the end of the volume Kennet p six hundred ninety six In the public and avowed conduct of the king and the house of commons throughout this whole reign there appears sufficient cause of quarrel and mutual disgust yet are we not to imagine that this was the sole foundation of that jealousy which prevailed between them During debates in the house it often happened that a particular member more ardent and zealous than the rest would display the highest sentiments of liberty which the commons contented themselves to hear with silence and seeming approbation and the king informed of these harangues concluded the whole house to be infected with the same principles and to be engaged in a combination against his prerogative The king on the other hand though he valued himself extremely on his kingcraft and perhaps was not altogether incapable of dissimulation seems to have been very little endowed with the gift of secrecy but openly at his table in all companies inculcated those monarchical tenets which he had so strongly imbibed Before a numerous audience he had expressed himself with great disparagement of the common law of England and had given the preference in the strongest terms to the civil law and for this indiscretion he found himself obliged to apologize in a speech to the former parliament As a specimen of his usual liberty of talk we may mention a story though it passed some time after which we meet with in the life of Waller and which that poet used frequently to repeat When Waller was young he had the curiosity to go to court and he stood in the circle and saw James dine where among other company there sat at table two bishops Neile and Andrews The king proposed aloud this question Whether he might not take his subjects money when he needed it without all this formality of parliament Neile replied God forbid you should not for you are the breath of our nostrils Andrews declined answering and said he was not skilled in parliamentary cases but upon the king s urging him and saying he would admit of no evasion the bishop replied pleasantly Why then I think your majesty may lawfully take my brother Neile s money for he offers it The favorite had hitherto escaped the inquiry of justice but he had not escaped that still voice which can make itself be heard amidst all the hurry and flattery of a court and astonishes the criminal with a just representation of his most secret enormities Conscious of the murder of his friend Somerset received small consolation from the enjoyments of love or the utmost kindness and indulgence of his sovereign The graces of his youth gradually disappeared the gayety of his manners was obscured his politeness and obliging behavior were changed into sullenness and silence And the king whose affections had been engaged by these superficial accomplishments began to estrange himself from a man who no longer contributed to his amusement The sagacious courtiers observed the first symptoms of this disgust Somerset s enemies seized the opportunity and offered a new minion to the king George Villiers a youth of one and twenty younger brother of a good family returned at this time from his travels and was remarked for the advantages of a handsome person genteel air and fashionable apparel At a comedy he was purposely placed full in James s eye and immediately engaged the attention and in the same instant the affections of that monarch Ashamed of his sudden attachment the king endeavored but in vain to conceal the partiality which he felt for the handsome stranger and he employed all his profound politics to fix him in his service without seeming to desire it King James s Works p five hundred thirty two Preface to Waller s Works Franklyn p fifty Kennet vol ii p six hundred ninety eight He declared his resolution not to confer any office on him unless entreated by the queen and he pretended that it should only be in complaisance to her choice he would agree to admit him near his person The queen was immediately applied to but she well knowing the extreme to which the king carried these attachments refused at first to lend her countenance to this new passion It was not till entreated by Abbot archbishop of Canterbury a decent prelate and one much prejudiced against Somerset that she would condescend to oblige her husband by asking this favor of him And the king thinking now that all appearances were fully saved no longer constrained his affection but immediately bestowed the office of cup bearer on young Villiers Coke p forty six forty seven Rush vol i p four hundred fifty six The whole court was thrown into parties between the two minions while some endeavored to advance the rising fortunes of Villiers others deemed it safer to adhere to the established credit of Somerset The king himself divided between inclination and decorum increased the doubt and ambiguity of the courtiers and the stern jealousy of the old favorite who refused every advance of friendship from his rival begat perpetual quarrels between their several partisans But the discovery of Somerset s guilt in the murder of Overbury at last decided the controversy and exposed him to the ruin and infamy which he so well merited An apothecary s apprentice who had been employed in making up the poisons having retired to Flushing began to talk very freely of the whole secret and the affair at last came to the ears of Trumbal the king s envoy in the Low Countries By his means Sir Ralph Winwood secretary of state was informed and he immediately carried the intelligence to James The king alarmed and astonished to find such enormous guilt in a man whom he had admitted into his bosom sent for Sir Edward Coke chief justice and earnestly recommended to him the most rigorous and unbiased scrutiny This injunction was executed with great industry and severity the whole labyrinth of guilt was carefully unravelled the lesser criminals Sir Jervis Elvis lieutenant of the Tower Franklin Weston missus Turner were first tried and condemned Somerset and his countess were afterwards found guilty Northampton s death a little before had saved him from a like fate It may not be unworthy of remark that Coke in the trial of missus Turner told her that she was guilty of the seven deadly sins she was a whore a bawd a sorcerer a witch a Papist a felon and a murderer And what may more surprise us Bacon then attorney general took care to observe that poisoning was a Popish trick Such were the bigoted prejudices which prevailed poisoning was not of itself sufficiently odious if it were not represented as a branch of Popery Stowe tells us that when the king came to Newcastle on his first entry into England he gave liberty to all the prisoners except those who were confined for treason murder and Papistry When one considers these circumstances that furious bigotry of the Catholics which broke out in the gunpowder conspiracy appears the less surprising All the accomplices in Overbury s murder received the punishment due to their crime but the king bestowed a pardon on the principals Somerset and the countess It must be confessed that James s fortitude had been highly laudable had he persisted in his first intention of consigning over to severe justice all the criminals but let us still beware of blaming him too harshly if on the approach of the fatal hour he scrupled to deliver into the hands of the executioner persons whom he had once favored with his most tender affections To soften the rigor of their fate after some years imprisonment he restored them to their liberty and conferred on them a pension with which they retired and languished out old age in infamy and obscurity Their guilty loves were turned into the most deadly hatred and they passed many years together in the same house without any intercourse or correspondence with each other Several historians in relating these events have insisted much on the dissimulation of James s behavior when he delivered Somerset into the hands of the chief justice on the insolent menaces of that criminal on his peremptory refusal to stand a trial and on the extreme anxiety of the king during the whole progress of this affair State Trials vol i p two hundred thirty State Trials vol i p two hundred forty two Kennet p six hundred ninety nine Coke Weldon et cetera Allowing all these circumstances to be true of which some are suspicious if not palpably false the great remains of tenderness which James still felt for Somerset may perhaps be sufficient to account for them That favorite was high spirited and resolute rather to perish than live under the infamy to which he was exposed James was sensible that the pardoning of so great a criminal which was of itself invidious would become still more unpopular if his obstinate and stubborn behavior on his trial should augment the public hatred against him At least the unreserved confidence in which the king had indulged his favorite for several years might render Somerset master of so many secrets that it is impossible without further light to assign the particular reason of that superiority which it is said he appeared so much to assume The fall of Somerset and his banishment from court opened the way for Villiers to mount up at once to the full height of favor of honors and of riches Had James s passion been governed by common rules of prudence the office of cup bearer would have attached Villiers to his person and might well have contented one of his age and family nor would any one who was not cynically austere have much censured the singularity of the king s choice in his friends and favorites But such advancement was far inferior to the fortune which he intended for his minion In the course of a few years he created him Viscount Villiers earl marquis and duke of Buckingham knight of the garter master of the horse chief justice in eyre warden of the cinque ports master of the king s bench office steward of Westminster constable of Windsor and lord high admiral of England His mother obtained the title of countess of Buckingham his brother was created Viscount Purbeck and a numerous train of needy relations were all pushed up into credit and authority And thus the fond prince while he meant to play the tutor to his favorite and to train him up in the rules of prudence and politics took an infallible method by loading him with premature and exorbitant honors to render him forever rash precipitate and insolent See Biog Brit article Coke p thirteen eighty four Bacon vol iv p six hundred seventeen Franklyn p thirty Clarendon eightvo edit vol i p ten A young minion to gratify with pleasure a necessitous family to supply with riches were enterprises too great for the empty exchequer of James In order to obtain a little money the cautionary towns must be delivered up to the Dutch a measure which has been severely blamed by almost all historians and I may venture to affirm that it has been censured much beyond its real weight and importance When Queen Elizabeth advanced money for the support of the infant republic besides the view of securing herself against the power and ambition of Spain she still reserved the prospect of reimbursement and she got consigned into her hands the three important fortresses of Flushing the Brille and Rammekins as pledges for the money due to her Indulgent to the necessitous condition of the states she agreed that the debt should bear no interest and she stipulated that if ever England should make a separate peace with Spain she should pay the troops which garrisoned those fortresses After the truce was concluded between Spain and the United Provinces the states made an agreement with the king that the debt which then amounted to eight hundred thousand pounds should be discharged by yearly payments of forty thousand pounds and as five years had elapsed the debt was now reduced to six hundred thousand pounds and in fifteen years more if the truce were renewed it would be finally extinguished Rymer tom xvi p three hundred forty one Winwood vol ii p three hundred fifty one Sir Dudley Carleton s Letters p twenty seven twenty eight But of this sum twenty six thousand pounds a year were expended on the pay of the garrisons the remainder alone accrued to the king and the states weighing these circumstances thought that they made James a very advantageous offer when they expressed their willingness on the surrender of the cautionary towns to pay him immediately two hundred and fifty thousand pounds and to incorporate the English garrisons in their army It occurred also to the king that even the payment of the forty thousand pounds a year was precarious and depended on the accident that the truce should be renewed between Spain and the republic if war broke out the maintenance of the garrisons lay upon England alone a burden very useless and too heavy for the slender revenues of that kingdom that even during the truce the Dutch straitened by other expenses were far from being regular in their payments and the garrisons were at present in danger of mutinying for want of subsistence that the annual sum of fourteen thousand pounds the whole saving on the Dutch payments amounted in fifteen years to no more than two hundred and ten thousand pounds whereas two hundred and fifty thousand pounds were offered immediately a larger sum and if money be computed at ten per cent the current interest more than double the sum to which England was entitled that if James waited till the whole debt were discharged the troops which composed the garrisons remained a burden upon him and could not be broken without receiving some consideration for their past services that the cautionary towns were only a temporary restraint upon the Hollanders and in the present emergence the conjunction of interest between England and the republic was so intimate as to render all other ties superfluous and no reasonable measures for mutual support would be wanting from the Dutch even though freed from the dependence of these garrisons that the exchequer of the republic was at present very low insomuch that they found difficulty now that the aids of France were withdrawn to maintain themselves in that posture of defence which was requisite during the truce with Spain and that the Spaniards were perpetually insisting with the king on the restitution of these towns as belonging to their crown and no cordial alliance could ever be made with that nation while they remained in the hands of the English These reasons together with his urgent wants induced the king to accept of Caron s offer and he evacuated the cautionary towns which held the states in a degree of subjection and which an ambitious and enterprising prince would have regarded as his most valuable possessions This is the date of the full liberty of the Dutch commonwealth An annuity of fourteen thousand pounds during fifteen years money being at ten per cent is worth on computation only one hundred and six thousand five hundred pounds whereas the king received two hundred and fifty thousand pounds Yet the bargain was good for the Dutch as well as the king because they were both of them freed from the maintenance of useless garrisons Rushworth vol i p three When the crown of England devolved on James it might have been foreseen by the Scottish nation that the independence of their kingdom the object for which their ancestors had shed so much blood would now be lost and that if both states persevered in maintaining separate laws and parliaments the weaker would more sensibly feel the subjection than if it had been totally subdued by force of arms But these views did not generally occur The glory of having given a sovereign to their powerful enemy the advantages of present peace and tranquillity the riches acquired from the munificence of their master these considerations secured their dutiful obedience to a prince who daily gave such sensible proofs of his friendship and partiality towards them Never had the authority of any king who resided among them been so firmly established as was that of James even when absent and as the administration had been hitherto conducted with great order and tranquillity there had happened no occurrence to draw thither our attention But this summer the king was resolved to pay a visit to his native country in order to renew his ancient friendships and connections and to introduce that change of ecclesiastical discipline and government on which he was extremely intent The three chief points of this kind which James proposed to accomplish by his journey to Scotland were the enlarging of episcopal authority the establishing of a few ceremonies in public worship and the fixing of a superiority in the civil above the ecclesiastical jurisdiction But it is an observation suggested by all history and by none more than by that of James and his successor that the religious spirit when it mingles with faction contains in it something supernatural and unaccountable and that in its operations upon society effects correspond less to their known causes than is found in any other circumstance of government a reflection which may at once afford a source of blame against such sovereigns as lightly innovate in so dangerous an article and of apology for such as being engaged in an enterprise of that nature are disappointed of the expected event and fail in their undertakings When the Scottish nation was first seized with that zeal for reformation which though it caused such disturbance during the time has proved so salutary in the consequences the preachers assuming a character little inferior to the prophetic or apostolical disdained all subjection to the spiritual rulers of the church by whom their innovations were punished and opposed The revenues of the dignified clergy no longer considered as sacred were either appropriated by the present possessors or seized by the more powerful barons and what remained after mighty dilapidations was by act of parliament annexed to the crown The prelates however and abbots maintained their temporal jurisdictions and their seats in parliament and though laymen were sometimes endowed with ecclesiastical titles the church notwithstanding its frequent protestations to the contrary was still supposed to be represented by those spiritual lords in the states of the kingdom After many struggles the king even before his accession to the throne of England had acquired sufficient influence over the Scottish clergy to extort from them an acknowledgment of the parliamentary jurisdiction of bishops though attended with many precautions in order to secure themselves against the spiritual encroachments of that order When king of England he engaged them though still with great reluctance on their part to advance a step further and to receive the bishops as perpetual presidents or moderators in their ecclesiastical synods reiterating their protestations against all spiritual jurisdiction of the prelates and all controlling power over the presbyters And by such gradual innovations the king flattered himself that he should quietly introduce episcopal authority but as his final scope was fully seen from the beginning every new advance gave fresh occasion of discontent and aggravated instead of softening the abhorrence entertained against the prelacy fifteen ninety eight sixteen oh six What rendered the king s aim more apparent were the endeavors which at the same time he used to introduce into Scotland some of the ceremonies of the church of England the rest it was easily foreseen would soon follow The fire of devotion excited by novelty and inflamed by opposition had so possessed the minds of the Scottish reformers that all rites and ornaments and even order of worship were disdainfully rejected as useless burdens retarding the imagination in its rapturous ecstasies and cramping the operations of that divine spirit by which they supposed themselves to be animated A mode of worship was established the most naked and most simple imaginable one that borrowed nothing from the senses but reposed itself entirely on the contemplation of that divine essence which discovers itself to the understanding only This species of devotion so worthy of the Supreme Being but so little suitable to human frailty was observed to occasion great disturbances in the breast and in many respects to confound all rational principles of conduct and behavior The mind straining for these extraordinary raptures reaching them by short glances sinking again under its own weakness rejecting all exterior aid of pomp and ceremony was so occupied in this inward life that It fled from every intercourse of society and from every cheerful amusement which could soften or humanize the character It was obvious to all discerning eyes and had not escaped the king s that by the prevalence of fanaticism a gloomy and sullen disposition established itself among the people a spirit obstinate and dangerous independent and disorderly animated equally with a contempt of authority and a hatred to every other mode of religion particularly to the Catholic In order to mellow these humors James endeavored to infuse a small tincture of ceremony into the national worship and to introduce such rites as might in some degree occupy the mind and please the senses without departing too far from that simplicity by which the reformation was distinguished The finer arts too though still rude in these northern kingdoms were employed to adorn the churches and the king s chapel in which an organ was erected and some pictures and statues displayed was proposed as a model to the rest of the nation But music was grating to the prejudiced ears of the Scottish clergy sculpture and painting appeared instruments of idolatry the surplice was a rag of Popery and every motion or gesture prescribed by the liturgy was a step towards that spiritual Babylon so much the object of their horror and aversion Every thing was deemed impious but their own mystical comments on the Scriptures which they idolized and whose Eastern prophetic style they employed in every common occurrence It will not be necessary to give a particular account of the ceremonies which the king was so intent to establish Such institutions for a time are esteemed either too divine to have proceeded from any other being than the Supreme Creator of the universe or too diabolical to have been derived from any but an infernal demon But no sooner is the mode of the controversy past than they are universally discovered to be of so little importance as scarcely to be mentioned with decency amidst the ordinary course of human transactions It suffices here to remark that the rites introduced by James regarded the kneeling at the sacrament private communion private baptism confirmation of children and the observance of Christmas and other festivals Franklyn p twenty five Spotswood The acts establishing these ceremonies were afterwards known by the name of the Articles of Perth from the place where they were ratified by the assembly A conformity of discipline and worship between the churches of England and Scotland which was James s aim he never could hope to establish but by first procuring an acknowledgment of his own authority in all spiritual causes and nothing could be more contrary to the practice as well as principles of the Presbyterian clergy The ecclesiastical courts possessed the power of pronouncing excommunication and that sentence besides the spiritual consequences supposed to follow from it was attended with immediate effects of the most important nature The person excommunicated was shunned by every one as profane and impious and his whole estate during his lifetime and all his movables forever were forfeited to the crown Nor were the previous steps requisite before pronouncing this sentence formal or regular in proportion to the weight of it Without accuser without summons without trial any ecclesiastical court however inferior sometimes pretended in a summary manner to denounce excommunication for any cause and against any person even though he lived not within the bounds of their jurisdiction And by this means the whole tyranny of the inquisition though without its order was introduced into the kingdom But the clergy were not content with the unlimited jurisdiction which they exercised in ecclesiastical matters they assumed a censorial power over every part of administration and in all their sermons and even prayers mingling politics with religion they inculcated the most seditious and most turbulent principles Black minister of saint Andrew s went so far in a sermon as to pronounce all kings the devil s children he gave the queen of England the appellation of atheist he said that the treachery of the king s heart was now fully discovered and in his prayers for the queen he used these words We must pray for her for the fashion s sake but we have no cause she will never do us any good When summoned before the privy council he refused to answer to a civil court for any thing delivered from the pulpit even though the crime of which he was accused was of a civil nature The church adopted his cause They raised a sedition in Edinburgh Spotswood fifteen ninety six seventeenth Dec fifteen ninety six The king during some time was in the hands of the enraged populace and it was not without courage as well as dexterity that he was able to extricate himself A few days after a minister preaching in the principal church of that capital said that the king was possessed with a devil and that one devil being expelled seven worse had entered in his place To which he added that the subjects might lawfully rise and take the sword out of his hand Scarcely even during the darkest night of Papal superstition are there found such instances of priestly encroachments as the annals of Scotland present to us during that period By these extravagant stretches of power and by the patient conduct of James the church began to lose ground even before the king s accession to the throne of England but no sooner had that event taken place than he made the Scottish clergy sensible that he was become the sovereign of a great kingdom which he governed with great authority Though formerly he would have thought himself happy to have made a fair partition with them of the civil and ecclesiastical authority he was now resolved to exert a supreme jurisdiction in church as well as state and to put an end to their seditious practices An assembly had been summoned at Aberdeen but on account of his journey to London he prorogued it to the year following Some of the clergy disavowing his ecclesiastical supremacy met at the time first appointed notwithstanding his prohibition He threw them into prison Such of them as submitted and acknowledged their error were pardoned The rest were brought to their trial They were condemned for high treason The king gave them their lives but banished them the kingdom Six of them suffered this penalty The general assembly was afterwards induced v to acknowledge the king s authority in summoning ecclesiastical courts and to submit to the jurisdiction and visitation of the bishops Even their favorite sentence of excommunication was declared invalid unless confirmed by the ordinary The king recommended to the inferior courts the members whom they should elect to this assembly and every thing was conducted in it with little appearance of choice and liberty v Spotswood Spotswood July sixteen oh four Spotswood V sixth June sixteen ten v Spotswood By his own prerogative likewise which he seems to have stretched on this occasion the king erected a court of high commission in imitation of that which was established in England The bishops and a few of the clergy who had been summoned willingly acknowledged this court and it proceeded immediately upon business as if its authority had been grounded on the full consent of the whole legislature But James reserved the final blow for the time when he should himself pay a visit to Scotland He proposed to the parliament which was then assembled that they should enact that whatever his majesty should determine in the external government of the church with the consent of the archbishops bishops and a competent number of the ministry should have the force of law What number should be deemed competent was not determined and their nomination was left entirely to the king so that his ecclesiastical authority had this bill passed would have been established in its full extent Some of the clergy protested They apprehended they said that the purity of their church would by means of this new authority be polluted with all the rites and liturgy of the church of England James dreading clamor and opposition dropped the bill which had already passed the lords of articles and asserted that the inherent prerogative of the crown contained more power than was recognized by it Some time after he called at saint Andrew s a meeting of the bishops and thirty six of the most eminent clergy He there declared his resolution of exerting his prerogative and of establishing by his own authority the few ceremonies which he had recommended to them They entreated him rather to summon a general assembly and to gain their assent An assembly was accordingly summoned to meet on the twenty fifth of November ensuing fifteenth Feb sixteen ten Spotswood Franklyn p twenty nine Yet this assembly which met after the king s departure from Scotland eluded all his applications and it was not till the subsequent year that he was able to procure a vote for receiving his ceremonies And through every step in this affair in the parliament as well as in all the general assemblies the nation betrayed the utmost reluctance to all these innovations and nothing but James s importunity and authority had extorted a seeming consent which was belied by the inward sentiments of all ranks of people Even the few over whom religious prejudices were not prevalent thought national honor sacrificed by a servile imitation of the modes worship practised in England And every prudent man agreed in condemning the measures of the king who by an ill timed zeal for insignificant ceremonies had betrayed though in an opposite manner equal narrowness of mind with the persons whom he treated with such contempt It was judged that had not these dangerous humors been irritated by opposition had they been allowed peaceably to evaporate they would at last have subsided within the limits of law and civil authority and that as all fanatical religions naturally circumscribe to very narrow bounds the numbers and riches of the ecclesiastics no sooner is their first fire spent than they lose their credit over the people and leave them under the natural and beneficent influence of their civil and moral obligations At the same time that James shocked in so violent a manner the religious principles of his Scottish subjects he acted in opposition to those of his English He had observed in his progress through England that a Judaical observance of the Sunday chiefly by means of the Puritans was every day gaining ground throughout the kingdom and that the people under color of religion were contrary to former practice debarred such sports and recreations as contributed both to their health and their amusement Festivals which in other nations and ages are partly dedicated to public worship partly to mirth and society were here totally appropriated to the offices of religion and served to nourish those sullen and gloomy contemplations to which the people were of themselves so unfortunately subject The king imagined that it would be easy to infuse cheerfulness into this dark spirit of devotion He issued a proclamation to allow and encourage after divine service all kinds of lawful games and exercises and by his authority he endeavored to give sanction to a practice which his subjects regarded as the utmost instance of profaneness and impiety Kennet p seven hundred nine Franklyn p thirty one To show how rigid the English chiefly the Puritans were become in this particular a bill was introduced into the house of commons in the eighteenth of the king for the more strict observance of the Sunday which they affected to the Sabbath One Shepherd opposed this bill objected to the appellation of Sabbath as Puritanical defended dancing by the example of David and seems even to have justified sports on that day For this profaneness he was expelled the house by the suggestion of mister Pym the house of lords opposed so far this Puritanical spirit of the commons that they proposed that the appellation of Sabbath should be changed into that of the Lord s day Journ fifteenth sixteenth Feb sixteen twenty twenty eighth May sixteen twenty one In Shepherd s sentence his offence is said by the house to be great exorbitant unparalleled CHAPTER XLVIII JAMES I At the time when Sir Waller Raleigh was first confined in the Tower his violent and haughty temper had rendered him the most unpopular man in England and his condemnation was chiefly owing to that public odium under which he labored During the thirteen years imprisonment which he suffered the sentiments of the nation were much changed with regard to him Men had leisure to reflect on the hardship not to say injustice of his sentence they pitied his active and enterprising spirit which languished in the rigors of confinement they were struck with the extensive genius of the man who being educated amidst naval and military enterprises had surpassed in the pursuits of literature even those of the most recluse and sedentary lives and they admired his unbroken magnanimity which at his age and under his circumstances could engage him to undertake and execute so great a work as his History of the World To increase these favorable dispositions on which he built the hopes of recovering his liberty he spread the report of a golden mine which he had discovered in Guiana and which was sufficient according to his representation not only to enrich all the adventurers but to afford immense treasures to the nation The king gave little credit to these mighty promises both because he believed that no such mine as the one described was any where in nature and because he considered Raleigh as a man of desperate fortunes whose business it was by any means to procure his freedom and to reinstate himself in credit and authority Thinking however that he had already undergone sufficient punishment he released him from the Tower and when his vaunts of the golden mine had induced multitudes to engage with him the king gave them permission to try the adventure and at their desire he conferred on Raleigh authority over his fellow adventurers Though strongly solicited he still refused to grant him a pardon which he deemed a natural consequence when he was intrusted with power and command But James declared himself still diffident of Raleigh s intentions and he meant he said to reserve the former sentence as a check upon his future behavior Raleigh well knew that it was far from the king s purpose to invade any of the Spanish settlements he therefore firmly denied that Spain had planted any colonies on that part of the coast where his mine lay When Gondomar the ambassador of that nation alarmed at his preparations carried complaints to the king Raleigh still protested the innocence of his intentions and James assured Gondomar that he durst not form any hostile attempt but should pay with his head for so audacious an enterprise The minister however concluding that twelve armed vessels were not fitted out without some purpose of invasion conveyed the intelligence to the court of Madrid who immediately gave orders for arming and fortifying all their settlements particularly those along the coast of Guiana When the courage and avarice of the Spaniards and Portuguese had discovered so many new worlds they were resolved to show themselves superior to the barbarous heathens whom they invaded not only in arts and arms but also in the justice of the quarrel they applied to Alexander VI who then filled the papal chair and he generously bestowed on the Spaniards the whole western and on the Portuguese the whole eastern part of the globe The more scrupulous Protestants who acknowledged not the authority of the Roman pontiff established the first discovery as the foundation of their title and if a pirate or sea adventurer of their nation had but erected a stick or a stone on the coast as a memorial of his taking possession they concluded the whole continent to belong to them and thought themselves entitled to expel or exterminate as usurpers the ancient possessors and inhabitants It was in this manner that Sir Walter Raleigh about twenty three years before had acquired to the crown of England a claim to the continent of Guiana a region as large as the half of Europe and though he had immediately left the coast yet he pretended that the English title to the whole remained certain and indefeasible But it had happened in the mean time that the Spaniards not knowing or not acknowledging this imaginary claim had taken possession of a part of Guiana had formed a settlement on the River Oronooko had built a little town called saint Thomas and were there working some mines of small value To this place Raleigh directly bent his course and remaining himself at the mouth of the river with five of the largest ships he sent up the rest to saint Thomas under the command of his son and of Captain Keymis a person entirely devoted to him The Spaniards who had expected this invasion fired on the English at their landing were repulsed and pursued into the town Young Raleigh to encourage his men called out That this was the true mine and none but fools looked for any other and advancing upon the Spaniards received a shot of which he immediately expired This dismayed not Keymis and the others They carried on the attack got possession of the town which they afterwards reduced to ashes and found not in it any thing of value Raleigh did not pretend that he had himself seen the mine which he had engaged so many people to go in quest of it was Keymis he said who had formerly discovered it and had brought him that lump of ore which promised such immense treasures Yet Keymis who owned that he was within two hours march of the place refused on the most absurd pretences to take any effectual step towards finding it and he returned immediately to Raleigh with the melancholy news of his son s death and the ill success of the enterprise Sensible to reproach and dreading punishment for his behavior Keymis in despair retired into his cabin and put an end to his own life The other adventurers now concluded that they were deceived by Raleigh that he never had known of any such mine as he pretended to go in search of that his intention had ever been to plunder saint Thomas and having encouraged his company by the spoils of that place to have thence proceeded to the invasion of the other Spanish settlements that he expected to repair his ruined fortunes by such daring enterprises and that he trusted to the money he should acquire for making his peace with England or if that view failed him that he purposed to retire into some other country where his riches would secure his retreat The small acquisitions gained by the sack of saint Thomas discouraged Raleigh s companions from entering into these views though there were many circumstances in the treaty and late transactions between the nations which might invite them to engage in such a piratical war against the Spaniards When England made peace with Spain the example of Henry IV was imitated who at the treaty of Vervins finding a difficulty in adjusting all questions with regard to the Indian trade had agreed to pass over that article in total silence The Spaniards having all along published severe edicts against the this silence in their own favor and considered it as a tacit acquiescence of England in the established laws of Spain The English on the contrary pretended that as they had never been excluded by any treaty from commerce with any part of the king of Spain s dominions it was still as lawful for them to trade with his settlements in either Indies as with his European territories In consequence of this ambiguity many adventurers from England sailed to the Spanish Indies and met with severe punishment when caught as they on the other hand often stole and when superior in power forced a trade with the inhabitants and resisted nay sometimes plundered the Spanish governors Violences of this nature which had been carried to a great height on both sides it was agreed to bury in total oblivion because of the difficulty which was found in remedying them upon any fixed principles But as there appeared a great difference between private adventurers in single ships and a fleet acting under a royal commission Raleigh s companions thought it safest to return immediately to England and carry him along with them to answer for his conduct It appears that he employed many artifices first to engage them to attack the Spanish settlements and failing of that to make his escape into France but all these proving unsuccessful he was delivered into the king s hands and strictly examined as well as his fellow adventurers before the privy council The council upon inquiry found no difficulty in pronouncing that the former suspicions with regard to Raleigh s intentions had been well grounded that he had abused the king in the representations which he had made of his projected adventure that contrary to his instructions he had acted in an offensive and hostile manner against his majesty s allies and that he had wilfully burned and destroyed a town belonging to the king of Spain He might have been tried either by common law for this act of violence and piracy or by martial law for breach of orders but it was an established principle among lawyers that as he lay under an actual attainder for high treason he could not be brought to a new trial for any other crime To satisfy therefore the court of Spain which raised the loudest complaints against him the king made use of that power which he had purposely reserved in his own hands and signed the warrant for his execution upon his former sentence fifty four See this matter discussed in Bacon s Letters published by doctor Birch p one hundred eighty one See note BBB at the end of the volume Raleigh finding his fate inevitable collected all his courage and though he had formerly made use of many mean artifices such as feigning madness sickness and a variety of diseases in order to protract his examination and procure his escape he now resolved to act his part with bravery and resolution Tis a sharp remedy he said but a sure one for all ills when he felt the edge of the axe by which he was to be beheaded His harangue to the people was calm and eloquent and he endeavored to revenge himself and to load his enemies with the public hatred by strong asseverations of facts which to say the least may be esteemed very doubtful With the utmost indifference he laid his head upon the block and received the fatal blow and in his death there appeared the same great but ill regulated mind which during his life had displayed itself in all his conduct and behavior Franklyn p thirty two He asserted in the most solemn manner that he had nowise contributed to Essex s death but the last letter in Murden s Collection contains the strongest proof of the contrary No measure of James s reign was attended with more public dissatisfaction than the punishment of Sir Walter Raleigh To execute a sentence which was originally so hard which had been so long suspended and which seemed to have been tacitly pardoned by conferring on him a new trust and commission was deemed an instance of cruelty and injustice To sacrifice to a concealed enemy of England the life of the only man in the nation who had a high reputation for valor and military experience was regarded as meanness and indiscretion and the intimate connections which the king was now entering into with Spain being universally distasteful rendered this proof of his complaisance still more invidious and unpopular James had entertained an opinion which was peculiar to himself and which had been adopted by none of his predecessors that any alliance below that of a great king was unworthy of a prince of Wales and he never would allow any princess but a daughter of France or Spain to be mentioned as a match for his son This instance of pride which really implies meanness as if he could receive honor from any alliance was so well known that Spain had founded on it the hopes of governing in the most important transactions this monarch so little celebrated for politics or prudence During the life of Henry the king of Spain had dropped some hints of bestowing on that prince his eldest daughter whom he afterwards disposed of in marriage to the young king of France Lewis XIII At that time the views of the Spaniards were to engage James into a neutrality with regard to the succession of Cleves which was disputed between the Protestant and Popish line but the bait did not then take and James in consequence of his alliance with the Dutch and with Henry IV of France marched four thousand men under the command of Sir Edward Cecil who joined these two powers and put the marquis of Brandenburgh and the palatine of Newbourg in possession of that duchy Gondomar was at this time the Spanish ambassador in England a man whose flattery was the more artful because covered with the appearance of frankness and sincerity whose politics were the more dangerous because disguised under the mask of mirth and pleasantry He now made offer of the second daughter of Spain to Prince Charles and that he might render the temptation irresistible to the necessitous monarch he gave hopes of an immense fortune which should attend the princess The court of Spain though determined to contract no alliance with a heretic entered into negotiations with James which they artfully protracted and amidst every disappointment they still redoubled his hopes of success v The transactions in Germany so important to the Austrian greatness became every day a new motive for this duplicity of conduct Kennet p seven hundred three seven hundred forty eight Rushworth vol i p two sixteen ten La Boderie vol ii p thirty v Franklyn p seventy one In that great revolution of manners which happened during the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries the only nations who had the honorable though often melancholy advantage of making an effort for their expiring privileges were such as together with the principles of civil liberty were animated with a zeal for religious parties and opinions Besides the irresistible force of standing armies the European princes possessed this advantage that they were descended from the ancient royal families that they continued the same designations of magistrates the same appearance of civil government and restraining themselves by all the forms of legal administration could insensibly impose the yoke on their unguarded subjects Even the German nations who formerly broke the Roman chains and restored liberty to mankind now lost their own liberty and saw with grief the absolute authority of their princes firmly established among them In their circumstances nothing but a pious zeal which disregards all motives of human prudence could have made them entertain hopes of preserving any longer those privileges which their ancestors through so many ages had transmitted to them As the house of Austria throughout all her extensive dominions had ever made religion the pretence for her usurpations she now met with resistance from a like principle and the Catholic religion as usual had ranged itself on the side of monarchy the Protestant on that of liberty The states of Bohemia having taken arms against the emperor Matthias continued their revolt against his successor Ferdinand and claimed the observance of all the edicts enacted in favor of the new religion together with the restoration of their ancient laws and constitution The neighboring principalities Silesia Moravia Lusatia Austria even the kingdom of Hungary took part in the quarrel and throughout all these populous and martial provinces the spirit of discord and civil war had universally diffused itself Ferdinand II who possessed more vigor and greater abilities though not more lenity and moderation than are usual with the Austrian princes strongly armed himself for the recovery of his authority and besides employing the assistance of his subjects who professed the ancient religion he engaged on his side a powerful alliance of the neighboring potentates All the Catholic princes of the empire had embraced his defence even Saxony the most powerful of the Protestant Poland had declared itself in his favor and above all the Spanish monarch deeming his own interest closely connected with that of the younger branch of his family prepared powerful succors from Italy and from the Low Countries and he also advanced large sums

4295-112687-0006	train-other-500	in former ages flew to rescue the Holy Land from the dominion of infidels The nation was as yet sincerely attached to the blood of their monarchs and they considered their connection with the palatine who had married a daughter of England
4295-112687-0007	train-other-500	as very close and intimate and when they heard of Catholics carrying on wars and persecutions against Protestants they thought their own interest deeply concerned and regarded their neutrality as a base desertion of the cause of God

4295-112687-0019	train-other-500	in favor of the former advantages James might have defended his pacific measures by such plausible arguments but these though the chief seem not to have been the sole motives which swayed him
4295-112687-0020	train-other-500	He had entertained the notion that as his own justice and moderation had shone out so conspicuously throughout all these transactions the whole house of Austria though not awed by the power of England would willingly

4295-112687-0037	train-other-500	which was refused by the upper house The king regarded this project of a joint petition
none	none	 as an attempt to force him from his measures he thanked the peers for their refusal to concur in it and told them that if it were their desire he would delay the adjournment but would not so far comply with the request of the lower house And thus in these great national affairs the same peevishness which in private altercations often raises a quarrel from the smallest beginnings produced a mutual coldness and disgust between the king and the commons It is thought that appeals from chancery to the house of peers first came into practice while Bacon held the great seal Appeals under the form of writs of error had long before lain against the courts of law Blackstone s Commentaries vol iii p four hundred fifty four Rushworth vol i p thirty five During the recess of parliament the king used every measure to render himself popular with the nation and to appease the rising ill humor of their representatives He had voluntarily offered the parliament to circumscribe his own prerogative and to abrogate for the future his power of granting monopolies He now recalled all the patents of that kind and redressed every article of grievance to the number of thirty seven which had ever been complained of in the house of commons But he gained not the end which he proposed The disgust which had appeared at parting could not so suddenly be dispelled He had likewise been so imprudent as to commit to prison Sir Edwin Sandys without any known cause besides his activity and vigor in discharging his duty as member of parliament And above all the transactions in Germany were sufficient when joined to the king s cautions negotiations and delays to inflame that jealousy of honor and religion which prevailed throughout the nation This summer the ban of the empire had been published against the elector palatine and the execution of it was committed to the duke of Bavaria The Upper Palatinate was in a little time conquered by that prince and measures were taking in the empire for bestowing on him the electoral dignity of which the palatine was then despoiled Frederic now lived with his numerous family in poverty and distress either in Holland or at Sedan with his uncle the duke of Bouillon And throughout all the new conquests in both the Palatinates as well as in Bohemia Austria and Lusatia the progress of the Austrian arms was attended with rigors and severities exercised against the professors of the reformed religion Rushworth vol i p thirty six Kennet p seven hundred thirty three Journ first December sixteen twenty one To show to what degree the nation was inflamed with regard to the Palatinate there occurs a remarkable story this session One Floyd a prisoner in the Fleet a Catholic had dropped some expressions in private conversation as if he were pleased with the misfortunes of the palatine and his wife The commons were in a flame and pretending to be a court of judicature and of record proceeded to condemn him to a severe punishment The house of lords checked this encroachment and what was extraordinary considering the present humor of the lower house the latter acquiesced in the sentiments of the peers This is almost the only pretension of the English commons in which they have not prevailed Happily for the nation they have been successful in almost all their other claims See Parliamentary History vol v p four hundred twenty eight four hundred twenty nine et cetera Journ fourth eighth twelfth of May sixteen twenty one Franklyn p seventy three The zeal of the commons immediately moved them upon their assembling to take all these transactions into consideration They framed a remonstrance which they intended to carry to the king They represented that the enormous growth of the Austrian power threatened the liberties of Europe that the progress of the Catholic religion in England bred the most melancholy apprehensions lest it should again acquire an ascendant in the kingdom that the indulgence of his majesty towards the professors of that religion had encouraged their insolence and temerity that the uncontrolled conquests made by the Austrian family in Germany raised mighty expectations in the English Papists but above all that the prospect of the Spanish match elevated them so far as to hope for an entire toleration if not the final reestablishment of their religion The commons therefore entreated his majesty that he would immediately undertake the defence of the Palatinate and maintain it by force of arms that he would turn his sword against Spain whose armies and treasures were the chief support of the Catholic interest in Europe that he would enter into no negotiation for the marriage of his son but with a Protestant princess that the children of Popish recusants should be taken from their parents and be committed to the care of Protestant teachers and schoolmasters and that the fines and confiscations to which the Catholics were by law liable should be levied with the utmost severity Franklyn p fifty eight fifty nine Rushworth vol i p forty forty one Kennet p seven hundred eighty seven By this bold step unprecedented in England for many years and scarcely ever heard of in peaceable times the commons attacked at once all the king s favorite maxims of government his cautious and pacific measures his lenity towards the Romish religion and his attachment to the Spanish alliance from which he promised himself such mighty advantages But what most disgusted him was their seeming invasion of his prerogative and their pretending under color of advice to direct his conduct in such points as had ever been acknowledged to belong solely to the management and direction of the sovereign He was at that time absent at Newmarket but as soon as he heard of the intended remonstrance of the commons he wrote a letter to the speaker in which he sharply rebuked the house for openly debating matters far above their reach and capacity and he strictly forbade them to meddle with any thing that regarded his government or deep matters of state and especially not to touch on his son s marriage with the daughter of Spain nor to attack the honor of that king or any other of his friends and confederates In order the more to intimidate them he mentioned the imprisonment of Sir Edwin Sandys and though he denied that the confinement of that member had been owing to any offence committed in the house he plainly told them that he thought himself fully entitled to punish every misdemeanor in parliament as well during its sitting as after its dissolution and that he intended thenceforward to chastise any man whose insolent behavior there should minister occasion of offence This violent letter in which the king though he here imitated former precedents may be thought not to have acted altogether on the defensive had the effect which might naturally have been expected from it the commons were inflamed not terrified Secure of their own popularity and of the bent of the nation towards a war with the Catholics abroad and the persecution of Popery at home they little dreaded the menaces of a prince who was unsupported by military force and whose gentle temper would of itself so soon disarm his severity In a new remonstrance therefore they still insisted on their former remonstrance and advice and they maintained though in respectful terms that they were entitled to interpose with their counsel in all matters of government that to possess entire freedom of speech in their debates on public business was their ancient and undoubted right and an inheritance transmitted to them from their ancestors and that if any member abused this liberty it belonged to the house alone who were witnesses of his offence to inflict a proper censure upon him So vigorous an answer was nowise calculated to appease the king It is said when the approach of the committee who were to present it was notified to him he ordered twelve chairs to be brought for that there were so many kings a coming Franklyn p sixty Rushworth vol i p forty three Kennet p seven hundred forty one Franklyn p sixty Rushworth vol i p forty four Kennet p seven hundred forty one Kennet p forty three His answer was prompt and sharp He told the house that their remonstrance was more like a denunciation of war than an address of dutiful subjects that their pretension to inquire into all state affairs without exception was such a plenipotence as none of their ancestors even during the reign of the weakest princes had ever pretended to that public transactions depended on a complication of views and intelligence with which they were entirely unacquainted that they could not better show their wisdom as well as duty than by keeping within their proper sphere and that in any business which depended on his prerogative they had no title to interpose with their advice except when he was pleased to desire it And he concluded with these memorable words And though we cannot allow of your style in mentioning your ancient and undoubted right and inheritance but would rather have wished that ye had said that your privileges were derived from the grace and permission of our ancestors and us for the most of them grew from precedents which shows rather a toleration than inheritance yet we are pleased to give you our royal assurance that as long as you contain yourselves within the limits of your duty we will be as careful to maintain and preserve your lawful liberties and privileges as ever any of our predecessors were nay as to preserve our own royal prerogative This open pretension of the king s naturally gave great alarm to the house of commons They saw their title to every privilege if not plainly denied yet considered at least as precarious It might be fortified by abuse and they had already abused it They thought proper therefore immediately to oppose pretension to pretension They framed a protestation in which they repeated all their former claims for freedom of speech and an unbounded authority to interpose with their advice and counsel And they asserted That the liberties franchises privileges and jurisdictions of parliament are the ancient and undoubted birthright and inheritance of the subjects of England The king informed of these increasing heats and jealousies in the house hurried to town He sent immediately for the journals of the commons and with his own hand before the council he tore out this protestation fifty six and ordered his reasons to be inserted in the council book He was doubly displeased he said with the protestation of the lower house on account of the manner of framing it as well as of the matter which it contained Ne sutor ultra crepidam This expression is imagined to be insolent and disobliging but it was a Latin proverb familiarly used on all occasions Franklyn p sixty two sixty three sixty four Rushworth vol i p forty six forty seven et cetera Kennet p seven hundred forty three See note DDD at the end of the volume Journ eighteenth Dec sixteen twenty one It was tumultuously voted at a late hour and in a thin house and it was expressed in such general and ambiguous terms as might serve for a foundation to the most enormous claims and to the most unwarrantable usurpations upon his prerogative The meeting of the house might have proved dangerous after so violent a breach It was no longer possible while men were in such a temper to finish any business The king therefore prorogued the parliament and soon after dissolved it by proclamation in which he also made an apology to the public for his whole conduct The leading members of the house Sir Edward Coke and Sir Robert Philips were committed to the Tower Selden Pym and Mallory to other prisons As a lighter punishment Sir Dudley Digges Sir Thomas Crew Sir Nathaniel Rich Sir James Perrot joined in commission with others were sent to Ireland in order to execute some business The king at that time enjoyed at least exercised the prerogative of employing any man even without his consent in any branch of public service Sir John Savile a powerful man in the house of commons and a zealous opponent of the court was made comptroller of the household a privy counsellor and soon after a baron This event is memorable as being the first instance perhaps in the whole history of England of any king s advancing a man on account of parliamentary interest and of opposition to his measures However irregular this practice it will be regarded by political reasoners as one of the most early and most infallible symptoms of a regular established liberty The king having thus with so rash and indiscreet a hand torn off that sacred veil which had hitherto covered the English constitution and which threw an obscurity upon it so advantageous to royal prerogative every man began to indulge himself in political reasonings and inquiries and the same factions which commenced in parliament were propagated throughout the nation In vain did James by reiterated proclamations forbid the discoursing of state affairs v Such proclamations if they had any effect served rather to inflame the curiosity of the public And in every company or society the late transactions became the subject of argument and debate Franklyn p sixty five Franklyn p sixty six Rushworth vol i p fifty five Franklyn p sixty six Rushworth vol i p fifty five Kennet p seven hundred forty nine v Franklyn p fifty six Rushworth vol i p twenty one thirty six fifty five The king also in imitation of his predecessors gave rules to preachers All history said the partisans of the court as well as the history of England justify the king s position with regard to the origin of popular privileges and every reasonable man must allow that as monarchy is the most simple form of government it must first have occurred to rude and uninstructed mankind The other complicated and artificial additions were the successive invention of sovereigns and legislators or if they were obtruded on the prince by seditious subjects their origin must appear on that very account still more precarious and unfavorable In England the authority of the king in all the exterior forms of government and in the common style of law appears totally absolute and sovereign nor does the real spirit of the constitution as it has ever discovered itself in practice fall much short of these appearances The parliament is created by his will by his will it is dissolved It is his will alone though at the desire of both houses which gives authority to laws To all foreign nations the majesty of the monarch seems to merit sole attention and regard And no subject who has exposed himself to royal indignation can hope to live with safety in the kingdom nor can he even leave it according to law without the consent of his master If a magistrate environed with such power and splendor should consider his authority as sacred and regard himself as the anointed of Heaven his pretensions may bear a very favorable construction Or allowing them to be merely pious frauds we need not be surprised that the same stratagem which was practised by Minos Numa and the most celebrated legislators of antiquity should now in these restless and inquisitive times be employed by the king of England Subjects are not raised above that quality though assembled in parliament The same humble respect and deference is still due to their prince Though he indulges them in the privilege of laying before him their domestic grievances with which they are supposed to be best acquainted this warrants not their bold intrusion into every province of government And to all judicious examiners it must appear That the lines of duty are as much transgressed by a more independent and less respectful exercise of acknowledged powers as by the usurpation of such as are new and unusual Franklyn p seventy The pulpit was at that time much more dangerous than the press Few people could read and still fewer were in the practice of reading The lovers of liberty throughout the nation reasoned after a different manner It is in vain said they that the king traces up the English government to its first origin in order to represent the privileges of parliament as dependent and precarious prescription and the practice of so many ages must long ere this time have given a sanction to these assemblies even though they had been derived from an origin no more dignified than that which he assigns them If the written records of the English nation as asserted represent parliaments to have arisen from the consent of monarchs the principles of human nature when we trace government a step higher must show us that monarchs themselves owe all their authority to the voluntary submission of the people But in fact no age can be shown when the English government was altogether an unmixed monarchy and if the privileges of the nation have at any period been overpowered by violent irruptions of foreign force or domestic usurpation the generous spirit of the people has ever seized the first opportunity of reestablishing the ancient government and constitution Though in the style of the laws and in the usual forms of administration royal authority may be represented as sacred and supreme whatever is essential to the exercise of sovereign and legislative power must still be regarded as equally divine and inviolable Or if any distinction be made in this respect the preference is surely due to those national councils by whose interposition the exorbitancies of tyrannical power are restrained and that sacred liberty is preserved which heroic spirits in all ages have deemed more precious than life itself Nor is it sufficient to say that the mild and equitable administration of James affords little occasion or no occasion of complaint How moderate soever the exercise of his prerogative how exact soever his observance of the laws and constitution If he founds his authority on arbitrary and dangerous principles it is requisite to watch him with the same care and to oppose him with the same vigor as if he had indulged himself in all the excesses of cruelty and tyranny Amidst these disputes the wise and moderate in the nation endeavored to preserve as much as possible an equitable neutrality between the opposite parties and the more they reflected on the course of public affairs the greater difficulty they found in fixing just sentiments with regard to them On the one hand they regarded the very rise of parties as a happy prognostic of the establishment of liberty nor could they ever expect to enjoy in a mixed government so invaluable a blessing without suffering that inconvenience which in such governments has ever attended it But when they considered on the other hand the necessary aims and pursuits of both parties they were struck with apprehension of the consequences and could discover no feasible plan of accommodation between them From long practice the crown was now possessed of so exorbitant a prerogative that it was not sufficient for liberty to remain on the defensive or endeavor to secure the little ground which was left her it was become necessary to carry on an offensive war and to circumscribe within more narrow as well as more exact bounds the authority of the sovereign Upon such provocation it could not but happen that the prince however just and moderate would endeavor to repress his opponents and as he stood upon the very brink of arbitrary power it was to be feared that he would hastily and unknowingly pass those limits which were not precisely marked by the constitution The turbulent government of England ever fluctuating between privilege and prerogative would afford a variety of precedents which might be pleaded on both sides In such delicate questions the people must be divided the arms of the state were still in their hands a civil war must ensue a civil war where no party or both parties would justly bear the blame and where the good and virtuous would scarcely know what vows to form were it not that liberty so necessary to the perfection of human society would be sufficient to bias their affections towards the side of its defenders CHAPTER XLIX JAMES I To wrest the Palatinate from the hands of the emperor and the duke of Bavaria must always have been regarded as a difficult task for the power of England conducted by so unwarlike a prince as James it was plainly impossible while the breach subsisted between him and the commons The king s negotiations therefore had they been managed with ever so great dexterity must now carry less weight with them and it was easy to elude all his applications When Lord Digby his ambassador to the emperor had desired a cessation of hostilities he was referred to the duke of Bavaria who commanded the Austrian armies The duke of Bavaria told him that it was entirely superfluous to form any treaty for that purpose Hostilities are already ceased said he and I doubt not but I shall be able to prevent their revival by keeping firm possession of the Palatinate till a final agreement shall be concluded between the contending parties Franklyn p fifty seven Rushworth vol i p thirty eight Notwithstanding this insult James endeavored to resume with the emperor a treaty of accommodation and he opened the negotiations at Brussels under the mediation of Archduke Albert and after his death which happened about this time under that of the infanta when the conferences were entered upon it was found that the powers of these princes to determine in the controversy were not sufficient or satisfactory Schwartzenbourg the imperial minister was expected at London and it was hoped that he would bring more ample authority his commission referred entirely to the negotiation at Brussels It was not difficult for the king to perceive that his applications were neglected by the emperor but as he had no choice of any other expedient and it seemed the interest of his son in law to keep alive his pretensions he was still content to follow Ferdinand through all his shifts and evasions Nor was he entirely discouraged even when the imperial diet at Ratisbon by the influence or rather authority of the emperor though contrary to the protestation of Saxony and of all the Protestant princes and cities had transferred the electoral dignity from the palatine to the duke of Bavaria Meanwhile the efforts made by Frederic for the recovery of his dominions were vigorous Three armies were levied in Germany by his authority under three commanders Duke Christian of Brunswick the prince of Baden Dourlach and Count Mansfeldt The two former generals were defeated by Count Tilly and the imperialists the third though much inferior in force to his enemies still maintained the war but with no equal supplies of money either from the palatine or the king of England It was chiefly by pillage and free quarters in the Palatinate that he subsisted his army As the Austrians were regularly paid they were kept in more exact discipline and James justly became apprehensive lest so unequal a contest besides ravaging the palatine s hereditary dominions would end in the total alienation of the people s affections from their ancient sovereign by whom they were plundered and in an attachment to their new masters by whom they were protected He persuaded therefore his son in law to disarm under color of duty and submission to the emperor and accordingly Mansfeldt was dismissed from the palatine s service and that famous general withdrew his army into the Low Countries and there received a commission from the states of the United Provinces To show how little account was made of James s negotiations abroad there is a pleasantry mentioned by all historians which for that reason shall have place here In a farce acted at Brussels a courier was introduced carrying the doleful news that the Palatinate would soon be wrested from the house of Austria so powerful were the succors which from all quarters were hastening to the relief of the despoiled elector the king of Denmark had agreed to contribute to his assistance a hundred thousand pickled herrings the Dutch a hundred thousand butter boxes and the king of England a hundred thousand ambassadors On other occasions he was painted with a scabbard but without a sword or with a sword which nobody could draw though several were pulling at it Parl Hist vol v p four hundred eighty four Kennet p seven hundred forty nine It was not from his negotiations with the emperor or the duke of Bavaria that James expected any success in his project of restoring the palatine his eyes were entirely turned towards Spain and if he could effect his son s marriage with the infanta he doubted not but that after so intimate a conjunction this other point could easily be obtained The negotiations of that court being commonly dilatory it was not easy for a prince of so little penetration in business to distinguish whether the difficulties which occurred were real or affected and he was surprised after negotiating five years on so simple a demand that he was not more advanced than at the beginning A dispensation from Rome was requisite for the marriage of the infanta with a Protestant prince and the king of Spain having undertaken to procure that dispensation had thereby acquired the means of retarding at pleasure or of forwarding the marriage and at the same time of concealing entirely his artifices from the court of England In order to remove all obstacles James despatched Digby soon after created earl of Bristol as his ambassador to Philip IV who had lately succeeded his father in the crown of Spain He secretly employed Gage as his agent at Rome and finding that the difference of religion was the principal if not the sole difficulty which retarded the marriage he resolved to soften that objection as much as possible He issued public orders for discharging all Popish recusants who were imprisoned and it was daily apprehended that he would forbid for the future the execution of the penal laws enacted against them For this step so opposite to the rigid spirit of his subjects he took care to apologize and he even endeavored to ascribe it to his great zeal for the reformed religion He had been making applications he said to all foreign princes for some indulgence to the distressed Protestants and he was still answered by objections derived from the severity of the English laws against Catholics It might indeed occur to him that if the extremity of religious zeal were ever to abate among Christian sects one of them must begin and nothing would be more honorable for England than to have led the way in sentiments so wise and moderate Franklyn p sixty nine Rushworth vol i p sixty three Not only the religious Puritans murmured at this tolerating measure of the king the lovers of civil liberty were alarmed at so important an exertion of prerogative But among other dangerous articles of authority the kings of England were at that time possessed of the dispensing power at least were at the constant practice of exercising it Besides though the royal prerogative in civil matters was then extensive the princes during some late reigns had been accustomed to assume a still greater in ecclesiastical And the king failed not to represent the toleration of Catholics as a measure entirely of that nature By James s concession in favor of the Catholics he attained his end The same religious motives which had hitherto rendered the court of Madrid insincere in all the steps taken with regard to the marriage were now the chief cause of promoting it By its means it was there hoped the English Catholics would for the future enjoy ease and indulgence and the infanta would be the happy instrument of procuring to the church some tranquillity after the many severe persecutions which it had hitherto undergone The earl of Bristol a minister of vigilance and penetration and who had formerly opposed all alliance with Catholics was now fully convinced of the sincerity of Spain and he was ready to congratulate the king on the entire completion of his views and projects A daughter of Spain whom he represents as extremely accomplished would soon he said arrive in England and bring with her an immense fortune of two millions of pieces of eight or six hundred thousand pounds sterling a sum four times greater than Spain had ever before given with any princess and almost equal to all the money which the parliament during the whole course of this reign had hitherto granted to the king But what was of more importance to James s honor and happiness Bristol considered this match as an infallible prognostic of the palatine s restoration nor would Philip he thought ever have bestowed his sister and so large a fortune under the prospect of entering next day into a war with England So exact was his intelligence that the most secret counsels of the Spaniards he boasts had never escaped him and he found that they had all along considered the marriage of the infanta and the restitution of the Palatinate as measures closely connected or altogether inseparable Rushworth vol i p two hundred ninety two Rushworth vol i p sixty nine Rushworth vol i p two hundred seventy two We find by private letters between Philip IV and the Conde Oliarez shown by the latter to Buckingham that the marriage and the restitution of the Palatinate were always considered by the court of Spain as inseparable See Franklyn p seventy one seventy two Rushworth vol i p seventy one two hundred eighty two hundred ninety nine three hundred Parl Hist vol vi p sixty six However little calculated James s character to extort so vast a concession however improper the measures which he had pursued for attaining that end the ambassador could not withstand the plain evidence of facts by which Philip now demonstrated his sincerity Perhaps too like a wise man he considered that reasons of state which are supposed solely to influence the councils of monarchs are not always the motives which there predominate that the milder views of gratitude honor friendship generosity are frequently able among princes as well as private persons to counterbalance these selfish considerations that the justice and moderation of James had been so conspicuous in all these transactions his reliance on Spain his confidence in her friendship that he had at last obtained the cordial alliance of that nation so celebrated for honor and fidelity Or if politics must still be supposed the ruling motive of all public measures the maritime power of England was so considerable and the Spanish dominions so divided as might well induce the council of Philip to think that a sincere friendship with the masters of the sea could not be purchased by too great concessions And as James during so many years had been allured and seduced by hopes and protestations his people enraged by delays and disappointments it would probably occur that there was now no medium left between the most inveterate hatred and the most intimate alliance between the nations Not to mention that as a new spirit began about this time to animate the councils of France the friendship of England became every day more necessary to the greatness and security of the Spanish monarch All measures being therefore agreed on between the parties nought was wanting but the dispensation from Rome which might be considered as a mere formality The king justified by success now exulted in his pacific counsels and boasted of his superior sagacity and penetration when all these flattering prospects were blasted by the temerity of a man whom he had fondly exalted from a private condition to be the bane of himself of his family and of his people Franklyn p seventy two Rushworth vol i p sixty six Ever since the fall of Somerset Buckingham had governed with an uncontrolled sway both the court and nation and could James s eyes have been opened he had now full opportunity of observing how unfit his favorite was for the high station to which he was raised Some accomplishments of a courtier he possessed of every talent of a minister he was utterly destitute Headlong in his passions and incapable equally of prudence and of dissimulation sincere from violence rather than candor expensive from profusion more than generosity a warm friend a furious enemy but without any choice or discernment in either with these qualities he had early and quickly mounted to the highest rank and partook at once of the insolence which attends a fortune newly acquired and the impetuosity which belongs to persons born in high stations and unacquainted with opposition Among those who had experienced the arrogance of this overgrown favorite the prince of Wales himself had not been entirely spared and a great coldness if not an enmity had for that reason taken place between them Buckingham desirous of an opportunity which might connect him with the prince and overcome his aversion and at the same time envious of the great credit acquired by Bristol in the Spanish negotiation bethought himself of an expedient by which he might at once gratify both these inclinations He represented to Charles that persons of his exalted station were peculiarly unfortunate in their marriage the chief circumstance of life and commonly received into their arms a bride unknown to them to whom they were unknown not endeared by sympathy not obliged by service wooed by treaties alone by negotiations by political interests that however accomplished the infanta she must still consider herself as a melancholy victim of state and could not but think with aversion of that day when she was to enter the bed of a stranger and passing into a foreign country and a new family bid adieu forever to her father s house and to her native land that it was in the prince s power to soften all these rigors and lay such an obligation on her as would attach the most indifferent temper as would warm the coldest affections that his journey to Madrid would be an unexpected gallantry which would equal all the fictions of Spanish romance and suiting the amorous and enterprising character of that nation must immediately introduce him to the princess under the agreeable character of a devoted lover and daring adventurer that the negotiations with regard to the Palatinate which had hitherto languished in the hands of ministers would quickly he terminated by so illustrious an agent seconded by the mediation and entreaties of the grateful infanta that Spanish generosity moved by that unexampled trust and confidence would make concessions beyond what could be expected from political views and considerations and that he would quickly return to the king with the glory of having reestablished the unhappy palatine by the same enterprise which procured him the affections and the person of the Spanish princess The mind of the young prince replete with candor was inflamed by these generous and romantic ideas suggested by Buckingham He agreed to make application to the king for his approbation They chose the moment of his kindest and most jovial humor and more by the earnestness which they expressed than by the force of their reasons they obtained a hasty and unguarded consent to their undertaking And having engaged his promise to keep their purpose secret they left him in order to make preparations for the journey No sooner was the king alone than his temper more cautious than sanguine suggested very different views of the matter and represented every difficulty and danger which could occur He reflected that however the world might pardon this sally of youth in the prince they would never forgive himself who at his years and after his experience could intrust his only son the heir of his crown the prop of his age to the discretion of foreigners without so much as providing the frail security of a safe conduct in his favor that if the Spanish monarch were sincere in his professions a few months must finish the treaty of marriage and bring the infanta into England if he were not sincere the folly was still more egregious of committing the prince into his hands that Philip when possessed of so invaluable a pledge might well rise in his demands and impose harder conditions of treaty and that the temerity of the enterprise was so apparent that the event how prosperous soever could not justify it and if disastrous it would render himself infamous to his people and ridiculous to all posterity Clarendon vol i p eleven twelve Clarendon vol i p fourteen Tormented with these reflections as soon as the prince and Buckingham returned for their despatches he informed them of all the reasons which had determined him to change his resolution and he begged them to desist from so foolish an adventure The prince received the disappointment with sorrowful submission and silent tears Buckingham presumed to speak in an imperious tone which he had ever experienced to be prevalent over his too easy master He told the king that nobody for the future would believe any thing he said When he retracted so soon the promise so solemnly given that he plainly discerned this change of resolution to proceed from another breach of his word in communicating the matter to some rascal who had furnished him with those pitiful reasons which he had alleged and he doubted not but he should hereafter know who his counsellor had been and that if he receded from what he had promised it would be such a dis obligation to the prince who had now set his heart upon the journey after his majesty s approbation that he could never forget it nor forgive any man who had been the cause of it Clarendon vol i p sixteen The king with great earnestness fortified by many oaths made his apology by denying that he had communicated the matter to any and finding himself assailed as well by the boisterous importunities of Buckingham as by the warm entreaties of his son whose applications had hitherto on other occasions been always dutiful never earnest he had again the weakness to assent to their purposed journey It was agreed that Sir Francis Cottington alone the prince s secretary and Endymion Porter gentleman of his bed chamber should accompany them and the former being at that time in the antechamber he was immediately called in by the king s orders James told Cottington that he had always been an honest man and therefore he was now to trust him in an affair of the highest importance which he was not upon his life to disclose to any man whatever Cottington added he here is baby Charles and Stenny these ridiculous appellations he usually gave to the prince and Buckingham who have a great mind to go post into Spain and fetch home the infanta they will have but two more in their company and have chosen you for one What think you of the journey Sir Francis who was a prudent man and had resided some years in Spain as the king s agent was struck with all the obvious objections to such an enterprise and scrupled not to declare them The king threw himself upon his bed and cried I told you this before and fell into a new passion and new lamentations complaining that he was undone and should lose baby Charles The prince showed by his countenance that he was extremely dissatisfied with Cottington s discourse but Buckingham broke into an open passion against him The king he told him asked him only of the journey and of the manner of travelling particulars of which he might be a competent judge having gone the road so often by post but that he without being called to it had the presumption to give his advice upon matters of state and against his master which he should repent as long as he lived A thousand other reproaches he added which put the poor king into a new agony in behalf of a servant who he foresaw would suffer for answering him honestly Upon which he said with some emotion Nay by God Stenny you are much to blame for using him so he answered me directly to the question which I asked him and very honestly and wisely and yet you know he said no more than I told you before he was called in However after all this passion on both sides James renewed his consent and proper directions were given for the journey Nor was he now at any loss to discover that the whole intrigue was originally contrived by Buckingham as well as pursued violently by his spirit and impetuosity These circumstances which so well characterize the persons seem to have been related by Cottington to Lord Clarendon from whom they are here transcribed and though minute are not undeserving of a place in history The prince and Buckingham with their two attendants and Sir Richard Graham master of horse to Buckingham passed disguised and undiscovered through France and they even ventured into a court ball at Paris where Charles saw the princess Henrietta whom he afterwards espoused and who was at that time in the bloom of youth and beauty In eleven days after their departure from London they arrived at Madrid and surprised every body by a step so unusual among great princes The Spanish monarch immediately paid Charles a visit expressed the utmost gratitude for the confidence reposed in him and made warm protestations of a correspondent confidence and friendship By the most studied civilities he showed the respect which he bore to his royal guest He gave him a golden key which opened all his apartments that the prince might without any introduction have access to him at all hours he took the left hand of him on every occasion except in the apartments

8015-112690-0002	train-other-500	as not to allow of any further intercourse till the arrival of the dispensation The point of honor was carried so far by that generous people that no attempt was made on account of the advantage which they had acquired
8015-112690-0003	train-other-500	of imposing any harder conditions of treaty their pious zeal only prompted them on one occasion to desire more concessions in the religious articles but upon the opposition of Bristol accompanied with some reproaches
8015-112690-0004	train-other-500	they immediately desisted The pope however hearing of the prince s arrival in Madrid tacked some new clauses to the dispensation and it became necessary to transmit the articles to London that the king might ratify them
8015-112690-0005	train-other-500	This treaty which was made public consisted of several articles chiefly regarding the exercise of the Catholic religion by the infanta and her household
8015-112690-0006	train-other-500	Nothing could reasonably be found fault with except one article in which the king promised that the children should be educated by the princess till ten years of age This condition could not be insisted on

8015-112690-0008	train-other-500	a very civil letter from the pope he was induced to return a very civil answer
none	none	 Meanwhile Gregory XV who granted the dispensation died and Urban VIII was chosen in his place 
8015-112690-0009	train-other-500	Upon this event the nuncio refused to deliver the dispensation till it should be renewed by Urban and that crafty pontiff delayed sending a new dispensation in hopes that during the prince s residence in Spain
8015-112690-0010	train-other-500	some expedient might be fallen upon to effect his conversion The king of England as well as the prince became impatient On the first hint Charles obtained permission to return and Philip graced his departure with all the circumstances

8015-112690-0014	train-other-500	and had impressed the most favorable ideas of him But in the same proportion that the prince was beloved and esteemed was Buckingham despised and hated His behavior composed of English familiarity and French vivacity

8015-112690-0017	train-other-500	that his own attachment to the Spanish nation and to the king of Spain was extreme that he would contribute to every measure which could cement the friendship between England and them and that his peculiar ambition would be to facilitate the prince s marriage with the infanta
8015-112690-0018	train-other-500	But he added with a sincerity equally insolent and indiscreet With regard to you sir in particular you must not consider me as your friend but must ever expect from me all possible enmity and opposition

8015-112690-0021	train-other-500	from whom he had met with such generous treatment by what colors he could disguise the ingratitude and imprudence of such a measure these are totally unknown to us We may only conjecture that the many unavoidable causes of delay
8015-112690-0022	train-other-500	which had so long prevented the arrival of the dispensation
none	none	 had afforded to Buckingham a pretence for throwing on the Spaniards the imputation of insincerity in the whole treaty 
8015-112690-0023	train-other-500	It also appears that his impetuous and domineering character had acquired what it ever after maintained a total ascendant over the gentle and modest temper
none	none	 of Charles and when the prince left Madrid he was firmly determined notwithstanding all his professions to break off the treaty with Spain It is not likely that Buckingham prevailed so easily with James to abandon a project which during so many years had been the object of all his wishes and which he had now unexpectedly conducted to a happy period Rushworth vol i p one hundred three Clarendon vol i p thirty seven Hacket s Life of Williams A rupture with Spain the loss of two millions were prospects little agreeable to this pacific and indigent monarch But finding his only son bent against a match which had always been opposed by his people and his parliament 
8015-112690-0024	train-other-500	he yielded to difficulties which he had not courage or strength of mind sufficient to overcome The prince therefore and Buckingham on their arrival at London assumed entirely the direction of the negotiation
8015-112690-0025	train-other-500	and it was their business to seek for pretences by which they could give a color to their intended breach of treaty
none	none	 Though the restitution of the Palatinate had ever been considered by James as a natural or necessary consequence of the Spanish alliance he had always forbidden his ministers to insist on it 
8015-112690-0026	train-other-500	as a preliminary article to the conclusion of the marriage treaty He considered that this principality was now in the hands of the emperor and the duke of Bavaria and that it was no longer in the king of Spain s power by a single stroke of his pen
none	none	 to restore it to its ancient master 
8015-112690-0027	train-other-500	The strict alliance of Spain with these princes would engage Philip he thought to soften so disagreeable a demand by every art of negotiation and many articles must of necessity be adjusted
8015-112690-0028	train-other-500	before such an important point could be effected It was sufficient in James s opinion if the sincerity of the Spanish court could for the present be ascertained and dreading further delays of the marriage so long wished for
8015-112690-0029	train-other-500	he was resolved to trust the palatine s full restoration to the event of future counsels and deliberations This whole system of negotiation Buckingham now reversed
8015-112690-0030	train-other-500	and he overturned every supposition upon which the treaty had hitherto been conducted After many fruitless artifices were employed to delay or prevent the espousals
none	none	 Bristol received positive orders not to deliver the proxy which had been left in his hands or to finish the marriage till security were given for the full restitution of the Palatinate Parl Hist vol vi p fifty seven Rushworth vol i p one hundred five Rennet p seven hundred seventy six Philip understood this language He had been acquainted with the disgust received by Buckingham and deeming him a man capable of sacrificing to his own ungovernable passions 
8015-112690-0031	train-other-500	the greatest interests of his master and of his country his had expected that the unbounded credit of that favorite would be employed to embroil the two nations Determined however
8015-112690-0032	train-other-500	to throw the blame of the rupture entirely on the English he delivered into Bristol s hand a written promise
none	none	 by which he bound himself to procure the restoration of the Palatinate either by persuasion 
8015-112690-0033	train-other-500	or by every other possible means and when he found that this concession gave no satisfaction he ordered the infanta to lay aside the title of princess of Wales which she bore after the arrival of the dispensation from Rome
8015-112690-0034	train-other-500	and to drop the study of the English language Any thinking that such rash counsels as now governed the court of England would not stop at the breach of the marriage treaty he ordered preparations for war immediately
8015-112690-0035	train-other-500	to be made throughout all his dominions Thus James having by means inexplicable from the ordinary rules of politics conducted so near an honorable period the marriage of his son and the restoration of his son in law
8015-112690-0036	train-other-500	failed at last of his purpose by means equally unaccountable But though the expedients already used by Buckingham were sufficiently inglorious both for himself and for the nation it was necessary for him ere he could fully effect his purpose
none	none	 to employ artifices still more dishonorable The king having broken with Spain 
8015-112690-0037	train-other-500	was obliged to concert new measures
none	none	 and without the assistance of parliament no effectual step of any kind could be taken The benevolence which during the interval had been rigorously exacted for recovering the Palatinate though levied for no popular an end had procured to the king less money than ill will from his subjects 
8015-112690-0038	train-other-500	Whatever discouragements therefore he might receive from his ill agreement with former parliaments there was a necessity of summoning once more this assembly and it might be hoped that the Spanish alliance which gave such umbrage
none	none	 being abandoned the commons would now be better satisfied with the king s administration 
8015-112690-0039	train-other-500	In his speech to the houses James dropped some hints of his cause of complaint against Spain and he graciously condescended to ask the advice of parliament

8015-112690-0040	train-other-500	and to throw on the court of Spain the reproach of artifice and insincerity He said that after many years negotiation the king found not himself any nearer his purpose and that Bristol had never brought the treaty beyond general professions and declarations
none	none	 that the prince doubting the good intentions of Spain 
8015-112690-0041	train-other-500	resolved at last to take a journey to Madrid and put the matter to the utmost trial that he there found such artificial dealing as made him conclude all the steps taken towards the marriage to be false and deceitful
none	none	 that the restitution of the Palatinate 
8015-112690-0042	train-other-500	which had ever been regarded by the king as an essential preliminary was not seriously intended by Spain and that after enduring much bad usage
none	none	 the prince was obliged to return to England without any hopes either of obtaining the infanta 
8015-112690-0043	train-other-500	or of restoring the elector palatine This narrative which considering the importance of the occasion and the solemnity of that assembly to which it was delivered deserves great blame
8015-112690-0044	train-other-500	was yet vouched for truth by the prince of Wales who was present and the king himself lent it indirectly his authority by telling the parliament that it was by his orders Buckingham laid the whole affair before them
none	none	 The conduct of these princes it is difficult fully to excuse 
8015-112690-0045	train-other-500	It is in vain to plead the youth and inexperience of Charles
none	none	 unless his inexperience and youth as is probable fifty seven if not certain 
8015-112690-0046	train-other-500	really led him into error and made him swallow all the falsities of Buckingham And though the king was here hurried from his own measures

8015-112690-0047	train-other-500	so long wished for of going to war with Papists they little thought of future consequences but immediately advised the king to break off both treaties with Spain as well that which regarded the marriage
8015-112690-0048	train-other-500	as that for the restitution of the Palatinate The people ever greedy of war till they suffer by it displayed their triumph at these violent measures by public bonfires and rejoicings and by insults on the Spanish ministers
8015-112690-0049	train-other-500	Buckingham was now the favorite of the public and of the parliament Sir Edward Coke in the house of commons called him the savior of the nation Every place resounded with his praises And he himself intoxicated by a popularity
8015-112690-0050	train-other-500	which he enjoyed so little time and which he so ill deserved violated all duty to his indulgent master and entered into cabals with the Puritanical members
none	none	 who had ever opposed the royal authority He even encouraged schemes for abolishing the order of bishops and selling the dean and chapter lands in order to defray the expenses of a Spanish war And the king though he still entertained projects for temporizing and for forming an accommodation with Spain was so borne down by the torrent of popular prejudices conducted and increased by Buckingham that he was at last obliged in a speech to parliament to declare in favor of hostile measures if they would engage to support him Doubts of their sincerity in this respect doubts which the event showed not to be ill grounded had probably been one cause of his former pacific and dilatory measures Parl Hist vol vi p seventy five Franklyn p ninety eight Rushworth vol i p one hundred twenty eight Parl Hist vol vi p one hundred three Clarendon vol i p six Franklyn p ninety four ninety five Rushworth vol i p one hundred twenty nine one hundred thirty In his speech on this occasion the king began with lamenting his own unhappiness that having so long valued himself on the epithet of the pacific monarch he should now in his old age be obliged to exchange the blessings of peace for the inevitable calamities of war He represented to them the immense and continued expense requisite for military armaments 
8015-112690-0051	train-other-500	and besides supplies from time to time as they should become necessary he demanded a vote of six subsidies and twelve fifteenths as a proper stock before the commencement of hostilities
none	none	 He told them of his intolerable debts chiefly contracted by the sums remitted to the palatine fifty eight but he added that he did not insist on any supply for his own relief 
8015-112690-0052	train-other-500	and that it was sufficient for him if the honor and security of the public were provided for To remove all suspicion he who had ever strenuously maintained his prerogative
none	none	 and who had even extended it into some points esteemed doubtful 
8015-112690-0053	train-other-500	now made an imprudent concession of which the consequences might have proved fatal to royal authority he voluntarily offered that the money voted should be paid to a committee of parliament
8015-112690-0054	train-other-500	and should be issued by them without being intrusted to his management The commons willingly accepted of this concession so unusual in an English monarch they voted him only three subsidies and three fifteenths
none	none	 and they took no notice of the complaints which he made of his own wants and necessities 
8015-112690-0055	train-other-500	Advantage was also taken of the present good agreement between the king and parliament in order to pass the bill against monopolies which had formerly been encouraged by the king but which had failed by the rupture between him and the last house of commons
8015-112690-0056	train-other-500	This bill was conceived in such terms as to render it merely declaratory and all monopolies were condemned as contrary to law and to the known liberties of the people
8015-112690-0057	train-other-500	It was there supposed that every subject of England had entire power to dispose of his own actions provided he did no injury to any of his fellow subjects and that no prerogative of the king no power of any magistrate
none	none	 nothing but the authority alone of laws could restrain that unlimited freedom The full prosecution of this noble principle into all its natural consequences has at last through many contests produced that singular and happy government which we enjoy at present fifty nine See note FFF at the end of the volume Rushworth vol i p one hundred thirty seven Less than three hundred thousand pounds See note GGG at the end of the volume The house of commons also corroborated by a new precedent the important power of impeachment which two years before they had exercised in the case of Chancellor Bacon and which had lain dormant for near two centuries except when they served as instruments of royal vengeance 
8015-112690-0058	train-other-500	The earl of Middlesex had been raised by Buckingham s interest from the rank of a London merchant to be treasurer of England and by his activity and address seemed not unworthy of that preferment
none	none	 But as he incurred the displeasure of his patron by scrupling or refusing some demands of money 
8015-112690-0059	train-other-500	during the prince s residence in Spain that favorite vowed revenge and employed all his credit among the commons to procure an impeachment of the treasurer The king was extremely dissatisfied with this measure
8015-112690-0060	train-other-500	and prophesied to the prince and duke that they would live to have their fill of parliamentary prosecutions In a speech to the parliament he endeavored to apologize for Middlesex and to soften the accusation against him
8015-112690-0061	train-other-500	The charge however was still maintained by the commons and the treasurer was found guilty by the peers though the misdemeanors proved against him were neither numerous nor important
8015-112690-0062	train-other-500	The accepting of two presents of five hundred pounds apiece for passing two patents was the article of greatest weight His sentence was to be fined fifty thousand pounds for the king s use and to suffer all the other penalties formerly inflicted upon Bacon
none	none	 The fine was afterwards remitted by the prince when he mounted the throne 
8015-112690-0063	train-other-500	This session an address was also made very disagreeable to the king craving the severe execution of the laws against Catholics His answer was gracious and condescending
8015-112690-0064	train-other-500	though he declared against persecution as being an improper measure for the suppression of any religion according to the received maxim That the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the church He also condemned an entire indulgence of the Catholics
8015-112690-0065	train-other-500	and seemed to represent a middle course as the most humane and most politic He went so far as even to affirm with an oath that he never had entertained any thoughts of granting a toleration to these religionists
8015-112690-0066	train-other-500	The liberty of exercising their worship in private houses which he had secretly agreed to in the Spanish treaty did not appear to him deserving that name and it was probably by means of this explication he thought that he had saved his honor
none	none	 And as Buckingham in his narrative v confessed that the king had agreed to a temporary suspension of the penal laws against the Catholics 
8015-112690-0067	train-other-500	which he distinguished from a toleration

8015-112691-0002	train-other-500	and whom he considered as the author both of the prince s journey to Spain and of the breach of the marriage treaty The arrival of Bristol he impatiently longed for
8015-112691-0003	train-other-500	and it was by the assistance of that minister whose wisdom he respected and whose views he approved that he hoped in time to extricate himself from his present difficulties During the prince s abode in Spain
8015-112691-0004	train-other-500	that able negotiator had ever opposed though unsuccessfully to the impetuous measures suggested by Buckingham his own wise and well tempered counsels After Charles s departure
8015-112691-0005	train-other-500	he still upon the first appearance of a change of resolution interposed his advice and strenuously insisted on the sincerity of the Spaniards in the conduct of the treaty as well as the advantages which England must reap from the completion of it
8015-112691-0006	train-other-500	Enraged to find that his successful labors should be rendered abortive by the levities and caprices of an insolent minion he would understand no hints
8015-112691-0007	train-other-500	and nothing but express orders from his master could engage him to make that demand which he was sensible must put a final period to the treaty He was not therefore surprised to hear that Buckingham had declared himself
8015-112691-0008	train-other-500	his open enemy and on all occasions had thrown out many violent reflections against him Nothing could be of greater consequence to Buckingham than to keep Bristol at a distance both from the king and the parliament
8015-112691-0009	train-other-500	lest the power of truth enforced by so well informed a speaker should open scenes which were but suspected by the former and of which the latter had as yet entertained no manner of jealousy
8015-112691-0010	train-other-500	He applied therefore to James whose weakness disguised to himself under the appearance of finesse and dissimulation was now become absolutely incurable
8015-112691-0011	train-other-500	A warrant for sending Bristol to the Tower was issued immediately upon his arrival in England and though he was soon released from confinement yet orders were carried him from the king to retire to his country seat
8015-112691-0012	train-other-500	and to abstain from all attendance in parliament He obeyed but loudly demanded an opportunity of justifying himself and of laying his whole conduct before his master On all occasions he protested his innocence
8015-112691-0013	train-other-500	and threw on his enemy the blame of every miscarriage Buckingham and at his instigation the prince declared that they would be reconciled to Bristol if he would but acknowledge his errors and ill conduct
8015-112691-0014	train-other-500	but the spirited nobleman jealous of his honor refused to buy favor at so high a price James had the equity to say that the insisting on that condition was a strain of unexampled tyranny but Buckingham scrupled not to assert
8015-112691-0015	train-other-500	with his usual presumption that neither the king the prince nor himself were as yet satisfied of Bristol s innocence While the attachment of the prince to Buckingham while the timidity of James or the shame of changing his favorite

8015-112691-0017	train-other-500	that the prince and Buckingham had conspired together and had the whole court at their devotion that cabals among the popular leaders in parliament were carrying on to the extreme prejudice of his authority that the project was to confine him to some of his hunting seats

the house of Stuart was written and published by the author before the history of the house of Tudor Hence it happens that some passages particularly in the present Appendix may seem to be repetitions of what was formerly delivered in the reign of Elizabeth The author in order to obviate this objection has cancelled some few passages in the foregoing chapters It may not be improper at this period to make a pause and to take a survey of the state of the kingdom with regard to government manners finances arms trade learning Where a just notion is not formed of these particulars history can be little instructive and often will not be intelligible We may safely pronounce that the English government at the accession of the Scottish line was much more arbitrary than it is at present the prerogative less limited the liberties of the subject less accurately defined and secured Without mentioning other particulars the courts alone of high commission and star chamber were sufficient to lay the whole kingdom at the mercy of the prince The court of high commission had been erected by Elizabeth in consequence of an act of parliament passed in the beginning of her reign by this act it was thought proper during the great revolution of religion to arm the sovereign with full powers in order to discourage and suppress opposition All appeals from the inferior ecclesiastical courts were carried before the high commission and of consequence the whole life and doctrine of the clergy lay directly under its inspection Every breach of the act of uniformity every refusal of the ceremonies was cognizable in this court and during the reign of Elizabeth had been punished by deprivation by fine confiscation and imprisonment James contented himself with the gentler penalty of deprivation nor was that punishment inflicted with rigor on every offender Archbishop Spotswood tells us that fee was informed by Bancroft the primate several years after the king s accession that not above forty five clergymen had then been deprived All the Catholics too were liable to be punished by this court if they exercised any act of their religion or sent abroad their children or other relations to receive that education which they could not procure them in their own country Popish priests were thrown into prison and might be delivered over to the law which punished them with death though that severity had been sparingly exercised by Elizabeth and never almost by James In a word that liberty of conscience which we so highly and so justly value at present was totally suppressed and no exercise of any religion but the established was permitted throughout the kingdom Any word or writing which tended towards heresy or schism was punishable by the high commissioners or any three of them they alone were judges what expressions had that tendency they proceeded not by information but upon rumor suspicion or according to their discretion they administered an oath by which the party cited before them was bound to answer any question which should be propounded to him whoever refused this oath though he pleaded ever so justly that he might thereby be brought to accuse himself or his dearest friend was punishable by Imprisonment and in short an inquisitorial tribunal with all its terrors and iniquities was erected in the kingdom Full discretionary powers were bestowed with regard to the inquiry trial sentence and penalty inflicted excepting only that corporal punishments were restrained by that patent of the prince which erected the court not by the act of parliament which empowered him By reason of the uncertain limits which separate ecclesiastical from civil causes all accusations of adultery and incest were tried by the court of high commission and every complaint of wives against their husbands was there examined and discussed Rymer tom xvii p two hundred On like pretences every cause which regarded conscience that is every cause could have been brought under their jurisdiction But there was a sufficient reason why the king would not be solicitous to stretch the jurisdiction of this court the star chamber possessed the same authority in civil matters and its methods of proceeding were equally arbitrary and unlimited The origin of this court was derived from the most remote antiquity though it is pretended that its power had first been carried to the greatest height by Henry VII In all times however it is confessed it enjoyed authority and at no time was its authority circumscribed or method of proceeding directed by any law or statute We have had already or shall have sufficient occasion dur ing the course of this history to mention the dispensing power the power of imprisonment of exacting loans and benevolences of pressing and quartering soldiers of altering the customs of erecting monopolies These branches of power if not directly opposite to the principles of all free government must at least be acknowledged dangerous to freedom in a monarchical constitution where an eternal jealousy must be preserved against the sovereign and no discretionary powers must ever be intrusted to him by which the property or personal liberty of any subject can be affected The kings of England however had almost constantly exercised these powers and if on any occasion the prince had been obliged to submit to laws enacted against them he had ever in practice eluded these laws and returned to the same arbitrary administration During almost three centuries before the accession of James the regal authority in all these particulars had never once been called in question Bushworth vol ii p four hundred seventy three In Chambers s case it was the unanimous opinion of the court of king s bench that the court of star Chamber was not derived from the statute of Henry VII but was a court many years before and one of the most high and honorable courts of justice See Coke s Rep term Mich five Car I See further Camden s Brit vol i Intro p two hundred fifty four edit of Gibson During several centuries no reign had passed without some forced loans from the subject We may also observe that the principles in general which prevailed during that age were so favorable to monarchy that they bestowed on it an authority almost absolute and unlimited sacred and indefeasible The meetings of parliament were so precarious their sessions so short compared to the vacations that when men s eyes were turned upwards in search of sovereign power the prince alone was apt to strike them as the only permanent magistrate invested with the whole majesty and authority of the state The great complaisance too of parliaments during so long a period had extremely degraded and obscured those assemblies and as all instances of opposition to prerogative must have been drawn from a remote age they were unknown to a great many and had the less authority even with those who were acquainted with them These examples besides of liberty had commonly in ancient times been accompanied with such circumstances of violence convulsion civil war and disorder that they presented but a disagreeable idea to the inquisitive part of the people and afforded small inducement to renew such dismal scenes By a great many therefore monarchy simple and unmixed was conceived to be the government of England and those popular assemblies were supposed to form only the ornament of the fabric without being in any degree essential to its being and existence sixty one The prerogative of the crown was represented by lawyers as something real and durable like those eternal essences of the schools which no time or force could alter The sanction of religion was by divines called in aid and the Monarch of heaven was supposed to be interested in supporting the authority of his earthly vicegerent And though it is pretended that these doctrines were more openly inculcated and more strenuously insisted on during the reign of the Stuarts they were not then invented and were only found by the court to be more necessary at that period by reason of the opposite doctrines which began to be promulgated by the Puritanical party sixty two See note III at the end of the volume See note KKK at the end of the volume In consequence of these exalted ideas of kingly authority the prerogative besides the articles of jurisdiction founded on precedent was by many supposed to possess an inexhaustible fund of latent powers which might be exerted on any emergence In every government necessity when real supersedes all laws and levels all limitations but in the English government convenience alone was conceived to authorize any extraordinary act of regal power and to render it obligatory on the people Hence the strict obedience required to proclamations during all periods of the English history and if James has incurred blame on account of his edicts it is only because he too frequently issued them at a time when they began to be less regarded not because he first assumed or extended to an unusual degree that exercise of authority Of his maxims in a parallel case the following is a pretty remark able instance Queen Elizabeth had appointed commissioners for the inspection of prisons and had bestowed on them full discretionary powers to adjust all differences between prisoners and their creditors to compound debts and to give liberty to such debtors as they found honest and insolvent From the uncertain and undefined nature of the English constitution doubts sprang up in many that this commission was contrary to law and it was represented in that light to James He forbore therefore renewing the commission till the fifteenth of his reign when complaints rose so high with regard to the abuses practised in prisons that he thought himself obliged to overcome his scruples and to appoint new commissioners invested with the same discretionary powers which Elizabeth had formerly conferred Rymer tom xviii p one hundred seventeen five hundred ninety four Upon the whole we must conceive that monarchy on the accession of the house of Stuart was possessed of a very extensive authority an authority in the judgment of all not exactly limited in the judgment of some not limitable But at the same time this authority was founded merely on the opinion of the people influenced by ancient precedent and example It was not supported either by money or by force of arms And for this reason we need not wonder that the princes of that line were so extremely jealous of their prerogative being sensible that when these claims were ravished from them they possessed no influence by which they could maintain their dignity or support the laws By the changes which have since been introduced the liberty and independence of individuals has been rendered much more full entire and secure that of the public more uncertain and precarious And it seems a necessary though perhaps a melancholy truth that in every government the magistrate must either possess a large revenue and a military force or enjoy some discretionary powers in order to execute the laws and support his own authority We have had occasion to remark in so many instances the bigotry which prevailed in that age that we can look for no toleration among the different sects Two Arians under the title of heretics were punished by fire during this period and no other reign since the reformation had been free from the like barbarities Stowe says that these Arians were offered their pardon at the stake if they would merit it by a recantation A madman who called himself the Holy Ghost was without any indulgence for his frenzy condemned to the same punishment Twenty pounds a month could by law be levied on every one who frequented not the established worship This rigorous law however had one indulgent clause that the lines exacted should not exceed two thirds of the yearly income of the person It had been usual for Elizabeth to allow those penalties to run on for several years and to levy them all at once to the utter ruin of such Catholics as had incurred her displeasure James was more humane in this as in every other respect The Puritans formed a sect which secretly lurked in the church but pretended not to any separate worship or discipline An attempt of that kind would have been universally regarded as the most unpardonable enormity And had the king been disposed to grant the Puritans a full toleration for a separate exercise of their religion it is certain from the spirit of the times that this sect itself would have despised and hated him for it and would have reproached him with luke warmness and indifference in the cause of religion They maintained that they themselves were the only pure church that their principles and practices ought to be established by law and that no others ought to be tolerated It may be questioned therefore whether the administration at this time could with propriety deserve the appellation of persecutors with regard to the Puritans Such of the clergy indeed as refused to comply with the legal ceremonies were deprived of their livings and sometimes in Elizabeth s reign were otherwise punished and ought any man to accept of an office or benefice in an establishment while he declines compliance with the fixed and known rules of that establishment But Puritans were never punished for frequenting separate congregations because there were none such in the kingdom and no Protestant ever assumed or pretended to the right of erecting them The greatest well wishers of the Puritanical sect would have condemned a practice which in that age was universally by statesmen and ecclesiastics philosophers and zealots regarded as subversive of civil society Even so great a reasoner as Lord Bacon thought that uniformity in religion was absolutely necessary to the support of government and that no toleration could with safety be given to sectaries See his essay De Unitate Ecclesiae Nothing but the imputation of idolatry which was thrown on the Catholic religion could justify in the eyes of the Puritans themselves the schism made by the Hugonots and other Protestants who lived in Popish countries In all former ages not wholly excepting even those of Greece and Rome religious sects and heresies and schisms had been esteemed dangerous if not pernicious to civil government and were regarded as the source of faction and private combination and opposition to the laws The magistrate therefore applied himself directly to the cure of this evil as of every other and very naturally attempted by penal statutes to suppress those separate communities and punish the obstinate innovators But it was found by fatal experience and after spilling an ocean of blood in those theological quarrels that the evil was of a peculiar nature and was both inflamed by violent remedies and diffused itself more rapidly throughout the whole society Hence though late arose the paradoxical principle and salutary practice of toleration The liberty of the press was incompatible with such maxims and such principles of government as then prevailed and was therefore quite unknown in that age Besides employing the two terrible courts of star chamber and high commission whose powers were unlimited Queen Elizabeth exerted her authority by restraints upon the press She passed a decree in her court of star chamber that is by her own will and pleasure forbidding any book to be printed in any place but in London Oxford and Cambridge and another in which she prohibited under severe penalties the publishing of any book or pamphlet against the form or meaning of any restraint or ordinance contained or to be contained in any statute or laws of this realm or in any injunction made or set forth by her majesty or her privy council or against the true sense or meaning of any letters patent commissions or prohibitions under the great seal of England James extended the same penalties to the importing of such books from abroad See Cicero de Legibus twenty eighth of Elizabeth See State Trials Sir Robert Knightly vol vii first edit Rymer tom xvii p five hundred twenty two Rymer tom xvii p five hundred twenty two And to render these edicts more effectual he afterwards inhibited the printing of any book without a license from the archbishop of Canterbury the archbishop of York the bishop of London or the vice chancellor of one of the universities or of some person appointed by them In tracing the coherence among the systems of modern theology we may observe that the doctrine of absolute decrees has ever been intimately connected with the enthusiastic spirit as that doctrine affords the highest subject of joy triumph and security to the supposed elect and exalts them by infinite degrees above the rest of mankind All the first reformers adopted these principles and the Jansenists too a fanatical sect in France not to mention the Mahometans in Asia have ever embraced them As the Lutheran establishments were subjected to Episcopal jurisdiction their enthusiastic genius gradually decayed and men had leisure to perceive the absurdity of supposing God to punish by infinite torments what he himself from all eternity had unchangeably decreed The king though at this time his Calvinistic education had rivetted him in the doctrine of absolute decrees yet being a zealous partisan of Episcopacy was insensibly engaged towards the end of his reign to favor the milder theology of Arminius Even in so great a doctor the genius of the religion prevailed over its speculative tenets and with him the whole clergy gradually dropped the more rigid principles of absolute reprobation and unconditional decrees Some noise was at first made about these innovations but being drowned in the fury of factions and civil wars which ensued the scholastic arguments made an insignificant figure amidst those violent disputes about civil and ecclesiastical power with which the nation was agitated And at the restoration the church though she still retained her old subscriptions and articles of faith was found to have totally changed her speculative doctrines and to have embraced tenets more suitable to the genius of her discipline and worship without its being possible to assign the precise period in which the alteration was produced It may be worth observing that James from his great desire to promote controversial divinity erected a college at Chelsea for the entertainment of twenty persons who should be entirely employed in refuting the Papists and Puritans Rymer tom xvii p six hundred sixteen Kennel p six hundred eighty five Caraden s Brit vol i p three hundred seventy Gibson s edit All the efforts of the great Bacon could not procure an establishment for the cultivation of natural philosophy even to this day no society has been instituted for the polishing and fixing of our language The only encouragement which the sovereign in England has ever given to any thing that has the appearance of science was this short lived establishment of James an institution quite superfluous considering the unhappy propension which at that time so universally possessed the nation for polemical theology The manners of the nation were agreeable to the monarchical government which prevailed and contained not that strange mixture which at present distinguishes England from all other countries Such violent extremes were then unknown of industry and debauchery frugality and profusion civility and rusticity fanaticism and scepticism Candor sincerity modesty are the only qualities which the English of that age possessed in common with the present High pride of family then prevailed and it was by a dignity and stateliness of behavior that the gentry and nobility distinguished themselves from the common people Great riches acquired by commerce were more rare and had not as yet been able to confound all ranks of men and render money the chief foundation of distinction Much ceremony took place in the common intercourse of life and little familiarity was indulged by the great The advantages which result from opulence are so solid and real that those who are possessed of them need not dread the near approaches of their inferiors The distinctions of birth and title being more empty and imaginary soon vanish upon familiar access and acquaintance The expenses of the great consisted in pomp and show and a numerous retinue rather than in convenience and true pleasure The earl of Nottingham in his embassy to Spain was attended by five hundred persons the earl of Hertford in that to Brussels carried three hundred gentlemen along with him Lord Bacon has remarked that the English nobility in his time maintained a larger retinue of servants than the nobility of any other nation except perhaps the Polanders Civil honors which now hold the first place were at that time subordinate to the military The young gentry and nobility were fond of distinguishing themselves by arms The fury of duels too prevailed more than at anytime before or since This was the turn that the romantic chivalry for which the nation was formerly so renowned had lately taken Essays De profer fin imp Franklyn p five See also Lord Herbert s Memoirs Liberty of commerce between the sexes was indulged but without any licentiousness of manners The court was very little an exception to this observation James had rather entertained an aversion and contempt for the females nor were those young courtiers of whom he was so fond able to break through the established manners of the nation The first sedan chair seen in England was in this reign and was used by the duke of Buckingham to the great indignation of the people who exclaimed that he was employing his fellow creatures to do the service of beasts The country life prevails at present in England beyond any cultivated nation of Europe but it was then much more generally embraced by all the gentry The increase of arts pleasures and social commerce was just beginning to produce an inclination for the softer and more civilized life of the city James discouraged as much as possible this alteration of manners He was wont to be very earnest as Lord Bacon tells us with the country gentlemen to go from London to their country seats And sometimes he would say thus to them Gentlemen at London you are like ships in a sea which show like nothing but in your country villages you are like ships in a river which look like great things He was not content with reproof and exhortation As Queen Elizabeth had perceived with regret the increase of London and had restrained all new buildings by proclamation James who found that these edicts were not exactly obeyed frequently renewed them though a strict execution seems still to have been wanting He also issued reiterated proclamations in imitation of his predecessor containing severe menaces against the gentry who lived in town Apophthegms Rymer tom xvii p six hundred thirty two This policy is contrary to that which has ever been practised by all princes who studied the increase of their authority To allure the nobility to court to engage them in expensive pleasures or employments which dissipate their fortune to increase their subjection to ministers by attendance to weaken their authority in the provinces by absence these have been the common arts of arbitrary government But James besides that he had certainly laid no plan for extending his power had no money to support a splendid court or bestow on a numerous retinue of gentry and nobility He thought too that by their living together they became more sensible of their own strength and were apt to indulge too curious researches into matters of government To remedy the present evil he was desirous of dispersing them into their country seats where he hoped they would bear a more submissive reverence to his authority and receive less support from each other But the contrary effect soon followed The riches amassed during their residence at home rendered them independent The influence acquired by hospitality made them formidable They would not be led by the court they could not be driven and thus the system of the English government received a total and a sudden alteration in the course of less than forty years The first rise of commerce and the arts had contributed in preceding reigns to scatter those immense fortunes of the barons which rendered them so formidable both to king and people The further progress of these advantages began during this reign to ruin the small proprietors of land and by both events the gentry or that rank which composed the house of commons enlarged their power and authority The early improvements in luxury were seized by the greater nobles whose fortunes placing them above frugality or even calculation were soon dissipated in expensive pleasures These improvements reached at last all men of property and those of slender fortunes who at that time were often men of family imitating those of a rank immediately above them reduced themselves to poverty Their lands coming to sale swelled the estates of those who possessed itches sufficient for the fashionable expenses but who were not exempted from some care and attention to their domestic economy The gentry also of that age were engaged in no expense except that of country hospitality No taxes were levied no wars waged no attendance at court expected no bribery or profusion required at elections Could human nature ever reach happiness the condition of the English gentry under so mild and benign a prince might merit that appellation The amount of the king s revenue as it stood in sixteen seventeen is thus stated

of baronet money paid by the states and by the king of France benevolences et cetera were in the whole about two millions two hundred thousand pounds of which the sale of lands afforded seven hundred and seventy five thousand pounds The extraordinary disbursements of the king amounted to two millions besides above four hundred thousand pounds given in presents Upon the whole a sufficient reason appears partly from necessary expenses partly for want of a rigid economy why the king even early in his reign was deeply involved in debt and found great difficulty to support the government Farmers not commissioners levied the customs It seems indeed requisite that the former method should always be tried before the latter though a preferable one When men s own interest is concerned they fall upon a hundred expedients to prevent frauds in the merchants and these the public may afterwards imitate in establishing proper rules for its officers The customs were supposed to amount to five per cent of the value and were levied upon exports as well as imports Nay the imposition upon exports by James s additions is said to amount in some few instances to twenty five per cent This practice so hurtful to industry prevails still in France Spain and most countries of Europe The customs in sixteen oh four yielded one hundred and twenty seven thousand pounds a year they rose to one hundred and ninety thousand towards the end of the reign The excess was formerly greater as appears by Salisbury s account See chap two Journ twenty first May sixteen oh four Interest during this reign was at ten per cent till sixteen twenty four when it was reduced to eight This high interest is an indication of the great profits and small progress of commerce The extraordinary supplies granted by parliament during this whole reign amounted not to more than six hundred and thirty thousand pounds which divided among twenty one years makes thirty thousand pounds a year I do not include those supplies amounting to three hundred thousand pounds which were given to the king by his last parliament These were paid in to their own commissioners and the expenses of the Spanish war were much more than sufficient to exhaust them The distressed family of the palatine was a great burden on James during part of his reign The king it is pretended possessed not frugality proportioned to the extreme narrowness of his revenue Splendid equipages however he did not affect nor costly furniture nor a luxurious table nor prodigal mistresses His buildings too were not sumptuous though the Banqueting House must not be forgotten as a monument which does honor to his reign Hunting was his chief amusement the cheapest pleasure in which a king can indulge himself His expenses were the effects of liberality rather than of luxury One day it is said while he was standing amidst some of his courtiers a porter passed by loaded with money which he was carrying to the treasury The king observed that Rich afterwards earl of Holland one of his handsome agreeable favorites whispered something to one standing near him Upon inquiry he found that Rich had said How happy would that money make me Without hesitation James bestowed it all upon him though it amounted to three thousand pounds He added You think yourself very happy in obtaining so large a sum but I am more happy in having an opportunity of obliging a worthy man whom I love The generosity of James was more the result of a benign humor or light fancy than of reason or judgment The objects of it were such as could render themselves agreeable to him in his loose hours not such as were endowed with great merit or who possessed talents or popularity which could strengthen his interest with the public The same advantage we may remark over the people which the crown formerly reaped from that interval between the fall of the peers and rise of the commons was now possessed by the people against the crown during the continuance of a like interval The sovereign had already lost that independent revenue by which he could subsist without regular supplies from parliament and he had not yet acquired the means of influencing those assemblies The effects of this situation which commenced with the accession of the house of Stuart soon rose to a great height and were more of less propagated throughout all the reigns of that unhappy family Subsidies and fifteenths are frequently mentioned by historians but neither the amount of these taxes nor the method of levying them have been well explained It appears that the fifteenths formerly corresponded to the name and were that proportionable part of the movables But a valuation having been made in the reign of Edward III that valuation was always adhered to and each town paid unalterably a particular sum which the inhabitants themselves assessed upon their fellow citizens The same tax in corporate towns was called a tenth because there it was at first a tenth of the movables The whole amount of a tenth and a fifteenth throughout the kingdom or a fifteenth as it is often more concisely called was about twenty nine thousand pounds The amount of a subsidy was not invariable like that of a fifteenth In the eighth of Elizabeth a subsidy amounted to one hundred and twenty thousand pounds in the fortieth it was not above seventy eight thousand It afterwards fell to seventy thousand and was continually decreasing The reason is easily collected from the method of levying it We may learn from the subsidy bills v that one subsidy was given for four shillings in the pound on land and two shillings and eightpence on movables throughout the counties a considerable tax had it been strictly levied But this was only the ancient state of a subsidy During the reign of James there was not paid the twentieth part of that sum The tax was so far personal that a man paid only in the county where he lived though he should possess estates in other counties and the assessors formed a loose estimation of his property and rated him accordingly Coke s Inst book iv chap one cf fifteenths quinzins Coke s Inst book iv chap one subsidies temporary Journ eleventh July sixteen ten Coke s Inst book iv subsidies temporary v See Statutes at large To preserve however some rule in the estimation it seems to have been the practice to keep an eye to former assessments and to rate every man according as his ancestors or men of such an estimated property were accustomed to pay This was a sufficient reason why subsidies could not increase notwithstanding the great increase of money and rise of rents But there was an evident reason why they continually decreased The favor as is natural to suppose ran always against the crown especially during the latter end of Elizabeth when subsidies became numerous and frequent and the sums levied were considerable compared to former supplies The assessors though accustomed to have an eye to ancient estimations were not bound to observe any such rule but might rate anew any person according to his present income When rents fell or parts of an estate were sold off the proprietor was sure to represent these losses and obtain a diminution of his subsidy but where rents rose or new lands were purchased he kept his own secret and paid no more than formerly The advantage therefore of every change was taken against the crown and the crown could obtain the advantage of none And to make the matter worse the alterations which happened in property during this age were in general unfavorable to the crown The small proprietors or twenty pound men went continually to decay and when their estates were swallowed up by a greater the new purchaser increased not his subsidy So loose indeed is the whole method of rating subsidies that the wonder was not how the tax should continually diminish but how it yielded any revenue at all It became at last so unequal and uncertain that the parliament was obliged to change it into a land tax The price of corn during this reign and that of the other necessaries of life was no lower or was rather higher than at present By a proclamation of James establishing public magazines whenever wheat fell below thirty two shillings a quarter rye below eighteen barley below sixteen the commissioners were empowered to purchase corn for the magazines These prices then are to be regarded as low though they would rather pass for high by our present estimation The usual bread of the poor was at this time made of barley The best wool during the greater part of James s reign was at thirty three shillings a tod At present it is not above two thirds of that value though it is lo be presumed that our exports in woollen goods are somewhat increased The finer manufactures too by the progress of arts and industry have rather diminished in price notwithstanding the great increase of money Rymer tom xvii p five hundred twenty six To the same purpose see also twenty first lac vi cap twenty eight Rymer tom xx p one hundred fifty seven See a compendium or dialogue inserted in the Memoirs of Wool chap twenty three In Shakspeare the hostess tells Falstaff that the shirts she bought him were Holland at eight shillings a yard a high price at this day even supposing what is not probable that the best Holland at that time was equal in goodness to the best that can now be purchased In like manner a yard of velvet about the middle of Elizabeth s reign was valued at two and twenty shillings It appears from doctor Birch s life of Prince Henry that that prince by contract with his butcher paid near a groat a pound throughout the year for all the beef and mutton used in his family Besides we must consider that the general turn of that age which no laws could prevent was the converting of arable land into pasture a certain proof that the latter was found more profitable and consequently that all butcher s meat as well as bread was rather higher than at present We have a regulation of the market with regard to poultry and some other articles very early in Charles I s reign and the prices are high A turkey cock four shillings and sixpence a turkey hen three shillings a pheasant cock six a pheasant hen five a partridge one shilling a goose two a capon two and sixpence a pullet one and sixpence a rabbit eightpence a dozen of pigeons six shillings We must consider that London at present is more than three times more populous than it was at that time a circumstance which much increases the price of poultry and of every thing that cannot conveniently be brought from a distance not to mention that these regulations by authority are always calculated to diminish never to increase the market prices The contractors for victualling the navy were allowed by government eightpence a day for the diet of each man when in harbor sevenpence halfpenny when at sea which would suffice at present The chief difference in expense between that age and the present consists in the imaginary wants of men which have since extremely multiplied v These are the principal reasons why James s revenue would go further than the same money in our time though the difference is not near so great as is usually imagined Page four hundred forty nine Rymer tom xix p five hundred eleven We may judge of the great grievance of purveyance by this circumstance that the purveyors often gave but sixpence for a dozen of pigeons and twopence for a fowl Journ twenty fifth May sixteen twenty six Rymer tom xvii p four hundred forty one et seq v This volume was written above twenty years before the edition of seventeen seventy eight In that short period prices have perhaps risen more than during the preceding hundred and fifty The public was entirely free from the danger and expense of a standing army While James was vaunting his divine vicegerency and boasting of his high prerogative he possessed not so much as a single regiment of guards to maintain his extensive claims a sufficient proof that he sincerely believed his pretensions to be well grounded and a strong presumption that they were at least built on what were then deemed plausible arguments The militia of England amounting to one hundred and sixty thousand men was the sole defence of the kingdom It is pretended that they were kept in good order during his reign The city of London procured officers who had served abroad and who taught the trained bands their exercises in Artillery Garden a practice which had been discontinued since fifteen eighty eight All the counties of England in emulation of the capital were fond of showing a well ordered and well appointed militia It appeared that the natural propensity of men towards military shows and exercises will go far with a little attention in the sovereign towards exciting and supporting this spirit in any nation The very boys at this time in mimicry of their elders enlisted themselves voluntarily into companies elected officers and practised the discipline of which the models were every day exposed to their view Sir Edward Harwood In a memorial composed at the beginning of the subsequent reign says that England was so unprovided with horses fit for war that two thousand men could not possibly be mounted throughout the whole kingdom At present the breed of horses is so much improved that almost all those which are employed either in the plough wagon or coach would be fit for that purpose The disorders of Ireland obliged James to keep up some forces there and put him to great expense The common pay of a private man in the infantry was eightpence a day a lieutenant two shillings an ensign eighteen pence v Journ first March sixteen twenty three Stowe See also Sir Walter Raleigh of the Prerogatives of Parliament and Johnston Hist lib xviii Stowe In the Harleian Miscellany vol iv p two hundred fifty five v Rymer tom xvi p seven hundred seventeen The armies in Europe were not near so numerous during that age and the private men we may observe were drawn from a better rank than at present and approaching nearer to that of the officers In the year fifteen eighty three there was a general review made of all the men in England capable of bearing arms and these were found to amount to one million one hundred and seventy two thousand men according to Raleigh It is impossible to warrant the exactness of this computation or rather we may fairly presume it to be somewhat inaccurate But if it approached near the truth England has probably since that time increased in populousness The growth of London in riches and beauty as well as in numbers of inhabitants has been prodigious From sixteen hundred it doubled every forty years and consequently in sixteen eighty it contained four times as many inhabitants as at the beginning of the century It has ever been the centre of all the trade in the kingdom and almost the only town that affords society and amusement The affection which the English bear to a country life makes the provincial towns be little frequented by the gentry Nothing but the allurements of the capital which is favored by the residence of the king and by being the seat of government and of all the courts of justice can prevail over their passion for their rural villas London at this time was almost entirely built of wood and in every respect was certainly a very ugly city The earl of Arundel first introduced the general practice of brick buildings The navy of England was esteemed formidable in Elizabeth s time yet it consisted only of thirty three ships besides pinnaces and the largest of these would not equal our fourth rates at present Raleigh advises never to build a ship of war above six hundred tons James was not negligent of the navy In five years preceding sixteen twenty three he built ten new ships and expended fifty thousand pounds a year on the fleet Sir William Petty Sir Edward Walker s Political Discourses p two hundred seventy Coke s Inst book iv chap one Consultation in parliament for the navy Of the Invention of Shipping This number is much superior to that contained in Murden and that delivered by Sir Edward Coke to the house of commons and is more likely By Raleigh s account in his discourse of the first invention of shipping the fleet in the twenty fourth of the queen consisted only of thirteen ships and was augmented afterwards eleven He probably reckoned some to be pinnaces which Coke called ships besides the value of thirty six thousand pounds in timber which he annually gave from the royal forests The largest ship that ever had come from the English docks was built during this reign She was only one thousand four hundred tons and carried sixty four guns The merchant ships in cases of necessity were instantly converted into ships of war The king affirmed to the parliament that the navy had never before been in so good a condition Every session of parliament during this reign we meet with grievous lamentations concerning the decay of trade and the growth of Popery such violent propensity have men to complain of the present times and to entertain discontent against their fortune and condition The king himself was deceived by these popular complaints and was at a loss to account for the total want of money which he heard so much exaggerated It may however be affirmed that during no preceding period of English history was there a more sensible increase than during the reign of this monarch of all the advantages which distinguish a flourishing people Not only the peace which he maintained was favorable to industry and commerce his turn of mind inclined him to promote the peaceful arts and trade being as yet in its infancy all additions to it must have been the more evident to every eye which was not blinded by melancholy prejudices v sixty three By an account v which seems judicious and accurate it appears that all the seamen employed in the merchant service amounted to ten thousand men which probably exceeds not the fifth part of their present number Sir Thomas Overbury says that the Dutch possessed three times more shipping than the English but that their ships were of inferior burden to those of the latter v Sir William Monson computed the English naval power to be little or nothing inferior to the Dutch v which is surely an

manufactures for which the English were then eminent would appear very contemptible in comparison of those which flourish among them at present Almost all the more elaborate and curious arts were only cultivated abroad particularly in Italy Holland and the Netherlands Ship building and the founding of iron cannon were the sole in which the English excelled They seem indeed to have possessed alone the secret of the latter and great complaints were made every parliament against the exportation of English ordnance Nine tenths of the commerce of the kingdom consisted in woollen goods Wool however was allowed to be exported till the nineteenth of the king Its exportation was then forbidden by proclamation though that edict was never strictly executed Most of the cloth was exported raw and was dyed and dressed by the Dutch who gained it is pretended seven hundred thousand pounds a year by this manufacture A proclamation issued by the king against exporting cloth in that condition had succeeded so ill during one year by the refusal of the Dutch to buy the dressed cloth that great murmurs arose against it and this measure was retracted by the king and complained of by the nation as if it had been the most impolitic in the world It seems indeed to have been premature In so little credit was the fine English cloth even at home that the king was obliged to seek expedients by which he might engage the people of fashion to wear it The manufacture of fine linen was totally unknown in the kingdom Journ twenty sixth May sixteen twenty one Journ twentieth May sixteen fourteen Raleigh in his Observations computes the loss at four hundred thousand pounds to the nation There are about eighty thousand undressed cloths says he exported yearly He computes besides that about one hundred thousand pounds a year had been lost by kerseys not to mention other articles The account of two hundred thousand cloths a year exported in Elizabeth s reign seems to be exaggerated Kymer tom xvii p four hundred fifteen Rymer tom xvii p four hundred fifteen The company of merchant adventurers by their patent possessed the sole commerce of woollen goods though the staple commodity of the kingdom An attempt made during the reign of Elizabeth to lay open this important trade had been attended with bad consequences for a time by a conspiracy of the merchant adventurers not to make any purchases of cloth and the queen immediately restored them their patent It was the groundless fear of a like accident that enslaved the nation to those exclusive companies which confined so much every branch of commerce and industry The parliament however annulled in the third of the king the patent of the Spanish company and the trade to Spain which was at first very insignificant soon became the most considerable in the kingdom It is strange that they were not thence encouraged to abolish all the other companies and that they went no further than obliging them to enlarge their bottom and to facilitate the admission of new adventurers A board of trade was erected by the king in sixteen twenty two One of the reasons assigned in the commission is to remedy the low price of wool which begat complaints of the decay of the woollen manufactory It is more probable however that this fall of prices proceeded from the increase of wool The king likewise recommends it to the commissioners to inquire and examine whether a greater freedom of trade and an exemption from the restraint of exclusive companies would not be beneficial Men were then fettered by their own prejudices and the king was justly afraid of embracing a bold measure whose consequences might be uncertain The digesting of a navigation act of a like nature with the famous one executed afterwards by the republican parliament is likewise recommended to the commissioners The arbitrary powers then commonly assumed by the privy council appear evidently through the whole tenor of the commission The silk manufacture had no footing in England but by James s direction mulberry trees were planted and silk worms introduced The climate seems unfavorable to the success of this project The planting of hops increased much in England during this reign Rymer tom xvii p four hundred ten Stowe Greenland is thought to have been discovered about this period and the whale fishery was carried on with success but the industry of the Dutch in spite of all opposition soon deprived the English of this source of riches A company was erected for the discovery of the north west passage and many fruitless attempts were made for that purpose In such noble projects despair ought never to be admitted till the absolute impossibility of success be fully ascertained The passage to the East Indies had been opened to the English during the reign of Elizabeth but the trade to those parts was not entirely established till this reign when the East India company received a new patent enlarged their stock to one million five hundred thousand pounds and fitted out several ships on these adventures In sixteen oh nine they built a vessel of twelve hundred tons the largest merchant ship that England had ever known She was unfortunate and perished by shipwreck In sixteen eleven a large ship of the company assisted by a pinnace maintained five several engagements with a squadron of Portuguese and gained a complete victory over forces much superior During the following years the Dutch company was guilty of great injuries towards the English in expelling many of their factors and destroying their settlements but these violences were resented with a proper spirit by the court of England A naval force was equipped under the earl of Oxford and lay in wait for the return of the Dutch East India fleet By reason of cross winds Oxford tailed of his purpose and the Dutch escaped Some time after one rich ship was taken by Vice admiral Merwin and it was stipulated by the Dutch to pay seventy thousand pounds to the English company in consideration of the losses which that company had sustained Journ twenty sixth Nov sixteen twenty one In sixteen twenty two Johnstoni Hist lib xix But neither this stipulation nor the fear of reprisals nor the sense of that friendship which subsisted between England and the states could restrain the avidity of the Dutch company or render them equitable in their proceedings towards their allies Impatient to have the sole possession of the spice trade which the English then shared with them they assumed a jurisdiction over a factory of the latter in the Island of Amboyna and on very improbable and even absurd pretences seized all the factors with their families and put them to death with the most inhuman tortures This dismal news arrived in England at the time when James by the prejudices of his subjects and the intrigues of his favorite was constrained to make a breach with Spain and he was obliged after some remonstrances to acquiesce in this indignity from a state whose alliance was now become necessary to him It is remarkable that the nation almost without a murmur submitted to this injury from their Protestant confederates an injury which besides the horrid enormity of the action was of much deeper importance to national interest than all those which they were so impatient to resent from the house of Austria The exports of England from Christmas sixteen twelve to Christmas sixteen thirteen are computed at two millions four hundred and eighty seven thousand four hundred and thirty five pounds the imports at two millions one hundred and forty one thousand one hundred and fifty one so that the balance in favor of England was three Hundred and forty six thousand two hundred and eighty four But in sixteen twenty two the exports were two millions three hundred and twenty thousand four hundred and thirty six pounds the imports two millions six hundred and nineteen thousand three hundred and fifteen which makes a balance of two hundred and ninety eight thousand eight hundred and seventy nine pounds against England The coinage of England from fifteen ninety nine to sixteen nineteen amounted to four millions seven hundred and seventy nine thousand three hundred and fourteen pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a proof that the balance in the main was considerably in favor of the kingdom As the annual imports and exports together rose to near five millions and the customs never yielded so much as two Hundred thousand pounds a year of which tonnage made a part it appears that the new rates affixed by James did not on the whole amount to one shilling in the pound and consequently were still inferior to the intention of the original grant of parliament The East India company usually carried out a third of their cargo in commodities The trade to Turkey was one of the most gainful to the nation It appears that copper halfpence and farthings began to be coined in this reign v Tradesmen had commonly carried on

the reign of James memorable is the commencement of the English colonies in America colonies established on the noblest footing that has been known in any age or nation The Spaniards being the first discoverers of the new world immediately took possession of the precious mines which they found there and by the allurement of great riches they were tempted to depopulate their own country as well as that which they conquered and added the vice of sloth to those of avidity and barbarity which had attended their adventurers in those renowned enterprises That fine coast was entirely neglected which reaches from saint Augustine to Cape Breton and which lies in all the temperate climates is watered by noble rivers and offers a fertile soil but nothing more to the industrious planter Peopled gradually from England by the necessitous and indigent who at home increased neither wealth nor populousness the colonies which were planted along that tract have promoted the navigation encouraged the industry and even perhaps multiplied the inhabitants of their mother country The spirit of independency which was reviving in England here shone forth in its full lustre and received new accession from the aspiring character of those who being discontented with the established church and monarchy had sought for freedom amidst those savage deserts Queen Elizabeth had done little more than given a name to the continent of Virginia and after her planting one feeble colony which quickly decayed that country was entirely abandoned But when peace put an end to the military enterprises against Spain and left ambitious spirits no hopes of making any longer such rapid advances towards honor and fortune the nation began to second the pacific intentions of its monarch and to seek a surer though slower expedient for acquiring riches and glory In sixteen oh six Newport carried over a colony and began a settlement which the company erected by patent for that purpose in London and Bristol took care to supply with yearly recruits of provisions utensils and new inhabitants About sixteen oh nine Argal discovered a more direct and shorter passage to Virginia and left the track of the ancient navigators who had first directed their course southwards to the tropic sailed westward by means of the trade winds and then turned northward till they reached the English settlements The same year five hundred persons under Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers were embarked for Virginia Somers s ship meeting with a tempest was driven into the Bermudas and laid the foundation of a settlement in those islands Lord Delawar afterwards undertook the government of the English colonies but notwithstanding all his care seconded by supplies from James and by money raised from the first lottery ever known in the kingdom such difficulties attended the settlement of these countries that in sixteen fourteen there were not alive more than four hundred men of all that had been sent thither After supplying themselves with provisions more immediately necessary for the support of life the new planters began the cultivating of tobacco and James notwithstanding his antipathy to that drug which he affirmed to be pernicious to men s morals as well as their health gave them permission to enter it in England and he inhibited by proclamation all importation of it from Spain By degrees new colonies were established in that continent and gave new names to the places where they settled leaving that of Virginia to the province first planted The Island of Barbadoes was also planted in this reign Rymer tom xvii p six hundred twenty one Rymer tom xvii p six hundred twenty one six hundred thirty three Speculative reasoners during that age raised many objections to the planting of those remote colonies and foretold that after draining their mother country of inhabitants they would soon shake off her yoke and erect an independent government in America but time has shown that the views entertained by those who encouraged such generous undertakings were more just and solid A mild government and great naval force have preserved and may still preserve during some time the dominion of England over her colonies And such advantages have commerce and navigation reaped from these establishments that more than a fourth of the English shipping is at present computed to be employed in carrying on the traffic with the American settlements Agriculture was anciently very imperfect in England The sudden transitions so often mentioned by historians from the lowest to the highest price of grain and the prodigious inequality of its value in different years are sufficient proofs that the produce depended entirely on the seasons and that art had as yet done nothing to fence against the injuries of the heavens During this reign considerable improvements were made as in most arts so in this the most beneficial of any A numerous catalogue might be formed of books and pamphlets treating of husbandry which were written about this time The nation however was still dependent on foreigners for daily bread and though its exportation of grain forms a considerable branch of its commerce notwithstanding its probable increase of people there was in that period a regular importation from the Baltic as well as from France and if it ever stopped the bad consequences were sensibly felt by the nation Sir Walter Raleigh in his Observations computes that two millions went out at one time for corn It was not till the fifth of Elizabeth that the exportation of corn had been allowed in England and Camden observes that agriculture from that moment received new life and vigor The endeavors of James or more properly speaking those of the nation for promoting trade were attended with greater success than those for the encouragement of learning Though the age was by no means destitute of eminent writers a very bad taste in general prevailed during that period and the monarch himself was not a little infected with it On the origin of letters among the Greeks the genius of poets and orators as might naturally be expected was distinguished by an amiable simplicity which whatever rudeness may sometimes attend it is so fitted to express the genuine movements of nature and passion that the compositions possessed of it must ever appear valuable to the discerning part of mankind The glaring figures of discourse the pointed antithesis the unnatural conceit the jingle of words such false ornaments were not employed by early writers not because they were rejected but because they scarcely ever occurred to them An easy unforced strain of sentiment runs through their compositions though at the same time we may observe that amidst the most elegant simplicity of thought and expression one is sometimes surprised to meet with a poor conceit which had presented itself unsought for and which the author had not acquired critical observation enough to condemn The name of Polynices one of OEdipus s sons means in the original much quarrelling In the altercations between the two brothers in AEschylus Sophocles and Euripides this conceit is employed and it is remarkable that so poor a conundrum could not be rejected by any of these three poets so justly celebrated for their taste and simplicity What could Shakspeare have done worse Terence has his inceptio est amentium non amanthim Many similar instances will occur to the learned It is well known that Aristotle treats very seriously of puns divides them into several classes and recommends the use of them to orators A bad taste seizes with avidity these frivolous beauties and even perhaps a good taste ere surfeited by them they multiply every day more and more in the fashionable compositions nature and good sense are neglected labored ornaments studied and admired and a total degeneracy of style and language prepares the way for barbarism and ignorance Hence the Asiatic manner was found to depart so much from the simple purity of Athens hence that tinsel eloquence which is observable in many of the Roman writers from which Cicero himself is not wholly exempted and which so much prevails in Ovid Seneca Lucan Martial and the Plinys On the revival of letters when the judgment of the public is yet raw and unformed this false glitter catches the eye and leaves no room either in eloquence or poetry for the durable beauties of solid sense and lively passion The reigning genius is then diametrically opposite to that which prevails on the first origin of arts The Italian writers it is evident even the most celebrated have not reached the proper simplicity of thought and composition and in Petrarch Tasso Guarini frivolous witticisms and forced conceits are but too predominant The period during which letters were cultivated in Italy was so short as scarcely to allow leisure for correcting this adulterated relish The more early French writers are liable to the same reproach Voiture Balzac even Coraeneille have too much affected those ambitious ornaments of which the Italians in general and the least pure of the ancients supplied them with so many models And it was not till late that observation and reflection gave rise to a more natural turn of thought and composition among that elegant people A like character may be extended to the first English writers such as flourished during the reigns of Elizabeth and James and even till long afterwards Learning on its revival in this island was attired in the same unnatural garb which it wore at the time of its decay among the Greeks and Romans And what may be regarded as a misfortune the English writers were possessed of great genius before they were endowed with any degree of taste and by that means gave a kind of sanction to those forced turns and sentiments which they so much affected Their distorted conceptions and expressions are attended with such vigor of mind that we admire the imagination which produced them as much as we blame the want of judgment which gave them admittance To enter into an exact criticism of the writers of that age would exceed our present purpose A short character of the most eminent delivered with the same freedom which history exercises over kings and ministers may not be improper The national prepossessions which prevail will perhaps render the former liberty not the least perilous for an author If Shakspeare be considered as a man born in a rude age and educated in the lowest manner without any instruction either from the world or from books he may be regarded as a prodigy if represented as a poet capable of furnishing a proper entertainment to a refined or intelligent audience we must abate much of this eulogy In his compositions we regret that many irregularities and even absurdities should so frequently disfigure the animated and passionate scenes intermixed with them and at the same time we perhaps admire the more those beauties on account of their being surrounded with such deformities A striking peculiarity of sentiment adapted to a singular character he frequently hits as it were by inspiration but a reasonable propriety of thought he cannot for any time uphold Nervous and picturesque expressions as well as descriptions abound in him but it is in vain we look either for purity or simplicity of diction His total ignorance of all theatrical art and conduct however material a defect yet as it affects the spectator rather than the reader we can more easily excuse than that want of taste which often prevails in his productions and which gives way only by intervals to the irradiations of genius A great and fertile genius he certainly possessed and one enriched equally with a tragic and comic vein but he ought to be cited as a proof how dangerous it is to rely on these advantages alone for attaining an excellence in the finer arts And there may even remain a suspicion that we overrate if possible the greatness of his genius in the same manner as bodies often appear more gigantic on account of their being disproportioned and misshapen He died in sixteen sixteen aged fifty three years Invenire etiam barbari solent disponere et ornare non nisi eruditus PLIN Jonson possessed all the learning which was wanting to Shakspeare and wanted all the genius of which the other was possessed Both of them were equally deficient in taste and elegance in harmony and correctness A servile copyist of the ancients Jonson translated into bad English the beautiful passages of the Greek and Roman authors without accommodating them to the manners of his age and country His merit has been totally eclipsed by that of Shakspeare whose rude genius prevailed over the rude art of his contemporary The English theatre has ever since taken a strong tincture of Shakspeare s spirit and character and thence it has proceeded that the nation has undergone from all its neighbors the reproach of barbarism from which its valuable productions in some other parts of learning would otherwise have exempted it Jonson had a pension of a hundred marks from the king which Charles afterwards augmented to a hundred pounds He died in sixteen thirty seven aged sixty three Fairfax has translated Tasso with an elegance and ease and at the same time with an exactness which for that age are surprising Each line in the original is faithfully rendered by a correspondent line in the translation Harrington s translation of Ariosto is not likewise without its merit It is to be regretted that these poets should have imitated the Italians in their stanza which has a prolixity and uniformity in it that displeases in long performances They had otherwise as well as Spenser who went before them contributed much to the polishing and refining of the English versification In Donne s satires when carefully inspected there appear some flashes of wit and ingenuity but these totally suffocated and buried by the harshest and most uncouth expression that is any where to be met with If the poetry of the English was so rude and imperfect during that age we may reasonably expect that their prose would be liable to still greater objections Though the latter appears the more easy as it is the more natural method of composition it has ever in practice been found the more rare and difficult and there scarcely is an instance in any language that it has reached a degree of perfection before the refinement of poetical numbers and expression English prose during the reign of James was written with little regard to the rules of grammar and with a total disregard to the elegance and harmony of the period Stuffed with Latin sentences and quotations it likewise imitated those inversions which however forcible and graceful in the ancient languages are entirely contrary to the idiom of the English I shall indeed venture to affirm that whatever uncouth phrases and expressions occur in old books they were chiefly owing to the unformed taste of the author and that the language spoken in the courts of Elizabeth and James was very little different from that which we meet with at present in good company Of this opinion the little scraps of speeches which are found in the parliamentary journals and which carry all air so opposite to the labored rations seem to be a sufficient proof and there want not productions of that age which being written by men who were not authors by profession retain a very natural manner and may give us some idea of the language which prevailed among men of the world I shall particularly mention Sir John Davis s Discovery Throgmorton s Essex s and Nevil s letters In a more early period Cavendish s life of Cardinal Wolsey the pieces that remain of Bishop Gardiner and Anne Boleyn s letter to the king differ little or nothing from the language of our time The great glory of literature in this island during the reign of James was Lord Bacon Most of his performances were composed in Latin though he possessed neither the elegance of that nor of his native tongue If we consider the variety of talents displayed by this man as a public speaker a man of business a wit a courtier a companion an author a philosopher he is justly the object of great admiration If we consider him merely as an author and philosopher the light in which we view him at present though very estimable he was yet inferior to his contemporary Galilaeo perhaps even to Kepler Bacon pointed out at a distance the road to true philosophy Galilaeo both pointed it out to others and made himself considerable advances in it The Englishman was ignorant of geometry the Florentine revived that science excelled in it and was the first that applied it together with experiment to natural philosophy The former rejected with the most positive disdain the system of Copernicus the latter fortified it with new proofs derived both from reason and the senses Bacon s style is stiff and rigid his wit though often brilliant is also often unnatural and far fetched and he seems to be the original of those pointed similes and long spun allegories which so much distinguish the English authors Galilaeo is a lively and agreeable though somewhat a prolix writer But Italy not united in any single government and perhaps satiated with that literary glory which it has possessed both in ancient and modern times has too much neglected the renown which it has acquired by giving birth to so great a man That national spirit which prevails among the English and which forms their great happiness is the cause why they bestow on all their eminent writers and on Bacon among the rest such praises and acclamations as may often appear partial and excessive He died in sixteen twenty six in the sixty sixth year of his life If the reader of Raleigh s history can have the patience to wade through the Jewish and rabbinical learning which compose the half of the volume he will find when he comes to the Greek and Roman story that his pains are not unrewarded Raleigh is the best model of that ancient style which some writers would affect to revive at present He was beheaded in sixteen eighteen aged sixty six years Camden s history of Queen Elizabeth may be esteemed good composition both for style and matter It is written with simplicity of expression very rare in that age and with a regard to truth It would not perhaps be too much to affirm that it is among the best historical productions which have yet been composed by any Englishman It is well known that the English have not much excelled in that kind of literature He died in sixteen twenty three aged seventy three years We shall mention the king himself at the end of these English writers because that is his place when considered as an author It may safely be affirmed that the mediocrity of James s talents in literature joined to the great change in national taste is one cause of that contempt under which his memory labors and which is often carried by party writers to a great extreme It is remarkable how different from ours were the sentiments of the ancients with regard to learning Of the first twenty Roman emperors counting from Caesar to Severus above the half were authors and though few of them seem to have been eminent in that profession it is always remarked to their praise that by their example they encouraged literature Not to mention Germanicus and his daughter Agrippina persons so nearly allied to the throne the greater part of the classic writers whose works remain were men of the highest quality As every human advantage is attended with inconveniencies the change of men s ideas in this particular may probably be ascribed to the invention of printing which has rendered books so common that even men of slender fortunes can have access to them That James was but a middling writer may be allowed that he was a contemptible one can by no means be admitted Whoever will read his Basilicon Doron particularly the two last books the true law of free monarchies his answer to Cardinal Perron and almost all his speeches and messages to parliament will confess him to have possessed no mean genius If he wrote concerning witches and apparitions who in that age did not admit the reality of these fictitious beings If he has composed a commentary on the Revelations and proved the pope to be Antichrist may not a similar reproach be extended to the famous Napier and even to Newton at a time when learning was much more advanced than during the reign of James From the grossness of its superstitions we may infer the ignorance of an age but never should pronounce concerning the folly of an individual from his admitting popular errors consecrated by the appearance of religion Such a superiority do the pursuits of literature possess above every other occupation that even he who attains but a mediocrity in them merits the preeminence above those that excel the most in the common and vulgar professions The speaker of the house of commons is usually an eminent lawyer yet the harangue of his majesty will always be found much superior to that of the speaker in every parliament during this reign Every science as well as polite literature must be considered as being yet in its infancy Scholastic learning and polemical divinity retarded the growth of all true knowledge Sir Henry Saville in the preamble of that deed by which he annexed a salary to the mathematical and astronomical professors in Oxford says that geometry was almost totally abandoned and unknown in England The best learning of that age was the study of the ancients Casaubon eminent for this species of knowledge was invited over from France by James and encouraged by a pension of three hundred pounds a year as well as by church preferments The famous Antonio di Dominis archbishop of Spalatro no despicable philosopher came likewise into England and afforded great triumph to the nation by their gaining so considerable a proselyte from the Papists But the mortification followed soon after the archbishop though advanced to some ecclesiastical preferments received not encouragement sufficient to satisfy his ambition he made his escape into Italy where he died in confinement Rymer tom xvii p two hundred seventeen Rymer tom xvii p seven hundred nine Rymer tom xvii p ninety six NOTES Footnote one NOTE A p ten The parliament also granted the queen the duties of tonnage and poundage but this concession was at that time regarded only as a matter of form and she had levied these duties before they were voted by parliament But there was another exertion of power which she practiced and which people in the present age from their ignorance of ancient practices may be apt to think a little extraordinary Her sister after the commencement of the war with France had from her own authority imposed four marks on each tun of wine imported and had increased the poundage a third on all commodities Queen Elizabeth continued these impositions as long as she thought convenient The parliament who had so good an opportunity of restraining these arbitrary taxes when they voted the tonnage and poundage thought not proper to make any mention of them They knew that the sovereign during that age pretended to have the sole regulation of foreign trade and that their intermeddling with that prerogative would have drawn on them the severest reproof if not chastisement See Forbes vol i p one hundred thirty two one hundred thirty three We know certainly from the statutes and journals that no such impositions were granted by parliament Footnote two NOTE B p twenty Knox p one hundred twenty seven We shall suggest afterwards some reasons to suspect that perhaps no express promise was ever given Calumnies easily arise during times of faction especially those of the religious kind when men think every art lawful for promoting their purpose The congregation in their manifesto in which they enumerate all the articles of the regent s mal administration do not reproach her with this breach of promise It was probably nothing but a rumor spread abroad to catch the populace If the Papists have sometimes maintained that no faith was to be kept with heretics their adversaries seem also to have thought that no truth ought to be told of idolaters Footnote three NOTE C p twenty three Spotswood p one hundred forty six Melvil p twenty nine Knox p two hundred twenty five two hundred twenty eight Lesley lib That there was really no violation of the capitulation of Perth appears from the manifesto of the congregation in Knox p one hundred eighty four in which it is not so much as pretended The companies of Scotch soldiers were probably in Scotch pay since the congregation complains that the country was oppressed with taxes to maintain armies Knox p one hundred sixty four one hundred sixty five And even if they had been in French pay it had been no breach of the capitulation since they were national troops not French Knox does not say p one hundred thirty nine that any of the inhabitants of Perth were tried or punished for their past offences but only that they were oppressed with the quartering of soldiers and the congregation in their manifesto say only that many of them had fled for fear This plain detection of the calumny with regard to the breach of the capitulation of Perth may make us suspect a like calumny with regard to the pretended promise not to give sentence against the ministers The affair lay altogether between the regent and the laird of Dun and that gentleman though a man of sense and character might be willing to take some general professions for promises If the queen overawed by the power of the congregation gave such a promise in order to have liberty to proceed to a sentence how could she expect to have power to execute a sentence so insidiously obtained And to what purpose could it serve Footnote four NOTE D p twenty four Knox p one hundred fifty three one hundred fifty four one hundred fifty five This author pretends that this article was agreed to verbally but that the queen s scribes omitted it in the treaty which was signed The story is very unlikely or rather very absurd and in the mean time it is allowed that the article is not in the treaty nor do the congregation in their subsequent manifesto insist upon it Knox p one hundred eighty four Besides would the queen regent in an article of a treaty call her own religion idolatry Footnote five NOTE E p twenty five The Scotch lords in their declaration say How far we have sought support of England or of any other prince and what just cause we had and have so to do we shall shortly make manifest unto the world to the praise of God s holy name and to the confusion of fell those that slander us for so doing for this we fear not to confess that as in this enterprise against the devil against idolatry and the maintainers of the same we chiefly and only seek God s glory to be notified unto men sin to be punished and virtue to be maintained so where power faileth of ourselves we will seek it wheresoever God shall offer the same Knox p one hundred seventy six Footnote six NOTE F p sixty one This year the council of Trent was dissolved which had sitten from fifteen forty five The publication of its decrees excited anew the general ferment in Europe while the Catholics endeavored to enforce the acceptance of them and the Protestants rejected them The religious controversies were too far advanced to expect that any conviction would result from the decrees of this council It is the only general council which has been held in an age truly learned and inquisitive and as the history of it has been written with great penetration and Judgment it has tended very much to expose clerical usurpations and intrigues and may serve us as a specimen of more ancient councils No one expects to see another general council till the decay of learning and the progress of ignorance shall again fit mankind for these great impostures Footnote seven NOTE G p sixty nine It appears however from Randolfs Letters see Keith p two hundred that some offers had been made to that minister of seizing Lenox and Darnley and delivering them into Queen Elizabeth s hands Melvil confirms the same story and says that the design was acknowledged by the conspirators p fifty six This serves to justify the account given by the queen s party of the Raid of Baith as it is called See farther Goodall vol ii p three hundred fifty eight The other conspiracy of which Murray complained is much more uncertain and is founded on very doubtful evidence Footnote eight NOTE H p seventy three Buchanan confesses that Rizzio was ugly but it may be inferred from the narration of that author that he was young He says that on the return of the duke of Savoy to Turin Rizzio was in adolescentiae vigore in the vigor of youth Now that event happened only a few years before lib xvii cap forty four That Bothwell was young appears among many other invincible proofs from Mary s instructions to the bishop of Dumblain her ambassador at Paris where she says that in fifteen fifty nine only eight years before he was very young He might therefore have been about thirty when he married her See Keith s History p three hundred eighty eight From the appendix to the Epistolae Regum Scotorum it appears by authentic documents that Patrick earl of Bothwell father to James who espoused Queen Mary was alive till near the year fifteen sixty Buchanan by a mistake which has been long ago corrected calls him James Footnote nine NOTE I p eighty four Mary herself confessed in her instructions to the ambassadors whom she sent to France that Bothwell persuaded all the noblemen that their application in favor of his marriage was agreeable to her Keith p three hundred eighty nine Anderson vol i p ninety four Murray afterwards produced to Queen Elizabeth s commissioners a paper signed by Mary by which she permitted them to make this application to her This permission was a sufficient declaration of her intentions and was esteemed equivalent to a command Anderson vol iv p fifty nine They even asserted that the house in which they met was surrounded with armed men Goodall vol ii p one hundred forty one Footnote eleven NOTE K p one hundred eight Mary s complaints of the queen s partiality in admitting Murray to a conference was a mere pretext in order to break off the conference She indeed employs that reason in her order for that purpose see Goodall vol ii p one hundred eighty four but in her private letter her commissioners are directed to make use of that order to prevent her honor from being attacked Goodall vol ii p one hundred eighty three It was therefore the accusation only she was afraid of Murray was the least obnoxious of all her enemies He was abroad when her subjects rebelled and reduced her to captivity He had only accepted of the regency when voluntarily proffered him by the nation His being admitted to Queen Elizabeth s presence was therefore a very bad foundation for a quarrel or for breaking off the conference and was plainly a mere pretence Footnote twelve NOTE L p one hundred ten We shall not enter into a long discussion concerning the authenticity of these letters We shall only remark in general that the chief objections against them are that they are supposed to have passed through the earl of Morton s hands the least scrupulous of all Mary s enemies and that they are to the last degree indecent and even somewhat inelegant such as it is not likely she would write But to these presumptions we may oppose the following considerations one Though it be not difficult to counterfeit a subscription it is very difficult and almost impossible to counterfeit several pages so as to resemble exactly the handwriting of any person These letters were examined and compared with Mary s handwriting by the English privy council and by a great many of the nobility among whom were several partisans of that princess They might have been examined by the bishop of Ross Herreis and others of Mary s commissioners The regent must have expected that they would be very critically examined by them and had they not been able to stand that test he was only preparing a scene of confusion to himself Bishop Lesley expressly declines the comparing of the hands which he calls no legal proof Goodall vol ii p three hundred eighty nine two The letters are very long much longer than they needed to have been in order to serve the purposes of Mary s enemies a circumstance which increased the difficulty and exposed any forgery the more to the risk of a detection three They are not so gross and palpable as forgeries commonly are for they still left a pretext for Mary s friends to assert that their meaning was strained to make them appear criminal See Goodall vol ii p three hundred sixty one four There is a long contract of marriage said to be written by the earl of Huntley and signed by the queen before Bothwells acquittal Would Morton without any necessity have thus doubled the difficulties of the forgery and the danger of detection five The letters are indiscreet but such was apparently Mary s conduct at that time They are inelegant but they have a careless natural air like letters hastily written between familiar friends six They contain such a variety of particular circumstances as nobody could have thought of inventing especially as they must necessarily have afforded her many means of detection seven We have not the originals of the letters which were in French We have only a Scotch and Latin translation from the original and a French translation professedly done from the Latin Now it is remarkable that the Scotch translation is full of Gallicisms and is clearly a translation from a French original such as make fault faire des fautes make it seem that I believe faire semblant de le croire make brek faire breche this is my first journey c est ma premiere journee have you not desire to laugh n avez vous pas envie de rire the place will hold unto the

ordre a cela discharge your heart decharger votre coeur make gud watch faites bonne garde et cetera eight There is a conversation which she mentions between herself and the king one evening but Murray produced before the English commissioners the testimony of one Crawford a gentleman of the earl of Lenox who swore that the king on her departure from him gave him an account of the same conversation nine There seems very little reason why Murray and his associates should run the risk of such a dangerous forgery which must have rendered them infamous if detected since their cause from Mary s known conduct even without these letters was sufficiently good and justifiable ten Murray exposed these letters to the examination of persons qualified to judge of them the Scotch council the Scotch parliament Queen Elizabeth and her council who were possessed of a great number of Mary s genuine letters eleven He gave Mary herself an opportunity of refuting and exposing him if she had chosen to lay hold of it twelve The letters tally so well with all the other parts of her conduct during that transaction that these proofs throw the strongest light on each other thirteen The duke of Norfolk who had examined these papers and who favored so much the queen of Scots that he intended to marry her and in the end lost his life in her cause yet believed them authentic and was fully convinced of her guilt This appears not only from his letters above mentioned to Queen Elizabeth and her ministers but by his secret acknowledgment to Bannister his most trusty confidant See State Trials vol i p eighty one In the conferences between the duke Secretary Lidington and the bishop of Ross all of them zealous partisans of that princess the same thing is always taken for granted Ibid p seventy four seventy five See further MS in the Advocates library A three twenty eight p three hundred fourteen from Cott lib Calig c nine Indeed the duke s full persuasion of Mary s guilt without the least doubt or hesitation could not have had place if he had found Lidington or the bishop of Ross of a different opinion or if they had ever told him that these letters were forged It is to be remarked that Lidington being one of the accomplices knew the whole bottom of the conspiracy against King Henry and was besides a man of such penetration that nothing could escape him in such interesting events fourteen I need not repeat the presumption drawn from Mary s refusal to answer The only excuse for her silence is that she suspected Elizabeth to be a partial judge It was not indeed the interest of that princess to acquit and justify her rival and competitor and we accordingly find that Lidington from the secret information of the Duke of Norfolk informed Mary by the bishop of Ross that the queen of England never meant to come to a decision but only to get into her hands the proofs of Mary s guilt in order to blast her character See State Trials vol i p seventy seven But this was a better reason for declining the conference altogether than for breaking it off on frivolous pretences the very moment the chief accusation was unexpectedly opened against her Though she could not expect Elizabeth s final decision in her favor it was of importance to give a satisfactory answer if she had any to the accusation of the Scotch commissioners That answer could have been dispersed for the satisfaction of the public of foreign nations and of posterity And surely after the accusation and proofs were in Queen Elizabeth s hands it could do no harm to give in the answers Mary s information that the queen never intended to come to a decision could be no obstacle to her justification fifteen The very disappearance of these letters is a presumption of their authenticity That event can be accounted for no way but from the care of King James s friends who were desirous to destroy every proof of his mother s crimes The disappearance of Morton s narrative and of Crawford s evidence from the Cotton library Calig c I must have proceeded from a like cause See MS in the Advocates library A three twenty nine p eighty eight I find an objection made to the authenticity of the letters drawn from the vote of the Scotch privy council which affirms the letters to be written and subscribed by Queen Mary s own hand whereas the copies given in to the parliament a few days after were only written not subscribed See Goodall vol ii p sixty four sixty seven But it is not considered that this circumstance is of no manner of force There were certainly letters true or false laid before the council and whether the letters were true or false this mistake proceeds equally from the inaccuracy or blunder of the clerk The mistake may be accounted for the letters were only written by her the second contract with Bothwell was only subscribed A proper accurate distinction was not made and they are all said to be written and subscribed A late writer mister Goodall has endeavored to prove that these letters clash with chronology and that the queen was not in the places mentioned in the letters on the days there assigned To confirm this he produces charters and other deeds signed by the queen where the date and place do not agree with the letters But it is well known that the date of charters and such like grants is no proof of the real day on which they were signed by the sovereign Papers of that kind commonly pass through different offices The date is affixed by the first office and may precede very long the day of the signature The account given by Morton of the manner in which the papers came into his hands is very natural When he gave it to the English commissioners he had reason to think it would be canvassed with all the severity of able adversaries interested in the highest degree to refute it It is probable that he could have confirmed it by many circumstances and testimonies since they declined the contest The sonnets are inelegant insomuch that both Brantome and Bonsard who knew Queen Mary s style were assured when they saw them that they could not be of her composition Jebb voL ii p four hundred seventy eight But no person is equal in his productions especially one whose style is so little formed as Mary s must be supposed to be Not to mention that such dangerous and criminal enterprises leave little tranquillity of mind for elegant poetical compositions In a word Queen Mary might easily have conducted the whole conspiracy against her husband without opening her mind to any one person except Bothwell and without writing a scrap of paper about it but it was very difficult to have conducted it so that her conduct should not betray her to men of discernment In the present case her conduct was so gross as to betray her to every body and fortune threw into her enemies hands papers by which they could convict her The same infatuation and imprudence which happily is the usual attendant of great crimes will account for both It is proper to observe that there is not one circumstance of the foregoing narrative contained in the history that is taken from Knox Buchanan or even Thuanus or indeed from any suspected authority Footnote thirteen NOTE M p one hundred eleven Unless we take this angry accusation advanced by Queen Mary to be an argument of Murray s guilt there remains not the least presumption which should lead us to suspect him to have been anywise an accomplice in the king s murder That queen never pretended to give any proof of the charge and her commissioners affirmed at the time that they themselves knew of none though they were ready to maintain its truth by their mistress s orders and would produce such proof as she should send them It is remarkable that at that time it was impossible for either her or them to produce any proof because the conferences before the English commissioners were previously broken off It is true the bishop of Ross in an angry pamphlet written by him under a borrowed name where it is easy to say any thing affirms that Lord Herreis a few days after the king s death charged Murray with the guilt openly to his face at his own table This latter nobleman as Lesley relates the matter affirmed that Murray riding in Fife with one of his servants the evening before the commission of that crime said to him among other talk This night ere morning the Lord Darnley shall lose his life See Anderson vol i p seventy five But this is only a hearsay of Lesley s concerning a hearsay of Herreis s and contains a very improbable fact Would Murray without any use or necessity communicate to a servant such a dangerous and important secret merely by way of conversation We may also observe that Lord Herreis himself was one of Queen Mary s commissioners who accused Murray Had he ever heard this story or given credit to it was not that the time to have produced it and not have affirmed as he did that he for his part knew nothing of Murray s guilt See Goodall vol ii p three hundred seven The earls of Huntley and Argyle accuse Murray of this crime but the reason which they assign is ridiculous He had given his consent to Mary s divorce from the king therefore he was the king s murderer See Anderson vol iv part two p one hundred ninety two It is a sure argument that these earls knew no better proof against Murray otherwise they would have produced it and not have insisted on so absurd a presumption Was not this also the time for Huntley to deny his writing Mary s contract with Bothwell if that paper had been a forgery Murray could have no motive to commit that crime The king indeed bore him some ill will but the king himself was become so despicable both from his own ill conduct and the queen s aversion to him that he could neither do good nor harm to any body To judge by the event in any case is always absurd especially in the present The king s murder indeed procured Murray the regency but much more Mary s ill conduct and imprudence which he could not possibly foresee and which never would have happened had she been entirely innocent Footnote fourteen NOTE N p one hundred eleven I believe there is no reader of common sense who does not see from the narrative in the text that the author means to say that Queen Mary refuses constantly to answer before the English commissioners but offers only to answer in person before Queen Elizabeth in person contrary to her practice during the whole course of the conference till the moment the evidence of her being an accomplice in her husband s murder is unexpectedly produced It is true the author having repeated four or five times an account of this demand of being admitted to Elizabeth s presence and having expressed his opinion that as it had been refused from the beginning even before the commencement of the conferences she did not expect it would now be complied with thought it impossible his meaning could be misunderstood as indeed it was impossible and not being willing to tire his reader with continual repetitions he mentions in a passage or two simply that she had refused to make any answer I believe also there is no reader of common sense who peruses Anderson or Goodall s collections and does not see that agreeably to this narrative Queen Mary insists unalterably and strenuously on not continuing to answer before the English commissioners but insists to be heard in person by Queen Elizabeth in person though once or twice by way of bravado she says simply that she will answer and refute her enemies without inserting this condition which still is understood But there is a person that has written an Inquiry historical and critical into the Evidence against Mary Queen of Scots and has attempted to refute the foregoing narrative He quotes a single passage of the narrative in which Mary is said simply to refuse answering and then a single passage from Goodall in which she boasts simply that she will answer and he very civilly and almost directly calls the author a liar on account of this pretended contradiction That whole Inquiry from beginning to end is composed of such scandalous artifices and from this instance the reader may judge of the candor fair dealing veracity and good manners of the inquirer There are indeed three events in our history which may be regarded as touchstones of party men An English whig who asserts the reality of the Popish plot an Irish Catholic who denies the massacre in sixteen forty one and a Scotch Jacobite who maintains the innocence of Queen Mary must be considered as men beyond the reach of argument or reason and must be left to their prejudices Footnote fifteen NOTE O p one hundred twenty nine By Murden s state papers published after the writing of this history it appears that an agreement had been made between Elizabeth and the regent for the delivering up of Mary to him The queen afterwards sent down Killigrew to the earl of Marre when regent offering to put Mary into his hands Killigrew was instructed to take good security from the regent that that queen should be tried for her crimes and that the sentence should be executed upon her It appears that Marre rejected the offer because we hear no more of it Footnote sixteen NOTE P p one hundred thirty Sir James Melvil p one hundred eight one hundred nine ascribes to Elizabeth a positive design of animating the Scotch factions against each other but his evidence is too inconsiderable to counterbalance many other authorities and is indeed contrary to her subsequent conduct as well as her interest and the necessity of her situation It was plainly her interest that the king s party should prevail and nothing could have engaged her to stop their progress or even forbear openly assisting them but her intention of still amusing the queen of Scots by the hopes of being peaceably restored to her throne See further Strype vol ii Append p twenty Footnote seventeen NOTE Q p one hundred eighty seven That the queen s negotiations for marrying the duke of Anjou were not feigned nor political appears clearly from many circumstances particularly from a passage in doctor Forbes s manuscript collections at present in the possession of Lord Royston She there enjoins Walsingham before he opens the treaty to examine the person of the duke and as that prince had lately recovered from the small pox she desires her ambassador to consider whether he yet retained so much of his good looks as that a woman could fix her affections on him Had she not been in earnest and had she only meant to amuse the public or the court of France this circumstance was of no moment Footnote eighteen NOTE R p two hundred three D Ewes p three hundred twenty eight The Puritanical sect had indeed gone so far that a book of discipline was secretly subscribed by above five hundred clergymen and the Presbyterian government thereby established in the midst of the church notwithstanding the rigor of the prelates and of the high commission So impossible is it by penal statutes however severe to suppress all religious innovation See Neal s Hist of the Puritans vol i p four hundred eighty three Strype s Life of Whitgift p two hundred ninety one Footnote nineteen NOTE S p two hundred five This year the earl of Northumberland brother to the earl beheaded some years before had been engaged in a conspiracy with Lord Paget for the deliverance of the queen of Scots He was thrown into the Tower and being conscious that his guilt could be proved upon him at least that sentence would infallibly be pronounced against him he freed himself from further prosecution by a voluntary death He shot himself in the breast with a pistol About the same time the earl of Arundel son of the unfortunate duke of Norfolk having entered into some exceptionable measures and reflecting en the unhappy fate which had attended his family endeavored to depart secretly beyond sea but was discovered and thrown into the Tower In fifteen eighty seven this nobleman was brought to his trial for high treason chiefly because he had dropped some expressions of affection to the Spaniards and had affirmed that he would have masses said for the success of the armada His peers found him guilty of treason This severe sentence was not executed but Arundel never recovered his liberty He died a prisoner in fifteen ninety five He carried his religious austerities so far that they were believed the immediate cause of his death Footnote twenty NOTE T p two hundred sixteen Mary s extreme animosity against Elizabeth may easily be conceived and it broke out about this tune in an incident which may appear curious While the former queen was kept in custody by the earl of Shrewsbury she lived during a long time in great intimacy with the countess but that lady entertaining a jealousy of an amour between her and the earl their friendship was converted into enmity and Mary took a method of revenge which at once gratified her spite against the countess and that against Elizabeth She wrote to the queen informing her of all the malicious scandalous stories which she said the countess of Shrewsbury had reported of her that Elizabeth had given a promise of marriage to a certain person whom she afterwards often admitted to her bed that she had been equally indulgent to Simier the French agent and to the duke of Anjou that Hatton was also one of her paramours who was even disgusted with her excessive love and fondness that though she was on other occasions avaricious to the last degree as well as ungrateful and kind to very few she spared no expense in gratifying her amorous passions that notwithstanding her licentious amours she was not made like other women and all those who courted her in marriage would in the end be disappointed that she was so conceited of her beauty as to swallow the most extravagant flattery from her courtiers who could not on these occasions forbear even sneering at her for her folly that it was usual for them to tell her that the lustre of Her beauty dazzled them like that of the sun and they could not behold it with a fixed eye She added that the countess had said that Mary s best policy would be to engage her son to make love to the queen nor was there any danger that such a proposal would be taken for mockery so ridiculous was the opinion which she had entertained of her own charms She pretended that the countess had represented her as no less odious in her temper than profligate in her manners and absurd in her vanity that she had so beaten a young woman of the name of Scudamore as to break that lady s finger and in order to cover over the matter it was pretended that the accident had proceeded from the fall of a candlestick that she had cut another across the hand with a knife who had been so unfortunate as to offend her Mary added that the countess had informed her that Elizabeth had suborned Rolstone to pretend friendship to her in order to debauch her and thereby throw infamy on her rival See Murden s State Papers p five hundred fifty eight This imprudent and malicious letter was written a very little before the detection of Mary s conspiracy and contributed no doubt to render the proceedings against her the more rigorous How far all these imputations against Elizabeth can be credited may perhaps appear doubtful but her extreme fondness for Leicester Hatton and Essex not to mention Mountjoy and others with the curious passages between her and Admiral Seymour contained in Haynes render her chastity very much to be suspected Her self conceit with regard to beauty we know from other undoubted authority to have been extravagant Even when she was a very old woman she allowed her courtiers to flatter her with regard to her excellent beauties Birch vol ii p four hundred forty two four hundred forty three Her passionate temper may also be proved from many lively instances and it was not unusual with her to beat her maids of honor See the Sidney Papers vol ii p thirty eight The blow she gave to Essex before the privy council is another instance There remains in the Museum a letter of the earl of Huntingdon s in which he complains grievously of the queen s pinching his wife very sorely on account of some quarrel between them Had this princess been born in a private station she would not have been very amiable but her absolute authority at the same time that it gave an uncontrolling swing to her violent passions enabled her to compensate her infirmities by many great and signal virtues Footnote twenty one NOTE U p two hundred twenty six Camden p five hundred twenty five This evidence was that of Curie her secretary whom she allowed to be a very honest man and who as well as Nau had given proofs of his integrity by keeping so long such important secrets from whose discovery he could have reaped the greatest profit Mary after all thought that she had so little reason to complain of Curie s evidence that she took care to have him paid a considerable sum by her will which she wrote the day before her death Goodall vol i p four hundred thirteen Neither did she forget Nau though less satisfied in other respects with his conduct Id ibid Footnote twenty four NOTE X p two hundred twenty six The detail of this conspiracy is to be found in a letter of the queen of Scots to Charles Paget her great confidant This letter is dated the twentieth of May fifteen eighty six and is contained in doctor Forbes s manuscript collections at present in the possession of Lord Royston It is a copy attested by Curie Mary s secretary and endorsed by Lord Burleigh What proves its authenticity beyond question is that we find in Murden s Collection p five hundred sixteen that Mary actually wrote that very day a letter to Charles Paget and further she mentions in the manuscript letter a letter of Charles Paget s of the tenth of April Now we find by Murden p five hundred six that Charles Paget did actually write her a letter of that date This violence of spirit is very consistent with Mary s character Her maternal affection was too weak to oppose the gratification of her passions particularly her pride her ambition and her bigotry Her son having made some fruitless attempts to associate her with him in the title and having found the scheme impracticable on account of the prejudices of his Protestant subjects at last desisted from that design and entered into an alliance with England without comprehending his mother She was in such a rage at this undutiful behavior as she imagined it that she wrote to Queen Elizabeth that she no longer cared what became of him or herself in the world the greatest satisfaction she could have before her death was to see him and all his adherents become a signal example of tyranny ingratitude and impiety and undergo the vengeance of God for their wickedness She would find in Christendom other heirs and doubted not to put her inheritance in such hands as would retain the firmest hold of it She cared not after taking this revenge what became of her body The quickest death would then be the most agreeable to her And she assured her that if he persevered she would disown him for her son would give him her malediction would disinherit him as well of his present possessions as of all he could expect by her abandoning him not only to her subjects to treat him as they had done her but to all strangers to subdue and conquer him It was in vain to employ menaces against her the fear of death or other misfortune would never induce her to make one step or pronounce one syllable beyond what she had determined She would rather perish with honor in maintaining the dignity to which God had raised her than degrade herself by the least pusillanimity or act what was unworthy of her station and of her race Murden p five hundred sixty six five hundred sixty seven James said to Courcelles the French ambassador that he had seen a letter under her own hand in which she threatened to disinherit him and said that he might betake him to the lordship of Darnley for that was all he had by his father Courcelles Letter a MS of doctor Campbell s There is in Jebb vol ii p five hundred seventy three a letter of hers where she throws out the same menace against him We find this scheme of seizing the king of Scots and delivering him into the hands of the pope or the king of Spain proposed by Morgan to Mary See Murden p five hundred twenty five A mother must be very violent to whom one would dare to make such a proposal but it seems she assented to it Was not such a woman very capable of murdering her husband who had so grievously offended her Footnote twenty five NOTE Y p two hundred twenty seven The volume of state papers collected by Murden prove beyond controversy that Mary was long in close correspondence with Babington p five hundred thirteen five hundred sixteen five hundred thirty two five hundred thirty three She entertained a like correspondence with Ballard Morgan and Charles Paget and laid a scheme with them for an insurrection and for the invasion of England by Spain p five hundred twenty eight thousand five hundred thirty one The same papers show that there had been a discontinuance of Babington s correspondence agreeably to Camden s narration See Slate Papers p five hundred thirteen where Morgan recommends it to Queen Mary to renew her correspondence with Babington These circumstances prove that no weight can be laid on Mary s denial of guilt and that her correspondence with Babington contained particulars which could not be avowed Footnote twenty six NOTE Z p two hundred twenty seven There are three suppositions by which the letter to Babington may be accounted for without allowing Mary s concurrence in the conspiracy for assassinating Elizabeth The first is that which she seems herself to have embraced that her secretaries had received Babington s letter and had without any treacherous intention ventured of themselves to answer it and had never communicated the matter to her But it is utterly improbable if not impossible that a princess of so much sense and spirit should in an affair of that importance be so treated by her servants who lived in the house with her and who had every moment an opportunity of communicating the secret to her If the conspiracy failed they must expect to suffer the severest punishment from the court of England if it succeeded the lightest punishment which they could hope for from their own mistress must be disgrace on account of their temerity Not to mention that Mary s concurrence was in some degree requisite for effecting the design of her escape It was proposed to attack her guards while she was employed in hunting she must therefore concert the time and place with the conspirators The second supposition is that these two secretaries were previously traitors and being gained by Walsingham had made such a reply in their mistress s cipher as might involve her in the guilt of the conspiracy But these two men had lived long with the queen of Scots had been entirely trusted by her and had never fallen under suspicion either with her or her partisans Camden informs us that Curle afterwards claimed a reward from Walsingham on pretence of some promise but Walsingham told him that he owed him no reward and that he had made no discoveries on his examination which were not known with certainty from other quarters The third supposition is that neither the queen nor the two secretaries Nau and Curle ever saw Babington s letter or made any answer but that Walsingham having deciphered the former forged a reply But this supposition implies the falsehood of the whole story told by Camden of Gifford s access to the queen of Scots family and Paulet s refusal to concur in allowing his servants to be bribed Not to mention that as Nau s and Curle s evidence must on this supposition have been extorted by violence and terror they would necessarily have been engaged for their own justification to have told the truth afterwards especially upon the accession of James But Camden informs us that Nau even after that event persisted still in his testimony We must also consider that the two last suppositions imply such a monstrous criminal conduct in Walsingham and consequently in Elizabeth for the matter could be no secret to her as exceeds all credibility If we consider the situation of things and the prejudices of the times Mary s consent to Babington s conspiracy appears much more natural and probable She believed Elizabeth to be a usurper and a heretic She regarded her as a personal and a violent enemy She knew that schemes for assassinating heretics were very familiar in that age and generally approved of by the court of Rome and the zealous Catholics Her own liberty and sovereignty were connected with the success of this enterprise and it cannot appear strange that where men of so much merit as Babington could be engaged by bigotry alone in so criminal an enterprise Mary who was actuated by the same motive joined to so many others should have given her consent to a scheme projected by her friends We may be previously certain that if such a scheme was ever communicated to her with any probability of success she would assent to it and it served the purpose of Walsingham and the English ministry to facilitate the communication of these schemes as soon as they had gotten an expedient for intercepting her answer and detecting the conspiracy Now Walsingham s knowledge of the matter is a supposition necessary to account for the letter delivered to Babington As to the not punishing of Nau and Curle by Elizabeth it never is the practice to punish lesser criminals who had given evidence against the principal But what ought to induce us to reject these three suppositions is that they must all of them be considered as bare possibilities The partisans of Mary can give no reason for preferring one to the other Not the slightest evidence ever appeared to support any one of them Neither at that time nor at any time afterwards was any reason discovered by the numerous zealots at home and abroad who had embraced Mary s defence to lead us to the belief of any of these three suppositions and even her apologists at present seem not to have fixed on any choice among these supposed possibilities The positive proof of two very credible witnesses supported by the other very strong circumstances still remains unimpeached Babington who had an extreme interest to have communication with the queen of Scots believed he had found a means of correspondence with her and had received an answer from her He as well as the other conspirators died in that belief There has not occurred since that time the least argument to prove that they were mistaken can there be any reason at present to doubt the truth of their opinion Camden though a professed apologist for Mary is constrained to tell the story in such a manner as evidently supposes her guilt Such was the impossibility of finding any other consistent account even by a man of parts who was a contemporary In this light might the question have appeared even during Mary s trial But what now puts her guilt beyond all controversy is the following passage of her letter to Thomas Morgan dated the twenty seventh of July fifteen eighty six As to Babington he hath both kindly and honestly offered himself and all his means to be employed any way I would whereupon I hope to have satisfied him by two of my several letters since I had his and the rather for that I opened him the way thereby I received his with your aforesaid Murden p five hundred thirty three Babington confessed that he had offered her to assassinate the queen It appears by this that she had accepted the offer so that all the suppositions of Walsingham s forgery or the temerity or treachery of her secretaries fall to the ground Footnote twenty seven NOTE AA p two hundred thirty one This parliament granted the queen a supply of a subsidy and two fifteenths They adjourned and met again after the execution of the queen of Scots when there passed some remarkable incidents which it may be proper not to omit We shall give them in the words of Sir Simon D Ewes p four hundred ten four hundred eleven which are almost wholly transcribed from Townshend s Journal On Monday the twenty seventh of February mister Cope first using some speeches touching the necessity of a learned ministry and the amendment of things amiss in the ecclesiastical estate offered to the house a bill and a book written the bill containing a petition that it might be enacted that all laws now in force touching ecclesiastical government should be void and that it might be enacted that the Book of Common Prayer now offered and none other might be received into the church to be used The book contained the form of prayer and administration of the sacraments with divers rites and ceremonies to be used in the church and he desired that the book might be read Whereupon mister Speaker in effect used this speech For that her majesty before this time had commanded the house not to meddle with this matter and that her majesty had promised to take order in those causes he doubted not but to the good satisfaction of all her people he desired that it would please them to spare the reading of it Notwithstanding the house desired the reading of it Whereupon mister Speaker desired the clerk to read And the court being ready to read it mister Dalton made a motion against the reading of it saying that it was not meet to be read and it did appoint a new form of administration of the sacraments and ceremonies of the church to the discredit of the Book of Common Prayer and of the whole state and thought that this dealing would bring her majesty s indignation against the house thus to enterprise this dealing with those things which her majesty especially had taken into her own charge and direction Whereupon mister Lewkenor spake showing the necessity of preaching and of a learned ministry and thought it very fit that the petition and book should be read To this purpose spake mister Hurleston and mister Bainbrigg and so the time being passed the house broke up and neither the petition nor book read This done her majesty sent to mister Speaker as well for this petition and book as for that other petition and book for the like effect that was delivered the last session of parliament which mister Speaker sent to her majesty On Tuesday the twenty eighth of February her majesty sent for mister Speaker by occasion whereof the house did not sit On Wednesday the first of March mister Wentworth delivered to mister Speaker certain articles which contained questions touching the liberties of the house and to some of which he was to answer and desired they might be read mister Speaker desired him to spare his motion until her majesty s pleasure was further known touching the petition and book lately delivered into the house but mister Wentworth would not be so satisfied but required his articles might be read mister Wentworth introduced his queries by lamenting that he as well as many others were deterred from speaking by their want of knowledge and experience in the liberties of the house and the queries were as follows Whether this council were not a place for any member of the same here assembled freely and without controlment of any person or danger of laws by bill or speech to utter any of the griefs of this commonwealth whatsoever touching the service of God the safety of the prince and this noble realm Whether that great honor may be done unto God and benefit and service unto the prince and state without free speech in this council that may be done with it Whether there be any council which can make add or diminish from the laws of the realm but only this council of parliament Whether it be not against the orders of this council to make any secret or matter of weight which is here in hand known to the prince or any other concerning the high service of God prince or state without the consent of the house Whether the speaker or any other may interrupt any member of this council in his speech used in this house tending to any of the forenamed services Whether the speaker may rise when he will any matter being propounded without consent of the house or not Whether the speaker may overrule the house in any matter or cause there in question or whether he is to be ruled or overruled in any matter or not Whether the prince and state can continue and stand and be maintained without this council of parliament not altering the government of the state At the end of these questions says Sir Simon D Ewes I found set down this short memorial ensuing by which it may be perceived both what Serjeant Puckering the speaker did with the said questions after he had received them and what became also of this business viz These questions mister Puckering pocketed up and showed Sir Thomas Henage who so handled the matter that mister Wentworth went to the Tower and the questions not at all moved mister Buckler of Essex herein brake his faith in forsaking the matter et cetera and no more was done After setting down continues Sir Simon D Ewes the said business of mister Wentworth in the original journal book there follows only this short conclusion of the day itself viz This day mister Speaker being sent for to the queen s majesty the house departed On Thursday the twod of March mister Cope mister Lewkenor mister Hurleston and mister Bainbrigg were sent for to my lord chancellor and by divers of the privy council and from thence were sent to the Tower On Saturday the fourth day of March Sir John Higham made a motion to this house for that divers good and necessary members thereof were taken from them that it would please them to be humble petitioners to her majesty for the restitution of them again to this house To which speeches mister Vice chamberlain answered that if the gentlemen were committed for matter within the compass of the privilege of the house then there might be a petition but if not then we should give occasion to her majesty s further displeasure and therefore advised to stay until they heard more which could not be long And further he said touching the book and the petition her majesty had for divers good causes best known to herself thought fit to suppress the same without any further examination thereof and yet thought it very unfit for her majesty to give any account of her doings But whatsoever mister Vice chamberlain pretended it is most probable these members were committed for intermeddling with matters touching the church which her majesty had often inhibited and which had caused so much disputation and so many meetings between the two houses the last parliament This is all we find of the matter in Sir Simon D Ewes and Townshend and it appears that those members who had been committed were detained in custody till the queen thought proper to release them These questions of mister Wentworth are curious because they contain some faint dawn of the present English constitution though suddenly eclipsed by the arbitrary government of Elizabeth Wentworth was indeed by his Puritanism as well as his love of liberty for these two characters of such unequal merit arose and advanced together the true forerunner of the Hambdens the Pyms and the Hollises who in the next age with less courage because with less danger rendered their principles so triumphant I shall only ask whether it be not sufficiently clear from all these transactions that in the two succeeding reigns it was the people who encroached upon the sovereign not the sovereign who attempted as is pretended to usurp upon the people Footnote twenty eight NOTE BB p two hundred fifty nine The queen s speech in the camp of Tilbury was in these words My loving people we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety to take heed how we commit ourselves to armed multitudes for fear of treachery but assure you I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people Let tyrants fear I have always so behaved myself that under God I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects And therefore I am come amongst you at this time not as for my recreation or sport but being resolved in the midst and heat of the battle to live or die amongst you all to lay down for my God and for my kingdom and for my people my honor and my blood even in the dust I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman but I have the heart of a king and of a king of England too and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain or any prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realms to which rather than any dishonor should grow by me I myself will take up arms I myself will be your general judge and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field I know already by your forwardness that you have deserved rewards and crowns and we do assure you on the word of a prince they shall be duly paid you In the mean time my lieutenant general shall be in my stead than whom never prince commanded a more noble and worthy subject not doubting by your obedience to my general by your concord in the camp and your valor in the field we shall shortly have a famous victory over those enemies of my God of my kingdom and of my people Footnote twenty nine NOTE CC p two hundred sixty four Strype vol iii p five hundred twenty five On the fourth of September boon after the dispersion of the Spanish armada died the earl of Leicester the queen s great but unworthy favorite Her affection for him continued to the last He had discovered no conduct in any of his military enterprises and was suspected of cowardice yet she intrusted him with the command of her armies during the danger of the Spanish invasion a partiality which might have proved fatal to her had the duke of Parma been able to land his troops in England She had even ordered a commission to be drawn for him constituting him her lieutenant in the kingdoms of England and Ireland but Burleigh and Hatton represented to her the danger of intrusting such unlimited authority in the hands of any subject and prevented the execution of that design No wonder that a conduct so unlike the usual jealousy of Elizabeth gave reason to suspect that her partiality was founded on some other passion than friendship But Elizabeth seemed to carry her affection to Leicester no farther than the grave she ordered his goods to be disposed of at a public sale in order to reimburse herself of some debt which he owed her and her usual attention to money was observed to prevail over her regard to the memory of the deceased This earl was a great hypocrite a pretender to the strictest religion an encourager of the Puritans and founder of hospitals Footnote thirty NOTE DD p two hundred sixty four Strype vol iii p five hundred forty two Id append p two hundred thirty nine There are some singular passages in this last speech which may be worth taking notice of especially as they came from a member who was no courtier for he argues against the subsidy And first says he for the necessity thereof I cannot deny but if it were a charge imposed upon us by her majesty s commandment or a demand proceeding from her majesty by way of request that I think there is not one among us all either so disobedient a subject in regard of our duty or so unthankful a man in respect of the inestimable benefits which by her or from her we have received which would not with frank consent both of voice and heart most willingly submit himself thereunto without any unreverend inquiry into the causes thereof For it is continually in the mouth of us all that our lands goods and lives are at our prince s disposing And it agreeth very well with that position of the civil law which sayeth Quod omnia regis aunt But how Ita tamen ut omnium sint Ad regem enim potestas omnium pertinet ad singulos proprietas So that although it be most true that her majesty hath over ourselves and our goods potestatem imperandi yet it is true that until that power command which no doubt will not command without very just cause every subject hath his own proprietatem possidendi Which power and commandment from her majesty which we have not yet received I take it saving reformation that we are freed from the cause of necessity And the cause of necessity is the dangerous estate of the commonwealth et cetera The tenor of the speech pleads rather for a general benevolence than a subsidy for the law of Richard III against benevolence was nevei conceived to have any force The member even proceeds to assert with some precaution that it was in the power of parliament to refuse the king s demand of a subsidy and that there was an instance of that liberty in Heary III s time near four hundred years before Sub Fine Footnote thirty one NOTE EE p two hundred sixty six We may judge of the extent and importance of these abuses by a speech of Bacon s against purveyors delivered in the first session of the first parliament of the subsequent reign by which also we may learn that Elizabeth had given no redress to the grievances complained of First says he they take in kind what they ought not to take secondly they take in quantity a far greater proportion than cometh to your majesty s use thirdly they take in an unlawful manner in a manner I say directly and expressly prohibited by the several laws For the first I am a little to alter their name for in stead of takers they become taxers Instead of taking provisions for your majesty s service they tax your people ad redimendam vexationem imposing upon them and extorting from them divers sums of money sometimes in gross sometimes in the nature of stipends annually paid ne noceant to be freed and eased of their oppression Again they take trees which by law they cannot do timber trees which are the beauty countenance and shelter of men s houses that men have long spared from their own purse and profit that men esteem for their use and delight above ten times the value that are a loss which men cannot repair or recover These do they take to the defacing and spoiling of your subjects mansions and dwellings except they may be compounded with to their own appetites And if a gentleman be too hard for them while he is at home they will watch their time when there is but a bailiff or a servant remaining and put the axe to the root of the tree ere even the master can stop it Again they use a strange and most unjust exaction in causing the subjects to pay poundage of their own debts due from your majesty unto them so as a poor man when he has had his hay or his wood or his poultry which perchance he was full loath to part with and had for the provision of his own family and not to put to sale taken from him and that not at a just price but under the value and cometh to receive his money he shall have after the rate of twelve pence in the pound abated for poundage of his due payment upon so hard conditions Nay further they are grown to that extremity as is affirmed though it be scarce credible save that in such persons all things are credible that they will take double poundage once when the debenture is made and again the second time when the money is paid For the second point most gracious sovereign touching the quantity which they take far above that which is answered to your majesty s use it is affirmed unto me by divers gentlemen of good report as a matter which I may safely avouch unto your majesty that there is no pound profit which redoundeth unto your majesty in this course but induceth and begetteth three pound damage upon your subjects beside the discontentment And to the end they may make their spoil more securely what do they Whereas divers statutes do strictly provide that whatsoever they take shall De registered and attested to the end that by making a collation of that which is taken from the country and that which is answered above their deceits might appear they to the end to obscure their deceits utterly omit the observation of this which the law prescribeth And therefore to descend if it may please your majesty to the third sort of abuse which is of the unlawful manner of their taking whereof this question is a branch it is so manifold as it rather asketh an enumeration of some of the particulars than a prosecution of all For their price by law they ought to take as they can agree with the subject by abuse they take at an imposed and enforced price By law they ought to take but one apprizement by neighbors in the country by abuse they make a second apprizement at the court gate and when the subjects cattle come up many miles lean and out of plight by reason of their travel then they prize them anew at an abated price By law they ought to take between sun and sun by abuse they take by twilight and in the night time a time well chosen for malefactors By law they ought not to take in the highways a place by her majesty s high prerogative protected and by statute by special words excepted by abuse they take in the highways By law they ought to show their commission et cetera A number of other particulars there are et cetera Bacon s Works vol iv p three hundred five three hundred six Such were the abuses which Elizabeth would neither permit her parliaments to meddle with nor redress herself I believe it will readily be allowed that this slight prerogative alone which has passed almost unobserved amidst other branches of so much greater importance was sufficient to extinguish all regular liberty For what elector or member of parliament or even juryman durst oppose the will of the court while he lay under the lash of such an arbitrary prerogative For a further account of the grievous and incredible oppressions of purveyors see the Journals of the house of commons vol i p one hundred ninety There is a story of a carter which may be worth mentioning on this occasion A carter had three times been at Windsor with his cart to carry away upon summons of a remove some part of the stuff of her majesty s wardrobe and when he had repaired thither once twice and the third time and that they of the wardrobe had told him the third time that the remove held not the carter slapping his hand on his thigh said Now I see that the queen is a woman as well as my wife which words being overheard by her majesty who then stood at the window she said What a villain is this and so sent him three angels to stop his mouth Birch s Memoirs vol i p one hundred fifty five Footnote thirty two NOTE FF p two hundred seventy four This year the nation suffered a great loss by the death of Sir Francis Walsingham secretary of state a man equally celebrated for his abilities and his integrity He had passed through many employments had been very frugal in his expense yet died so poor that his family was obliged to give him a private burial He left only one daughter first married to Sir Philip Sidney then to the earl of Essex favorite of Queen Elizabeth and lastly to the earl of Clanriearde of Ireland The same year died Thomas Randolph who had been employed by the queen in several embassies to Scotland as did also the earl of Warwick elder brother to Leicester Footnote thirty three NOTE GO p two hundred seventy six This action of Sir Richard Greenville is so singular as to merit a more particular relation He was engaged alone with the whole Spanish fleet of fifty three sail which had ten thousand men on board and from the time the fight began which was about three in the afternoon to the break of day next morning he repulsed the enemy fifteen times though they continually shifted their vessels and hoarded with fresh men In the beginning of the action he himself received a wound but he continued doing his duty above deck till eleven at night when receiving a fresh wound he was carried down to be dressed During this operation he received a shot in the head and the surgeon was killed by his side The English began now to want powder All their small arms were broken or become useless Of their number which were but a hundred and three at first forty were killed and almost all the rest wounded Their masts were beat overboard their tackle cut in pieces and nothing but a hulk left unable to move one way or other In this situation Sir Richard proposed to the ship s company to trust to the mercy of God not to that of the Spaniards and to destroy the ship with themselves rather than yield to the enemy The master gunner and many of the seamen agreed to this desperate resolution but others opposed it and obliged Greenville to surrender himself prisoner He died a few days after and his last words were Here die I Richard Greenville with a joyful and quiet mind for that I have ended my life as a true soldier ought to do fighting for his country queen religion and honor my soul willingly departing from this body leaving behind the lasting fame of having behaved as every valiant soldier is in his duty bound to do The Spaniards lost in this sharp though unequal action four ships and about a thousand men and Greenville s vessel perished soon after with two hundred Spaniards in her Hacklyt s Voyages vol iii part two p one hundred sixty nine Camden p five hundred sixty five Footnote

transcribing My estate said he is nothing correspondent for the maintenance of this dignity for my father dying left me a younger brother and nothing to me but my bare annuity Then growing to man s estate and some small practice of the law I took a wife by whom I have had many children the keeping of us all being a great impoverishing to my estate and the daily living of us all nothing but my

and sacred personage of our dread and dear sovereign the terror of whose countenance will appal and abase even the stoutest hearts yea whose very name will pull down the greatest courage for how

displeased to read it My very good lord Though there is not that man this day living whom I would sooner make judge of any question that might concern me than yourself yet you must give me leave to tell you that in some cases I must appeal from all earthly judges and if any then surely in this when the highest judge on earth has imposed on me the heaviest punishment without trial or hearing Since then I must either answer your lord ship s argument or else forsake mine own just defence I will force mine aching head to do me service for an hour I must first deny my discontent which was forced to be a humorous discontent and that it was unseasonable or is of so long continuing your lordship should rather condole with me than expostulate Natural seasons are expected here below but violent and unseasonable storms come from above There is no tempest equal to the passionate indignation of a prince nor yet at any time so unseasonable as when it lighteth on those that might expect a harvest of their careful and painful labors He that is once wounded must needs feel smart till his hurt is cured or the part hurt become senseless But cure I expect none her majesty s heart being obdurate against me and be without sense I cannot being of flesh and blood But say you I may aim at the end I do more than aim for I see an end of all my fortunes I have set an end to all my desires In this course do I any thing for my enemies When I was at court I found them absolute and therefore I had rather they should triumph alone than have me attendant upon their chariots Or do I leave my friends When I was a courtier I could yield them no fruit of my love unto them and now that I am a hermit they shall bear no envy for their love towards me Or do I forsake myself because I do enjoy myself Or do I overthrow my fortunes because I build not a fortune of paper walls which every puff of wind bloweth down Or do I ruinate mine honor because I leave following the pursuit or wearing the false badge or mark of the shadow of honor Do I give courage or comfort to the foreign foe because I reserve myself to encounter with him or because I keep my heart from business though I cannot keep my fortune from declining No no my good lord I give every one of these considerations its due weight and the more I weigh them the more I find myself justified from offending in any of them As for the two last objections that I forsake my country when it hath most need of me and fail in that indissoluble duty which I owe to my sovereign I answer that if my country had at this time any need of my public service her majesty that governeth it would not have driven me to a private life I am tied to my country by two bonds One public to discharge carefully and industriously that trust which is committed to me the other private to sacrifice for it my life and carcass which hath been nourished in it Of the first I am free being dismissed discharged and disabled by her majesty Of the other nothing can free me but death and therefore no occasion of my performance shall sooner offer itself but I shall meet it half way The indissoluble duty which I owe unto her majesty is only the duty of allegiance which Imnever have nor never can fail in The duty of attendance is no indissoluble duty I owe her majesty the duty of an earl and of lord marshal of England I have been content to do her majesty the service of a clerk but I can never serve her as a villain of slave But yet you say I must give way unto the time So I do for now that I see the storm come I have put myself into the harbor Seneca saith we must give way to fortune I know that fortune is both blind and strong and therefore I go as far as I can out of her way You say the remedy is not to strive I neither strive nor seek for remedy But you say I must yield and submit I can neither yield myself to be guilty nor allow the imputation laid upon me to be just I owe so much to the Author of all truth as I can never yield truth to be falsehood nor falsehood to be truth Have I given cause you ask and yet take a scandal when I have done No I gave no cause not so much as Fimbria s complaint against me for I did totum telum corpore recipere receive the whole sword into my body I patiently bear all and sensibly feel all that I then received when this scandal was given me Nay more when the vilest of all indignities are done unto me et cetera This noble letter Bacon afterwards in pleading against Essex called bold and presumptuous and derogatory to her majesty Birch s Memoirs vol ii p three hundred thirty eight Footnote thirty seven NOTE KK P three hundred twenty one Most of Queen Elizabeth s courtiers feigned love and desire towards her and addressed themselves to her in the style of passion and gallantry Sir Walter Raleigh having fallen into disgrace wrote the following letter to his friend Sir Robert Cecil with a view no doubt of having it shown to the queen My heart was never broke till this day that I hear the queen goes away so far off whom I have followed so many years with so great love and desire in so many journeys and am now left behind here in a dark prison all alone While she was yet near at hand that I might hear of her once in two or three days my sorrows were the less but even now my heart it cast into the depth of all misery I that was wont to behold her riding like Alexander hunting like Diana walking like Venus the gentle wind blowing her fair hair about her pure cheeks like a nymph sometimes sitting in the shade like a goddess sometimes singing like an angel sometimes playing like Orpheus behold the sorrow of this world once amiss hath bereaved me of all O glory that only sdineth in misfortune what is become of thy assurance All wounds have scars but that of fantasy all affections their relenting but that of womankind Who is the judge of friendship but adversity only when is grace witnessed but in offences There were no divinity but by reason of compassion for revenges are brutish and mortal All those times past the loves the sighs the sorrows the desires cannot they weigh down one frail misfortune Cannot one drop of gall be hid in so great heaps of sweetness I may then conclude Spes et fortuna valete She is gone in whom I trusted and of me hath not one thought of mercy nor any respect of that which was Do with me now therefore what you

vowing that I might take my leave of it for he would not forego it for any treasure and that to possess the favor of the lovely picture he would forsake all the world and hold himself most happy with many other most passionate speeches Murden p seven hundred eighteen For further particulars on this head see the ingenious author of the Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors article Essex Footnote thirty eight NOTE LL P three hundred thirty seven It may not be amiss to subjoin some passages of these speeches which may serve to give us a just idea of the government of that age and of the political principles which prevailed during the reign of Elizabeth mister Laurence Hyde proposed a bill entitled An act for the explanation of the common law in certain cases of letters patent mister Spicer said This bill may touch the prerogative royal which as I learned the last parliament is so transcendent that the of the subject may not aspire thereunto Far be it therefore from me that the state and prerogative royal of the prince should be tied by me or by the act of any other subject mister Francis Bacon said As to the prerogative royal of the prince for my own part I ever allowed of it and it is such as I hope will never be discussed The queen as she is our sovereign hath both an enlarging and restraining power For by her prerogative she may set at liberty things restrained by statute law or otherwise and secondly by her prerogative she may restrain things which be at liberty For the first she may grant a non obstante contrary to the penal laws With regard to monopolies and such like cases the case hath ever been to humble ourselves onto her majesty and by petition desire to have our grievances remedied especially when the remedy touched her so nigh in point of prerogative I say and I say it again that we ought not to deal to judge or meddle with her majesty s prerogative I wish therefore every man to be careful of this business doctor Bennet said He that goeth about to debate her majesty s prerogative had need to walk warily mister Laurence Hyde said For the bill itself I made it and I think I understand it and far be it from this heart of mine to think this tongue to speak or this hand to write any thing either in prejudice or derogation of her majesty s prerogative royal and the state mister Speaker quoth Serjeant Harris for aught I see the house moveth to have this bill in the nature of a petition It must then begin with more humiliation And truly sir the bill is good of itself but the penning of it is somewhat out of course mister Montague said The matter is good and honest and I like this manner of proceeding by bill well enough in this matter The grievances are great and I would only unto you thus much that the last parliament we proceeded by way of petition which had no successful effect mister Francis More said I know the queen s prerogative is a thing curious to be dealt withal yet all grievances are not comparable I cannot utter with my tongue or conceive with my heart the great grievances that the town and country for which I serve suffereth by some of these monopolies It bringeth the general profit into a private hand and the end of all this is beggary and bondage to the subjects We have a law for the true and faithful currying of leather There is a patent sets all at liberty notwithstanding that statute And to what purpose is it to do any thing by act of parliament when the queen will undo the same by her prerogative Out of the spirit of humiliation mister Speaker I do speak it there is no act of hers that hath been or is mores derogatory to her own majesty more odious to the subject more dangerous to the commonwealth than the granting of these monopolies mister Martin said I do speak for a town that grieves and pines tor a country that groaneth and languisheth under the burden of monstrous and unconscionable substitutes to the monopolitans of starch tin fish cloth oil vinegar salt and I know not what nay what not The principalest commodities both of my town and country are engrossed into the hands of these bloodsuckers of the commonwealth If a body mister Speaker being let blood be left still languishing without any remedy how can the good estate of that body still remain Such is the state of my town and country the traffic is taken away the inward and private commodities are taken away and dare not be used without the license of these monopolitans If these bloodsuckers be still let alone to suck up the best and principalest commodities which the earth there hath given us what will become of us from whom the fruits of our own soil and the commodities of our own labor which with the sweat of our brows even up to the knees in mire and dirt we have labored for shall be taken by warrant of supreme authority which the poor subject dare not gainsay mister George Moore said We know the power of her majesty cannot be restrained by any act Why wherefore should we thus talk s Admit we should make this statute with a non obstante yet the queen may grant a patent with a non obstante to cross this non obstante I think therefore it agreeth more with the gravity and wisdom of this house to proceed with all humbleness by petition than bill mister Downland said As I would be no let or over vehement in any thing so I am not sottish or senseless of the common grievance of the commonwealth If we proceed by way of petition we can have no more gracious answer then we had the last parliament to our petition But since that parliament we have no reformation Sir Robert Wroth said I speak and I speak it boldly these patentees are worse than ever they were mister Hayward Townsend proposed that they should make suit to her majesty not only to repeal all monopolies grievous to the subject but also that it would please her majesty to give the parliament leave to make an act that they might be of no more force validity or effect than they are at the common law without the strength of her prerogative Which though we might now do and the act being so reasonable we might assure ourselves her majesty would not delay the passing thereof yet we her loving subjects et cetera would not offer without her privity and consent the cause so nearly touching her prerogative or go about to do any such act On a subsequent day the bill against monopolies was again introduced and mister Spicer said It is to no purpose to offer to tie her majesty s hands by act of parliament when she may loosen herself at her pleasure mister Davies said God hath given that power to absolute princes which he attributes to himself Dixi quod Dii estis N B This axiom he applies to the kings of England mister Secretary Cecil said I am servant to the queen and before I would speak and give consent to a case that should debase her prerogative or abridge it I would wish that my tongue were cut out of my head I am sure there were law makers before there were laws meaning I suppose that the sovereign was above the laws One gentleman went about to possess us with the execution of the law in an ancient record of five or seven of Edward III Likely enough to be true in that time when the king was afraid of the subject If you stand upon law and dispute of the prerogative hark ye what Bracton says Praerogativam nestram nemo audeat disputare And for my own part I like not these courses should be taken And you mister Speaker should perform the charge her majesty gave unto you in the beginning of this parliament not to receive bills of this nature for her majesty s ears be open to all grievances and her hands stretched out to every man s petitions When the prince dispenses with a penal law that is left to the alteration of sovereignty that is good and irrevocable mister Montague said I am loath to speak what I know lest perhaps I should displease The prerogative royal is that which is now in question and which the laws of the land have ever allowed bad maintained Let us therefore apply by petition to her majesty After the speaker told the house that the queen had annulled many of the patents mister Francis More said I must confess mister Speaker I moved the house both the last parliament and this touching this point but I never meant and I hope the house thinketh so to set limits and bounds to the prerogative royal He proceeds to move that thanks should be given to her majesty and also that whereas divers speeches have been moved extravagantly in the house which doubtless have been told her majesty and perhaps ill conceived of by her mister Speaker would apologize and humbly crave pardon for the same N B These extracts were taken by Townsend a member of the house who was no courtier and the extravagance of the speeches seems rather to be on the other side It will certainly appear strange to us that this liberty should be thought extravagant However the queen notwithstanding her cajoling the house was so ill satisfied with these proceedings that she spoke of them peevishly in her concluding speech and told them that she perceived that private respects with them were privately masked under public presence D Ewes p six hundred nineteen There were some other topics in favor of prerogative still more extravagant advanced in the house this parliament When the question of the subsidy was before them mister Serjeant Heyle said mister Speaker I marvel much that the house should stand upon granting of a subsidy or the time of payment when all we have is her majesty s and she may lawfully at her pleasure take it from us yea she hath as much right to all our lands and goods as to any revenue of her crown At which all the house hemmed and laughed and talked Well quoth Serjeant Heyle all your hemming shall not put me out of countenance So mister Speaker stood up and said It is a great disorder that this house should be so used So the said serjeant proceeded and when he had spoken a little while the house hemmed again and so he sat down In his latter speech he said he could prove his former position by precedents in the time of Henry III King John King Stephen et cetera which was the occasion of then hemming D Ewes p six hundred thirty three It is observable that Heyle was an eminent lawyer a man of character Winwood vol i p two hundred ninety And though the house in general showed their disapprobation no one cared to take him down Or oppose these monstrous positions It was also asserted this session that in the same manner as the Roman consul was possessed of the power of rejecting or admitting motions in the senate the speaker might either admit or reject bills in the house D Ewes p six hundred seventy seven The house declared themselves against this opinion but the very proposal of it is a proof at what a low ebb liberty was at that time in England In the year fifteen ninety one the judges made a solemn decree that England was an absolute empire of which the king was the head In consequence of this opinion they determined that even if the act of the first of Elizabeth had never been made the king was supreme head of the church and might have erected by his prerogative such a court as the ecclesiastical commission for that he was the head of all his subjects Now that court was plainly arbitrary The inference is that his power was equally absolute over the laity See Coke s Reports p five Caudrey s case Footnote thirty nine NOTE MM p three hundred fifty nine We have remarked before that Harrison in book ii chap eleven says that in the reign of Henry VIII there were hanged seventy two thousand thieves and rogues besides other malefactors this makes about two thousand a year but in Queen Elizabeth s time the same author says there were only between three and four hundred a year banged for theft and robbery so much had the times mended But in our age there are not forty a year hanged for those crimes in all England Yet Harrison complains of the relaxation of the laws that there were so few such rogues punished in his time Our vulgar prepossession in favor of the morals of former and rude ages is very absurd and ill grounded The same author says chap ten that there were computed to be ten thousand gypsies in England a species of banditti introduced about the reign of Henry VIII and he adds that there will be no way of extirpating them by the ordinary course of justice The queen must employ martial law against them That race has now almost totally disappeared in England and even in Scotland where there were some remains of them a few years ago However arbitrary the exercise of martial law in the crown it appears that nobody in the age of Elizabeth entertained any jealousy of it Footnote forty NOTE NN p three hundred sixty seven Harrison in his Description of Britain printed in fifteen seventy seven has the following passage chap thirteen Certes there is no prince in Europe that hath a more beautiful sort of ships than the queen s majesty of England at this present and those generally are of such exceeding force that two of them being well appointed and furnished as they ought will not let to encounter with three or four of them of other countries and either bowge them or put them to flight if they may not bring them home The queen s highness hath at this present already made and furnished to the number of one and twenty great ships which lie for the most part in Gillingham Rode Beside these her grace hath other in hand also of whom hereafter as their turns do come about I will not let to leave some further remembrance She hath likewise three notable galleys the Speedwell the Tryeright and the Black Galley with the sight whereof and the rest of the navy royal it is incredible to say how marvellously her grace is delighted and not without great cause sith by their means her coasts are kept in quiet and sundry foreign enemies put back which otherwise would invade us After speaking of the merchant ships which he says are commonly estimated at seventeen or eighteen hundred he continues I add therefore to the end all men should understand somewhat of the great masses of treasure daily employed upon our navy how there are few of those ships of the first and second sort that is of the merchant ships that being apparelled and made ready to sail are not worth one thousand pounds or three thousand ducats at the least if they should presently be sold What shall we then think of the navy royal of which some one vessel is worth two of the other as the shipwright has often told me It is possible that some covetous person hearing this report will either not credit at all or suppose money so employed to be nothing profitable to the queen s coffers as a good husband said once when he heard that provisions should be made for armor wishing the queen s money to be rather laid out to some speedier return of gain unto her grace But if he wist that the good keeping of the sea is the safeguard of our land he would alter his censure and soon give over his judgment Speaking of the forests this author says An infinite deal of wood hath been destroyed within these few years and I dare affirm that if wood do go so fast to decay in the next hundred years of grace as they have done or are like to do in this it is to be feared that sea coal will be good merchandise even in the city of London Harrison s prophecy was fulfilled in a very few years for about sixteen fifteen there were two hundred sail employed in carrying coal to London See Anderson vol i p four hundred ninety four Footnote forty one NOTE OO p three hundred seventy three Life of Burleigh published by Collins f forty four The author hints that this quantity of plate was considered only as small in a man of Burleigh s rank His words are His plate was not above fourteen or fifteen thousand pounds That he means pounds weight is evident For by Burleigh s will which is annexed to his life that nobleman gives away in legacies to friends and relations near four thousand pounds weight which would have been above twelve thousand pounds sterling in value The remainder he orders to be divided into two equal portions the half to his eldest son and heir the other half to be divided equally among his second son and three daughters Were we therefore to understand the whole value of his plate to be only fourteen or sixteen thousand pounds sterling he left not the tenth of it to the heir of his family Footnote forty two NOTE PP p three hundred seventy three Harrison says The greatest part of our building in the cities and good towns of England consisteth only of timber cast over with thick clay to keep out the wind Certes this rude kind of building made the Spaniards in Queen Mary s days to wonder but chiefly when they saw that large diet was used in many of these so homely cottages insomuch that one of no small reputation amongst them said after this manner These English quoth he have their houses made of sticks and dirt but they fare commonly so well as the king Whereby it appeareth that he liked better of our good fare in such coarse cabins than of their own thin diet in their princely habitations and palaces The clay with which our houses are commonly empanelled is either white red or blue Book ii chap twelve The author adds that the new houses of the nobility are commonly of brick or stone and that glass windows were beginning to be used in England Footnote forty three NOTE QQ p three hundred seventy five The following are the words of Roger Ascham the queen s preceptor It is your shame I speak to you all young gentlemen of England that one maid should go beyond ye all in excellency of learning and knowledge of divers tongues Point out six of the best given gentlemen of this court and all they together show not so much good will spend not so much time bestow not so many hours daily orderly and constantly for the increase of learning and knowledge as doth the queen s majesty herself Yea I believe that besides her perfect readiness in Latin Italian French and Spanish she readeth here now at Windsor more Greek every day than some prebendary of this church doth Latin in a whole week Amongst all the benefits which God had blessed me withal next the knowledge of Christ s true religion I count this the greatest that it pleased God to call me to be one poor minister in setting forward these excellent gifts of learning et cetera page two hundred forty two Truly says Harrison it is a rare thing with us now to hear of a courtier which hath but his own language and to say how many gentlewomen and ladies there are that besides sound knowledge of the Greek and Latin tongues are thereto no less skilful in the Spanish Italian and French or in some one of them it resteth not in me sith I am persuaded that as the noblemen and gentlemen do surmount in this behalf so these come little or nothing at all behind them for their parts which industry God continue The stranger that entereth in the court of England upon the sudden shall rather imagine himself to come into some public school of the university where many give ear to one that readeth unto them than into a prince s palace if you confer thus with those of other nations Description of Britain book ii chap fifteen By this account the court had profited by the example of the queen The sober way of life practised by the ladies of Elizabeth s court appears from the same author Reading spinning and needlework occupied the elder music the younger Id ibid Footnote forty four NOTE RR p three hundred ninety one Sir Charles Cornwallis the king s ambassador at Madrid when pressed by the duke of Lernia to enter into a league with Spain said to that minister Though his majesty was an absolute king and therefore not bound to give an account to any of his actions yet that so gracious and regardful a prince he was of the love and contentment of his own subjects as I assured myself he would not think it fit to do any thing of so great consequence without acquainting them with his intentions Winwood vol ii p two hundred twenty two Sir Walter Raleigh has this passage in the preface to his History of the World Philip II by strong hand and main force attempted to make himself not only an absolute monarch over the Netherlands like unto the kings and monarchs of England and France but Turk like to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws privileges and ancient rights We meet with this passage in Sir John Davis s Question concerning impositions p one hundred sixty one Thus we see by this comparison that the king of England doth lay but his little finger upon his subjects when other princes and states do lay their heavy loins upon their people What is the reason of this difference from whence cometh it assuredly not from a different power or prerogative for the king of England is as absolute a monarch as any emperor or king in the world and hath as many prerogatives incident to his crown Coke in Cawdry s case says that by the ancient laws of this realm England is an absolute empire and monarchy and that the king is furnished with plenary and entire power prerogative and jurisdiction and is supreme governor over all persons within this realm Spencer speaking of some grants of the English kings to the Irish corporations says all which though at the time of their first grant they were tolerable and perhaps reasonable yet now are most unreasonable and inconvenient But all these will easily be cut off with the superior power of her majesty s prerogative against which her own grants are not to be pleaded or enforced State of Ireland p sixteen thirty seven edit seventeen oh six The same author in p sixteen sixty proposes a plan for the civilization of Ireland that the queen should create a marshal in every county who might ride about with eight or ten followers in search of stragglers and vagabonds the first time he catches any he may punish them more lightly by the stocks the second time by whipping but the third time he may hang them without trial or process on the first bough and he thinks that this authority may more safely be intrusted to the provost marshal than to the sheriff because the latter magistrate having a profit by the escheats of felons may be tempted to hang innocent persons Here a real absolute or rather despotic power is pointed out and we may infer from all these passages either that the word absolute bore a different sense from what it does at present or that men s ideas of the English as well as Irish government were then different This latter inference seems juster The word being derived from the French bore always the same sense as in that language An absolute monarchy in Charles I s answer to the nineteen propositions is opposed to a limited and the king of England is acknowledged not to be absolute so much had matters changed even before the civil war In Sir John Fortescue s treatise of absolute and limited monarchy a book written in the reign of Edward IV the word absolute is taken in the same sense as at present and the government of England is also said not to be absolute They were the princes of the house of Tudor chiefly who introduced that administration which had the appearance of absolute government The princes before them were restrained by the barons as those after them by the house of commons The people had properly speaking little liberty in either of these ancient governments but least in the more ancient Footnote forty five NOTE SS p three hundred ninety two Even this parliament which showed so much spirit and good sense in the affair of Goodwin made a strange concession to the crown in their fourth session Toby Mathews a member had been banished by order of the council upon direction from his majesty The parliament not only acquiesced in this arbitrary proceeding but issued writs for a new election such novices were they as yet in the principles of liberty See Journ fourteenth Feb sixteen oh nine Mathews was banished by the king on account of his change of religion to Popery The king had an indulgence to those who had been educated Catholics but could not bear the new converts It was probably the animosity of the commons against the Papists which made them acquiesce in this precedent without reflecting on the consequences The jealousy of liberty though roused was not yet thoroughly enlightened Footnote forty six NOTE TT p three hundred ninety four At that time men of genius and of enlarged minds had adopted the principles of liberty which were as yet pretty much unknown to the generality of the people Sir Matthew Hales has published a remonstrance against the king s conduct towards the parliament during this session The remonstrance is drawn with great force of reasoning and spirit of liberty and was the production of Sir Francis Bacon and Sir Edwin Sandys two men of the greatest parts and knowledge in England It is drawn in the name of the commons but as there is no hint of it in the journals we must conclude either that the authors sensible that the strain of the piece was much beyond the principles of the age had not ventured to present it to the house or that it had been for that reason rejected The dignity and authority of the commons are strongly insisted upon in this remonstrance and it is there said that their submission to the ill treatment which they received during the latter part of Elizabeth s reign had proceeded from their tenderness towards her age and her sex But the authors are mistaken in these facts for the house received and submitted to as bad treatment in the beginning and middle of that reign The government was equally arbitrary in Mary s reign in Edward s in Henry VIII and VII s And the further we go back into history though there might be more of a certain irregular kind of liberty among the barons the commons were still of less authority Footnote forty seven NOTE UU p three hundred ninety eight This parliament passed an act of recognition of the king s title in the most ample terms They recognized and acknowledged that immediately upon the dissolution and decease of Elizabeth late queen of England the imperial crown thereof did by inherent birthright and lawful and undoubted succession descend and come to his most excellent majesty as being lineally justly and lawfully next and sole heir of the blood royal of this realm I James I cap one The Puritans though then prevalent did not think proper to dispute this great constitutional point In the recognition of Queen Elizabeth the parliament declares that the queen s highness is and in very deed and of most mere right ought to be by the laws of God and by the laws and statutes of this realm our most lawful and rightful sovereign liege lady and queen et cetera It appears then that if King James s divine right be not mentioned by parliament the omission came merely from chance and because that phrase did not occur to the compiler of the recognition his title being plainly the same with that of his predecessor who was allowed to have a divine right Footnote fifty NOTE XX p four hundred five Some historians have imagined that the king had secret intelligence of the conspiracy and that the letter to Monteagle was written by his direction in order to obtain the praise of penetration in discovering the plot But the known facts refute this supposition That letter being commonly talked of might naturally have given an alarm to the conspirators and made them contrive their escape The visit of the lord chamberlain ought to have had the same effect In short it appears that nobody was arrested or inquired after for some days till Fawkes discovered the names of the conspirators We may infer however from a letter in Winwood s Memorials vol ii p one hundred seventy one that Salisbury s sagacity led the king in his conjectures and that the minister like an artful courtier gave his master the praise of the whole discovery Footnote fifty one NOTE YY p four hundred seventeen We find the king s answer in Winwood s Memorials vol iii r one hundred ninety eight twod edit To the third and fourth namely that it might be lawful to arrest the king s servants without leave and that no man should be enforced to lend money nor to give a reason why he would not his majesty sent us an answer that because we brought precedents of antiquity to strengthen those demands he allowed not of any precedents drawn from the time of usurping or decaying princes or people too bold and wanton that he desired not to govern in that commonwealth where subjects should be assured of all things and hope for nothing It was one thing submittere principatum legibus and another thing submittere principatum subditis That he would not leave to posterity such a mark of weakness upon his reign and therefore his conclusion was non placet petitio non placet exemplum yet with this mitigation that in matters of loans he would refuse no reasonable excuse nor should my lord chamberlain deny the arresting of any of his majesty s servants if just cause was shown The parliament however acknowledged at this time with thankfulness to the king that he allowed disputes and inquiries about his prerogative much beyond what had been indulged by any of his predecessors Parliament Hist vol v p two hundred thirty This very session he expressly gave them leave to produce all their grievances without exception Footnote fifty two NOTE ZZ p four hundred twenty It may not be unworthy of observation that James in a book called The true Laws of free Monarchies which he published a little before his accession to the crown of England affirmed That a good king although he be above the law will subject and frame his actions thereto for example s sake to his subjects and of his own free will but not as subject or bound thereto In another passage According to the fundamental law already alleged we daily see that in the parliament which is nothing else but the head court of the king and his vassals the laws are but craved by his subjects and only made by him at their rogation and with their advice For albeit the king make daily statutes and ordinances enjoining such pains thereto as he thinks meet without any advice of parliament or estates yet it lies in the power of no parliament to make any kind of law or statute without his sceptre be to it for giving it the force of a law King James s Works p two hundred two It is not to be supposed that at such a critical juncture James had so little sense as directly in so material a point to have openly shocked what were the universal established principles of that age on the contrary we are told by historians that nothing tended more to facilitate his accession than the good opinion entertained of him by the English on account of his learned and judicious writings The question however with regard to the royal power was at this time become a very dangerous point and without employing ambiguous insignificant terms which determined nothing it was impossible to please both king and parliament doctor Cowell who had magnified the prerogative in words too intelligible fell this session under the indignation of the commons Parliament Hist vol v p two hundred twenty one The king himself after all his magnificent boasts was obliged to make his escape through a distinction which he framed between a king in abstracto and a king in concreto an abstract king he said had all power but a concrete king was bound to observe the laws of the country which he governed King James s Works p five hundred thirty three But how bound by conscience only or might his subjects resist him and defend their privileges This he thought not fit to explain And so difficult is it to explain that point that to this day whatever liberties may be used by private inquirers the laws have very prudently thought proper to maintain a total silence with regard to it Footnote fifty three NOTE AAA p four hundred thirty four Parliament Hist vol v p two hundred ninety So little fixed at this time were the rules of parliament that the commons complained to the peers of a speech made in the upper house by the bishop of Lincoln which it belonged only to that house to censure and which the other could not regularly be supposed to be acquainted with These at least are the rules established since the parliament became a real seat of power and scene of business neither the king must take notice of what passes in either house nor either house of what passes in the other till regularly informed of it The commons in their famous protestation sixteen twenty one fixed this rule with regard to the king though at present they would not bind themselves by it But as liberty was yet new those maxims which guard and regulate it were unknown and unpractised Footnote fifty four NOTE BBB p four hundred fifty two Some of the facts in this narrative which seem to condemn Raleigh are taken from the king s declaration which being published by authority when the facts were recent being extracted from examinations before the privy council and subscribed by six privy councillors among whom was Abbot archbishop of Canterbury a prelate nowise complaisant to the court must be allowed to have great weight or rather to be of undoubted credit Yet the most material facts are confirmed either by the nature and reason of the thing or by Sir Walter s own apology and his letters The king s declaration is in the Harleian Miscellany vol iii No two one There seems to be an improbability that the Spaniards who knew nothing of Raleigh s pretended mine should have built a town in so wide a coast within three miles of it The chances are extremely against such a supposition and it is more natural to think that the view of plundering the town led him thither than that of working a mine two No such mine is there found to this day three Raleigh in fact found no mine and in fact he plundered and burned a Spanish town Is it not more probable therefore that the latter was his intention How can the secrets of his breast be rendered so visible as to counterpoise certain facts four He confesses in his letter to Lord Carew that though he knew it yet he concealed from the king the settlement of the Spaniards on that coast Does not this fact alone render him sufficiently criminal five His commission empowers him only to settle on a coast possessed by savage and barbarous inhabitants Was it not the most evident breach of orders to disembark on a coast possessed by Spaniards six His orders to Keymis when he sent him up the river are contained in his own apology and from them it appears that he knew what was unavoidable that the Spaniards would resist and would oppose the English landing and taking possession of the country His intentions therefore were hostile from the beginning seven Without provocation and even when at a distance he gave Keymis orders to dislodge the Spaniards from their own town Could any enterprise be more hostile And considering the Spaniards as allies to the nation could any enterprise be more criminal Was he not the aggressor even though it should be true that the Spaniards fired upon his men at landing It is said he killed three or four hundred of them Is that so light a matter eight In his letter to the king and in his apology he grounds his defence on former hostilities exercised by the Spaniards against other companies of Englishmen These are accounted for by the ambiguity of the treaty between the nations And it is plain that though these might possibly be reasons for the king s declaring war against that nation they could never entitle Raleigh to declare war and without any commission or contrary to his commission to invade the Spanish settlements He pretends indeed that peace was never made with Spain in the Indies a most absurd notion The chief hurt which the Spaniards could receive from England was in the Indies and they never would have made peace at all if hostilities had been still to be continued on these settlements By secret agreement the English were still allowed to support the Dutch even after the treaty of peace If they had also been allowed to invade the Spanish settlements the treaty had been a full peace to England while the Spaniards were still exposed to the full effects of war nine If the claim to the property of that country as first discoverers was good in opposition to present settlement as Raleigh pretends why was it not laid before the king with all its circumstances and submitted to his judgment ten Raleigh s force is acknowledged by himself to have been insufficient to support him in the possession of saint Thomas against the power of which Spain was master on that coast yet it was sufficient as he owns to take by surprise and plunder twenty towns It was not therefore his design to settle but to plunder By these confessions which I have here brought together he plainly betrays himself eleven Why did he not stay and work his mine as at first he projected He apprehended that the Spaniards would be upon him with a greater force But before he left England he knew that this must be the case if he invaded any part of the Spanish colonies His intention therefore never was to settle but only to plunder twelve He acknowledges that he knew neither the depth nor riches of the mine but only that there was some ore there Would he have ventured all his fortune and credit on so precarious a foundation thirteen Would the other adventurers if made acquainted with this have risked every thing to attend him Ought a fleet to have been equipped for an experiment Was there not plainly an imposture in the management of this affair fourteen He says to Keymis in his orders Bring but a basket full of ore and it will satisfy the king that my project was not imaginary This was easily done from the Spanish mines and he seems to have been chiefly displeased at Keymis for not attempting it Such a view was a premeditated apology to cover his cheat fifteen The king in his declaration imputes it to Raleigh that as soon as he was at sea he immediately fell into such uncertain and doubtful talk of his mine and said that it would be sufficient if he brought home a basket full of ore From the circumstance last mentioned it appears that this imputation was not without reason sixteen There are many other circumstances of great weight in the king s declaration that Raleigh when he fell down to Plymouth took no pioneers with him which he always declared to be his intention that he was nowise provided with instruments for working a mine but had a sufficient stock of warlike stores that young Raleigh in attacking the Spaniards employed the words which in the narration I have put in his mouth that the mine was movable and shifted as he saw convenient not to mention many other public facts which prove him to have been highly criminal against his companions as well as his country Howel in his letters says that there lived in London in sixteen forty five an officer a man of honor who asserted that he heard young Raleigh speak these words vol ii letter sixty three That was a time when there was no interest in maintaining such a fact seventeen Raleigh s account of his first voyage to Guiana proves him to have been a man capable of the most extravagant credulity or most impudent imposture So ridiculous are the stories which he tells of the Inca s chimerical empire in the midst of Guiana the rich city of El Dorado or Manao two days journey in length and shining with gold and silver the old Peruvian prophecies in favor of the English who he says were expressly named as the deliverers of that country long before any European had ever touched there the Amazons or republic of women and in general the vast and incredible riches which he saw on that continent where nobody has yet found any treasures This whole narrative is a proof that he was extremely defective either in solid understanding or morals or both No man s character indeed seems ever to have been carried to such extremes as Raleigh s by the opposite passions of envy and pity In the former part of his life when he was active and lived in the world and was probably best known he was the object of universal hatred and detestation throughout England in the latter part when shut up in prison he became much more unreasonably the object of great love and admiration As to the circumstances of the narrative that Raleigh s pardon was refused him that his former sentence was purposely kept in force against him and that he went out under these express conditions they may be supported by the following authorities one The king s word and that of six privy counsellors who affirm it for fact two The nature of the thing If no suspicion had been entertained of his intentions a pardon would never have been refused to a man to whom authority was intrusted three The words of the commission itself where he is simply styled Sir Walter Raleigh and not faithful and not beloved according to the usual and never failing style on such occasions four In all the letters which he wrote home to Sir Ralph Winwood and to his own wife he always considers himself as a person unpardoned and liable to the law He seems indeed immediately upon the failure of his enterprise to have become desperate and so have expected the fate which he met with It is pretended that the king gave intelligence to the Spaniards of Raleigh s project as if he had needed to lay a plot for destroying a man whose life had been fourteen years and still was in his power The Spaniards wanted no other intelligence to be on their guard than the known and public fact of Raleigh s armament And there was no reason why the king should conceal from them the project of a settlement which Raleigh pretended and the king believed to be entirely innocent The king s chief blame seems to have lain in his negligence in allowing Raleigh to depart without a more exact scrutiny but for this he apologizes by saying that sureties were required for the good behavior of Raleigh and all his associates in the enterprise but that they gave in bonds for each other a cheat which was not perceived till they had sailed and which increased the suspicion of bad intentions Perhaps the king ought also to have granted Raleigh a pardon for his old treason and to have tried him anew for his new offences His punishment in that case would not only have been just but conducted in a just and unexceptionable manner But we are told that a ridiculous opinion at that time prevailed in the nation and it is plainly supposed by Sir Walter in his apology that by treaty war was allowed with the Spaniards in the Indies though peace was made in Europe and while that notion took place no jury would have found Raleigh guilty So that had not the king punished him upon the old sentence the Spaniards would have had a just cause of complaint against the king sufficient to have produced a war at least to have destroyed all cordiality between the nations This explication I thought necessary in order to clear up the story of Raleigh which though very obvious is generally mistaken in so gross a manner that I scarcely know its parallel in the English history Footnote fifty five NOTE CCC p four hundred fifty eight This parliament is remarkable for being the epoch in which were first regularly formed though without acquiring these denominations the parties of court and country parties which have ever since continued and which while they often threaten the total dissolution of the government are the real causes of its permanent life and vigor In the ancient feudal constitution of which the English partook with other European nations there was a mixture not of authority and liberty which we have since enjoyed in this island and which now subsist uniformly together but of authority and anarchy which perpetually shocked with each other and which took place alternately according as circumstances were more or less favorable to either of them A parliament composed of barbarians summoned from their fields and forests uninstructed by study conversation or travel ignorant of their own laws and history and unacquainted with the situation of all foreign nations a parliament called precariously by the king and dissolved at his pleasure sitting a few days debating a few points prepared for them and whose members were impatient to return to their own castles where alone they were great and to the chase which was their favorite amusement such a parliament was very little fitted to enter into a discussion of all the questions of government and to share in a regular manner the legal administration The name the authority of the king alone appeared in the common course of government in extraordinary emergencies he assumed with still better reason the sole direction the imperfect and unformed laws left in every thing a latitude of interpretation and when the ends pursued by the monarch were in general agreeable to his subjects little scruple or jealousy was entertained with regard to the regularity of the means During the reign of an able fortunate or popular prince no member of either house much less of the lower durst think of entering into a formed party in opposition to the court since the dissolution of the parliament must in a few days leave him unprotected to the vengeance of his sovereign and to those stretches of prerogative which were then so easily made in order to punish an obnoxious subject During an unpopular and weak reign the current commonly ran so strong against the monarch that none durst enlist themselves in the court party or if the prince was able to engage any considerable barons on his side the question was decided with arms in the field not by debates or arguments in a senate or assembly And upon the whole the chief circumstance which during ancient times retained the prince in any legal form of administration was that the sword by the nature of the feudal tenures remained still in the hands of his subjects and this irregular and dangerous check had much more influence than the regular and methodical limits of the laws and constitution As the nation could not be compelled it was necessary that every public measure of consequence particularly that of levying new taxes should seem to be adopted by common consent and approbation The princes of the house of Tudor partly by the vigor of their administration partly by the concurrence of favorable circumstances had been able to establish a more regular system of government but they drew the constitution so near to despotism as diminished extremely the authority of the parliament The senate became in a great degree the organ of royal will and pleasure opposition would have been regarded as a species of rebellion and even religion the most dangerous article in which innovations could be introduced had admitted in the course of a few years four several alterations from the authority alone of the sovereign The parliament was not then the road to honor and preferment the talents of popular intrigue and eloquence were uncultivated and unknown and though that assembly still preserved authority and retained the privilege of making laws and bestowing public money the members acquired not upon that account either with prince or people much more weight and consideration What powers were necessary for conducting the machine of government the king was accustomed of himself to assume His own revenues supplied him with money sufficient for his ordinary expenses And when extraordinary emergencies occurred the prince needed not to solicit votes in parliament either for making laws or imposing taxes both of which were now became requisite for public interest and preservation The security of individuals so necessary to the liberty of popular councils was totally unknown in that age And as no despotic princes scarcely even the Eastern tyrants rule entirely without the concurrence of some assemblies which supply both advice and authority little but a mercenary force seems then to have been wanting towards the establishment of a simple monarchy in England The militia though more favorable to regal authority than the feudal institutions was much inferior in this respect to disciplined armies and if it did not preserve liberty to the people it preserved at least the power if ever the inclination should arise of recovering it But so low at that time ran the inclination towards liberty that Elizabeth the last of that arbitrary line herself no less arbitrary was yet the most renowned and most popular of all the sovereigns that had filled the throne of England It was natural for James to take the government as he found it and to pursue her measures which he heard so much applauded nor did his penetration extend so far as to discover that neither his circumstances nor his character could support so extensive an authority His narrow revenues and little frugality began now to render him dependent on his people even in the ordinary course of administration their increasing knowledge discovered to them that advantage which they had obtained and made them sensible of the inestimable value of civil liberty And as he possessed too little dignity to command respect and too much good nature to impress fear a new spirit discovered itself every day in the parliament and a party watchful of a free constitution was regularly formed in the house of commons But notwithstanding these advantages acquired to liberty so extensive was royal authority and so firmly established in all its parts that it is probable the patriots of that age would have despaired of ever resisting it had they not been stimulated by religious motives which inspire a courage unsurmountable by any human obstacle The same alliance which has ever prevailed between kingly power and ecclesiastical authority was now fully established in England and while the prince assisted the clergy in suppressing schismatics and innovators the clergy in return inculcated the doctrine of an unreserved submission and obedience to the civil magistrate The genius of the church of England so kindly to monarchy forwarded the confederacy its submission to episcopal jurisdiction its attachment to ceremonies to order and to a decent pomp and splendor of worship and in a word its affinity to the tame superstition of the Catholics rather than to the wild fanaticism of the Puritans On the other hand opposition to the church and the persecutions under which they labored were sufficient to throw the Puritans into the country party and to beget political principles little favorable to the high pretensions of the sovereign The spirit too of enthusiasm bold daring and uncontrolled strongly disposed their minds to adopt republican tenets and inclined them to arrogate in their actions and conduct the same liberty which they assumed in their rapturous flights and ecstasies Ever since the first origin of that sect through the whole reign of Elizabeth as well as of James Puritanical principles had been understood in a double sense and expressed the opinions favorable both to political and to ecclesiastical liberty And as the court in order to discredit all parliamentary opposition affixed the denomination of Puritans to its antagonists the religious Puritans willingly adopted this idea which was so advantageous to them and which confounded their cause with that of the patriots or country party Thus were the civil and ecclesiastical factions regularly formed and the humor of the nation during that age running strongly towards fanatical extravagancies the spirit of civil liberty gradually revived from its lethargy and by means of its religious associate from which it reaped more advantage than honor it secretly enlarged its dominion over the greater part of the kingdom This note was in the first editions a part of the text but the author omitted it in order to avoid as much as possible the style of dissertation in the body of his History The passage however contains views so important that he thought it might be admitted as a footnote Footnote fifty six NOTE DDD p four hundred sixty five This protestation is so remarkable that it may not be improper to give it in its own words The commons now assembled in parliament being justly occasioned thereunto concerning sundry liberties franchises and privileges of parliament amongst others here mentioned do make this protestation following That the liberties franchises and jurisdictions of parliament are the ancient and undoubted birthright and inheritance of the subjects of England and that the urgent and arduous affairs concerning the king state and defence of the realm and of the church of England and the maintenance and making of laws and redress of mischiefs and grievances which daily happen within this realm are proper subjects and matter of counsel and debate in parliament and that in the handling and proceeding of those businesses every member of the house of parliament hath and of right ought to have freedom of speech to propound treat reason and bring to conclusion the same and that the commons in parliament have like liberty and freedom to treat of these matters in such order as in their judgment shall seem fittest and that every member of the said house hath like freedom from all impeachment imprisonment and molestation other than by censure of the house itself for or concerning any speaking reasoning or declaring of any matter or matters touching the parliament or parliament business And that if any of the said members be complained of or questioned for any thing done or said in parliament the same is to be shown to the king by the advice and assent of all the commons assembled in parliament before the king give credence to any private information Franklyn p sixty five Rush vol i p fifty three Kennet p seven hundred forty seven Coke p seventy seven Footnote fifty seven NOTE EEE p four hundred thirty four The moment the prince embarked at saint Andero s he said to those about him that it was folly in the Spaniards to use him so ill and allow him to depart a proof that the duke had made him believe they were insincere in the affair of the marriage and the Palatinate for as to his reception in other respects it had been altogether unexceptionable Besides had not the prince believed the Spaniards to be insincere he had no reason to quarrel with them though Bucking ham had It appears therefore that Charles himself must have been deceived The multiplied delays of the dispensation though they arose from accident afforded Buckingham a plausible pretext for charging the Spaniards with insincerity Footnote fifty eight NOTE FFF p four hundred eighty six Among other particulars he mentions a sum of eighty thousand pounds borrowed from the king of Denmark In a former speech to the parliament he told them that he had expended five hundred thousand pounds in the cause of the palatine besides the voluntary contributions given him by the people See Franklyn p fifty But what is more extraordinary the treasurer in order to show his own good services boasts to the parliament that by his contrivance sixty thousand pounds had been saved in the article of exchange in the sums remitted to the palatine This seems a great sum nor is it easy to conceive whence the king could procure such vast sums as would require a sum so considerable to be paid in exchange From the whole however it appears that the king had been far from neglecting the interests of his daughter and son in law and had even gone far beyond what his narrow revenue could afford Footnote fifty nine NOTE GGG p four hundred eighty six How little this principle had prevailed during any former period of the English government particularly during the last reign which was certainly not so perfect a model of liberty as most writers would represent it will easily appear from many passages in the history of that reign But the ideas of men were much changed during about twenty years of a gentle and peaceful administration The commons though James of himself had recalled all patents of monopolies were not contented without a law against them and a declaratory law too which was gaining a great point and establishing principles very favorable to liberty but they were extremely grateful when Elizabeth upon petition after having once refused their requests recalled a few of the most oppressive patents and employed some soothing expressions towards them The parliament had surely reason when they confessed in the seventh of James that he allowed them more freedom of debate than ever was indulged by any of his predecessors His indulgence in this particular joined to his easy temper was probably one cause of the great power assumed by the commons Monsieur de la Boderie in his despatches vol i p four hundred forty nine mentions the liberty of speech in the house of commons as a new practice Footnote sixty NOTE HHH p four hundred ninety one Rymer tom xviii p two hundred twenty four It is certain that the young prince of Wales afterwards Charles II had Protestant governors from his early infancy first the earl of Newcastle then the marquis of Hertford The king in his memorial to foreign churches after the commencement of the civil wars insists on his care in educating his children in the Protestant religion as a proof that he was nowise inclined to the Catholic Rush vol v p seven hundred fifty two It can scarcely therefore be questioned but this article which has so odd an appearance was inserted only to amuse the pope and was never intended by either party to be executed Footnote sixty one NOTE III p four hundred ninety nine Monarchies according to Sir Walter Raleigh are of two sorts touching their power or authority viz one Entire where the whole power of ordering all state matters both in peace and war doth by law and custom appertain to the prince as in the English kingdom where the prince hath the power to make laws league and war to create magistrates to pardon life of appeal et cetera Though to give a contentment to the other degrees they have a suffrage in making laws yet ever subject to the prince s pleasure and negative will two Limited or restrained that hath no full power in all the points and matters of state as the military king that hath not the sovereignty in time of peace as the making of laws et cetera but in war only as the Polonian king Maxims of State And a little after In every just state some part of the government is or ought to be imparted to the people as in a kingdom a voice and suffrage in making laws and sometimes also of levying of arms if the charge be great and the prince forced to borrow help of his subjects the matter rightly may be propounded to a parliament that the tax may seem to have proceeded from themselves So consultations and some proceedings in judicial matters may in part be referred to them The reason lest seeing themselves to be in no number nor of reckoning they mislike the state or government This way of reasoning differs little from that of King James who considered the privileges of the parliament as matters of grace and indulgence more than of inheritance It is remarkable that Raleigh was thought to lean towards the Puritanical party notwithstanding these positions But ideas of government change much in different times Raleigh s sentiments on this head are still more openly expressed in his Prerogatives of Parliaments a work not published till after his death It is a dialogue between a courtier or counsellor and a country justice of peace who represents the patriot party and defends the highest notion of liberty which the principles of that age would bear Here is a passage of it Counsellor That which is done by the king with the advice of his private or privy council is done by the king s absolute power Justice And by whose power is it done in parliament but by the king s absolute power Mistake it not my lord the three estates do but advise as the privy council doth which advice if the king embrace it becomes the king s own act in the one and the king s law in the other et cetera The earl of Clare in a private letter to his son in law Sir Thomas Wentworth afterwards earl of Strafford thus expresses himself We live under a prerogative government where book law submits to lex loquens He spoke from his own and all his ancestors experience There was no single instance of power which a king of England might not at that time exert on pretence of necessity or expediency the continuance alone or frequent repetition of arbitrary administration might prove dangerous for want of force to support it It is remarkable that this letter of the earl of Clare was written in the first year of Charles s reign and consequently must be meant of the general genius of the government not the spirit or temper of the monarch See Strafford s Letters vol i p thirty two From another letter in the same collection vol i p ten it appears that the council sometimes assumed the power of forbidding persons disagreeable to the court to stand in the elections This authority they could exert in some instances but we are not thence to inter that they could shut the door of that house to every one who was not acceptable to them The genius of the ancient government reposed more trust in the king than to entertain any such suspicion and it allowed scattered instances of such a kind as would have been totally destructive of the constitution had they been continued without interruption I have not met with any English writer in that age who speaks of England as a limited monarchy but as an absolute one where the people have many privileges That is no contradiction In all European monarchies the people have privileges but whether dependent or independent on the will of the monarch is a question that in most governments it is better to forbear Surely that question was not determined before the age of James The rising spirit of the parliament together with that king s love of general speculative principles brought it from its obscurity and made it be commonly canvassed The strongest testimony that I remember from a writer of James s age in favor of English liberty is in Cardinal Bentivoglio a foreigner who mentions the English government as similar to that of the Low Country provinces under their princes rather than to that of France or Spain Englishmen were not so sensible that their prince was limited because they were sensible that no individual had any security against a stretch of prerogative but foreigners by comparison could perceive that these stretches were at that time from custom or other causes less frequent in England than in other monarchies Philip de Comines too remarked the English constitution to be more popular in his time than that of France But in a paper written by a patriot in sixteen twenty seven it is remarked that the freedom of speech in parliament had been lost in England since the days of Comines Franklyn p two hundred thirty eight Here is a stanza of Malherbe s Ode to Mary de Medicis the queen regent written in sixteen fourteen Entre les rois a qui cet age Doit son principal ornement Ceux de la Tamise et du Tage Font louer leur gouvernement Mais en de si calmes provinces Ou le peuple adore les princes Et met au gre le plus haut L honneur du sceptre legitime Sauroit on excuser le crime De ne regner pas comme il faut The English as well as the Spaniards are here pointed out as much more obedient subjects than the French and much more tractable and submissive to their princes Though this passage be taken from a poet every man of judgment will allow its authority to be decisive The character of a national government cannot be unknown in Europe though it changes sometimes very suddenly Machiavel in his Dissertations on Livy says repeatedly that France was the most legal and most popular monarchy then in Europe Footnote sixty two NOTE KKK p four hundred ninety nine Passive obedience is expressly and zealously inculcated in the homilies composed and published by authority in the reign of Queen Elizabeth The convocation which met in the very first year of the king s reign voted as high monarchical principles as are contained in the decrees of the University of Oxford during the rule of the Tories These principles so far from being deemed a novelty introduced by James s influence passed so smoothly that no historian has taken notice of them they were never the subject of controversy or dispute or discourse and it is only by means of Bishop Overall s Convocation Book printed near seventy years after that we are acquainted with them Would James who was so cautious and even timid have ventured to begin his reign with a bold stroke which would have given just ground of jealousy to his subjects It appears from that monarch s Basilicon Doron written while he was in Scotland that the republican ideas of the origin of power from the people were at that time esteemed Puritanical novelties The patriarchal scheme it is remarkable is inculcated in those votes of the convocation preserved by Overall nor was Filmer the first inventor of those absurd notions Footnote sixty three NOTE LLL p five hundred fourteen That of the honest historian Stowe seems not to have been of this number The great blessings of God says he through increase of wealth in the common subjects of this land especially upon the citizens of London such within men s memory and chiefly within these few years of peace that except there were now due mention of some sort made thereof it would in time to come be held incredible et cetera In another place Amongst the manifold tokens and signs of the infinite blessings of Almighty God bestowed upon this kingdom by the wondrous and merciful establishing of peace within ourselves and the full benefit of concord with all Christian nations and others of all which graces let no man dare to presume he can speak too much whereof in truth there can never be enough said neither was there ever any people less considerate and less thankful than at this time being not willing to endure the memory of their present happiness as well as in the universal increase of commerce and traffic throughout the kingdom great building of royal ships and by private merchants the repeopling of cities towns and villages beside the discernible and sudden increase of fair and costly buildings as well within the city of London as the suburbs thereof especially within these twelve years et cetera End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The History of England in Three Volumes Vol I Part D by David

tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Most people start at our Web site which has the
