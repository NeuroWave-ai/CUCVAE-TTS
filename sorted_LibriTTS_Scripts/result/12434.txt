because it offered them the only way of escape from the intolerable social and moral ills that attended the death pangs of the old heathenism Then came the Dark Ages with their resurgent heathenism and barbarism when the Bible was taken from the hands of the people In the hour of a nation s deepest humiliation and moral depravity John Wycliffe with the aid of a devoted army of lay priests gave back the Bible to the people and in so doing laid the foundations for England s intellectual political and moral greatness The joy and inspiration of the Protestant Reformers was the rediscovery and popular interpretation of the Bible In all the great forward movements of the modern centuries the Bible has played a central role The ultimate basis of our magnificent modern scientific and material progress is the inspiration given to the human race by the Protestant Reformation Unfortunately the real meaning and message of the Bible has been in part obscured during past centuries by dogmatic interpretations The study of the Bible has also been made a solemn obligation rather than a joyous privilege The remarkable discoveries of the present generation and its new and larger sense of power and progress have tended to turn men s attention from the contemplation of the heritage which comes to them from the past The result is that most men know little about the Bible They are acquainted with its chief characters such as Abraham David and Jesus A few are even able to give a clear cut outline of the important events of Israel s history but they regard it simply as a history whose associations and interests belong to a bygone age How many realize that most of the problems which Israel met and solved are similar to those which to day are commanding the absorbing attention of every patriotic citizen and that of all existing books the Old Testament makes the greatest contributions to the political and social as well as to the religious thought of the world National expansion taxation centralization of authority civic responsibility the relation of religion to politics and to public morality were as vital and insistent problems in ancient Israel as they are in any live progressive nation to day The gradual discovery of this fact explains why here and there through out the world the leaders in modern thought and progress are studying the Bible with new delight and enthusiasm not only because of its intrinsic beauty and interest but because in it they find stated in clearest form the principles which elucidate the intricate problems of modern life THE OBJECTS OF THESE STUDIES There are two distinct yet important ways of interpreting the Bible The one is that of the scholar who knows the Bible from the linguistic historical and literary point of view the other that of the man who knows life and who realizes the meaning and value of the Bible to those who are confronted by insistent social economic and individual problems These studies aim to combine both methods of interpretation Briefly defined the chief objects of these studies are one To introduce the men and women of to day to that which is most vital in the literature and thought of the Old Testament two To interpret the often neglected Old Testament into the language of modern life simply and directly and in the light of that which is highest in the teachings of Christianity three To present the constructive results of the modern historical and literary study of the Bible not dogmatically but tentatively so that the reader and student may be in a position to judge for himself regarding the conclusions that are held by a large number of Biblical scholars and to estimate their practical religious value four To show how closely the Old Testament is related to the life of to day and how it helps to answer the pressing questions now confronting the nations five To lead strong men to think through our national social and individual problems and to utilize fearlessly and practically the constructive results of modern method and research in the fields of both science and religion THE PLAN OF WORK These studies are planned to meet the needs of college students and adult Bible classes Those who are able to command more time and wish to do more thorough work will find in the list of Parallel Readings on the first page of each study carefully selected references

in the image of God created he him male and female created he them And God blessed them and God said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth Gen one twenty seven twenty eight When I consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers The moon and the stars which thou hast ordained What is man that thou art mindful of him And the son of man that thou visitest him For thou hast made him but little lower than God And crownest him with glory

wisdom he filled their minds Good and evil he taught them Ben Sira seventeen three seven Hist Bible All things were made through him and without him was not any thing made that hath been made John one three I DIFFERENT THEORIES OF CREATION Every early people naturally asked the questions How were things made How were men created First of all Who made the world They necessarily answered them according to their own dawning knowledge The most primitive races believed that some great animal created the earth and man In the Alaskan collection in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania there is a huge crow sitting upon the mask of a man s face This symbolizes the crude belief of the Alaskan Indians regarding the way man was created The early Egyptians thought that the earth and man were hatched out of an egg In one part of Egypt it was held that the artisan god Ptah broke the egg with his hammer In another part of the land and probably at a later date the tradition was current that Thoth the moon god spoke the world into existence The earliest Babylonian record states that The god Marduk laid a reed on the face of the waters He formed dust and poured it out beside the reed That he might cause the gods to dwell in the dwellings of their heart s desire He formed mankind Later he formed the grass and the rush of the marsh and the forest Then he created the animals and their young The Parsee teachers held that the rival gods Ahriman and Ormuzd evolved themselves out of primordial matter and then through the long ages created their attendant hierarchies of angels The philosophers of India anticipated in some respects our modern evolutionary theory Brahma is thought of as self existent and eternal He gradually condenses himself into material objects such as ether fire water earth and the elements Last of all he manifests himself in man The Greek philosophers were the first to attempt to describe creation as a purely physical generative process They taught the evolution of the more complex from the simpler forms Plato and Aristotle believed in a transcendental deity and found in the world indications of a vital impulse toward a higher manifestation of life man Michael Angelo with wonderful dramatic power in his painting in the Sistine Chapel at Rome has portrayed how lifeless clay in form of man when touched by the finger of God by sheer vitalizing power is transformed into a living soul Very different yet equally impressive is the modern scientific view The origin of matter and of life is so absolutely unknown that scientists have not as yet formulated definite theories concerning it Even the theories regarding the origin of the solar system are still conflicting and none is generally accepted The old nebular hypothesis is discredited and the theory of the spiral movement of the solar matter seems to be confirmed by phenomena observable in the heavens The one principle generally held by scientists is that given matter and life and some creating force our present marvelous complex universe has come into being according to laws usually called natural These laws are so invariable that they may be considered unchanging Even more definitely established is the so called theory of evolution which is based on the careful observation and comparison of countless thousands of natural phenomena According to the Encyclopedia Britannica it is the history of the physical process by which all living beings have acquired the characteristics physical mental moral and spiritual which now distinguish them It recognizes the gradual development from the simplest to the most complex forms It is merely an attempt to describe in the light of careful observation and investigation the process of growth by which the world and the beings which inhabit it have grown into what they are A comparison of the Hebrew account of creation with those of other races and times is extremely suggestive II THE PRIESTLY STORY OF CREATION Note that the first and second chapters of Genesis contain two distinct accounts of creation Read Genesis one one two three see Hist Bib I pp two hundred thirty one three for modern translation noting its picture of conditions in the universe before the actual work of creation began The creative power is the spirit or breath of God The Hebrew word for spirit ruah represents the sound of the breath as it emerges from the mouth or the sound of the wind as it sighs through the trees It is the effective symbol of a real and mighty force that cannot be seen or touched yet produces terrific effects as when the cyclone rends the forest or transforms the sea into a mountain of billows and twists like straws the masts of wood and steel In the Old Testament the spirit of God or the spirit of the Holy One is God working one in the material universe as in the work of creation two in human history as when he directs the life of nations or three in the lives of men Note the method of creation and the distinctive work of each day The process is that of separation It is orderly and progressive The first three days of preparation in which one light and darkness two air and water separated by the firmament and three land and vegetation are created correspond to the work of the second three days in which are created one the heavenly bodies two the birds and fishes which live in the air and water and three land animals and man The underlying conception of the universe is that held by most early peoples Compare the diagram in Hastings Dictionary of the Bible I five hundred three or Kent s Student s Old Testament Vol I p fifty two which illustrates it God s benign plan is revealed by the recurring words God saw that it was good What was the culminating act of creation Created man in his image can not mean with a body like that of God for in this story God is thought of as a spirit but rather with a God like spirit mind will and power to rule III THE EARLY PROPHETIC STORY OF CREATION The opening words of the second account of creation which begins in the fourth verse of the second chapter of Genesis imply that the earth and the heavens have already been created In the day that Jehovah made earth and heaven no plant of the field was yet on the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up for Jehovah had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was no man to till the ground but a mist used to rise from the earth and water the whole face of the ground It is possible that here only a part of the original story is preserved What is the order in the story of creation found in this second chapter The method of man s creation According to this account the tree of life was planted in the garden that man while he lived there might enjoy immortality Was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil placed in the garden to develop man s moral nature by temptation or merely to inculcate obedience The love between the sexes is apparently implanted in all living beings primarily for the conservation of the species but the early prophet also recognized clearly the broader intellectual and moral aspects of the relation It is not good for man to be alone were the significant words of Jehovah Hence animals birds and last of all woman were created to meet man s innate social needs Man s words on seeing woman were This now is bone of my bone And flesh of my flesh This one shall be called woman For from man was she taken What fundamental explanation is here given of the institution of marriage Compare Jesus confirmation of this teaching in Matthew nineteen four five And he answered and said Have ye not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female and said For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh IV A COMPARISON OF THE TWO ACCOUNTS OF CREATION The account of creation found in the second chapter suggests the simple direct ideas of a primitive people while the account in Genesis one has the exact repetitious majestic literary style of a legal writer Are the differences between these two accounts of creation greater than those between the parallel narratives in the Gospels We recognize that the differences in detail between the Gospel accounts of the same event are due to the fact that no two narrators tell the same story in the same way Are the variations between the two Biblical accounts of creation to be similarly explained A growing body of Biblical scholars hold though many differ in judgment that the account in the first chapter of Genesis was written by a priestly writer who lived about four hundred B C and the second account four hundred years earlier by a patriotic prophetic historian Observe that the two accounts agree in the following fundamental teachings one One supreme God is the Creator two man is closely akin to God three all else is created for man s best and noblest development Is the primary aim of these accounts to present scientific facts or to teach religious truths Paul says in Timothy that Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for instruction which is in righteousness Is their religious value even as in the parables of the New Testament entirely independent of their historical or scientific accuracy Is there any contradiction between the distinctive teachings of the Bible and modern science Do not the Bible and science deal with two different but supplemental fields of life the one with religion and morals the other with the physical world V MAN S CONQUEST AND RULERSHIP OF THE WORLD In the story of Genesis one man is commanded to subdue the earth and to have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that creeps upon the earth How far has man already subdued the animals and made them serve him How far has he conquered the so called natural forces and learned to utilize them Is the latter day conquest of the air but a step in this progress Are all inventions and developments of science in keeping with the purpose expressed in Genesis one Does the command imply the immediate or the gradual conquest of nature Why Do science and the Bible differ or agree in their answers to these questions VI MAN S RESPONSIBILITY AS THE RULER OF THE WORLD Consider the different ways in which the Biblical accounts of creation state that man is akin to God In the one account man was created in the image of God in the other Jehovah formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils his own life giving breath In what sense is man God like Are all men made in the image of God Does this story imply that every man has the right and capacity to become God like A high official of China whose power of authority extends to questions of life and death is called the father and mother of his people If he fails in the responsibility which his authority imposes upon him and the people in consequence create a disturbance he is severely punished sometimes by death Does authority always imply responsibility Of what value to man is the conquest of the forces of nature President Roosevelt said that he considered the conservation of the natural resources of the United States the most important question before the American people Is this political question also a religious question Why did God give man authority over the animal world Does the responsibility that comes from this authority rest upon every man One of the laws of the Boy Scouts reads A scout is kind He is a friend to animals He will not kill nor hurt any living creature needlessly but will strive to save and protect all harmless life Is this a practical application of the teaching in Genesis one If God s purpose is to make everything good man s highest privilege as well as duty is to company operate with him in realizing that purpose Are men to day as a whole growing happier and nobler In what practical ways may a man contribute to the happiness and ennobling of his fellow men Is your community growing better What would be the result if you and others like yourself did your best to improve conditions If so how Questions for Further Consideration Is man s possession of knowledge and power the ultimate object of creation If not what is Does human experience suggest that man s life on earth is in its ultimate meaning simply a school for the development of individual character and for the perfecting of the human race Is there any other practical way in which a man can serve God except by serving his fellowmen If so how Subjects for Further Study one The Origin and Content of the Babylonian Stories of Creation Hastings Dictionary of the Bible

none	none	Morality and religion were rarely combined

none	none	Sin as represented in Genesis three was the result of individual choice It was yielding to the common rather than the nobler impulses to desire rather than to the sense of duty 
1337_156963_000020_000006	train-clean-360	The temptation came from within rather than from without and the responsibility of not choosing the best rested with the individual 
none	none	The explanation is as simple and as true to human experience to day as in the childhood of the race The Persian religion on the contrary conceived of the world as controlled by two hostile gods with their hosts of attendant angels 
1337_156963_000021_000001	train-clean-360	One god Ormuzd was the embodiment of light and goodness The other Ahriman represented darkness and evil 
1337_156963_000021_000002	train-clean-360	They traced all sin to the direct influence of Ahriman and the evil spirits that attended him 
none	none	During the Persian period a somewhat similar explanation of the origin of evil appeared in Jewish thought Satan who in the book of Job appears to be simply the prosecuting attorney of heaven began to be thought of as the enemy of man until in later times all sin was traced directly or indirectly to his influence This was the conception prevalent among the Puritans This view tended to relieve man of personal responsibility for he was regarded as the victim of assaults of hosts of malignant spirits Does your knowledge of the heart of man confirm the insight of the prophet who speaks through the wonderful story of Genesis three III THE ORIGIN OF SIN ACCORDING TO THE STORY IN GENESIS three In your judgment is the story of the man and the woman in Genesis three a chapter from the life of a certain man and woman or a faithful reflection of universal human experience Most of the elements which are found in the story may likewise be traced in earlier Semitic traditions The aim of the prophet who has given us the story was according to the view of certain interpreters to present in vivid concrete form the origin nature and consequences of sin This method of teaching was similar to that which Jesus used for example in the parable of Dives and Lazarus The tree of the knowledge of good and evil with the command not to eat of it apparently symbolizes temptation Is temptation necessary for man s moral development The serpent was evidently chosen because of its reputation for craft and treachery 
1337_156963_000024_000006	train-clean-360	The serpent s words represent the natural inclinations that were struggling in the mind of the woman against her sense of duty Note that in the story the temptation did not come to man through his appetite or his curiosity or his esthetic sense but through his wife whom God had given him

none	none	V GOD S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE SINNER Jehovah in the story evidently asked the man and woman a question the answer to which he already knew in order to give them an opportunity to confess their wrong doing Parents and teachers often seek to give the culprit the opportunity to confess his sin What is the attitude of the law towards the criminal who pleads guilty What is the reason for this attitude A loving parent or even the state might forgive an unrepentant sinner but the effect of the wrong doing upon the sinner and upon others may still remain While the man and woman remained conscious of their wrong doing though defiant to abide in Jehovah s presence was for them intolerable Are toil and pain essential to the moral development of sinners who refuse to confess their crime Are toil and pain in themselves curses or blessings to those who have done wrong The picture in Genesis three clearly implies that God s intention was not that man should suffer but that he should enjoy perfect health and happiness Jehovah s preparation of the coats of skin for the man and woman is convincing evidence that his love and care continued unremittingly even for the wrong doers Modern psychology is making it clear that the effect of sin upon the unrepentant sinner is to increase his inclination toward sinning But when a man in penitence for his sin has turned toward God and changed his relation to his fellow men God becomes to him a new Being with a nearness and intimacy impossible before May the Christian believe that this new sense of nearness and love to God is met by a corresponding feeling on God s part In the light of Christian experience is there not every reason to believe that God himself also enters into a new and joyous relationship with the man This thought was evidently in the mind of Jesus when be declared that there was joy in heaven over one sinner that repented VI THE EFFECT OF SIN UPON SOCIETY Men are often heard to remark that they are willing to bear the consequences of their sin Is it possible for any individual to experience in himself the entire result of his wrong doing In the Genesis story the woman s deliberate disobedience would seem to have had very direct influence upon her husband Mankind has almost universally come to regard certain acts as wrong and to prescribe definite modes of punishment Such decisions have come about not simply because of the effect of sin upon the individual but more especially because the sin of the individual affects society State the different influences that deter men from sin and note those which from your experience seem the strongest Questions for Further Consideration Is an act that is wrong for one man necessarily a sin if committed by another Are men s tendencies to sin due to their inheritance or to impulses which they share in common with brutes or to influences that come from their environment In the light of this discussion formulate your own definition of sin Is the final test of sin a man s consciousness of guilt or the ultimate effect of his act upon himself or upon society May the woman in the Garden of Eden be regarded as the prototype of the modern scientist Are there ways in which the scientist may sin in making his investigations Illustrate How about vivisection Does sin bring moral enlightenment Distinguish between Jesus attitude toward sin and toward the sinner What should be our attitude toward the sinner If the man and woman had frankly confessed their sin what by implication would have been the effect first upon themselves and second upon the attitude and action of God Does temptation to sin as in the case of Adam often come in the guise of virtue What is the value of confession to the sinner To society Subjects for Further Study one The

an offering to Jehovah And Abel also brought some of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat And Jehovah looked favorably upon Abel and his offering but for Cain and his offering he had no regard Therefore Cain was very angry and his countenance fell And Jehovah said to Cain Why art thou angry And why is thy countenance fallen If thou doest well is there not acceptance But if thou doest not well Does not sin crouch at the door And to thee shall be its desire But thou shouldst rule over it Then Cain said to Abel his brother Let us go into the field And while they were in the field Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him And when Jehovah said to Cain Where is Abel thy brother he said I know not am I my brother s keeper general four three nine Hist Bible And the Scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery and having set her in the midst they say unto Jesus Teacher this woman hath been taken in adultery in the very act Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such what then sayest thou of her And this they said trying him that they might have whereof to accuse him But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground And when they continued asking him he lifted himself and said unto them He that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her And again he stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground And they when they heard it went out one by one beginning from the eldest even unto the last and Jesus was left alone and the woman where she was in the midst And Jesus lifted himself up and said unto her Woman where

friend let their trampled instincts be genially tempted out in your atmosphere let their doubts know that you have doubted and their wonder feel that you have wondered Emerson But I still have a good heart and believe in myself and fellow men and the God who made us all Robert Louis Stevenson I THE MEANING OF THE STORY OF CAIN In Arabia and Palestine to day as in the past a man s prosperity or misfortune is universally regarded as the evidence of divine approval or disapproval Even Jesus disciples on seeing a blind man by the wayside raised the question Did this man sin or his parents Among the Arabs of the desert the tribal mark either tattooing or a distinctive way of cutting the hair insures the powerful protection of the tribe Each tribesman is under the most sacred obligation to protect the life of a member of his tribe or to avenge if need be with his own life blood every injury done him Without the tribal mark a man becomes an outlaw Many scholars therefore think that the mark placed upon Cain was not primarily a stigma proclaiming his guilt but rather a token that protected him from violence at the hands of Jehovah s people and compelled them to avenge any wrongs that might befall him In the light of these facts would it not seem possible that Cain s character and conduct are the reason why his offering was not accepted What is the meaning and purpose of Jehovah s question Where is Abel thy brother Is it probable that in the question Am I my brother s keeper the writer intended to assert the responsibility of society for the acts of its members In China where to day far more than in the West there exists the responsibility of neighbors those who fail to exert the proper influence over the character and conduct of a criminal neighbor often have their houses razed to the ground and the sites sown with salt Is society responsible for producing criminals How far am I personally responsible for my neighbor s acts II THE MAKING OF A CRIMINAL Paul said All men have sinned Are all men therefore criminals What constitutes a criminal Was Cain a criminal before he slew his brother Legally Morally Was Cain s motive in the worship of God truly religious or merely mercenary This portrait of Cain illustrates the fact that formal religious worship does not necessarily deter a man from becoming a criminal Sometimes men prominent in religious work become defaulters or commit other crimes Does this story suggest the fundamental reason why great crimes are sometimes committed by religious leaders The motive rather than the form is clearly the one thing absolutely essential in religious worship Was the slaying of Abel the result simply of jealousy or a sudden fit of anger or of a gradual deterioration of character Compare the gradual development of the criminal instincts in Shakespeare s Macbeth Think of the different influences tending to make criminals Most criminals are made before they reach the age of twenty one The development of the criminal is the result either of wrong education or the lack of right education Parents by their failure to guard carefully their children s associates and to develop in them habits of self control respect for the rights of others and a sense of social and civic obligation are perhaps more than any other class responsible for the growth of criminals In what ways does the State through its negligence also contribute to the making of criminals III THE CRIMINAL S ATTITUDE TOWARDS SOCIETY Every criminal act is anti social Few if any criminals realize this fact A superintendent of the Elmira Reformatory after years of experience said that he had never seen a criminal who felt remorse while criminals usually regretted being caught they always excused their crime The criminal repudiates his social obligations not acknowledging the fact that the basis of all society is the recognition of the rights of others The thief often excuses his acts by asserting that society owes him a living Is this position right or do you agree with the following statement The criterion of what is for the benefit of the community at large must be settled by the community itself not by an individual The citizen then may and must do what the community determines it is best for him to do he must stand in the forefront of battle if so ordered He must not do what the State forbids he may be deprived of liberty and life if he does Jenks IV THE WAYS IN WHICH SOCIETY DEALS WITH THE CRIMINAL Cain s punishment was banishment rather than imprisonment What was the fate that Cain specially feared Cain and Abel in the original story some writers believe represented tribes see Hist Bible I forty four Among nomadic peoples in the early East as to day the punishment of murder was left to the family or tribe of the murdered man Was this just or effective The same crude method of avenging wrongs is found in the vendetta of Italy and the family feuds in certain sparsely settled regions in the United States The survival of this institution is to day one of the greatest obstacles to civilization in those regions Why In most criminal legislation the chief emphasis is placed on punishment For example thieves are punished with imprisonment Why A radical change in public opinion is now taking place The prevailing method of dealing with crimes advocated by penologists to day is the protection of society if possible by the reform of the criminal Does this method protect society effectually Why is it that criminals generally prefer a definite term in prison rather than an indefinite sentence with the possibility of release in less than half the time Which method of treatment is best in the end for the wrong doer It is important to distinguish clearly between the private and the official attitude toward the criminal As individuals who cannot know the motives we should heed the maxim of Jesus Judge not As public officials whose duty it is to protect society we are under obligation to deal firmly and effectively with the criminal What would probably have been the result had Cain confessed his crime God was far more lenient even with the unrepentant Cain than were his fellow men Did God however remit Cain s sentence Cain said I shall become a fugitive and a wanderer on the face of the earth Was this sense of being an outcast the most painful element in Cain s punishment All crime thus in a sense brings its own punishment If in placing upon Cain a tribal mark thereby protecting him from being killed God apparently aimed to give him an opportunity to reform the clear implication is that the divine love and care still follow him That love and that care never cease toward even the most depraved Compare Jesus attitude toward the criminal as illustrated in his ministry and especially in his dealing with the woman taken in adultery His forgiveness of the woman s sin did not cancel the social results but gave her a new basis for right living in the future She realized that some one believed in her Is this one of the most important influences to day in assisting weak men and in redeeming criminals Henry Drummond when asked the secret of his success with men said I love men V HOW TO DEAL WITH CRIMINALS The purpose of criminal legislation and administration is clearly the protection of society The criminals are punished not for the mere sake of the punishment or for vengeance but to deter them from further crime or to serve as a warning to others Only on this account can punishment be justified To prove an effective warning the punishment for crime should be certain prompt and just For these reasons effective police upright judges and fair methods of procedure are absolutely essential Efforts should be made not to influence the courts by public opinion and the pernicious prejudgment of cases by popular newspapers should be discountenanced The surest method of stopping a criminal s dangerous activity is to reform him to give him a new and absorbing interest Experience at our best reformatories shows that with the indeterminate sentence a very large majority of young criminals can be transformed into safe and useful citizens This method is both cheaper and more effective than direct punishment for fixed terms VI THE PREVENTION OF CRIME The best method of dealing with crime is that of prevention The work of protecting society against crime should begin with arousing parents to the sense of their responsibilities and by training them thoroughly in the duties of parenthood Philanthropic agencies the church the schools the State may do much both by training character and by removing temptation The maintenance of good economic conditions provision for wholesome amusements improved sanitation all tend to remove pernicious influences and strengthen the power of resistance to temptation The public press and the theatre which are at times exceedingly harmful agencies may be and should be transformed into active moral forces In furthering all these reform measures and preventive movements each individual has a personal responsibility and as an active citizen he may render most important service The home the school the church and the State all touch the individual on every side and create and together control the influences that make or unmake character Questions for Further Consideration What was the effect of Cain s anger upon his own life Gladstone said I do not have time to hate anybody In what way do anger and hatred hamper one s greatest usefulness Do you believe in the modern theories regarding the effect of jealousy and hatred upon the body Is capital punishment at times a necessity What is the most effective argument which can be used to restore honor and manhood to a criminal Is there any particular agency at work in your community to assist men who have committed crimes Is the chief object of punishment to avenge the wrong to punish the criminal to deter others from committing similar crimes or to reclaim the wrong doer Subjects for Further Study one The Effect of the Semitic Law of Blood revenge upon a the criminal b society and c possible criminals Kent Israel s Laws and Legal Precedents

2999_156967_000019_000000	train-clean-360	These fundamental variations and the presence of duplicate versions of the same incidents point some writers think to two originally distinct accounts of the flood which have been closely woven together by the final editor of the book of Genesis 
none	none	When these two accounts are disentangled they are each practically complete and apparently represent variant versions of the same flood story See Hist Bible I fifty three fifty six for these two parallel accounts The one known as the prophetic version was written these writers believe about six hundred fifty B C

none	none	At the end when he had determined by sending out birds that the waters had subsided he went forth from the ark and reared an altar and offered sacrifice to Jehovah of every clean beast and bird The other and more detailed account is apparently the sequel of the late priestly narratives found in Genesis one and five 
2999_156967_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The style is that of a legal writer formal exact and repetitious 
2999_156967_000020_000002	train-clean-360	In this account only two of each kind of beast and bird are taken into the ark

2999_156967_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The older Babylonian account is found in the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh epic which comes from the library of Asshurbanipal

2999_156967_000023_000004	train-clean-360	In response to Gilgamesh s question as to how he a mortal attained immortality the Babylonian Noah recounts the story of the flood 
2999_156967_000023_000005	train-clean-360	It was brought about by the Babylonian gods in order to destroy the city of Shurippak situated on the banks of the Euphrates

2999_156967_000025_000000	train-clean-360	A detailed account then follows of the building of the ark 
2999_156967_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Its dimensions were one hundred and twenty cubits in each direction It was built in six stories each of which was divided into nine parts 
2999_156967_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Plentiful provisions were next carried on board and a great feast was held to commemorate the completion of the ark

none	none	Then When the seventh day arrived I sent forth a dove and let it loose The dove went forth but came back Because it found no resting place it returned Then I sent forth a swallow but it came back Because it found no resting place it returned Then I sent forth a raven and let it loose The raven went forth and saw that the waters had decreased It fed it waded it croaked but did not return Then I sent forth everything in all directions and offered a sacrifice I made an offering of incense on the highest peak of the mountain Seven and seven bowls I placed there And over them I poured out calamus cedar wood and fragrant herbs The gods inhaled the odor The gods inhaled the sweet odor The gods gathered like flies above the sacrifice At the intercession of Ea the Babylonian Noah and his wife were granted immortality and permitted to dwell in the distance at the confluence of the streams A later version of the same Babylonian flood story is quoted by Eusebius from the writings of the Chaldean priest Berossus who lived about the fourth century B C According to this version the god Kronos appeared in a dream to Xisuthros the hero who like Noah in the priestly account was the last of the ten ancient Babylonian kings 
2999_156967_000032_000002	train-clean-360	At the command of the god he built a great ship fifteen stadia long and two in width 
2999_156967_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Into this he took not only his family and provisions but quadrupeds and birds of all kinds When the flood began to recede he sent out a bird which quickly returned

2999_156967_000032_000005	train-clean-360	When the third bird failed to return he took off the cover of the ship and found that it had stranded on a mountain of Armenia

none	none	III HISTORY OF THE BIBLICAL FLOOD STORIES 
2999_156967_000036_000000	train-clean-360	On the basis of the preceding comparisons some writers attempt to trace tentatively the history of the flood tradition current among the peoples of southwestern Asia 
2999_156967_000036_000001	train-clean-360	A fragment of the Babylonian flood story coming from at least as early as two thousand B C has recently been discovered 
2999_156967_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The probability is that the tradition goes back to the earliest beginnings of Babylonian history 
none	none	The setting of the Biblical accounts of the flood is also the Tigris Euphrates valley rather than Palestine 
2999_156967_000036_000004	train-clean-360	The description of the construction of the ark in Genesis six fourteen sixteen is not only closely parallel to that found in the Babylonian account but the method the smearing of the ark within and without with bitumen is peculiar to the Tigris Euphrates valley 
2999_156967_000036_000005	train-clean-360	Many scholars believe therefore that Babylonia was the original home of the Biblical flood story 
2999_156967_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Its exact origin however is not so certain 
2999_156967_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Many of its details were doubtless suggested by the annual floods and fogs which inundate that famous valley and recall the primeval chaos so vividly pictured in the corresponding Babylonian story of the creation 
2999_156967_000037_000002	train-clean-360	It may have been based on the remembrances of a great local inundation possibly due to the subsidence of great areas of land 
2999_156967_000037_000003	train-clean-360	In the earliest Hebrew records there is no trace of this tradition although it may have been known to the Aramean ancestors of the Hebrews 
none	none	The literary evidence however suggests that it was first brought to Palestine by the Assyrians During the reactionary reign of Manasseh Assyrian customs and Baylonian ideas which these conquerors had inherited inundated Judah 
2999_156967_000037_000006	train-clean-360	Even in the temple at Jerusalem the Babylonians gods the host of heaven were worshipped by certain of the Hebrews 
2999_156967_000037_000007	train-clean-360	The few literary inscriptions which come from this period those found in the mound at Gezer are written in the Assyrian script and contain the names of Assyrian officials 
2999_156967_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Later when the Jewish exiles were carried to Babylonia they naturally came into contact again with the Babylonian account of the flood but in its later form as the comparisons already instituted clearly indicate 
none	none	It is thus possible these scholars believe to trace in outline at least the literary history of the Semitic flood story in its various transformations through a period of nearly two thousand years IV 
2999_156968_000001_000000	train-clean-360	AIM OF THE BIBLICAL WRITERS IN RECOUNTING THE FLOOD STORY 
none	none	The practical question which at once suggests itself is What place or right has this ancient Semitic tradition if such it is among the Biblical narratives At best the historical data which it preserves are exceedingly small and of doubtful value 
2999_156968_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Is it possible that the prophetic and priestly historians found these stories on the lips of the people and sought in this heroic way to divest them of their polytheistic form and in certain respects immoral implications 
none	none	A minute comparison of the Babylonian and Biblical accounts indicates that this may perhaps be precisely what has been done but the majestic just God of the Biblical narratives is far removed from the capricious intriguing gods of the Babylonian tradition who hang like flies over the battlements of heaven stupefied with terror because of the destruction which they had wrought Each of the Biblical narrators seems to be seeking also by means of these illustrations to teach certain universal moral and religious truths 
2999_156968_000003_000001	train-clean-360	In this respect the two variant Biblical narratives are in perfect agreement 
2999_156968_000003_000002	train-clean-360	The destruction of mankind came not as the fiat of an arbitrary Deity but because of the purpose which God had before him in the work of creation and because that purpose was good 
2999_156968_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Men by their sins and wilful failure to observe his benign laws were thwarting that purpose 
2999_156968_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Hence in accord with the just laws of the universe their destruction was unavoidable and it came even as effect follows cause 
2999_156968_000003_000005	train-clean-360	On the other hand these ancient teachers taught with inimitable skill that God would not destroy that which was worthy of preservation 
none	none	In each of the accounts the character of Noah stands in striking contrast with those of his contemporaries 
2999_156968_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The story as told is not merely an illustration of the truth that righteousness brings its just reward but of the profounder principle that it is the morally fit who survive 
2999_156968_000004_000002	train-clean-360	In both of the versions Noah in a very true sense represents the beginning of a new creation he is the traditional father of a better race 
2999_156968_000004_000003	train-clean-360	To him are given the promises which God was eager to realize in the life of humanity 
2999_156968_000004_000004	train-clean-360	In the poetic fancy of the ancient East even the resplendent rainbow which proclaimed the return of the sun after the storm was truly interpreted as evidence of God s fatherly love and care for his children 
2999_156968_000004_000005	train-clean-360	In the light of these profound religious teachings may any one reasonably question the right of these stories to a place in the Bible 
none	none	Did not Jesus himself frequently use illustrations drawn from earlier history or from nature to make clear his teachings 
2999_156968_000004_000007	train-clean-360	Is it not evidence of superlative teaching skill to use that which is familiar and therefore of interest to those taught in order to inculcate the deeper moral and religious truths of life 
none	none	V SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IN THE NATURAL WORLD 
2999_156968_000007_000000	train-clean-360	It is interesting and illuminating to note how the ancient Hebrew prophets in their religious teaching forecast the discoveries and scientific methods of our day 
2999_156968_000007_000001	train-clean-360	This was because they had grasped universal principles 
none	none	Since the memorable evening in July eighteen fifty eight in which the views of Darwin and Wallace on the principles of variation and selection in the natural world were sent to the Linnaean Society in London the leading scientists have laid great stress upon the doctrine of the survival of the fittest as the true explanation of progress in the natural world It was apparently made clear by Darwin and supported by sufficient evidence that any being if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself under the complex and somewhat varying conditions of life will have a better chance of surviving and thus be naturally selected 
2999_156968_000009_000000	train-clean-360	This principle since that day has been thoroughly worked out in practically all the important fields of both the plant and animal world 
2999_156968_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Moreover the doctrine of evolution dependent upon this principle has exerted so great an influence upon the process of investigation and thinking in all fields of activity that the resulting change in method has amounted to a revolution 
2999_156968_000009_000002	train-clean-360	The principle is applied not only in the field of biology but also in the realm of astronomy where we study the evolution of worlds and in psychology history social science where we speak of the development of human traits and of the growth of economic political and social institutions 
none	none	It is necessary to remember in applying such a brief statement of a principle that the words are used in a highly technical sense The word fittest by no means need imply the best from the point of view of beauty or strength or usefulness in nature nor does it necessarily mean in reference to society best from the point of view of morals or a higher civilization Rather the fittest means the being best adapted to the conditions under which it is living or to its environment As a matter of fact it is the general opinion that in practically all fields this principle works toward progress in the highest and best sense but it is always a matter for specific study as well as of great scientific interest and importance to determine where and how the variation and the corresponding selection tend to promote the morally good Especially is this true in the study of society where we should endeavor to see whether or not the fittest means also the highest from the moral and religious point of view The story of the flood gives us a most interesting example of the way in which the ancient Hebrews looked upon such a process of selection in the moral and religious world and taught it as a divine principle 
2999_156968_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It is therefore one of the most suggestive and interesting of the writings of the early Israelites 
none	none	VI THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IN SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE From our modern point of view the ancient Hebrew writers had a far deeper knowledge of moral and religious questions than of natural science They had a far keener sense of what was socially beneficial than of what was scientifically true However we may estimate their knowledge of geology and biology we must grant that their beliefs regarding the good and ill effects of human action have in them much that is universally true even though we may not follow them throughout in their theories of divine wrath and immediate earthly punishment of the wicked But is it not true almost invariably if we look at social questions of every kind in a comprehensive way that the survival of the fittest means the survival of the morally best That the religion which endures is of the highest type 
2999_156968_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Business success in the long run is so strongly based upon mutual confidence and trust that especially in these later days of credit organization the dishonest man or even the tricky man cannot prosper long 
2999_156968_000015_000003	train-clean-360	A sales manager of a prominent institution said lately that the chief difficulty that he had with his men was to make them always tell the truth 
2999_156968_000015_000004	train-clean-360	For the sake of making an important sale they were often inclined to misrepresent his goods 
none	none	But nothing he added will so surely kill all business as misrepresentation Even a gambling book maker on the race tracks in New York before such work was forbidden by law is said to have proudly claimed that absolute justice and honesty toward his customers was essential to his success and had therefore become the rule of his life Although it is sometimes said that the man who guides his life by the maxim Honesty is the best policy is in reality not honest at heart it must nevertheless be granted that in business the survival of the fittest means the survival of the most honest business man 
2999_156968_000016_000000	train-clean-360	It may perhaps have been true in the days of Machiavelli that cruelty and treachery would aid the unscrupulous petty despot of Italy to secure and at times to maintain his dukedom but certainly in modern days when in all civilized countries permanently prosperous government is based ultimately upon the will of the people the successful ruler can no longer be treacherous and cruel 
2999_156968_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Even among our so called spoils politicians and corrupt bosses who hold their positions by playing upon the selfishness of their followers and the ignorance and apathy of the public there must be rigid faithfulness to promises and at any rate the appearance of promoting the public welfare 
2999_156968_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Otherwise their term of power is short 
2999_156968_000017_000000	train-clean-360	If we look back through the history of modern times we shall find that the statesmen who rank high among the successful rulers of their countries are men of unselfish patriotism and almost invariably men of personal uprightness and morality and usually of deep religious feeling 
none	none	Think over the names of the great men of the United States and note their characters 
2999_156968_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Pick out the leading statesmen of the last half century in England Germany and Italy Do they not all stand for unselfish patriotic purpose in their actions and in character for individual honor and integrity 
2999_156968_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The same is true in our social intercourse 
2999_156968_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Brilliancy of intellect however important in many fields of activity counts for relatively little in home and social life if not accompanied by graciousness of manner kindness of heart uprightness of character 
2999_156968_000018_000002	train-clean-360	It may sometimes seem that the brilliant rascal succeeds that the unscrupulous business man becomes rich and that the hypocrite prospers through his hypocrisy 
none	none	If all society were made up of men of these low moral types would such cases perhaps be more often found than now In a society of hypocrites would the fittest for survival be the most skilful deceiver 
2999_156968_000018_000005	train-clean-360	Or even there would the adage There must be honor among thieves hold when it came to permanent organization 
2999_156968_000018_000006	train-clean-360	But whatever your answer society fortunately is not made up of hypocrites or rascals of any kind 
2999_156968_000018_000007	train-clean-360	With all the weakness of human nature found in every society the growing success of the rule of the people throughout the world proves that fundamentally men and women are honest and true 
2999_156968_000018_000008	train-clean-360	Generally common human nature is for the right 
2999_156968_000018_000009	train-clean-360	Almost universally if a mooted question touching morals can be put simply and squarely before the people they will see and choose the right 
none	none	Fortunate it is for the world that the lessons taught by the early Hebrew writers regarding the survival of the moral and upright are true and that good sense and religion both agree that in the long run honor and virtue and righteousness not only pay the individual but are essential to the prosperity of a nation Questions for Further Consideration Had most primitive peoples a tradition regarding the flood

3547-156969-0007	train-other-500	finds in the different accounts of the same events or teachings in the life of Jesus They suggest to many that the author of the book of Genesis was eager to preserve each and every story regarding Abraham

3547-156969-0008	train-other-500	as in the case of the Gospels they have been combined with great skill Sometimes as in the case of the expulsion of Hagar the two versions are introduced at different points in the life of the patriarch More commonly the two or more versions are closely interwoven
3547-156969-0009	train-other-500	giving a composite narrative that closely resembles Tatian s Diatessaron which was one continuous narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus based on quotations from each of the four Gospels Fortunately if this theory is right

3547-156969-0013	train-other-500	migrated from the land of Aram to seek for themselves and their descendants a permanent home in the land of Canaan Abraham whose name in Hebrew means Exalted Father or as it was later interpreted Father of a Multitude
none	none	 naturally represents this historic movement but the story of his call and settlement in Canaan has a larger meaning and value It simply and vividly illustrates the eternal truths that one God guides those who will be guided two He reveals himself alone to those who seek a revelation three His revelations come along the path of duty and are confined to no place or land

Hist Bible I one hundred one twenty one Hastings Dict Bible II five hundred twenty six five hundred thirty five Prin of Politics Ch II Now as the boys grew Esau became a skilful hunter but Jacob was a quiet man a dweller in tents And Isaac loved Esau for he had a taste for game and Rebekah loved Jacob Once when Jacob was preparing a stew Esau came in from the field and he was faint therefore Esau said to Jacob Let me eat quickly I pray some of that red food for I am faint Therefore his name was called Edom Red But Jacob said Sell me first of all your birthright And Esau replied Alas I am nearly dead therefore of what use is this birthright to me And Jacob said Swear to me first so he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob Then Jacob gave Esau bread and stewed lentils and when he had eaten and drank he rose up and went his way Thus Esau despised his birthright Hist Bible Charles Darwin when asked for the secret of his success said It s dogged as does it Oh well for him

South of the Dead Sea bounded by the rocky desert on the east and the hot barren Arabah on the west extends the wild picturesque range of Mount Seir It is a land of lofty heights and deep almost inaccessible valleys the home of the hunter and the nomad From a few copious springs there issue clear refreshing brooks which run rippling through the deep ravines but soon lose themselves in their hot gravelly beds A few miles further on they emerge and again disappear as they approach the borders of the hot thirsty wilderness that surrounds Mount Seir on every side Here in early times lived the Edomites a nomadic people who established themselves in this borderland of Palestine long before the Hebrews gained a permanent foothold in the land of Canaan The name Edom is found in an inscription of a king of the eighth Egyptian Dynasty In the Biblical narrative Esau evidently is the traditional ancestor of the Edomites even as Jacob figures as the father of the twelve tribes One of the aims of these narratives it seems to many scholars is to explain why the Israelites the younger people who settled latest in Palestine ultimately possessed the land and conquered the Edomites The portraits of Esau and Jacob are remarkably true to the characteristics of these two rival nations They are also faithful to human nature as we find it to day Of these two brothers which on the whole is the more attractive Which resembles his father and which his mother Read the accounts of their lives general twenty four twenty seven What noble virtues does Esau possess What was his great fault Reckless men or drifters with generous impulses but with no definite purpose of whom gypsies and hoboes are extreme types are found in every age and society Why is it that men of the type of Esau so often in time become criminals II THE MAN WITH A WRONG AMBITION The modern tendency to idealize the character of Jacob simply because he was one of the famous patriarchs is both unfortunate and misleading Although he vividly typifies certain characteristics of his race the Jacob of these early prophetic accounts is portrayed with absolute fidelity and realism His faults are revealed even more clearly than his virtues The dominant motive in his life is ambition but it is a thoroughly selfish ambition In the light of the stories state in your own words what was the exact nature of Jacob s ambition How did it differ from that of Abraham What methods did he use to achieve his ambition Were these methods justifiable What is your view of the statement The end justifies the means Try to define exactly the method of determining justifiable means May Jacob s action be excused because he was acting under the direction of his mother Does a man with a selfish ambition always injure others Does he in the end injure himself most of all How Every type of selfishness is directly opposed to a man s highest self interest Jesus continually had this large truth in mind when he declared He that findeth his life shall lose it but he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it Jesus himself illustrated this principle Cite other illustrations from history From your own observation or experience Was Jacob even with his wrong ambition a stronger and more promising character than his brother Esau Why Would you rather have your son a boy of strong character with vicious tendency or a weakling with harmless virtuous inclinations III JACOB S TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE Jacob s experiences as a fugitive well illustrate the homely proverb The way of the transgressor is hard He who deceived and cheated his brother soon became the victim of deception and fraud Most painful of all was the ever haunting sense of fear because of the consequences of his wrong acts that followed him even in his life as an exile and like a spectre confronted him as he returned again to the scenes of his boyhood These painful experiences were probably essential to the development of Jacob s character Are there any other ways in which men of this type can be led to appreciate that their ambitions are wrong Was Laban any more unjust or tricky in his dealing with Jacob than Jacob had been with Esau or than Jacob was with Laban Note the grim humor running through these stories They are the type of stories that would be especially appreciated when told by shepherds beside the camp fire The most significant point in these stories is that they declare that Jehovah s care and guidance followed the selfish deceiver even as he fled the consequences of his own misdeeds Why should that divine care shield him from the consequences of his misdeeds Do we find such instances to day How do you explain them What is the meaning of the story of Jacob s vision at Bethel What promising elements did Jehovah find in Jacob s character What practical lessons did Jacob learn during his sojourn in Aram Was Jacob really a hypocrite or did he in fact fail to see any inconsistency between his trickery and meanness and his worship of Jehovah A man may be sincere in his religious worship on Sunday and yet cheat a neighbor on Monday Analyze carefully the nature of his religion IV THE INVINCIBLE POWER OP AMBITION AND PERSEVERANCE History and modern life abound in illustrations of what can be accomplished by the combination of ambition and perseverance Cyrus the king of a little upland province through a remarkable series of victories became the undisputed master of south western Asia and laid the foundations of the great Persian Empire Julius Caesar who transformed Rome from a republic into an empire and Napoleon the Corsican are the classic illustrations of the power of great ambition and dauntless persistency Far nobler is that quiet courageous perseverance which led Livingston through the trackless swamps and forests of Africa and blazed the way for the conquest of the dark continent Equally significant is that noble ambition coupled with heroic perseverance that has enabled settlement workers to bring light to the darkest parts of our great cities Ambition without persistency is but a dream or hope Observe Jacob s persistency in the Biblical stories Does persistency which has always been a marked characteristic of the Hebrew race largely explain the achievements of the Jews throughout the world Note the apparently scientific knowledge regarding breeding of lambs by Jacob in his dealings with Laban Is it a fact recognized by science to day If he knew this and Laban did not can you justify his acts Can you justify the act of the director of a corporation who uses his prior knowledge of the business of his corporation to make profit from buying or selling its stocks Who loses Is he a trustee for their interests What is the meaning of the strange story of Jacob s midnight struggle with the angel Hist Bible I one hundred nineteen twenty What lessons did Jacob learn from this struggle Would you call Jacob a truly religious man according to his light and training or were his religious professions only hypocritical May he have been sincere but have had a wrong conception of religion What is hypocrisy Did Jacob s faith in Jehovah in the end prove the strongest force in his life Is there any trace in his later years of the selfish ambition which earlier dominated him What are his chief interests in the latter part of his life Did he become the strong and noble character that he might have been had he from the first been guided by a worthy ambition Were the misfortunes that came to him in his old age due largely to his own faults reappearing in the characters of his sons V THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AMBITION In the ultimate analysis it is the man s motive which determines his character as well as his acts As he thinketh within himself so is he Prov twenty three seven Man looketh on the outward appearance but Jehovah on the heart I Sam sixteen seven With many men the strongest motive is the desire to surpass others It not only leads them to perform certain acts but in so doing shapes their habits and character is largely the result of man s habitual way of acting Jacob grew up narrow and crafty because of the selfish dwarfing nature of his ambition At first his ambition was of a low type that of the child which desires to acquire possessions and power simply for himself In the child this impulse is perfectly natural In the normally developed individual during the years of early adolescence the years of fourteen to sixteen the social and altruistic impulses begin to develop and to take the place of those which are purely egoistic or selfish When the fully developed man fails as did Jacob to leave behind childish things and retains the ambitions and impulses of the child his condition is pitiable Men of this type of ambition often achieve great things from the economic or political point of view Economically they are of greater value to society than the drifter Sometimes however they bring ruin and disaster to society as well as to themselves Despots like Herod the Great and Napoleon corrupt political bosses who play into the hands of certain classes at the expense of the general public and men who employ grafting methods in business or politics belong to this class VI THE DEVELOPMENT OF RIGHT AMBITIONS The desire to spare one s energies is natural to man To gain wealth with the least expenditure of energy is said to be the chief economic motive Most men are by nature lazy This law of inertia applies not only in the physical world but also in the intellectual moral and spiritual fields The great majority of men follow the line of least resistance In politics and morals they accept the standards of their associates Unconsciously they join the great army of the drifters or followers who preserve the traditions of the past but contribute little to the future progress of the race To deliver man from the control of his natural inertia he must be touched by some strong compelling power Ambition is one great force that enables most men to overcome this inertia The influences therefore which kindle ambition are among the most important which enter the life of man In the Orient the mother stands in especially close relation to the son How far was Jacob s desire to surpass his brother inspired by his mother Many of the world s greatest leaders trace the impulse which has led them to achieve directly to their parents and especially to their mothers The mother of Charles and John Wesley is but one of the many mothers to whom the human race owes an inestimable debt Of all the heritages which parents can leave their children none is greater than a worthy ambition Sometimes it is the personality of a great teacher which inspires the youthful ambition and directs it in lines of worthy achievement How much of England s greatness may be traced to the quiet influence of Arnold of Rugby Consider the unparalleled influence of Socrates Plato Aristotle all primarily teachers The true pastor with the spirit of a prophet is often able to guide those with whom he comes into intimate contact to great fields of service In encouraging Sophia Smith to found Smith College that quiet New England pastor the Reverend John M Greene won a high place among those in America who first appreciated the importance of education of woman Equally great opportunities may lie before every pastor and teacher and citizen Frequently it is the contact through literature or in life with men or women who have done heroic deeds or have won success in the face of great obstacles that kindles the youthful ambition and stirs the latent motives which in turn develop strong and noble characters Therein lies the perennial value of the Biblical narratives For many men that which arouses their ambitions is the call of a great opportunity or responsibility Note the change in General Grant s life with the outbreak of the Civil War The unambitious tanner becomes the untiring rigid unconquerable soldier Striking illustrations of this fact are many men whose character as well as conduct after they have been called to positions of political or judicial trust is in marked contrast to their previous record A corrupt lawyer has sometimes become an upright judge The pride of office the traditions of the bench have sustained him It is the privilege and duty of each man by thoughtful deliberation and study to shape and develop his own individual ambitions that they may conform to the highest ideals and thus guide him to the noblest and most worthy achievement Of what value to a man is biography in forming his ambitions Mention some biographies that you consider of the greatest help In what ways are the life and teachings of Jesus of practical service in developing the ambitions of a man to day Questions for Further Consideration Is it possible for a man without ambition to develop or to achieve anything really significant In your judgment what percentage of the men in your community really think out and carefully plan their lives What proportion drift or take the way shown them by others Some people consider mental or moral inertia the chief force that sustains the corrupt political boss Is this true What proportion of the voters in your voting district actually study and appreciate the issues in each election What proportion of church members drift into their church membership and what proportion join only after a careful study of the relative merits of the different churches What are the chief ambitions that stir men to

none	none	It also emphasizes the necessity of being ready to do the work in accordance with the employer s wishes Ultimate success also requires knowledge and trained ability These however come through apprenticeship and a faithful improvement of opportunities The Hebrew sages with true insight emphasized the importance of knowledge but they taught also that wisdom which is not only knowledge but the power to apply it practically in the various relations of life was far more important What other qualities are essential to the highest success Is it very important that a man should have the right moral standards How do a man s habits affect his efficiency Is it only the genius who is able to attain the highest success to day in business and professional life

none	none	The dreams which Joseph told to his brothers reveal his high estimate of his own importance and were probably suggested by his father s attitude toward him They were indeed a revelation of the ambitions already stirring in the young boy s mind But Joseph required closer contact with real life in order to transform his ambitions into actual achievements Joseph gave his brothers cause for hatred toward him but their action in selling him to the Ishmaelites was by no means justifiable Nevertheless it brought to Joseph the experiences and opportunities absolutely essential to the attainment of his ultimate success Often what seem man s greatest misfortunes are in reality the door that opens to the new and larger opportunities In what two ways may a man meet misfortune III THE CALL OF A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

none	none	The ever recurring complaint of employers is the scarcity of good men especially of men able to exercise discretion in positions of responsibility Was it Joseph s skill in interpreting Pharaoh s dreams or his wise counsel in suggesting methods of providing for the people during famine that gave him his position of high trust and authority Was the policy which made Pharaoh practical owner of all the land first instituted by Joseph or was it already in force in Egypt Hist Bible I one hundred thirty three In the thought of the prophetic narrative was Joseph s fiscal system regarded as evidence of his loyalty to his master rather than of disloyalty to the interests of the people Was the system suited to that stage and kind of civilization Can this be cited by Socialists to day as a valid argument in favor of public ownership of all land If not why not Three principles illustrated by Joseph s life are true to all time one The only successful way to forget one s own burdens is to help bear another s two God makes all things work together for good to those that love him three he alone who improves the small opportunities will not miss the great chances of life IV THE TEMPTATIONS OF SUCCESS Modern life and especially that in America to day is full of illustrations of the overwhelming temptations which come to the man who has had great success Many a man has enjoyed the confidence and respect of his associates until his abilities have won for him large wealth with which apparently comes at times a misleading sense of immunity from the ordinary moral obligations The result has been that the sterling virtues which have enabled him to win success have been quickly undermined and his public and private acts have become the theme of the public press Instead of being an honor he has become a disgrace to his nation Joseph s sudden rise to power surpassed anything told in the Arabian Nights Tales and yet he remained the same simple unaffected man more thoughtful for another s interests than for his own The supreme test came in his contact with his brothers who had insulted and cruelly wronged him They were completely at his mercy and he had abundant reason for ignoring the obligations of kinship Did Joseph hide his cup in Benjamin s sack and later hold him as a hostage in order to punish his brothers or to test their honor and fidelity Was this action wise Did the brothers stand the test No class was regarded by the Egyptians with greater scorn and contempt than the shepherds to whom they entrusted their flocks because the task of herding sheep was regarded as too menial for an Egyptian The public recognition of his shepherd kinsmen therefore revealed in Joseph the noblest and most courageous qualities Why is such loyalty a primary obligation Is it to day regarded by all thoughtful men as one of the clearest evidences of a strong character Can you give any modern illustrations perhaps among your acquaintances What is a snob Did Joseph leave undone any act which loyalty to his kinsmen could prompt Is Joseph s character as portrayed by the prophetic account practically perfect Of the three characters Abraham Jacob and Joseph which offers more practical suggestions to the man of to day Which has exerted the most powerful influence upon the ideals and conduct of the human race V THE STANDARDS OF REAL SUCCESS It is natural and inevitable that the various social classes of each succeeding generation should define their standards of success concretely that is by the lives and achievements of those who have done great things In certain social groups the world s champion prize fighter is the beau ideal of success Among the Camorrists of Italy that ideal is the successful blackmailer In many sections of our great cities the powerful ward boss whatever be his methods is regarded as the embodiment of success Too often in America to day both in the public press and in the public mind the multi millionaire is regarded as the pre eminently successful man Although the power to amass wealth is evidence of marked ability the homage paid to it is one of the most sinister tendencies in American life Ordinarily it means that the ambitions and achievements of a Jacob rather than those of a Joseph are set before the youth as the supreme goal for which to strive A most hopeful element in the present situation is that many of the world s wealthiest men are proclaiming their sense of responsibility to society in ways both practical and impressive Far more significant than their actual gifts is this

achievement VI THE METHODS OF SUCCESS The story is told of the late President Garfield that in the heat of a political campaign one of his lieutenants suggested that he adopt an exceedingly questionable policy When mister Garfield objected his lieutenant replied No one will know it But I shall know was the quick reply To thine own self be true And it must follow as the night the day Thou canst not then be false to any man Hamlet Act I Sc three Wealth and power are worthy goals for which to strive One of the first duties of a political party is to capture the offices for without them in its power it cannot carry out the principles for which it stands The possession of wealth represents vast possibilities for service Thousands of tragic experiments have demonstrated however the fallacy of the seductive doctrine that the end justifies the means The tragedy that overshadows many of the seemingly most successful men of to day is the memory of the iniquitous methods whereby they have acquired wealth or mounted to power Lavish philanthropy and the beneficent use of power can never wholly blot out from the public mind or from the mind of the successful man the memory of certain questionable acts that at the time seemed essential to the realization of a great policy A keen well informed student of modern economic conditions has asserted that no man can succeed in business life today and remain true to the teachings of Jesus Is this true Is it true in professional life Is it true in politics One of our most prominent statesmen has said that he would have found it impossible to succeed and maintain his independence if he had been compelled to earn his living He would have been compelled either to yield to the boss or quit politics Who are some of the men in public life who are gaining success and yet maintaining Christian principles If the ultimate ideal of real success is service is there any other way in which men may obtain success Is this true of every department of human effort Does this principle make it possible for every man however limited his ability and opportunities to attain real success Questions for Further Consideration How would

presence of Pharaoh and took up his abode in the land of Midian And Jehovah said I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt and have heard their cry of anguish because of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the power of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a land beautiful and broad to a land flowing with

it Lincoln I THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE The one contemporary reference to Israel thus far found in the Egyptian inscriptions comes from the reign of Merneptah the son of Ramses II It implies that at the time at least part of the Hebrews were in the land of Palestine Plundered is Canaan with every evil Askalon is carried into captivity Gezer is taken Yenoam is annihilated Israel is desolated her seed is not Palestine has become a widow for Egypt All lands are united they are pacified Every one who is turbulent has been found by King Merneptah The testimony of the oldest Biblical narratives regarding the sojourn of the Hebrews in Egypt is also in perfect accord with the picture which the contemporary Egyptian inscriptions give of the period Furthermore the Egyptian historians never distinguished the different races in their midst but rather designated the foreign serf class by a common name The absence of detailed reference to the Hebrews is therefore perfectly natural It seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which ultimately coalesced into the Hebrew nation found their way to Egypt The stories regarding Joseph the traditional father of Ephraim and Manasseh imply that these strong central tribes possibly together with the southern tribes of Benjamin and Judah were the chief actors in this opening scene in Israel s history The Biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in Egypt The reference in general fifteen sixteen which some writers think comes from the northern Israelite group of stories implies that it was a period of between one hundred and one hundred and fifty years The same duration is suggested by the priestly writer in Numbers twenty six fifty seven fifty nine The later traditions tend to extend the period If as seems probable the Hebrews first found their way to Egypt during the reign of Amenhotep IV who reigned between thirteen seventy five and thirteen fifty eight B C the older Hebrew chronology would make Ramses II who reigned between twelve ninety two and twelve twenty five the Pharaoh of the oppression Of all the Pharaohs of this period in Egypt s history the great builder and organizer Ramses II corresponds most closely to the Biblical description He it was who filled Egypt from one end to the other with vast temples and other buildings which could have been reared only through the services of a huge army of serfs The excavations of the Egypt Exploration fund have identified the Biblical Pithom with certain ruins in the Wady Tumilat near the eastern terminus of the modern railroad from Cairo to the Suez Canal This probably lay in the eastern boundary of the Biblical land of Goshen which seems to have included the Wady Tumilat and to have extended westward to the Nile delta Here were found several inscriptions bearing the Egyptian name of the city P Atum house of the god Atum The excavations also laid bare a great square brick wall with the ruins of store chambers inside These rectangular chambers were of various sizes and were surrounded by walls two or three yards in thickness Contemporary inscriptions indicate that they were filled with grain from the top and were probably used for the storing of supplies to be used by the armies of Ramses II in their Asiatic campaigns This city was founded by Ramses II who during the first twenty years of his reign developed and colonized the territory east of the Nile delta including the Biblical land of Goshen A contemporary inscription also states that he founded near Pithum the house of Ramses a city with a royal residence and temples Thus the inferences in the first chapter of Exodus regarding the historical background are in perfect accord with the facts now known from other sources regarding the reign of Ramses II In transforming the land of Goshen into a cultivated agricultural region the nomadic Hebrews were naturally put to task work by the strong handed ruler of Egypt That the Hebrews were restive under this tyranny was natural inevitable Apparently their rebellious attitude also increased the burden which was placed upon them The memory of the crushing Hyksos invasion which meant the rule of Egypt by nomadic invaders from Asia was still fresh in the minds of the Egyptians They both looked down upon and feared the nomad immigrants on their eastern border In the light of these facts it is possible to understand the motives which influenced Ramses II cruelly to oppress the Hebrews He endeavored by forced labor and rigorous peonage not only to avail himself of their needed services but also to crush their spirit and by force to hold in subjection the alarmingly large serf class which was found at this time in the land of Egypt Was any other procedure to be expected from a despotic ruler of that land and day II THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT The story of Moses birth and early childhood is one of the most interesting chapters in Biblical history It is full of human and dramatic interest The great crisis in Moses early manhood came when he woke to a realization of his kinship with the despised and oppressed serfs and an appreciation of the cruel injustice of which they were the helpless victims Was Moses justified in resisting the Egyptian taskmaster Are numbers essential to the rightness of a cause What right had Ramses II to demand forced labor from the immigrants within his border Was he justified in his method of exacting tribute Is peonage always disastrous not only to its victims but also to the government imposing it Did Moses show himself a coward in fleeing from the land of Egypt Naturally he went to the land of Midian The wilderness to the east of Egypt had for centuries been the place of refuge for Egyptian fugitives From about two thousand B C there comes the Egyptian story of Sinuhit an Egyptian prince who to save his life fled eastward past the Wall of the Princes which guarded the northeastern frontier of Egypt On the borders of the wilderness he found certain Bedouin herdsmen who received him hospitably These sand wanderers sent him on from tribe to tribe until he reached the land of Kedem east of the Dead Sea where he remained for a year and a half Later he found his way to the court of one of the local kings in central Palestine where he married and became in time a prosperous local prince III THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS The story of Moses is in many ways closely parallel to that of Sinuhit Among the Midianite tribes living to the south and southeast of Palestine he found refuge and generous hospitality The priest of the sub tribe of the Kenites received him into his home and gave him his daughter in marriage Note the characteristic Oriental idea of marriage Here Moses learned the lessons that were essential for his training as the leader and deliverer of his people The Kenites figure in later Hebrew history as worshippers of Jehovah and are frequently associated with the Israelites After the capture of Jericho certain of them went up with the southern tribes to conquer southern Palestine Judg one sixteen It was Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite Judg five twenty four who rendered the Hebrews a signal service by slaying Sisera the fleeing king of the Canaanites after the memorable battle beside the River Kishon Many modern scholars draw the conclusion from the Biblical narrative that it was from the Kenites that Moses first learned of Yahweh or as the distinctive name of Israel s God was translated by later Jewish scribes Jehovah Furthermore it is suggested that gratitude to the new God who delivered the Israelites from their bondage was the reason why they proved on the whole so loyal to Jehovah This conclusion is possible and in many ways attractive but it is beset with serious difficulties We know in ancient history of no other example of a people suddenly changing their religion When there have been such sudden and wholesale conversions in later times they have been either under the compulsion of the sword as in the history of Islam or under the influence of a far higher religion as when Christianity has been carried to heathen peoples on a low stage of civilization Do the earliest Hebrew traditions imply that the ancestors of the Israelites were worshippers of Jehovah Is it not probable that Moses fled to the nomadic Midianites not only because they were kinsmen but because they were also worshippers of Jehovah In any case Moses life in Midian tended to intensify his faith in Jehovah The title of his father in law implies that this priest ministered at some wilderness sanctuary In the light of the subsequent Biblical narrative was this possibly at the sacred spring of Kadesh or on the top of the holy mountain Horeb elsewhere called Sinai where Kenites and Hebrews believed that Jehovah dwelt or at least manifested himself Moses in the home of the Midian priest was brought into direct and constant contact with the Jehovah worship The cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in Egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training His quest was for a just and strong God able to deliver the oppressed The wilderness with its lurking foes and the ever present dread of hunger and thirst deepened his sense of need and of dependence upon a power able to guide the destinies of men The peasants of the vast Antolian plain in central Asia Minor still call every life giving spring God hath given The constant necessity of meeting the dangers of the wilderness and of defending the flocks entrusted to Moses care developed his courage and power of leadership and action What other great leaders of Israel were trained in this same school What was the effect of their wilderness life upon the early New England pioneers IV MOSES CALL TO PUBLIC SERVICE The solitude of the wilderness gave Moses ample opportunity for profound reflection His previous experiences made such reflection natural indeed inevitable Borne by the caravans over the great highway from the land of the Nile or from desert tribe to tribe came occasional reports of the cruel injustice to which his kinsmen in Egypt were subjected In these reports he recognized the divine call to duty When perhaps at last the report came that the mighty despot Ramses II was dead Moses like his later successor Isaiah Is six saw that the moment had come for decision and action It looks to many scholars as if three originally distinct versions of Moses call have been welded together in the narrative of Exodus three four and six Each differs in regard to detail Hist Bible I one hundred sixty one five According to the early Judean prophetic account Jehovah spoke audibly to Moses from the flaming thorn bush In the Northern Israelite version the moment of decision came to him as he stood with his flock on the sacred mountain Horeb Like Isaiah in his memorable vision of Jehovah s presence the inner consciousness of God and the compelling sense of duty led him to cry out Here am I Likewise in the late priestly story God s presence and character were so deeply impressed upon him that he seemed to bear an audible voice according to the view of those who accept this interpretation even though the later priests believed and taught that God was a spirit not like man clothed in flesh and blood Thus the different groups of Hebrew narratives in their characteristic way record the essential facts in Moses call to public service Each has preserved certain important elements in that call and the late editor has done well to combine them Even as Isaiah caught his supreme vision of Jehovah and of duty in the temple so to Moses the prophetic call probably came on the lofty heights of the mountain in which he in common with the Kenites believed God dwelt The wilderness with its flaming bush spoke to him God s message Recent writers have felt and forcibly interpreted the fascination and the message of the desert and plain none more vividly than the Welsh writer Rhoscomyl in describing the experience of one of his rough self reliant cowboy heroes Two days ago he was riding back alone in the afternoon from an unsuccessful search after strayed horses and suddenly all in the lifting of a hoof the weird prairie had gleamed into eerie life had dropped the veil and spoken to him while the breeze stopped and the sun stood still for a flash in waiting for his answer And he his heart in a grip of ice the frozen flesh a crawl with terror upon his loosened bones white lipped and wide eyed with frantic fear uttered a yell of horror as he dashed the spurs into his panic stricken horse in a mad endeavor to escape from the Awful Presence that filled all earth and sky from edge to edge of vision Then almost in the same flash the unearthly light died out of the dim prairie the veil swept across into place again and he managed to check his wild flight and look about him His empty lips were gibbering without a sound escaping them and his very heart shivered with cold for all the brassy heat of the day But the breeze was wandering on again under the great sun the prairie spread dim to the southwest and tawny to the northeast only between his own loose knees the horse trembled in every limb and mumbled the bit with dry mouth All was as before in earth and sky apparently but not in his own self It was as if his spirit stood apart from him putting questions which he could not answer and demanding judgment upon problems which he dare not reason out Then he remembered what this thing was which had happened The prairie had spoken to him as sooner or later it spoke to most men that rode it It was a something well known amongst them but known without words and as by a subtle instinct for no man who had experienced it ever spoke willingly about it afterwards Only the man would be changed some began to be more reckless as if a dumb blasphemy rankled hidden in their breasts Others coming with greater strength perhaps to the ordeal became quieter looking squarely at any danger as they face it but continuing ahead as though quietly confident that nothing happened save as the gods ordained The motive power in all of Moses later work was that transforming vivid sense of Jehovah s presence that came to him on the barren mountain peak Also fundamental to his call was the recognition of the crying need of his disorganized oppressed kinsmen in Egypt This appealed to all the instincts begotten by his shepherd training for they were a shepherdless flock in the midst of wolves Through the ages the inhabitants of the parched stony wilderness had looked with hungry eyes upon the tree clad hills and green fields of Palestine The early traditions of his ancestors also glorified this paradise of the wilderness wanderer and led Moses to look to it as the haven of refuge to which he might lead his helpless kinsmen Vividly and concretely the ancient narrative tells of the struggle in the mind of Moses between his own diffidence and consciousness of his limitations on the one side and on the other his sense of duty and the realization of Jehovah s power to accomplish what seemed to man miraculous Was Moses inner experience like that of the other great Hebrew prophets Who Like that of Jesus Does every man who undertakes a great service for humanity to day pass through a somewhat similar struggle How about Grant on leaving his home at Galena Illinois Lincoln at the great crisis of his life V THE EDUCATION OF PUBLIC OPINION Like every man who catches a vision of a great need and undertakes to meet it Moses had to educate public opinion Whatever the form of government may be whether monarchy or democracy it must ultimately rest upon the will of the people and the shaping of that will is often a statesman s task In a democracy the expression of the people s will is readily determined at every election although in many cases owing to the number of issues this result is not clearly seen In a despotism like Egypt there is no ready expression of a people s will However great their sufferings they must endure until they feel that the evils of revolt are less than the evils of oppression Then by means of a revolution they carry out their will In what ways did the Exodus resemble in what ways differ from a revolution Compare Moses with Washington or Samuel Adams as leader of a revolution During the last few years in China there has been great dissatisfaction on the part of many millions of the people with the rule of the Manchu dynasty It was nevertheless for many years the people s will rather to endure the evils of a corrupt government than to take the risk of war At length however after years of propaganda by skilful leaders war appeared to them the lesser evil and their will was carried out by force of arms The government in this direct way was forced to recognize the will of the people and to grant their requests A statesman considers not merely his own views regarding the best methods of governing his country or of gaining special ends but he must carefully consider also what plans can in practice be carried out In all free governments only those policies can be put into effect that meet the approval of the people and one of the greatest gifts of a statesman is the ability to ascertain with few mistakes how far his proposed policies meet the public will and how he can so put his plans before the people as to convince them of their benefits In the later days of the Egyptian bondage the Israelites made frequent complaint of the oppression of the Pharaohs bemoaning their fate as serfs but for many years after their sufferings had become severe they had not yet been roused to a determination to throw off the yoke of the oppressor Even when Moses first attempted to rouse them to make a struggle for freedom he could not breathe into them his own bold spirit What measures did Moses take to incite the Israelites to action What measures did he take to convince Pharaoh of his duty toward the Israelites Did he present his case truthfully Was he justified in the measures taken At length not from the acts of the Israelites but from the plagues that afflicted the Egyptians and the insistent demand of Moses coupled with the belief that the plagues were sent on account of divine displeasure as a punishment for unjust oppression the Hebrews were enabled to escape What is the contemporary Egyptian testimony regarding the plagues Hist Bible I one hundred seventy six seven Do the earliest Hebrew records imply that these were miracles or natural calamities peculiar to the land of Egypt The statesmanship of Moses led him to seize the opportune time for freeing his people from bondage Only the influence of the religious sentiments among his people and their belief in Jehovah together with the religious awe felt by the Egyptian rulers enabled him to take advantage of the circumstances so that he could rescue his people In most countries religion is a powerful influence often made use of by rulers sometimes for good sometimes for ill to direct the action of their subjects The Greek church in Russia has for many decades been perhaps the most important weapon by which the Russian Czars have kept their people in peaceful submission If China loses her Mongolian provinces it will be because the religious leaders of Mongolia are controlling their people Can you give in the United States an example of a people largely dominated by the religious motive which controls most of the affairs of their every day life How far was the religious motive responsible for the settlement and upbuilding of the New England Colonies How far and in what ways may a statesman to day appeal to the moral and religious feelings of the people in order to promote national and international welfare VI THE TRAINING OF MODERN STATESMEN In training administrative officers in the leading countries of Europe and in the United States emphasis is laid upon a knowledge of history of constitutional administrative and international law politics economics diplomacy and any other subjects that may fall within the scope of action of the special official When however a law maker or a high administrative official deals at first hand with a great population it is extremely important that he be so experienced and so fitted by temperament that he may know his people He must see how far he can go without arousing too much opposition Even in promoting good measures it is often essential not to go too fast if he is to succeed Every statesman of modern times as well as those of bygone days must have the interests of the people genuinely at heart if he is to be in the best sense of the word successful What did Moses seek for his people Liberty Prosperity Religious freedom Confucius the great Chinese sage from his study of human nature and of government five centuries before Christ had learned that the rule of justice in the state promoted prosperity At length a young ruler made him his prime minister The result of his wise and just measures was to bring into his country so large a number of immigrants who preferred to live in a country where justice reigned that the prosperity aroused the envy and hostility of the neighboring states In consequence measures were taken to put an end to this just rule which was felt to be so detrimental to other kings unwilling to adopt the same just means Finally the wise Confucius was treacherously driven from his post not however until he had proved that the counsels of justice and religion were those best suited to the welfare of the state This is a common experience in all lands and ages but perhaps nowhere else has the lesson been so frequently and so thoroughly taught as in the history of the Hebrews that the most essential factor in a statesman s training is the acceptance of the principles of justice and righteousness In other words God is the most important factor in human progress Questions for Further Consideration Is it the duty of a government in order to promote the welfare of its people to set aside at times the personal convenience even the personal welfare of individuals or of certain classes If an inheritance tax falls heavily upon the heirs of a rich man ought the state to collect it On what grounds is a state justified in withholding liberty from criminals From children Many of our states compel citizens to work in repairing country roads Is this temporary peonage How do you justify a state in compelling citizens to risk their lives in war In what circumstances would a state be justified in compelling its citizens to labor Did circumstances justify Pharaoh Why were he and his kingdom punished Is it ever right for an individual to raise his hand against a recognized and established authority Or when there is an established government should an individual ever attempt to punish crime or avenge personal wrong Were our revolutionary forefathers right in resisting the demands of King George Are numbers essential to the rightness of a cause In what ways does God to day call men to do an important task Do you consider Lincoln a man raised up by God for a purpose and called by him to service If so how did the call come Was Moses call similar Should a clergyman have a definite call to his life work Should every man Does every man have such a call if he but interprets rightly his experiences A working girl had seen the story of Moses at a moving picture show Afterwards she commented as follows Our walking delegate is a regular Moses He said to the factory boss You let my people go In what respect is the labor struggle to day similar to that

none	none	No better illustration of the crystallization of customs into laws can be found than that given in Exodus eighteen one twenty seven Hist Bible I one hundred ninety eight two hundred two Moses sat all day long as judge to decide cases for the people until his practical minded father in law Jethro seeing the waste of time and energy of the ruler upon whom the welfare of the tribe depended proposed a wise plan He advised that instead of rendering decisions regarding each individual case Moses should formulate the principles and leave their application to minor judges appointed by himself as rulers over thousands and over hundreds and fifties and tens In modern days the law making body is distinct from the judicial Is there any reason why the judge should not be the maker of the law he interprets Doubtless many of the customs thus formulated by Moses had come down through the preceding ages from the Babylonian and common Semitic ancestors of the Hebrews The most striking example of the pre Mosaic formulation of custom into law under the sanction of the deity is found in the so called code of Hammurabi which comes from about nineteen hundred B C At the top of the stele which records these laws this enlightened king depicted himself in a bas relief as receiving them from the sun god Shamash Hammurabi looked upon himself as a shepherd chosen by the gods to care for his people It was his duty to see that the great should not oppress the weak to counsel the widow and orphan to render judgment and decide the decisions of the land and to succor the injured in order that by the command of Shamash the judge supreme of heaven and earth justice might shine in the land Many of the principles laid down by him are also found among the laws attributed to Moses which were afterward codified in the early decalogues At times though rarely among the Hebrews we may study custom in the making as when in a new situation a ruler renders a decision which henceforth becomes a law Thus David dividing the spoil after his victory over the Amalekites established a precedent that henceforth had binding force upon his followers I Sam thirty but in the majority of such cases the ruler even when be establishes new precedents represents himself as simply interpreting ancient custom As society becomes more and more complex and the interests of individuals and classes in society clash besides the judges we find legislatures making new rules in the form of law In the earlier communities practically all law relates to the preservation of life and of the tribe 
3781_156977_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Later as the tribe enters the pastoral state private property is established and laws for its care are made 
none	none	Still later with the development of a higher civilization and with the individual conscience stimulating men to care for the welfare not merely of their family but of their nation legislation considers primarily the welfare of society Yet as one of our great judges has lately explained in practically all stages of society whenever the population becomes numerous and business is so developed that we may recognize different classes in a community legislation has been primarily in the interests of a ruling class often at the expense of the other classes This principle is illustrated by certain of the later Jewish ceremonial laws that brought to the priests a large income at the expense of the people Many laws in Europe and in the United States to day have been made clearly in the interests of certain classes in society Can you think of some III THE AUTHORITY UNDERLYING ALL LAW Back of all laws and rules as the fundamental consideration whether consciously expressed in laws or carried out instinctively lies the welfare of society Among the wolves the pack that is best disciplined by the strongest and most successful leader is the one that survives In the earlier savage groups the rules which guided united action grew up as a result of successful experience in securing food and warding off enemies 
3781_156977_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Among them the less disciplined the less intelligently directed groups perish 
none	none	Through his fear of the unknown stimulated by the terrible vindications of nature s laws when poison and pestilence and storms and floods do their deadly work the savage feels the presence of unknown forces that he calls gods and he thus gives to his rules of action the sanction of divinity And as society develops through the pastoral agricultural and industrial stages into the tribe and state with the development of religion and the growing sense of right and of responsibility to one s fellow men this religious sanction of the law still abides In the earlier days the sanction was due to fear of the vengeance of the gods In later society it is the sense of right and justice and love for one s fellow men springing from the firm belief in the divine creation and direction of the universe and in God s care for men 
3781_156977_000029_000000	train-clean-360	But as this sense of fear or right or justice or love associated with a Being felt to be divine is not universal inasmuch as many members of society are found ready to act selfishly taking the law into their own hands force is needed in all stages of society to put the rules and laws into effect

generally known as the laws of Moses and the assumption of many readers in earlier years has been that the different codes were practically formulated by Moses himself The subsequent study of the Old Testament long ago suggested to many that this view may be mistaken The oldest records of his work and the fact that as creator of the Hebrew nation after the Exodus and as leader and prophet be rendered important judicial decisions have well justified the belief that he was the real founder of what is called the Mosaic Law As stated in Exodus eighteen he did actually formulate the principles by which decisions were made by the rulers whom he appointed over thousands and over hundreds fifties and tens He may have even put into form the principles found in the earliest decalogues Moreover as the Israelites in their later history were led to formulate new rules of action they based these upon the principles of justice religion and civil equality found in the earlier decalogues While the specific rules of living must have changed materially as the Israelites changed their habits of living from those of wanderers in the wilderness to those adapted to their early settlements in Canaan and afterward to the settled conditions under the monarchy they would still base their laws upon these earlier principles Hence it was not unnatural to ascribe the origin of these laws to Moses nor is it to day inaccurate to speak of them as the Mosaic code even though they may have been put into their present form at different periods remote from one another and by rulers prophets and priests whose occupations and attitude toward life were widely different Back of practically all these laws are the fundamental beliefs that the Israelites are the people chosen of God that to him they owe allegiance and that from him they derive in principle at least the laws under which they live V THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN LAW Not merely the Hebrews but practically all ancient nations ascribe the origin of their laws either to a deity or to some great ancestral hero As already noted the code of Hammurabi is represented as having been given to him directly by the god Shamash In the early days of Greek history the laws of Solon and Draco were formulated In India we find the laws of Manu in China the teachings of Confucius and so on throughout all of the great nations In some instances doubtless many of the laws were actually formulated under the direction of the person to whom they are ascribed but in many others as perhaps in the case of the Mosaic code there was some great judge or king under whose direction certain principles were laid down and simple laws or precedents established and as a result all later developments were ascribed to him In modern times when legislative bodies are found in limited monarchies as well as in republics the methods of legislation are necessarily different Although chosen bodies of men come together to legislate for the benefit of society as represented by the state there is still a normal tendency for the ruling class to feel that it is to a great extent the state and it does not forget its own needs This class legislation was doubtless existent to a certain extent even when the laws supposed to be of divine origin were formulated by prophets and priests for the real public character of the laws was dependent primarily upon the unselfish beliefs social and religious of the writers whether kings or priests No one is able to free himself entirely from the influence of class prejudice Like the legislatures the courts even are also the product of their times though naturally conservative No law can long exactly fit changing conditions The judge must adapt a law made by one generation to the needs of the next In so doing he bends it to suit his times and to further the welfare of his state If aeroplanes carrying goods from Pennsylvania to New York over the State of New Jersey let them fall and damage the property of a resident of New Jersey can our courts invoke the Interstate Commerce Law made before aeroplanes were invented And yet there has been throughout the individual history of each nation a gradual improvement in the living conditions of the masses of people even in the tribal state As it proved more profitable to preserve a worker than to kill him captives in war were not slain but enslaved As society became more settled the custom of personally avenging one s wrong by slaying an enemy was modified Cities of refuge were established where innocent victims might escape the avengers All down through the ages there has been a growing tendency to adapt the punishment to the crime to temper justice with mercy to realize that the aim of all law is not vengeance or punishment but the promotion of the best interests of society through the wise administration of justice VI THE ATTITUDE OP THE CITIZENS TOWARD THE LAW Among savages as has been said there is no formulation of law There is the instinct of the individual to preserve his own life and there are rules that must be followed if the people are to survive As has been truly said The love of justice is simply in the majority of men the fear of suffering injustice The instinct of preservation and sheer necessity compel the people almost unconsciously to follow the rules of their leader In most patriarchal societies the fear of the god of the tribe the overpowering influence of custom and the unswerving directness of the punishment of the man who violates it tend to prevent the development of individuality and of independent thinking and the normal attitude of practically every person is to obey the customs and the laws although often those laws leave to the individual a range of action not found in later civilized states But as the sense of right and justice and the desire to promote the public welfare grow individualism grows also Each individual thrown upon his own resources learns to think and question and judge In democratic states he learns to take upon himself the responsibility for his acts and at length the view becomes prevalent that law exists for the benefit of society The individual in judging himself and his attitude toward society feels that the law must be obeyed because obedience promotes the public welfare Even when he believes that a law is unwise or even unjust he hesitates to violate it not only because he might be punished therefor but primarily because it has become wrong according to his conscience to violate a law that has been adopted by the representatives of his fellow citizens as just and beneficial Thus the individual in later even more than in earlier times obeys the laws not merely from selfish but from social and religious motives Questions for Further Consideration Can you name any modern laws that you think have been framed in the interests of a special social class Do you think that the people of to day are recreant in their respect for or adherence to law What do

people and for the people whom exactly do we mean by people Does the word have the same meaning in each of these phrases Is it ever right to violate a law of the land Some people contend that an individual ought to break a human law provided that it is contrary to divine law What is divine law Who decides Shall the individual decide or is that the duty of the community Or of the clergy Was it right for the Abolitionists to violate the provisions of the fugitive slave law Were this handful of men able and conscientious as they were as likely to be right regarding the welfare of society as the large majority of citizens whose representatives had enacted the fugitive slave law If a person believes our tariff laws to be unjust is it right for him to smuggle goods Under what circumstances if any is it one s duty to disobey a law of the state Would the fact that an individual believed it his duty to violate the law justify a judge in declining to punish him Thoreau declined to pay a tax that he believed unjust and accepted his punishment declaring that if he paid the penalty he might thus arouse public sentiment and secure the repeal of the law Was John Brown justified in attempting

are intended to define clearly the obligations of the nation to Jehovah and to place these obligations before the people so definitely that they would be understood and met As the term decalogue that is ten words indicates the Biblical decalogue originally contained ten brief sententious commands easily memorized even by children Each of the decalogues is divided into two groups of five laws or pentads This division of five and ten was without reasonable doubt intended to aid the memory by associating each law with a finger or thumb of the two hands Exodus twenty twenty three and its parallels in Deuteronomy contain ten decalogues that is a decalogue of decalogues suggesting that originally a decalogue was associated with each of the fingers and thumbs of the two hands even as were the individual words or commands This system of mnemonics was useful in teaching a child nation It is still useful to day It is important to impress upon the child in this concrete way certain of the fundamental obligations to God and man The form of the ten commandments in part explains the commanding place which they still hold in religious education throughout Christendom The Biblical accounts of the two decalogues in Exodus twenty and thirty four vary in details The early Judean prophetic narrative in Exodus thirty four states that these commands were inscribed by Moses himself on two stone tablets In the later versions of the story Jehovah inscribes them with his own fingers on the two tablets which he gave to Moses That the older decalogue was written on two tablets and set up in the temple of Solomon is exceedingly probable for by the days of the United Kingdom the Hebrews were beginning to become acquainted with the art of writing and therefore could read the laws in written form The recently discovered code of Hammurabi which comes from the twentieth century B C was inscribed in parallel columns on a stone monument In the epilogue to this wonderful code the king states By the order of Shamash the judge supreme of heaven and earth that judgment may shine in the land I set up a bas relief to preserve my likeness in the great temple that I love to commemorate my name forever in gratitude The oppressed who has a suit to prosecute may come before my image that of a righteous king and read my inscription and understand my precious words and let my stele elucidate his case Let him see the law he seeks and may he draw in his breath and say This Hammurabi was to his people like the father that begot them Thus this devout king of ancient Babylonia graphically defines the motive which at a later period led Israel s spiritual leaders to set before the people those principles which made for the welfare both of the nation and of the individual Each was keenly conscious that the laws which brought social and spiritual health to mankind emanated from the divine power that was guiding the destinies of men Hebrew tradition has described in a great variety of narratives the way in which God made known his will to the people The scene in each case was Mount Sinai which the ancient Hebrews as well as the Kenites regarded as Jehovah s abode In the early Judean version as some writers classify the accounts Moses alone ascends the mountain while the people are forbidden to approach In the Northern Israelite version the people approach but being terrified by the thunder and lightnings they request Moses to receive for them the divine message This later version implies that a raging thunder storm shrouded the sacred mountain while the early Judean and late priestly narratives apparently suggest an active volcano The element common to all these accounts is that under the direction of their prophetic leader Moses a solemn covenant was established between the nation and Jehovah and that the obligations of the people were defined in the decalogue with its ten short commands The problem is however complicated by the presence of two decalogues one now preserved in Exodus thirty four and the other the familiar ten commandments of Exodus twenty Both agree in emphasizing as primary the nation s obligation to be loyal to Jehovah The decalogue in Exodus thirty four however goes on to describe in succeeding laws the ways in which the nation may show its loyalty This was through the observation of certain ceremonial customs and especially the great annual feasts Did most ancient peoples show their loyalty to the gods by their lives and deeds or by the ceremonies of the ritual and the offerings which they brought to the altars The first great prophet Amos declared that Jehovah hated and despised feasts and ceremonies unless accompanied by deeds of justice and mercy The decalogue in Exodus thirty four may well represent the original commands which Moses laid upon the nation but the higher moral sense of later editors has truly recognized the superiority of the ethical commands of the familiar decalogue in Exodus twenty and given it the commanding place which it richly deserves For a probable literary history of this decalogue see Hist Bible I one hundred ninety four five The two decalogues of Exodus twenty and thirty four are not duplicates the one of the other but rather supplement each other The one defines the obligation of the nation the other of the individual The Hebrews long continued to retain in their homes the family images inherited from their Semitic ancestors Not until the days of Amos and Isaiah did the prophets begin to protest against the calves or bulls and the cherubim in the sanctuaries of Northern Israel and even in the temple at Jerusalem Hence the second command Thou shalt not make for thyself any graven image some believe comes from a period centuries later than Moses Possibly as in Exodus thirty four seventeen it originally read molten image and referred to foreign idols If so it may come in this older form from Moses The tenth command which places the emphasis on the motive rather than the act also suggests a maturer age but with these possible exceptions there is good reason for believing that the spirit and teaching of Moses are embodied in this noble decalogue In what respects does the version in Deuteronomy five differ from that in Exodus twenty Hist Bible I one hundred ninety five Which is probably the older version What later explanations and exhortations have been added to the original ten words in Exodus twenty In Deuteronomy five What was the object of these additions Are they of real value Is it profitable to teach them to children to day II OBLIGATIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO GOD Into what two groups do the ten words in Exodus twenty fall And what is the theme of each Is there a real difference between the command of Exodus thirty four Thou shalt worship no other gods and that of Exodus twenty Thou shall have no other gods before me Did the Hebrews as a matter of fact tolerate the worship of other gods in their midst centuries after the days of Moses May the Hebrews have originally interpreted the command of Exodus twenty as a demand that Jehovah be given the first place in the worship and faith of Israel How did later prophets like Elijah and Isaiah interpret it See I Kings eighteen twenty one and Is six one eight eight thirteen The older command in Exodus thirty four Thou shall make thee no molten gods was probably intended to guard the Israelites from imitating the religious customs of their heathen neighbors such as the Egyptians and the Moabites The command to make no graven image was it seems directed not against the public idols but against the private images These were usually made of wood and were cherished in many a Hebrew family as for example that of Jacob cf the story of his flight from Laban general thirty one or of David I Sam nineteen The spirit of the law is truly interpreted by the later priestly commentator who places completely under the ban all attempts visibly to represent the Deity Is the spirit of this command disregarded by the modern Greek church In certain parts of the Roman Catholic world In any phases of Protestant worship How is the third command interpreted to day The exact meaning of the original Hebrew is not entirely clear It may be interpreted literally Thou shall not invoke the name of Jehovah thy God in vain The interpretation turns on the meaning of the phrase in vain This admits of four different translations one Purposelessly and therefore needlessly or irreverently two for destruction as when a man calls down a curse upon another three for nothing that is in swearing to what is not true and four in the practice of sorcery or witchcraft for this word was frequently used by the Hebrews as a scornful designation of heathen abominations Is it possible that the original command was intended to guard against each of these evils If so it broadens and deepens its modern application Its fundamental idea is evidently reverence and sincerity Why did the Hebrew law givers place these three laws which emphasize absolute loyalty to Jehovah at the beginning of the decalogue What do we mean to day by loyalty to God Loyalty to Jehovah was not only the corner stone of Israel s religion but also of the Hebrew state During the wilderness period and far down into later periods it was the chief and at times practically the only bond that bound together the individual members of the tribe and nation Disloyalty to Jehovah was treason and even the mild code found in the book of Deuteronomy directs that apostasy be punished by public stoning Loyalty to God or at least to the individual sense of right to day as in the past is the first essential of effective citizenship Which is the more essential for the welfare of the state the manual the mental or the religious training of its citizens Where is the chief emphasis placed to day Is this right III THE SOCIAL AND ETHICAL BASIS OF THE SABBATH LAW The institution of the Sabbath in different countries apparently has a long and complex history Many explanations have been given of its origin aside from the direct divine command The simplest and most satisfactory is probably that it was originally connected with the worship of the moon There are many indications in Hebrew history that the early ancestors of the Israelites were moon worshippers To day as in the distant past the inhabitants of the deserts from whence came the forefathers of the Hebrews make their journeys under the clear cool light of the moon avoiding the hot piercing rays of the mid day sun The moon with its marvelous transformations is unquestionably the most striking and awe inspiring object in the heavens It is not strange therefore that many primitive peoples and especially the nomadic desert dwellers worshipped it as the supreme embodiment of beauty and power In China feast days once a month were doubtless connected with the phases of the moon Among the American Indians time was reckoned by numbers of moons The custom of observing as sacred the four days which marked the transition from one quarter of the moon to another was also widespread In the Hebrew religion the feast of the New Moon was closely identified with that of the Sabbath The Hebrew month was also the lunar month of approximately twenty eight days The new moon therefore marked the beginning of the month and each succeeding Sabbath a new phase of the moon The fourth commandment seems therefore like the others to have a basis in nature and also as we shall note a social reason Would a commandment be truly divine if it did not have a natural and reasonable basis By the ancients rest from labor was regarded as one of the essential elements in the sacred day The prophet Amos denounced the merchants of Northern Israel because they were constantly saying When shall the new moon pass that we may sell grain And the Sabbath that we may open the corn In its earlier ceremonial interpretation to abstain from all labor on the Sabbath was clearly regarded as a primary obligation Like fasting it is probably regarded as an offering due to Jehovah The word holy in the Hebrew means set apart distinct The Sabbath therefore was to differ from the other days of the week The great ethical prophets of the Assyrian period were the first completely to divest this ancient institution of its heathen significance and give it a deeper religious and therefore social and humanitarian interpretation They gave it its true and eternal content declaring that God decreed that all who labor should have their needed rest The prophet who added the noble interpretation in Deuteronomy five fourteen fifteen declares that it was not only that old and young master and slave might rest but also that even the toiling ox and ass and the resident alien might have the relaxation which their tired bodies required Thus these inspired prophets traced the ultimate basis of the institution of the Sabbath to God s providence for the innate needs of man They recognized that it was essential for the physical mental and spiritual well being of the individual and therefore for the welfare of the State That the Hebrews might not forget this obligation the prophets appealed to the memory of the days when the Israelites themselves were slaves in the land of Egypt and the thought of how Jehovah delivered them from their slavery Tuan Fang the great Manchu viceroy who only recently met martyrdom at the hands of his warring countrymen said when visiting America a few years ago I think that when I return to China I will introduce Sunday in my province When asked whether he would make it the seventh day he replied Yes for I think that the seventh day is far better than the tenth Furthermore for the convenience and economy of all I will make it correspond to the Christian Sunday From my study of the conditions in America and of the needs in China I am convinced that the Sabbath is a most valuable and essential institution Later Judaism revived the earlier heathen content of the Sabbath and lost sight of its deeper political social and humanitarian significance Unfortunately the Christian church and above all our Puritan fathers followed the guidance of the later priests rather than of the early prophets Jesus with his clear insight into human hearts and needs and with his glowing love for men repudiated the harsh mechanical interpretation of the Sabbath current in his day and reasserted the teachings of the great prophets that preceded him The Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath Does the social and humanitarian interpretation of the Sabbath obscure or deepen its religious significance Does the great body of the Christian church to day accept the interpretation of the prophets and of Jesus or that of early heathenism and later Judaism Does the interpretation of the prophets and of Jesus furnish a basis on which all classes in the state can unite in appreciating and in jealously guarding the Sabbath Does the acceptance of one or the other of these interpretations fundamentally affect our actual observance of the Sabbath Our motives and our spirit Our attitude toward our fellow men IV IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN S LOYALTY TO PARENTS It is generally recognized by scientists that the place of animals in the scale of being is dependent upon the length of their period of infancy The lower forms of animal life are mature almost as soon as they are born Minnows never come under the care of their genitors but are independent as soon as they are hatched The young of the less developed quadrupeds are soon weaned and forgotten by their parents The longer the young remain in the care of their parents the higher the form of the animal The great difference between men and most of the higher animals is thought by many to be dependent upon the length of childhood and the consequent care and attention given by the parents Even among human beings it is scarcely too much to say that the longer the time of education and training under proper supervision lasts the more successful finally at the end of life the man will be When one considers that Aristotle who is perhaps generally accepted as the world s greatest thinker associated with his great teacher Plato twenty years until he was thirty eight years of age and produced nearly all his important works only after that time we may see one example of the profound importance of training The care of parents for their children throughout all of their early years would naturally imply loyalty of children to the parents as a mark of gratitude for the time and affection expended upon them In one of his characteristic poems filled with wise suggestion Lowell speaks of obedience as that great tap root of the state and civilization The habit of obedience is one of the finest characteristics in family life and obedience to parents normally becomes obedience to law in the citizen one of the surest bonds of society and one of the most necessary conditions of social progress This fact was so fully recognized in the patriarchal stage of society that the head of the family within the tribe had the power even of life and death over the members of his household In practically all early societies we find this authority of the parent and the obedience of the child insisted upon as fundamental In the Orient even to the present day this respect of children for their parents is closely bound up with their religion and their civilization The first wish of every man is that be may have a son to sacrifice to his memory after he has gone And not only in China but in many other states we find ancestral worship springing from this relation of father and son The primitive Hebrew laws Ex twenty one fifteen seventeen made death the penalty for a child who struck or cursed his parents In many countries parricide is considered the worse type of murder The very old Sumerian law of ancient Babylon punished with slavery the son who repudiated his father In the fifth commandment no penalty is named for disrespect toward one s parents The religious sanction only is implied though the penalty of death was inflicted by the law of the tribe In society to day our aim in education is to develop individuality and for a country with a democratic form of government this type of education should be encouraged Disobedience or disrespect ho parents has no longer a legal penalty although the children may be compelled by law to support their parents But gratitude toward parents and a normal affectionate family life are practically essential to social welfare Aside from its civic aspect there is nothing in society more beautiful than the right relationship between parents and children Jesus who represented the kingdom of God as a household found that the best analogy for the relationship of men to God and the best descriptions of the divine nature are based upon this relationship V PRIMARY OBLIGATIONS OF MAN TO MAN The second five commandments of the decalogue deal with the obligations of man to man These commands still find a central place in modern society as the best guarantees of social stability security and peace All of the crimes with which they deal except that of covetousness were punished in Hebrew custom and law by definite penalties In many instances these penalties were still more severe among other early peoples As soon as society emerges from the savage state the crime of adultery is always forbidden Nothing else stirs the worst of human passions as does sexual jealousy Even to day probably no other cause is more productive of murder and suicide In early societies like that of the Israelites to this normal human feeling of personal wrong was added that of the loss of property for wives or concubines were considered as property Hence the penalty for adultery among the Hebrews as with many ancient and many modern peoples was death As soon as society develops from the savage into the pastoral stage private property is recognized in the flocks and herds In the development of society additional types of property rights appear under various forms of ownership until it is not too much to say that modern society is based largely upon property rights The evils associated with property are many but as yet at any rate the rights of property are a benefit to the state provided those rights are exercised under proper legal supervision It should be recognized however that the command Thou shall not steal may well have various meanings dependent upon the laws of property Our law restricts the right of legacy the sale or even the possession of poisons and often of dangerous weapons Similarly the degree of ownership of other goods is often limited The ninth command not to bear false witness against one s neighbor is often interpreted as simply a violation of one s oath in court or when appended to formal legal papers But in most modern countries the command is also interpreted so as to include lying If this crime is defined in its broadest sense as lack of truth and trustworthiness it is in many ways the greatest sin man can commit against society Practically all modern economic and social relations are based upon the security of contracts and upon the readiness of business men and citizens to keep their word It may be well questioned whether the crime of murder is as dangerous to society as the habit of deception for the temptation of murder is rare as compared with that of deception while the evil is often less far reaching in its consequence and less despicable In the last command that directed against covetousness the law giver goes beyond the external act to the motive and spirit in the mind of the individual If this command is kept in spirit the others are practically unnecessary This command is like in kind to that of Jesus in the New Testament where all the commandments are summed up into one Love one another VI THE PRESENT DAY AUTHORITY OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS The various books that make up our Bible were each written to meet the needs of the people of its day but inasmuch as the prophets and law givers from the days of Moses to those of Jesus touched upon the most vital questions of human life and society these principles are most of them universal and applicable to all tribes and nations and races and peoples Necessarily there are many variations in the specific methods by which these commands are to be carried out The honor and reverence due everywhere to mother and father may well have different applications depending upon the type of civilization the customs of living and the type of home life that exist in the different countries The injunction to keep the Sabbath may well be carried out with the same spirit in various ways What constitutes theft depends upon the law of the separate state and upon the rights of property granted by that law but everywhere the primary obligations of the individual to God to society and to his fellow men remain substantially the same As he develops a more tender conscience a more just and kindly attitude toward his fellows a greater reverence toward his Creator the spirit with which be keeps these commandments is becoming continually more urgent whatever may be the specific way in which they may be carried out for the benefit of his fellow men and of society Questions for Further Consideration Does idol worship exist in any part of the civilized world to day If so where and in what forms Are those addicted to profanity necessarily and intentionally irreverent What is the origin of this habit How may it be eradicated What are some of the best methods by which children may be guarded against it Do you think it is right for the state to become responsible for the religious education of its citizens What is the fundamental difference between the so called Continental Sabbath and that observed by Jesus In what way may Sunday be made a day of greater profit and significance to the working man What attitude should one take regarding so called white

3781_156981_000027_000006	train-clean-360	Some scholars hold that this coarse food was the manna of the Biblical accounts 
none	none	They argue that later generations familiar with the barrenness of the wilderness and believing that the Hebrews at this time numbered many thousands naturally concluded and reported that their ancestors were miraculously fed At certain periods also the meagre fare of the desert dweller is supplemented by the quails which he is able to capture and these are a welcome relief to his monotonous diet About the perennial springs which gush forth from the barren rock there also grew up stories of a miraculous provision for the needs of Jehovah s people for all springs and especially those in the desert were regarded by the ancients as miracles Even in more fertile lands the Greeks reared beside such springs temples to the god whom they thought of as thus signally revealing himself In the deeper sense each of these early Hebrew stories is historical for they all record the fundamental thought and belief that through this strenuous painful period even as in later crises in their history Jehovah was guiding his people and giving them not only food and water but also that training in the school of danger and privation which was essential for their highest development Even more insistent than the constant struggle for food and water were the dangers that came from the hostile tribes which already occupied this much contested territory For the possession of the springs and pasture lands they fought with the energy and craft that characterize the Bedouin tribes to day Hence to the Hebrews fresh from the fertile fields of Egypt their life in the wilderness represented constant hardship privation suffering and danger II INFLUENCE OV THE NOMADIC LIFE UPON ISRAEL S CHARACTER AND IDEALS The wilderness left a stamp upon Hebrew character and life that may be traced even to day in the later descendants of that race It tightened their muscles and gave them that physical virility which has enabled them to survive even amidst the most unfavorable conditions It taught them how to subsist on the most meagre food supply and to thrive where the citizen of a more prosperous land would inevitably starve It is probable that in their early nomadic experiences the Hebrews acquired those migratory habits which intensified by unwonted vicissitudes have carried them to almost every civilized land In the wilderness they also learned the art of nomadic warfare which to win victories depended not so much upon open attack as upon strategy The common dangers of the wilderness life tightened the racial and religious bonds that held them together Only by the closest union could they resist the perils that beset them

none	none	Hence arose that devotion to race that readiness to avenge every wrong and to protect each individual even if it cost the life blood of the tribe which is illustrated in many of the stories that come from this early period How far has this racial characteristic survived In a community thus closely bound together the morality of each individual was guarded with a jealousy unknown in more settled prosperous communities Thus for example adultery from the first appears to have been punished by public stoning How far has this characteristic survived to the glory of the Jewish race The tribal organization also cherished the freedom of each individual His voice was heard in its council and his rights were carefully protected The free atmosphere of the desert tolerated no despotism and the sheik was the servant of all These fundamental conceptions of government persisted even when under the influence of a new agricultural environment the Hebrews established the kingship and monarchy It was the struggle between these inherited democratic ideals and those of the neighbors who were ruled by despots that ultimately disrupted the Hebrew kingdom and called forth those great champions of liberty and social justice the prophets of the Assyrian period It was this same democratic atmosphere that made possible the work of those prophets who openly denounced the crimes of king and people How far have the Jews throughout all their history allied themselves with democratic movements III THE INFLUENCE OF THE WILDERNESS LIFE UPON ISRAEL S FAITH The pressure of constant danger intensified the sense of dependence upon a power outside and above themselves It led them to look constantly to Jehovah as their sole guide and deliverer A continued attitude crystallized into a habit

none	none	With the same vivid imagery according to some interpreters the later Hebrews pictured the march of their ancestors through the wilderness and thereby symbolized the belief that Jehovah was then present and that through his prophet Moses he was personally guiding his people How far have these Old Testament narratives been thus interpreted by modern western readers Does it change their spiritual significance to seek to learn their origin and real literary character Are there still to be found often in humble walks of life earnest Christians who have similar deep spiritual experiences and describe them with the same vivid imagery and concreteness Is the value of our conception of God s presence and activity in human history deepened and strengthened or lessened by the thought that in the past even as to day he accomplished his ends by natural rather than contra natural methods Are the faith and institutions of nations and individuals developed most through special revelations or through ordinary constant daily training and experience Is it not true that to us all there come at times experiences akin to those that underlie these wonderful narratives IV THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EAST JORDAN CONQUESTS Desert dwellers take little account of the lapse of time It is not strange that the data regarding the duration of the sojourn in the wilderness are late and exceedingly vague The number forty in the Bible is the concrete Hebrew equivalent of many Ordinarily the forty years represent a generation A period of about forty years accords well with the facts of contemporary Egyptian chronology If the Hebrews fled from Egypt about twelve hundred during the period of anarchy following the breakdown of the nineteenth Egyptian dynasty they could not have entered Palestine much before the middle of the twelfth century for Ramses III of the Twentieth Dynasty succeeded in re establishing and maintaining his authority in Southern Palestine until his death about eleven sixty seven B C The account of the spies preserved according to some writers in variant versions by each of the great groups of Hebrew narratives indicates that the Hebrews attempted but failed to enter Canaan from the south For tribesmen like the Israelites chafing under their harsh environment and recalling the prosperity of the land of Egypt Palestine with its green hills and fertile fields was an irresistible lodestone luring them on to the conquest The reasons why they failed to enter Canaan from the south are suggested in the narrative of the spies and confirmed by a study of the historical geographical situation The Canaanite cities of Southern Palestine were built largely with the view to protecting their inhabitants from the ever lurking nomad invaders On the other hand the Hebrews had none of the equipment needed to conquer walled cities More than that the barren hills of the South Country did not furnish the base of supplies necessary to maintain a protracted siege The early Hebrew narratives imply that certain nomadic tribes as for example the Calebites the Kenizzites and the Jerahmeelites independently gained a foothold on the southern borders of Canaan and ultimately assimilated with the Hebrew tribe of Judah when the latter entered Palestine The earliest Hebrew accounts however as well as the logic of the situation indicate that the great body of the Israelites whose ancestors had been in the land of Egypt entered Palestine from the east Throughout all its history the east Jordan land has witnessed the constant transition of Arab tribes from the nomadic life of the desert to the more settled civilization of agricultural Palestine Here on the eastern heights that overlook the Jordan valley and the land of Canaan the traveller still finds the Arab tents and flocks of the nomads beside the plowed fields of the village dwellers On the rolling plains of northern Moab and southern Gilead there are few commanding heights or natural fortresses The important towns like Dibon and Heshbon lay on slightly rising hills The character of the ruins to day does not indicate that they were ever surrounded by formidable walls Whether the Hebrews conquered them by open attack or by strategy as in the case of the town of Ai is not stated It is certain however that here they first gained a permanent foothold in agricultural Palestine From the conquered they here learned their initial lessons in the arts of agriculture and became acquainted with that more advanced Canaanite civilization which they later absorbed Coming fresh from the desert where only the fittest survived their numbers rapidly increased in this quieter and more favorable environment Soon to the constant pressure of the desert population on the east was added that of over population so that necessity as well as ambition impelled them to cross the Jordan to seek homes among the hills to the west V THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MOSES WORK The study of the beginnings of Israel s history in the light of its physical social and economic environment reveals clearly the many powerful forces then at work At the same time these do not alone explain Israel s later history and the uniqueness of its character and faith These later facts plainly point back to a strong commanding personality who shaped the ideals and institutions of this early people and left upon them the imperishable imprint of his own unique individuality Although the traditions regarding him have been transmitted for centuries from mouth to mouth they portray the character and work of Moses with remarkable clarity and impressiveness Moses was primarily a patriot He was also a prophet statesman able to grasp and interpret the significance of the great crises in the life of his people and to suggest practical solutions Moreover he was able to inspire confidence and to lead as well as direct In the harsh environment of the wilderness he was able to adjust himself to most difficult conditions In leading the Hebrew serfs from the land of Egypt he became indeed the creator of the future Hebrew nation In the wilderness be trained that child nation As judge and counsellor he taught concretely the broad principles which became the foundation of later Hebrew law As guardian of the oracle and priest of the desert sanctuary Moses like the later prophet of Islam but with far greater spiritual power and deeper insight taught his people not only the art of worship but certain of the great essentials of religion He it was who formulated in a positive faith the wholesome reaction which he and his kinsmen felt against the gross polytheism of Egypt The inspiration of all of Moses work was his own personal faith The first great vision of Jehovah s character and purpose that he had received in the land of Midian was doubtless often renewed amidst the same wild impressive scenes The exact nature of the deeper more personal side of his character and faith must be inferred from the close analogies that may be drawn from the memoirs of Isaiah or Jeremiah At the same time it is a mistake to infer that Moses beliefs were as lofty as those of the later prophets who stood in the light of a larger experience On the other hand it is not just to disregard the fact that Moses being a prophet was far in advance of the primitive age in which he lived Not only did Moses create the Hebrew nation and teach it its first lessons in practical politics and religion but he it was who first instilled into his race commanding loyalty to the one God Jehovah and taught that religion was more than form that it meant right thinking and doing Thus Moses was the forerunner of Israel s later prophets who broke away from the narrow heathen interpretation of religion and defined it in terms of life and service VI THE EARLY STAGES IN THE TRAINING OF THE HUMAN RACE It is interesting and important to note that Israel s history was in most respects like that of other growing nations In the beginning pastoral society and tribal government develop among savages primarily through the domestication of animals The young of the animals slain in the hunt are kept first as pets then when as a result of the thriftless nature of the savages supplies at times become scarce the pets are slain for food As pets become more common and population increases the advantage of breeding for use is apparent and private property in distinction from community possessions appears The growing herds naturally develop the need of regular service To meet this need the institutions of permanent marriage and bondage arise and the wife or wives and the slaves perform the added work With the custom of fixed marriage and the possibility of tracing ancestry through the father comes in time ancestral government The Hebrews seem to have had this type of government even in the days of Abraham and it lasted until the tribes broke up into clans and families when they acquired permanent homes and became agriculturists in the land of Canaan Many of the characteristics of the tribe disappear almost entirely as wandering nomads settle in a fixed abode and the patriarchal rule changes to that of a royal or democratic government Customs become fixed in formal statutes Property in land becomes more important than that in herds War becomes the business of a special army instead of the frequent duty of all But in the tribe there is little competition All work for the community or for the family rather than for individual interests Each man is primarily responsible not to the state but to the head of his family or clan who in turn answers for his family to the tribal chief Certain of these tribal institutions and ideals have left their indelible impress on modern society The tribe was exclusive All those not born into the tribe had no right no welcome there for their coming would tend to restrict the common pasturage They would be a burden Though the tent dweller might be hospitable to a guest an alien had no rights except on sufferance If he were needy and were received he usually became a serf or slave And yet this exclusiveness is the germ of our patriotism a noble trait that may ultimately but not soon be replaced by a cosmopolitan love for humanity Allied to this is the personal bond that obtains in the tribe instead of the territorial unity of the modern state A Frenchman is such because he is born in France an Israelite is such because he is the son of Abraham and knows his people as his blood kinsmen This personal tie makes for peace and democracy Building on this Jewish tribal trait Jesus calls all men brethren because sons of a common Father His Kingdom of God likewise is not territorial Its citizens are bound together by the tribal bond of a common brotherhood and fatherhood Thus the lessons so deeply impressed in the childhood of the race have a large and growing significance for the present and future Questions for Further Consideration What reasons may be given to prove that love for humanity is a virtue more useful to modern civilization than patriotism Does the movement for universal peace find any encouragement in the teachings ascribed to Moses On what grounds can the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites be defended How did it differ from the taking of Tripoli by Italy Or of Porto Rico by the United States In the light of the oldest records was Moses work in your judgment accomplished by natural or supernatural methods What were the chief characteristics of Moses What place does he hold in history Is modern socialism in any way a revival of the principles underlying the old tribal organization How far did Jesus in his idea of the Kingdom of God build on the old tribal idea Subjects or Further Study one

the preceding studies the motives that led the Hebrews to cross the Jordan become evident As the Pilgrim Fathers to secure a home where they might enjoy and develop their own type of belief and methods of civilization braved the dimly known dangers of the sea and the wilderness the Hebrews braved the contests that unquestionably lay before them Between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea the Jordan is fordable at thirty points during certain parts of the year The first of the two main fords in the lower Jordan is just below the point where the Wady Kelt enters the Jordan from the west and deposits its mass of mud and silt The other ford is six miles further north below the point where the Wady Nimrin comes down from the highlands of Gilead Here to day the main highway connecting the east and the west Jordan country crosses the river This spot was probably the scene of the historic crossing at the beginning of Hebrew history Certain writers hold that variant accounts of the most important facts in early Hebrew history have here been preserved Traces of three different versions of the crossing of the Jordan may still in their judgment be found in the third and fourth chapters of the book of Joshua The latest and most familiar narrative represents the crossing as a superlative miracle and the waters of the rushing river as piled up like a wall on either side The Northern Israelite version appears to have stated that the waters of the Jordan were dried up implying that the Hebrews crossed during the late summer when the river was easily fordable The earliest narrative the Judean prophetic states that the waters rose up in a heap a great way off at Adam the city that is beside Zarathan and those that went down toward the Sea of the Arabah the Salt Sea were wholly cut off Josh three sixteenb From other references in the Old Testament it would appear that the city of Adam which means red earth is to day represented by the ruins of Ed Damieh which stands near the famous Damieh ford at the point where the river Jabbok enters the Jordan It is interesting to note in this connection that a reliable Moslem historian states that in the year twelve fifty seven A D the retreating Moslems found it neccessary to repair the foundations of an important bridge which stood at this point When the workmen arrived on the scene they were amazed to find the riverbed empty and were able by working rapidly to complete the repairs before the waters came rushing down This remarkable phenomenon seemed to them to be due to the direct intervention of Allah but the historian fortunately records the cause it was a huge landslide a little further up the river which temporarily dammed its waters The oldest Biblical account of the crossing of the Jordan may point to a like natural cause If this be true does it imply that Jehovah had no part in preparing the way for the future conquests of his people Would a miracle such as that recorded in the late priestly tradition be any stronger proof of God s presence and activity in human history than are the provisions which we to day call natural II THE CANAANITE CIVILIZATION Contemporary inscriptions and recent excavations make it possible to form a very definite conception of conditions in Canaan when the Hebrews crossed the Jordan The dominant civilization was that of the Canaanites the descendants of the Semitic invaders from the desert who entered Palestine centuries before the ancestors of the Hebrews Naturally they settled first along the fertile coast plains that skirt the western Mediterranean In later times these were known as the Phoenicians As the population increased the Canaanites pushed their outposts along the broad valleys that penetrated the uplands of Palestine These valleys were especially fertile and attractive in the territory later known as Galilee and Samaria The wide Plain of Esdraelon and its eastward extension the Valley of Jezreel cut straight across the central plateau of Palestine The Plain of Esdraelon was the strongest centre of the Canaanite civilization A few outposts were established in the Jordan valley as for example Laish later known as Dan at the foot of Mount Hermon and Jericho at the southern end of the Jordan valley Only a few Canaanite villages were found along the more barren hills of Southern Canaan There the peoples and civilization still retained the imprint of their desert origin Along the coast plains and across the great Plain of Esdraelon ran the main highways that connected the three earliest and most nourishing centres of the world s civilization the Egyptian on the southwest the Amorite on the north probably between the southern Lebanons and the Babylonian to the east and northeast For centuries the Canaanites had absorbed the ideas institutions and culture of these stronger peoples So fundamentally had the Babylonians impressed the Canaanites that practically all of the inscriptions coming from this early period are written in the Babylonian script Even in writing to their Egyptian conqueror during the fourteenth century the Canaanite kings of Palestine used this same Babylonian system of writing The Amorite civilization had so strongly influenced the Canaanites that to day it is difficult for the archaeologist to distinguish between the two By certain of the Biblical writers the terms Canaanite and Amorite are used interchangeably As early as sixteen hundred B C Egypt under the ambitious conquering kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty had overrun Palestine and for the next three or four centuries ruled it as a tributary province The nearness of Egypt made its influence still more powerful so that in nearly every mound and Canaanite ruin the excavator finds hundreds of reminders of the presence of the Egyptian civilization The Canaanites had long since left behind them the nomadic state and had developed a strong agricultural and commercial civilization Their life centered about certain important cities like Megiddo on the southwestern side and Bethshean on the eastern side of the Plain of Esdraelon Their cities were usually built on a low lying hill in the midst of rich encircling plains They were provided with thick mud walls behind which the inhabitants felt secure from attack Over each city ruled a petty king whose authority however did not extend far beyond the surrounding fields that belonged to the inhabitants of the town Generally these city states were independent In many cases they were hostile to each other and the long rule of Egypt had tended to intensify this hostility for Egypt had depended upon this local jealousy to maintain its control The diversified physical contour of Palestine likewise strengthened this tendency toward separation rather than unity This type of political organization favored the growth of polytheism rather than the worship of one god Each city had its local god or baal which was worshipped at a high place either within the city or on some adjacent height while in the larger cities elaborate altars and temples were reared to them These local deities were regarded as the gods of fertility which gave to their worshippers ample harvests and numerous offspring both of the family and of the nock The principle of generation occupied such a prominent place in the Canaanite cults that in time they became exceedingly immoral and debasing To secure the favor of their gods the Canaanites brought rich sacrifices to their altars and observed certain great annual festivals with ceremonies very similar to those later adopted by the Hebrews While the Canaanites were on a much higher plane of material civilization than the Hebrews they ultimately fell a prey to those hardy invaders of the desert one Because they were incapable of strong united action and two because their civilization was corrupt and enervating Courage and real patriotism were almost unknown to them even as early as the seventeenth century B C when the Egyptian king Thutmose III invaded the land of Palestine Their strong walls and their superior military equipment however made their immediate conquest by the Hebrews impossible This explains why the earliest account of the initial conquest now found in Judges one is chiefly devoted to recounting the strong Canaanite cities which the Hebrews failed to conquer III THE CAPTURE OF THE OUTPOSTS OF PALESTINE In the light of our present knowledge of the Canaanite civilization it becomes evident why most of the early Hebrew conquests were in the south The only large Canaanite city which they could conquer in the early days was Jericho Recent excavations have also shown why later generations regarded its capture by the Hebrews as a miracle although many modern interpreters hold that the early account does not imply that it was by supernatural means Like most of the Canaanite cities it was situated on a slightly rising eminence close to the foothills that on the west rose abruptly to the central plateau of Canaan Northward eastward and southward extended for miles the level plain of the Jordan river which plowed its way through its alluvial bed six miles east of Jericho Close by the site of the ancient city came the perennial waters of the Wady Kelt with which it was possible to irrigate its fields Past the town ran the main highway from across the Jordan along the northern side of the Wady Kelt to join the great central highway that extended through the centre of Palestine Jericho was therefore the key to the land of Canaan and its capture was necessary if the Hebrews were to maintain their connection with their kinsmen east of the Jordan The ruins of the ancient Canaanite town rise between forty and fifty feet above the plain It is an oblong mound containing altogether about twelve acres The excavations have disclosed a large part of the encircling wall It was a construction of excellent workmanship which still stands practically intact testifying to the accuracy of the early Hebrew tradition Its foundation is a wall of rubble sixteen feet high and six to eight feet thick sloping inward On the top of this foundation which rested on the native rock was built a supplemental wall of burnt brick six or seven feet in thickness and rising even now in its ruined condition on an average eight feet above the lower wall Thus the original wall must have towered between twenty and thirty feet above the plain At the northern end of the city stood the citadel made of unburnt brick three stories high Even the stone staircase which led to the top is still intact According to these investigators the late tradition that these walls fell flat to the earth as the result of a miracle finds no confirmation in the ruins themselves The older Hebrew account however in their judgment agrees perfectly with the evidence revealed by the spade of the excavator In imagination it is easy to follow the perilous journey of the Hebrew spies and to appreciate the importance of the negotiations by which they secured the company operation of Rahab and of the clan within Jericho which she represented Later come the Hebrew hordes from across the Jordan bearing with them the ark which symbolized to them the presence of Jehovah who had led them on to victory in many an early battle Behind their impregnable walls the inhabitants of Jericho must have laughed scornfully at the desert host that seemed utterly incapable of an effective attack or of a protracted siege According to many modern interpreters the earliest Hebrew host marched silently about the Canaanite stronghold At first the inhabitants of Jericho accustomed to Arab strategy undoubtedly held themselves ready for defence When no attack came their vigilance was gradually relaxed At last on the seventh day when conditions were favorable at the preconcerted signal a trumpet blast the Hebrews rushed toward the walls the gates were probably opened by their allies within the city and Jericho was quickly captured The method of attack recorded in the prophetic narrative was very similar to the strategy used a little later by the Hebrews in the capture of the smaller towns of Ai and Bethel They are the methods still employed by the Bedouins in their attacks upon the outposts of Palestine The fierce nomadic instincts of these early Hebrew warriors are revealed by the fate which they visited upon Jericho and its inhabitants The recent excavations confirm the Biblical testimony that for several centuries after its initial capture the ancient town was left a heap of ruins Its inhabitants were slain as a great sacrificial offering to Jehovah whose true character as one who loves all mankind was first appreciated by the inspired prophets of a much later From the plain of Jericho two or three roads led up to the central plateau of Canaan The main road along the Wady Kelt ran past the villages of Ai and Bethel At most they were small towns and easily captured Along this highway went the Hebrew tribes later known as the Ephraimites and Manassites The other roads led through the wilderness southwestward to the heart of Judah The frontier town of Bezek mentioned in the ancient narrative of Judges has not yet been identified The name is perhaps but a scribal corruption of Bethlehem or of Bethzur further to the south The other towns ultimately captured by the southern tribes were Hebron with its copious water supply Debir to the southwest and Arad and Hormah which lay on the borders of the South Country The capture of these six or seven outposts represents the first stage in the conquest and settlement of Palestine It was significant because it meant that the people from the wilderness had gained a foothold in the land where they ultimately found their home It inaugurated Israel s pioneer period The Hebrews were no longer homeless wanderers in the desert nor sojourners in a foreign land At this point Israel s history as a nation properly begins although the complete union of the tribes was not consummated until nearly a century later IV WAYS BY WHICH THE ISRAELITES WON THEIR HOMES The impression conveyed by the later passages in the book of Joshua that the Hebrews within a period of seven years became complete masters of the land of Canaan is different from that made by the older records in Judges These indicate that the process was gradual extending through several generations Except at two or three great crises this conquest appears to have been peaceful rather than by the sword a process of settlement and colonization rather than of capture Today throughout many parts of Palestine one may still see close to the cities the black tents and the flocks of the Bedouin immigrants In the days of the Hebrew settlement the Canaanites were largely confined to the fertile valleys The uplands were still open to the men from the desert Here the Hebrews pitched their tents and finally built their rude homes In this more favorable environment their families and their flocks gradually increased until they began to encroach upon the territory already occupied by the older inhabitants The resulting quarrels and differences were sometimes settled by the appeal to the sword more frequently by alliances sealed by intermarriages The early narrative in the ninth and tenth chapters of the book of Judges gives a vivid picture of the resulting condition in the strong Canaanite city of Shechem Hebrews and Canaanites had so far intermarried that Abimelech a product of this intermarriage succeeded his father Gideon as king of the first little Hebrew kingdom At Shechem Hebrews and Canaanites also worshipped side by side in the common sanctuary which was known as the temple of Baal of the Covenant Under the pressure of the increased population certain of the Hebrew tribes migrated and seized new territory Such a migration is vividly recorded in Judges seventeen and eighteen The little tribe of the Danites finding the pressure of their kinsmen on the north and east and that of the Philistines on the west too strong captured the Canaanite city of Laish at the foot of Mount Hermon and thus found a permanent home in the upper Jordan valley It was a cruel barbarous age in which might was regarded as right Thus Ehud the Benjamite who treacherously gained admittance to the presence of Eglon secretly slew this Moabite oppressor of the Hebrews This act instead of being condemned was regarded then and even by later generations as an example of courageous patriotism Was his act justifiable How would it be regarded in America to day V DEBORAH S RALLY OF THE HEBREWS The growing numbers and strength of the Israelites at last alarmed the Canaanites A certain leader by the name of Sisera formed a coalition of the strong Canaanite cities encircling the Plain of Esdraelon The centre of this coalition was the powerful city of Megiddo the ruins of which on the south western side of the plain still remain to testify to the natural strength of this ancient stronghold The policy of the Canaanites was to keep the different Hebrew clans apart and thus prevent united action In the words of the ancient song In the days of Jael the highways were unused And travellers walked by round about paths The rulers ceased in Israel A shield was not seen in five cities Nor a spear among forty thousand The one who alone appears to have understood the crisis and to have been able to stir the Israelites to action was Deborah the prophetess of the central tribe of Issachar Israel s struggle for independence is graphically recorded in the ancient poem found in Judges five The later prose version of the incident found in Judges four supplements the earlier poem To a chief of a northern tribe of Napthali a certain Barak she turned as the natural leader in the struggle for independence Together they sent out the summons to the different northern tribes The southern tribes of Judah and Simeon were apparently ignored The distant tribes of Asher Dan and Reuben were engrossed in their local interests and failed to respond The tribesmen who rallied forty thousand strong on the northern side of the Plain of Esdraelon represented the great central Hebrew clans The ancient song sung by the women as they met the returning warriors makes it possible to reconstruct the battle scene Through the broad valleys that lead into the Plain of Esdraelon from the north came the sinewy unkempt roughly clad and poorly equipped Hebrew tribesmen each clan led by its local chief They had come up to the help of Jehovah against the mighty Tribal patriotism the memory of past grievances the desire for plunder and zeal for Jehovah the God who had led their forefathers through the wilderness into the land of Canaan stirred their courage and fired them to deeds of valor Well they chose their battlefield out on the plain on the northern side of the muddy sluggish river Kishon On the slightly rising ground they faced the Canaanite warriors who came out across the plain from the city of Megiddo six miles away The Canaanites were armed with chariots and the best weapons that the early Semitic civilization could produce but one thing they lacked courage fired by religious zeal Again a striking natural phenomenon appears suddenly to have turned the tide of Israel s fortune On the eve of battle a drenching thunderstorm seems to have swept across the alluvial plain transforming it into a morass and the sluggish Kishon into a rushing unfordable river In the words of the ancient triumphal ode From heaven fought the stars From their courses fought against Sisera The river Kishon swept them away The ancient river the river Kishon O my soul march on with strength Then did the horse hoofs resound With the galloping galloping of their steeds The Hebrew even brings out the sound of the sucking of the horses hoofs in the soft mud The storm not only gave to the Hebrews who were on foot a vast advantage but it meant to them that Jehovah whose chariot was the clouds his weapons the lightning and who spoke through the thunders was fighting in their behalf The victory was overwhelming Sisera the Canaanite leader fled but only to fall later ignominiously slain by a woman Henceforth the Canaanite cities of central Palestine were occupied by the Hebrews The vanquished were either enslaved or absorbed in intermarriage From them however the Hebrews learned skill in agriculture and received a heritage of art ideas and customs that had been developed by the Canaanites for many centuries How far was this heritage beneficial to the Hebrews What temptations did it bring to them Did it mark a step forward in their development Were the early Hebrews a pure or a mixed race More important than the spoils and lands which fell to the Hebrews was the new demonstration of Jehovah s ability and willingness to deliver his people which they received in the battle beside Kishon Throughout all of Israel s colonial period the chief force binding the scattered Hebrew tribes together was their faith in Jehovah The victory greatly strengthened that faith and prepared the way for the closer union which was necessary before Israel could become a permanent force among the nations of the earth The vision of what they had been able to achieve through united action never completely faded from the memory of the Hebrews Their subsequent experiences also tended to revive this memory Amidst the warring elements in Palestine a powerful nation was gradually taking form in the school of hard experience it was learning the lessons that were fitting it for a large life VI THE FINAL STAGE IN THE MAKING OP THE HEBREW NATION The final stage in the evolution of Israel is recorded in the opening chapters of I Samuel and is best studied in detail in connection with the history of the nation at its zenith We have studied the forces which made the nation A brief summary will indicate the transition to the next period that of the kingdom The victory over the Canaanites gave the Hebrews possession of the land and left them free to coalesce into a united nation but the centrifugal tribe spirit for a time proved the stronger Under Gideon a beginning was made in kingdom making but owing to the cruelty and inefficiency of his son Abimelech the first Hebrew state lasted little more than a generation The compelling power that finally brought all the rival Hebrew tribes together under a common leader was the conquest of their territory by the warlike ambitious Philistines In inspiring the Benjamite chieftain Saul to deliver his countrymen in their hour of shame and peril Samuel the prophet proved the true father of the Hebrew kingdom Under the compulsion of common danger the Israelites not only followed Saul to victory but also made him their king From this time on Israel took its place among the nations of the earth During their formative period the Hebrews acquired many characteristics that they have retained throughout their history From their early nomadic life they inherited physical strength hardihood adaptability even to the most unfavorable environment courage perseverance and that individual initiative and self reliance which come from protracted struggles against seemingly insuperable odds It was a harsh but thorough school in which the infant nation Israel was trained Their life in the wilderness and in the period of settlement also developed an intense love for freedom and that democratic spirit that was the glory of Israel and the foundation of its political institutions People passing their time chiefly out of doors and enjoying the uplifting stimulus of an unfettered life in the open naturally acquire a feeling of awe and reverence for the God of nature that is often lacking in the city dweller Especially is this true if like the early Hebrews the dwellers in the open feel that need of divine protection which is begotten by constant exposure to danger hunger hardship and hostile foes The many crises and the signal deliverances that came to the Hebrews not only intensified their faith but also gave them the consciousness that the God in whom they put their trust was both able and eager to deliver them Prophets like Moses strengthened the popular sense of Jehovah s immediate presence and interpreted the significance of each event Israel s early faith was simple like that of a little child While its beliefs were crude its trust was strong It was this trust and loyalty that carried the child nation through its early crises and ultimately bound together the separate tribes into a united commonwealth Thus Israel s early history illustrates the fundamental truth that the most essential the most powerful force in the making of a nation is a simple practical every day religion Questions for Further Consideration Should the successful and easy crossing of the Jordan by the Israelites be ascribed to miracle or to their own promptness in seizing an opportunity unexpectedly offered In what ways did the religious zeal of the ancient Hebrews in battle differ from the fanatical zeal of the modern Moslem in fighting the Christians Or the zeal of the Japanese before Port Arthur When if ever is assassination justifiable as a political expedient Give your reasons Were the Hebrews justified in the methods employed in securing control of Palestine Is it right for a progressive nation to compel a backward nation to submit Were the Americans on this ground justified in seizing the lands of the Indians What were the chief tenets in the early faith of the Hebrews How did Israel s faith affect its political development In what important ways was religion effective in making the English state The American

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new

directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER
