none	none	 I do not think that an old fellow like me need have been sitting here to try and prevent your entertaining abject notions of yourselves and talking of yourselves in an abject and ignoble way but to prevent there being by chance among you any such young men as after recognising their kindred to the Gods and their bondage in these chains of the body and its manifold necessities should desire to cast them off as burdens too grievous to be borne and depart their true kindred This is the struggle in which your Master and Teacher were he worthy of the name should be engaged You would come to me and say Epictetus we can no longer endure being chained to this wretched body giving food and drink and rest and purification aye and for its sake forced to be subservient to this man and that Are these not things indifferent and nothing to us Is it not true that death is no evil Are we not in a manner kinsmen of the Gods and have we not come from them Let us depart thither whence we came let us be freed from these chains that confine and press us down Here are thieves and robbers and tribunals and they that are called tyrants who deem that they have after a fashion power over us because of the miserable body and what appertains to it Let us show them that they have power over none

none	none	 Petrifaction is of two sorts There is petrifaction of the understanding and also of the sense of shame This happens when a man obstinately refuses to acknowledge plain truths and persists in maintaining what is self contradictory Most of us dread mortification of the body and would spare no pains to escape anything of that kind But of mortification of the soul we are utterly heedless With regard indeed to the soul if a man is in such a state as to be incapable of following or understanding anything I grant you we do think him in a bad way But mortification of the sense of shame and modesty we go so far as to dub strength of mind

nostrils you will forget it all and if you can but gain admission to Court you will be glad enough to elbow your way in and thank God for it Epictetus he replied if ever you find me setting as much as one foot within the Court think what you will of me Well as it was what did he do Ere ever he entered the city he was met by a despatch from the Emperor He took it and forgot the whole of his resolutions From that moment he has been piling one thing upon another I should like to be beside him to remind him of what he said when passing this way and to add How much better a prophet I am than you What then do I say man is not made for an active life Far from it But there is a great difference between other men s occupations and ours A glance at theirs will make it clear to you All day long they do nothing but calculate contrive consult how to wring their profit out of food stuffs farm plots and the like Whereas I entreat you to learn what the administration of the World is and what place a Being endowed with reason holds therein to consider what you are yourself and wherein your Good and Evil consists XXV A man asked me to write to Rome on his behalf who as most people thought had met with misfortune for having been before wealthy and distinguished he had afterwards lost all and was living here So I wrote about him in a humble style He however on reading the letter returned it to me with the words I asked for your help not for your pity No evil has happened unto me XXVI True instruction is this to learn to wish that each thing should come to pass as it does And how does it come to pass As the Disposer has disposed it Now He has disposed that there should be summer and winter and plenty and dearth and vice and virtue and all such opposites for the harmony of the whole XXVII Have this thought ever present with thee when thou losest any outward thing what thou gainest in its stead and if this be the more precious say not I have suffered loss XXVIII Concerning the Gods there are who deny the very existence of the Godhead others say that it exists but neither bestirs nor concerns itself nor has forethought for anything A third party attribute to it existence and forethought but only for great and heavenly matters not for anything that is on earth A fourth party admit things on earth as well as in heaven but only in general and not with respect to each individual A fifth of whom were Ulysses and Socrates are those that cry I move not without Thy knowledge XXIX Considering all these things the good and true man submits his judgement to Him that administers the Universe even as good citizens to the law of the State And he that is being instructed should come thus minded How may I in all things follow the Gods and How may I rest satisfied with the Divine Administration and How may I become free For he is free for whom all things come to pass according to his will and whom none can hinder What then is freedom madness God forbid For madness and freedom exist not together But I wish all that I desire to come to pass and in the manner that I desire You are mad you are beside yourself Know you not that Freedom is a glorious thing and of great worth But that what I desired at random I should wish at random to come to pass so far from being noble may well be exceeding base XXX You must know that it is no easy thing for a principle to become a man s own unless each day he maintain it and hear it maintained as well as work it out in life XXXI You are impatient and hard to please If alone you call it solitude if in the company of men you dub them conspirators and thieves and find fault with your very parents children brothers and neighbours Whereas when by yourself you should have called it Tranquillity and Freedom and herein deemed yourself like unto the Gods And when in the company of many you should not have called it a wearisome crowd and tumult but an assembly and a tribunal and thus accepted all with contentment XXXII What then is the chastisement of those who accept it not To be as they are Is any discontented with being alone let him be in solitude Is any discontented with his parents let him be a bad son and lament Is any discontented with his children let him be a bad father Throw him into prison What prison Where he is already for he is there against his will and wherever a man is against his will that to him is a prison Thus Socrates was not in prison since he was there with his own consent XXXIII Knowest thou what a speck thou art in comparison with the Universe That is with respect to the body since with respect to Reason thou art not inferior to the Gods nor less than they For the greatness of Reason is not measured by length or height but by the resolves of the mind Place then thy happiness in that wherein thou art equal to the Gods XXXIV Asked how a man might eat acceptably to the Gods Epictetus replied If when he eats he can be just cheerful equable temperate and orderly can he not thus eat acceptably to the Gods But when you call for warm water and your slave does not answer or when he answers brings it lukewarm or is not even found to be in the house at all then not to be vexed nor burst with anger is not that acceptable to the Gods But how can one endure such people Slave will you not endure your own brother that has God to his forefather even as a son sprung from the same stock and of the same high descent as yourself And if you are stationed in a high position are you therefor forthwith set up for a tyrant Remember who you are and whom you rule that they are by nature your kinsmen your brothers the offspring of God But I paid a price for them not they for me Do you see whither you are looking down to the earth to the pit to those despicable laws of the dead But to the laws of the Gods you do not look XXXV When we are invited to a banquet we take what is set before us and were one to call upon his host to set fish upon the table or sweet things he would be deemed absurd Yet in a word we ask the Gods for what they do not give and that although they have given us so many things XXXVI Asked how a man might convince himself that every single act of his was under the eye of God Epictetus answered Do you not hold that things on earth and things in heaven are continuous and in unison with each other I do was the reply Else how should the trees so regularly as though by God s command at His bidding flower at His bidding send forth shoots bear fruit and ripen it at His bidding let it fall and shed their leaves and folded up upon themselves lie in quietness and rest How else as the Moon waxes and wanes as the Sun approaches and recedes can it be that such vicissitude and alternation is seen in earthly things If then all things that grow nay our own bodies are thus bound up with the whole is not this still truer of our souls And if our souls are bound up and in contact with God as being very parts and fragments plucked from Himself shall He not feel every movement of theirs as though it were His own and belonging to His own nature XXXVII But you say I cannot comprehend all this at once Why who told you that your powers were equal to God s Yet God hath placed by the side of each a man s own Guardian Spirit who is charged to watch over him a Guardian who sleeps not nor is deceived For to what better or more watchful Guardian could He have committed which of us So when you have shut the doors and made a darkness within remember never to say that you are alone for you are not alone but God is within and your Guardian Spirit and what light do they need to behold what you do To this God you also should have sworn allegiance even as soldiers unto Caesar They when their service is hired swear to hold the life of Caesar dearer than all else and will you not swear your oath that are deemed worthy of so many and great gifts And will you not keep your oath when you have sworn it And what oath will you swear Never to disobey never to arraign or murmur at aught that comes to you from His hand never unwillingly to do or suffer aught that necessity lays upon you Is this oath like theirs They swear to hold no other dearer than Caesar you to hold our true selves dearer than all else beside XXXVIII How shall my brother cease to be wroth with me Bring him to me and I will tell him But to thee I have nothing to say about his anger XXXIX When one took counsel of Epictetus saying What I seek is this how even though my brother be not reconciled to me I may still remain as Nature would have me to be he replied All great things are slow of growth nay this is true even of a grape or of a fig If then you say to me now I desire a fig I shall answer It needs time wait till it first flower then cast its blossom then ripen Whereas then the fruit of the fig tree reaches not maturity suddenly nor yet in a single hour do you nevertheless desire so quickly and easily to reap the fruit of the mind of man Nay expect it not even though I bade you XL Epaphroditus had a shoemaker whom he sold as being good for nothing This fellow by some accident was afterwards purchased by one of Caesar s men and became a shoemaker to Caesar You should have seen what respect Epaphroditus paid him then How does the good Felicion Kindly let me know And if any of us inquired What is Epaphroditus doing the answer was He is consulting about so and so with Felicion Had he not sold him as good for nothing Who had in a trice converted him into a wiseacre This is what comes of holding of importance anything but the things that depend on the Will XLI What you shun enduring yourself attempt not to impose on others You shun slavery beware of enslaving others If you can endure to do that one would think you had been once upon a time a slave yourself For Vice has nothing in common with virtue nor Freedom with slavery XLII Has a man been raised to tribuneship Every one that he meets congratulates him One kisses him on the eyes another on the neck while the slaves kiss his hands He goes home to find torches burning he ascends to the Capitol to sacrifice Who ever sacrificed for having had right desires for having conceived such inclinations as Nature would have him In truth we thank the Gods for that wherein we place our happiness XLIII A man was talking to me to day about the priesthood of Augustus I said to him Let the thing go my good Sir you will spend a good deal to no purpose Well but my name will be inserted in all documents and contracts Will you be standing there to tell those that read them That is my name written there And even if you could now be there in every case what will you do when you are dead At all events my name will remain Inscribe it on a stone and it will remain just as well And think beyond Nicopolis what memory of you will there be But I shall have a golden wreath to wear If you must have a wreath get a wreath of roses and put it on you will look more elegant XLIV Above all remember that the door stands open Be not more fearful than children but as they when they weary of the game cry I will play no more even so when thou art in the like case cry I will play no more and depart But if thou stayest make no lamentation XLV Is there smoke in the room If it be slight I remain if grievous I quit it For you must remember this and hold it fast that the door stands open You shall not dwell at Nicopolis Well and good Nor at Athens Then I will not dwell at Athens either Nor at Rome Nor at Rome either You shall dwell in Gyara Well but to dwell in Gyara seems to me like a grievous smoke I depart to a place where none can forbid me to dwell that habitation is open unto all As for the last garment of all that is the poor body beyond that none can do aught unto me This why Demetrius said to Nero You threaten me with death it is Nature who threatens you XLVI The beginning of philosophy is to know the condition of one s own mind If a man recognises that this is in a weakly state he will not then want to apply it to questions of the greatest moment As it is men who are not fit to swallow even a morsel buy whole treatises and try to devour them Accordingly they either vomit them up again or suffer from indigestion whence come gripings fluxions and fevers Whereas they should have stopped to consider their capacity XLVII In theory it is easy to convince an ignorant person in actual life men not only object to offer themselves to be convinced but hate the man who has convinced them Whereas Socrates used to say that we should never lead a life not subjected to examination XLVIII This is the reason why Socrates when reminded that he should prepare for his trial answered Thinkest thou not that I have been preparing for it all my life In what way I have maintained that which in me lay How so I have never secretly or openly done a wrong unto any XLIX In what character dost thou now come forward As a witness summoned by God Come thou saith God and testify for me for thou art worthy of being brought forward as a witness by Me Is aught that is outside thy will either good or bad Do I hurt any man Have I placed the good of each in the power of any other than himself What witness dost thou bear to God I am in evil state Master I am undone None careth for me none giveth me aught all men blame all speak evil of me Is this the witness thou wilt bear and do dishonour to the calling wherewith He hath called thee because He hath done thee so great honour and deemed thee worthy of being summoned to bear witness in so great a cause L Wouldst thou have men speak good of thee speak good of them And when thou hast learned to speak good of them try to do good unto them and thus thou wilt reap in return their speaking good of thee LI When thou goest in to any of the great remember that Another from above sees what is passing and that thou shouldst please Him rather than man He therefore asks thee In the Schools what didst thou call exile imprisonment bonds death and shame I called them things indifferent What then dost thou call them now Are they at all changed No Is it then thou that art changed No Say then what are things indifferent Things that are not in our power Say then what follows That things which are not in our power are nothing to me Say also what things you hold to be good A will such as it ought to be and a right use of the things of sense And what is the end To follow Thee LII That Socrates should ever have been so treated by the Athenians Slave why say Socrates Speak of the thing as it is That ever then the poor body of Socrates should have been dragged away and haled by main force to prison That ever hemlock should have been given to the body of Socrates that that should have breathed its life away Do you marvel at this Do you hold this unjust Is it for this that you accuse God Had Socrates no compensation for this Where then for him was the ideal Good Whom shall we hearken to you or him And what says he Anytus and Melitus may put me to death to injure me is beyond their power And again If such be the will of God so let it be LIII Nay young man for heaven s sake but once thou hast heard these words go home and say to thyself It is not Epictetus that has told me these things how indeed should he No it is some gracious God through him Else it would never have entered his head to tell me them he that is not used to speak to any one thus Well then let us not lie under the wrath of God but be obedient unto Him Nay indeed but if a raven by its croaking bears thee any sign it is not the raven but God that sends the sign through the raven and if He signifies anything to thee through human voice will He not cause the man to say these words to thee that thou mayest know the power of the Divine how He sends a sign to some in one way and to others in another and on the greatest and highest matters of all signifies His will through the noblest messenger What else does the poet mean I spake unto him erst Myself and sent Hermes the shining One to check and warn him The husband not to slay nor woo the wife LIV In the same way my friend Heraclitus who had a trifling suit about a petty farm at Rhodes first showed the judges that his cause was just and then at the finish cried I will not entreat you nor do I care what sentence you pass It is you who are on your trial not I And so he ended the case LV As for us we behave like a herd of deer When they flee from the huntsman s feathers in affright which way do they turn What haven of safety do they make for Why they rush upon the nets And thus they perish by confounding what they should fear with that wherein no danger lies Not death or pain is to be feared but the fear of death or pain Well said the poet therefore Death has no terror only a Death of shame LVI How is it then that certain external things are said to be natural and other contrary to Nature Why just as it might be said if we stood alone and apart from others A foot for instance I will allow it is natural should be clean But if you take it as a foot and as a thing which does not stand by itself it will beseem it if need be to walk in the mud to tread on thorns and sometimes even to be cut off for the benefit of the whole body else it is no longer a foot In some such way we should conceive of ourselves also What art thou A man Looked at as standing by thyself and separate it is natural for thee in health and wealth long to live But looked at as a Man and only as a part of a Whole it is for that Whole s sake that thou shouldest at one time fall sick at another brave the perils of the sea again know the meaning of want and perhaps die an early death Why then repine Knowest thou not that as the foot is no more a foot if detached from the body so thou in like case art no longer a Man For what is a Man A part of a City first of the City of Gods and Men next of that which ranks nearest it a miniature of the universal City In such a body in such a world enveloping us among lives like these such things must happen to one or another Thy part then being here is to speak of these things as is meet and to order them as befits the matter LVII That was a good reply which Diogenes made to a man who asked him for letters of recommendation That you are a man he will know when he sees you whether a good or bad one he will know if he has any skill in discerning the good or bad But if he has none he will never know though I write him a thousand times It is as though a piece of silver money desired to be recommended to some one to be tested If the man be a good judge of silver he will know the coin will tell its own tale LVIII Even as the traveller asks his way of him that he meets inclined in no wise to bear to the right rather than to the left for he desires only the way leading whither he would go so should we come unto God as to a guide even as we use our eyes without admonishing them to show us some things rather than others but content to receive the images of such things as they present to us But as it is we stand anxiously watching the victim and with the voice of supplication call upon the augur Master have mercy on me vouchsafe unto me a way of escape Slave would you then have aught else then what is best is there anything better than what is God s good pleasure Why as far as in you lies would you corrupt your Judge and lead your Counsellor astray LIX God is beneficent But the Good also is beneficent It should seem then that where the real nature of God is there too is to be found the real nature of the Good What then is the real nature of God Intelligence Knowledge Right Reason Here then without more ado seek the real nature of the Good For surely thou dost not seek it in a plant or in an animal that reasoneth not LX Seek then the real nature of the Good in that without whose presence thou wilt not admit the Good to exist in aught else What then Are not these other things also works of God They are but not preferred to honour nor are they portions of God But thou art a thing preferred to honour thou art thyself a fragment torn from God thou hast a portion of Him within thyself How is it then that thou dost not know thy high descent dost not know whence thou comest When thou eatest wilt thou not remember who thou art that eatest and whom thou feedest In intercourse in exercise in discussion knowest thou not that it is a God whom thou feedest a God whom thou exercisest a God whom thou bearest about with thee O miserable and thou perceivest it not Thinkest thou that I speak of a God of silver or gold that is without thee Nay thou bearest Him within thee all unconscious of polluting Him with thoughts impure and unclean deeds Were an image of God present thou wouldest not dare to act as thou dost yet when God Himself is present within thee beholding and hearing all thou dost not blush to think such thoughts and do such deeds O thou that art insensible of thine own nature and liest under the wrath of God LXI Why then are we afraid when we send a young man from the Schools into active life lest he should indulge his appetites intemperately lest he should debase himself by ragged clothing or be puffed up by fine raiment Knows he not the God within him knows he not with whom he is starting on his way Have we patience to hear him say to us Would I had thee with me Hast thou not God where thou art and having Him dost thou still seek for any other Would He tell thee aught else than these things Why wert thou a statue of Phidias an Athena or a Zeus thou wouldst bethink thee both of thyself and thine artificer and hadst thou any sense thou wouldst strive to do no dishonour to thyself or him that fashioned thee nor appear to beholders in unbefitting guise But now because God is thy Maker is that why thou carest not of what sort thou shalt show thyself to be Yet how different the artists and their workmanship What human artist s work for example has in it the faculties that are displayed in fashioning it Is it aught but marble bronze gold or ivory Nay when the Athena of Phidias has put forth her hand and received therein a Victory in that attitude she stands for evermore But God s works move and breathe they use and judge the things of sense The workmanship of such an Artist wilt thou dishonor Him Ay when he not only fashioned thee but placed thee like a ward in the care and guardianship of thyself alone wilt thou not only forget this but also do dishonour to what is committed to thy care If God had entrusted thee with an orphan wouldst thou have thus neglected him He hath delivered thee to thine own care saying I had none more faithful than myself keep this man for me such as Nature hath made him modest faithful high minded a stranger to fear to passion to perturbation Such will I show myself to you all What exempt from sickness also from age from death Nay but accepting sickness accepting death as becomes a God LXII No labour according to Diogenes is good but that which aims at producing courage and strength of soul rather than of body LXIII A guide on finding a man who has lost his way brings him back to the right path he does not mock and jeer at him and then take himself off You also must show the unlearned man the truth and you will see that he will follow But so long as you do not show it him you should not mock but rather feel your own incapacity LXIV It was the first and most striking characteristic of Socrates never to become heated in discourse never to utter an injurious or insulting word on the contrary he persistently bore insult from others and thus put an end to the fray If you care to know the extent of his power in this direction read Xenophon s Banquet and you will see how many quarrels he put an end to This is why the Poets are right in so highly commending this faculty Quickly and wisely withal even bitter feuds would he settle Nevertheless the practice is not very safe at present especially in Rome One who adopts it I need not say ought not to carry it out in an obscure corner but boldly accost if occasion serve some personage of rank or wealth Can you tell me sir to whose care you entrust your horses I can Is it to the first comer who knows nothing about them Certainly not Well what of the man who takes care of your gold your silver or your raiment He must be experienced also And your body have you ever considered about entrusting it to any one s care Of course I have And no doubt to a person of experience as a trainer a physician Surely And these things the best you possess or have you anything more precious What can you mean I mean that which employs these which weights all things which takes counsel and resolve Oh you mean the soul You take me rightly I do mean the soul By Heaven I hold that far more precious than all else I possess Can you show me then what care you bestow on a soul For it can scarcely be thought that a man of your wisdom and consideration in the city would suffer your most precious possession to go to ruin through carelessness and neglect Certainly not Well do you take care of it yourself Did any one teach you the right method or did you discover it yourself Now here comes in the danger first that the great man may answer Why what is that to you my good fellow are you my master And then if you persist in troubling him may raise his hand to strike you It is a practice of which I was myself a warm admirer until such experiences as these befell me LXV When a youth was giving himself airs in the Theatre and saying I am wise for I have conversed with many wise men Epictetus replied I too have conversed with many rich men yet I am not rich LXVI We see that a carpenter becomes a carpenter by learning certain things that a pilot by learning certain things becomes a pilot Possibly also in the present case the mere desire to be wise and good is not enough It is necessary to learn certain things This is then the object of our search The Philosophers would have us first learn that there is a God and that His Providence directs the Universe further that to hide from Him not only one s acts but even one s thoughts and intentions is impossible secondly what the nature of God is Whatever that nature is discovered to be the man who would please and obey Him must strive with all his might to be made like unto him If the Divine is faithful he also must be faithful if free he also must be free if beneficent he also must be beneficent if magnanimous he also must be magnanimous Thus as an imitator of God must he follow Him in every deed and word LXVII If I show you that you lack just what is most important and necessary to happiness that hitherto your attention has been bestowed on everything rather than that which claims it most and to crown all that you know neither what God nor Man is neither what Good or Evil is why that you are ignorant of everything else perhaps you may bear to be told but to hear that you know nothing of yourself how could you submit to that How could you stand your ground and suffer that to be proved Clearly not at all You instantly turn away in wrath Yet what harm have I done to you Unless indeed the mirror harms the ill favoured man by showing him to himself just as he is unless the physician can be thought to insult his patient when he tells him Friend do you suppose there is nothing wrong with you why you have a fever Eat nothing to day and drink only water Yet no one says What an insufferable insult Whereas if you say to a man Your desires are inflamed your instincts of rejection are weak and low your aims are inconsistent your impulses are not in harmony with Nature your opinions are rash and false he forthwith goes away and complains that you have insulted him LXVIII Our way of life resembles a fair The flocks and herds are passing along to be sold and the greater part of the crowd to buy and sell But there are some few who come only to look at the fair to inquire how and why it is being held upon what authority and with what object So too in this great Fair of life some like the cattle trouble themselves about nothing but the fodder Know all of you who are busied about land slaves and public posts that these are nothing but fodder Some few there are attending the Fair who love to contemplate what the world is what He that administers it Can there be no Administrator is it possible that while neither city nor household could endure even a moment without one to administer and see to its welfare this Fabric so fair so vast should be administered in order so harmonious without a purpose and by blind chance There is therefore an Administrator What is His nature and how does He administer And who are we that are His children and what work were we born to perform Have we any close connection or relation with Him or not Such are the impressions of the few of whom I speak And further they apply themselves solely to considering and examining the great assembly before they depart Well they are derided by the multitude So are the lookers on by the traders aye and if the beasts had any sense they would deride those who thought much of anything but fodder LXIX I think I know now what I never knew before the meaning of the common saying A fool you can neither bend nor break Pray heaven I may never have a wise fool for my friend There is nothing more intractable My resolve is fixed Why so madman say too but the more firmly they believe in their delusions the more they stand in need of treatment LXX O when shall I see Athens and its Acropolis again Miserable man art thou not contented with the daily sights that meet thine eyes canst thou behold aught greater or nobler than the Sun Moon and Stars than the outspread Earth and Sea If indeed thou apprehendest Him who administers the universe if thou bearest Him about within thee canst thou still hanker after mere fragments of stone and fine rock When thou art about to bid farewell to the Sun and Moon itself wilt thou sit down and cry like a child Why what didst thou hear what didst thou learn why didst thou write thyself down a philosopher when thou mightest have written what was the fact namely I have made one or two Compendiums I have read some works of Chrysippus and I have not even touched the hem of Philosophy s robe LXXI Friend lay hold with a desperate grasp ere it is too late on Freedom on Tranquility on Greatness of soul Lift up thy head as one escaped from slavery dare to look up to God and say Deal with me henceforth as Thou wilt Thou and I are of one mind I am Thine I refuse nothing that seeeth good to Thee lead on whither Thou wilt clothe me in what garb Thou pleasest wilt Thou have me a ruler or a subject at home or in exile poor or rich All these things will I justify unto men for Thee I will show the true nature of each Who would Hercules have been had he loitered at home no Hercules but Eurystheus And in his wanderings through the world how many friends and comrades did he find but nothing dearer to him than God Wherefore he was believed to be God s son as indeed he was So then in obedience to Him he went about delivering the earth from injustice and lawlessness But thou art not Hercules thou sayest and canst not deliver others from their iniquity not even Theseus to deliver the soil of Attica from its monsters Purge away thine own cast forth thence from thine own mind not robbers and monsters but Fear Desire Envy Malignity Avarice Effeminacy Intemperance And these may not be cast out except by looking to God alone by fixing thy affections on Him only and by consecrating thyself to His commands If thou choosest aught else with sighs and groans thou wilt be forced to follow a Might greater than thine own ever seeking Tranquillity without and never able to attain unto her For thou seekest her where she is not to be found and where she is there thou seekest her not LXXII If a man would pursue Philosophy his first task is to throw away conceit For it is impossible for a man to begin to learn what he has a conceit that he already knows LXXIII Give me but one young man that has come to the School with this intention who stands forth a champion of this cause and says All else I renounce content if I am but able to pass my life free from hindrance and trouble to raise my head aloft and face all things as a free man to look up to heaven as a friend of God fearing nothing that may come to pass Point out such a one to me that I may say Enter young man into possession of that which is thine own For thy lot is to adorn Philosophy Thine are these possessions thine these books these discourses And when our champion has duly exercised himself in this part of the subject I hope he will come back to me and say What I desire is to be free from passion and from perturbation as one who grudges no pains in the pursuit of piety and philosophy what I desire is to know my duty to the Gods my duty to my parents to my brothers to my country to strangers Enter then on the second part of the subject it is thine also But I have already mastered the second part only I wished to stand firm and unshaken as firm when asleep as when awake as firm when elated with wine as in despondency and dejection Friend you are verily a God you cherish great designs LXXIV The question at stake said Epictetus is no common one it is this Are we in our senses or are we not LXXV If you have given way to anger be sure that over and above the evil involved therein you have strengthened the habit and added fuel to the fire If overcome by a temptation of the flesh do not reckon it a single defeat but that you have also strengthened your dissolute habits Habits and faculties are necessarily affected by the corresponding acts Those that were not there before spring up the rest gain in strength and extent This is the account which Philosophers give of the origin of diseases of the mind Suppose you have once lusted after money if reason sufficient to produce a sense of evil be applied then the lust is checked and the mind at once regains its original authority whereas if you have recourse to no remedy you can no longer look for this return on the contrary the next time it is excited by the corresponding object the flame of desire leaps up more quickly than before By frequent repetition the mind in the long run becomes callous and thus this mental disease produces confirmed Avarice One who has had fever even when it has left him is not in the same condition of health as before unless indeed his cure is complete Something of the same sort is true also of diseases of the mind Behind there remains a legacy of traces and blisters and unless these are effectually erased subsequent blows on the same spot will produce no longer mere blisters but sores If you do not wish to be prone to anger do not feed the habit give it nothing which may tend its increase At first keep quiet and count the days when you were not angry I used to be angry every day then every other day next every two next every three days and if you succeed in passing thirty days sacrifice to the Gods in thanksgiving LXXVI How then may this be attained Resolve now if never before to approve thyself to thyself resolve to show thyself fair in God s sight long to be pure with thine own pure self and God LXXVII That is the true athlete that trains himself to resist such outward impressions as these Stay wretched man suffer not thyself to be carried away Great is the combat divine the task you are fighting for Kingship for Liberty for Happiness for Tranquillity Remember God call upon Him to aid thee like a comrade that stands beside thee in the fight LXXVIII Who then is a Stoic in the sense that we call a statue of Phidias which is modelled after that master s art Show me a man in this sense modelled after the doctrines that are ever upon his lips Show me a man that is sick and happy an exile and happy in evil report and happy Show me him I ask again So help me Heaven I long to see one Stoic Nay if you cannot show me one fully modelled let me at least see one in whom the process is at work one whose bent is in that direction Do me that favour Grudge it not to an old man to behold a sight he has never yet beheld Think you I wish to see the Zeus or Athena of Phidias bedecked with gold and ivory Nay show me one of you a human soul desiring to be of one mind with God no more to lay blame on God or man to suffer nothing to disappoint nothing to cross him to yield neither to anger envy nor jealousy in a word why disguise the matter one that from a man would fain become a God one that while still imprisoned in this dead body makes fellowship with God his aim Show me him Ah you cannot Then why mock yourselves and delude others why stalk about tricked out in other men s attire thieves and robbers that you are of names and things to which you can show no title LXXIX If you have assumed a character beyond your strength you have both played a poor figure in that and neglected one that is within your powers LXXX Fellow you have come to blows at home with a slave you have turned the household upside down and thrown the neighbourhood into confusion and do you come to me then with airs of assumed modesty do you sit down like a sage and criticise my explanation of the readings and whatever idle babble you say has come into my head Have you come full of envy and dejected because nothing is sent you from home and while the discussion is going on do you sit brooding on nothing but how your father or your brother are disposed towards you What are they saying about me there at this moment they imagine I am making progress and saying He will return perfectly omniscient I wish I could become omniscient before I return but that would be very troublesome No one sends me anything the baths at Nicopolis are dirty things are wretched at home and wretched here And then they say Nobody is any the better for the School Who comes to the School with a sincere wish to learn to submit his principles to correction and himself to treatment Who to gain a sense of his wants Why then be surprised if you carry home from the School exactly what you bring into it LXXXI Epictetus I have often come desiring to hear you speak and you have never given me any answer now if possible I entreat you say something to me Is there do you think replied Epictetus an art of speaking as of other things if it is to be done skilfully and with profit to the hearer Yes And are all profited by what they hear or only some among them So that it seems there is an art of hearing as well as of speaking To make a statue needs skill to view a statue aright needs skill also Admitted And I think all will allow that one who proposes to hear philosophers speak needs a considerable training in hearing Is that not so The tell me on what subject your are able to hear me Why on good and evil The good and evil of what a horse an ox No of a man Do we know then what Man is what his nature is what is the idea we have of him And are our ears practised in any degree on the subject Nay do you understand what Nature is can you follow me in any degree when I say that I shall have to use demonstration Do you understand what Demonstration is what True or False is must I drive you to Philosophy Show me what good I am to do by discoursing with you Rouse my desire to do so The sight of a pasture it loves stirs in a sheep the desire to feed show it a stone or a bit of bread and it remains unmoved Thus we also have certain natural desires aye and one that moves us to speak when we find a listener that is worth his salt one that himself stirs the spirit But if he sits by like a stone or a tuft of grass how can he rouse a man s desire Then you will say nothing to me I can only tell you this that one who knows not who he is and to what end he was born what kind of world this is and with whom he is associated therein one who cannot distinguish Good and Evil Beauty and Foulness Truth and Falsehood will never follow Reason in shaping his desires and impulses and repulsions nor yet in assent denial or suspension of judgement but will in one word go about deaf and blind thinking himself to be somewhat when he is in truth of no account Is there anything new in all this Is not this ignorance the cause of all the mistakes and mischances of men since the human race began This is all I have to say to you and even this against the grain Why Because you have not stirred my spirit For what can I see in you to stir me as a spirited horse will stir a judge of horses Your body That you maltreat Your dress That is luxurious You behavior your look Nothing whatever When you want to hear a philosopher do not say You say nothing to me only show yourself worthy or fit to hear and then you will see how you will move the speaker LXXXII And now when you see brothers apparently good friends and living in accord do not immediately pronounce anything upon their friendship though they should affirm it with an oath though they should declare For us to live apart in a thing impossible For the heart of a bad man is faithless unprincipled inconstant now overpowered by one impression now by another Ask not the usual questions Were they born of the same parents reared together and under the same tutor but ask this only in what they place their real interest whether in outward things or in the Will If in outward things call them not friends any more than faithful constant brave or free call them not even human beings if you have any sense But should you hear that these men hold the Good to lie only in the Will only in rightly dealing with the things of sense take no more trouble to inquire whether they are father and son or brothers or comrades of long standing but sure of this one thing pronounce as boldly that they are friends as that they are faithful and just for where else can Friendship be found than where Modesty is where there is an interchange of things fair and honest and of such only LXXXIII No man can rob us of our Will no man can lord it over that LXXXIV When disease and death overtake me I would fain be found engaged in the task of liberating mine own Will from the assaults of passion from hindrance from resentment from slavery Thus would I fain to be found employed so that I may say to God Have I in aught transgressed Thy commands Have I in aught perverted the faculties the senses the natural principles that Thou didst give me Have I ever blamed Thee or found fault with Thine administration When it was Thy good pleasure I fell sick and so did other men by my will consented Because it was Thy pleasure I became poor but my heart rejoiced No power in the State was mine because Thou wouldst not such power I never desired Hast Thou ever seen me of more doleful countenance on that account Have I not ever drawn nigh unto Thee with cheerful look waiting upon Thy commands attentive to Thy signals Wilt Thou that I now depart from the great Assembly of men I go I give Thee all thanks that Thou hast deemed me worthy to take part with Thee in this Assembly to behold Thy works to comprehend this Thine administration Such I would were the subject of my thoughts my pen my study when death overtakes me LXXXV Seemeth it nothing to you never to accuse never to blame either God or Man to wear ever the same countenance in going forth as in coming in This was the secret of Socrates yet he never said that he knew or taught anything Who amongst you makes this his aim Were it indeed so you would gladly endure sickness hunger aye death itself LXXXVI How are we constituted by Nature To be free to be noble to be modest for what other living thing is capable of blushing or of feeling the impression of shame and to subordinate pleasure to the ends for which Nature designed us as a handmaid and a minister in order to call forth our activity in order to keep us constant to the path prescribed by Nature LXXXVII The husbandman deals with land physicians and trainers with the body the wise man with his own Mind LXXXVIII Which of us does not admire what Lycurgus the Spartan did A young citizen had put out his eye and been handed over to him by the people to be punished at his own discretion Lycurgus abstained from all vengeance but on the contrary instructed and made a good man of him Producing him in public in the theatre he said to the astonished Spartans I received this young man at your hands full of violence and wanton insolence I restore him to you in his right mind and fit to serve his country LXXXIX A money changer may not reject Caesar s coin nor may the seller of herbs but must when once the coin is shown deliver what is sold for it whether he will or no So is it also with the Soul Once the Good appears it attracts towards itself evil repels But a clear and certain impression of the Good the Soul will never reject any more than men do Caesar s coin On this hangs every impulse alike of Man and God XC Asked what Common Sense was Epictetus replied As that may be called a Common Ear which distinguishes only sounds while that which distinguishes musical notes is not common but produced by training so there are certain things which men not entirely perverted see by the natural principles common to all Such a constitution of the Mind is called Common Sense XCI Canst thou judge men then make us imitators of thyself as Socrates did Do this do not do that else will I cast thee into prison this is not governing men like reasonable creatures Say rather As God hath ordained so do else thou wilt suffer chastisement and loss Askest thou what loss None other than this To have left undone what thou shouldst have done to have lost the faithfulness the reverence the modesty that is in thee Greater loss than this seek not to find XCII His son is dead What has happened His son is dead Nothing more Nothing His ship is lost He has been haled to prison What has happened He has been haled to prison But that any of these things are misfortunes to him is an addition which every one makes of his own But you say God is unjust is this Why For having given thee endurance and greatness of soul For having made such things to be no evils For placing happiness within thy reach even when enduring them For open unto thee a door when things make not for thy good Depart my friend and find fault no more XCIII You are sailing to Rome you tell me to obtain the post of Governor of Cnossus You are not content to stay at home with the honours you had before you want something on a larger scale and more conspicuous But when did you ever undertake a voyage for the purpose of reviewing your own principles and getting rid of any of them that proved unsound Whom did you ever visit for that object What time did you ever set yourself for that What age Run over the times of your life by yourself if you are ashamed before me Did you examine your principles when a boy Did you not do everything just as you do now Or when you were a stripling attending the school of oratory and practising the art yourself what did you ever imagine you lacked And when you were a young man entered upon public life and were pleading causes and making a name who any longer seemed equal to you And at what moment would you have endured another examining your principles and proving that they were unsound What then am I to say to you Help me in this matter you cry Ah for that I have no rule And neither did you if that was your object come to me as a philosopher but as you might have gone to a herb seller or a cobbler What do philosophers have rules for then Why that whatever may betide our ruling faculty may be as Nature would have it and so remain Think you this a small matter Not so but the greatest thing there is Well does it need but a short time Can it be grasped by a passer by grasp it if you can Then you will say Yes I met Epictetus Aye just as you might a statue or a monument You saw me and that is all But a man who meets a man is one who learns the other s mind and lets him see his in turn Learn my mind show me yours and then go and say that you met me Let us try each other if I have any wrong principle rid me of it if you have out with it That is what meeting a philosopher means Not so you think this is only a flying visit while we are hiring the ship we can see Epictetus too Let us see what he has to say Then on leaving you cry Out on Epictetus for a worthless fellow provincial and barbarous of speech What else indeed did you come to judge of XCIV Whether you will or no you are poorer than I What then do I lack What you have not Constancy of mind such as Nature would have it be Tranquillity Patron or no patron what care I but you do care I am richer than you I am not racked with anxiety as to what Caesar may think of me I flatter none on that account This is what I have instead of vessels of gold and silver your vessels may be of gold but your reason your principles your accepted views your inclinations your desires are of earthenware XCV To you all you have seems small to me all I have seems great Your desire is insatiable mine is satisfied See children thrusting their hands into a narrow necked jar and striving to pull out the nuts and figs it contains if they fill the hand they cannot pull it out again and then they fall to tears Let go a few of them and then you can draw out the rest You too let your desire go covet not many things and you will obtain XCVI Pittacus wronged by one whom he had it in his power to punish let him go free saying Forgiveness is better than revenge The one shows native gentleness the other savagery XCVII My brother ought not to have treated me thus True but he must see to that However he may treat me I must deal rightly by him This is what lies with me what none can hinder XCVIII Nevertheless a man should also be prepared to be sufficient unto himself to dwell with himself alone even as God dwells with Himself alone shares His repose with none and considers the nature of His own administration intent upon such thoughts as are meet unto Himself So should we also be able to converse with ourselves to need none else beside to sigh for no distraction to bend our thoughts upon the Divine Administration and how we stand related to all else to observe how human accidents touched us of old and how they touch us now what things they are that still have power to hurt us and how they may be cured or removed to perfect what needs perfecting as Reason would direct XCIX If a man has frequent intercourse with others either in the way of conversation entertainment or simple familiarity he must either become like them or change them to his own fashion A live coal placed next a dead one will either kindle that or be quenched by it Such being the risk it is well to be cautious in admitting intimacies of this sort remembering that one cannot rub shoulders with a soot stained man without sharing the soot oneself What will you do supposing the talk turns on gladiators or horses or prize fighters or what is worse on persons condemning this and that approving the other Or suppose a man sneers and jeers or shows a malignant temper Has any among us the skill of the lute player who knows at the first touch which strings are out of tune and sets the instrument right has any of you such power as Socrates had in all his intercourse with men of winning them over to his own convictions Nay but you must needs be swayed hither and thither by the uninstructed How comes it then that they prove so much stronger than you Because they speak from the fulness of the heart their low corrupt views are their real convictions whereas your fine sentiments are but from the lips outwards that is why they are so nerveless and dead It turns one s stomach to listen to your exhortations and hear of your miserable Virtue that you prate of up and down Thus it is that the Vulgar prove too strong for you Everywhere strength everywhere victory waits your conviction C In general any methods of discipline applied to the body which tend to modify its desires or repulsions are good for ascetic ends But if done for display they betray at once a man who keeps an eye on outward show who has an ulterior purpose and is looking for spectators to shout Oh what a great man This is why Apollonius so well said If you are bent upon a little private discipline wait till you are choking with heat some day then take a mouthful of cold water and spit it out again and tell no man CI Study how to give as one that is sick that thou mayest hereafter give as one that is whole Fast drink water only abstain altogether from desire that thou mayest hereafter conform thy desire to Reason CII Thou wouldst do good unto men then show them by thine own example what kind of men philosophy can make and cease from foolish trifling Eating do good to them that eat with thee drinking to them that drink with thee yield unto all give way and bear with them Thus shalt thou do them good but vent not upon them thine own evil humour CIII Even as bad actors cannot sing alone but only in chorus so some cannot walk alone Man if thou art aught strive to walk alone and hold converse with thyself instead of skulking in the chorus at length think look around thee bestir thyself that thou mayest know who thou art CIV You would fain be victor at the Olympic games you say Yes but weigh the conditions weigh the consequences then and then only lay to your hand if it be for your profit You must live by rule submit to diet abstain from dainty meats exercise your body perforce at stated hours in heat or in cold drink no cold water nor it may be wine In a word you must surrender yourself wholly to your trainer as though to a physician Then in the hour of contest you will have to delve the ground it may chance dislocate an arm sprain an ankle gulp down abundance of yellow sand be scourge with the whip and with all this sometimes lose the victory Count the cost and then if your desire still holds try the wrestler s life Else let me tell you that you will be behaving like a pack of children playing now at wrestlers now at gladiators presently falling to trumpeting and anon to stage playing when the fancy takes them for what they have seen And you are even the same wrestler gladiator philosopher orator all by turns and none of them with your whole soul Like an ape you mimic what you see to one thing constant never the thing that is familiar charms no more This is because you never undertook aught with due consideration nor after strictly testing and viewing it from every side no your choice was thoughtless the glow of your desire had waxed cold Friend bethink you first what it is you would do and then what your own nature is able to bear Would you be a wrestler consider your shoulders your thighs your loins not all men are formed to the same end Think you to be a philosopher while acting as you do think you go on thus eating thus drinking giving way in like manner to wrath and to displeasure Nay you must watch you must labour overcome certain desires quit your familiar friends submit to be despised by your slave to be held in derision by them that meet you to take the lower place in all things in office in positions of authority in courts of law Weigh these things fully and then if you will lay to your hand if as the price of these things you would gain Freedom Tranquillity and passionless Serenity CV He that hath no musical instruction is a child in Music he that hath no letters is a child in Learning he that is untaught is a child in Life CVI Can any profit be derived from these men Aye from all What even from a reviler Why tell me what profit a wrestler gains from him who exercises him beforehand The very greatest he trains me in the practice of endurance of controlling my temper of gentle ways You deny it What the man who lays hold of my neck and disciplines loins and shoulders does me good while he that trains me to keep my temper does me none This is what it means not knowing how to gain advantage from men Is my neighbour bad Bad to himself but good to me he brings my good temper my gentleness into play Is my father bad Bad to himself but good to me This is the rod of Hermes touch what you will with it they say and it becomes gold Nay but bring what you will and I will transmute it into Good Bring sickness bring death bring poverty and reproach bring trial for life all these things through the rod of Hermes shall be turned to profit CVII Till then these sound opinions have taken firm root in you and you have gained a measure of strength for your security I counsel you to be cautious in associating with the uninstructed Else whatever impressions you receive upon the tablets of your mind in the School will day by day melt and disappear like wax in the sun Withdraw then somewhere far from the sun while you have these waxen sentiments CVIII We must approach this matter in a different way it is great and mystical it is no common thing nor given to every man Wisdom alone it may be will not suffice for the care of youth a man needs also a certain measure of readiness an aptitude for the office aye and certain bodily qualities and above all to be counselled of God Himself to undertake this post even as He counselled Socrates to fill the post of one who confutes error assigning to Diogenes the royal office of high reproof and to Zeno that of positive instruction Whereas you would fain set up for a physician provided with nothing but drugs Where and how they should be applied you neither know nor care CIX If what charms you is nothing but abstract principles sit down and turn them over quietly in your mind but never dub yourself a Philosopher nor suffer others to call you so Say rather He is in error for my desires my impulses are unaltered I give in my adhesion to what I did before nor has my mode of dealing with the things of sense undergone any change CX When a friend inclined to Cynic views asked Epictetus what sort of person a true Cynic should be requesting a general sketch of the system he answered We will consider that at leisure At present I content myself with saying this much If a man put his hand to so weighty a matter without God the wrath of God abides upon him That which he covets will but bring upon him public shame Not even on finding himself in a well ordered house does a man step forward and say to himself I must be master here Else the lord of that house takes notice of it and seeing him insolently giving orders drags him forth and chastises him So it is also in this great City the World Here also is there a Lord of the House who orders all thing Thou are the Sun in thine orbit thou hast power to make the year and the seasons to bid the fruits of the earth to grow and increase the winds arise and fall thou canst in due measure cherish with thy warmth the frames of men go make thy circuit and thus minister unto all from the greatest to the least Thou canst lead a host against Troy be Agamemnon Thou canst meet Hector in single combat be Achilles But had Thersites stepped forward and claimed the chief command he had been met with a refusal or obtained it only to his own shame and confusion of face before a cloud of witnesses CXI Others may fence themselves with walls and houses when they do such deeds as these and wrap themselves in darkness aye they have many a device to hide themselves Another may shut his door and station one before his chamber to say if any comes He has gone forth he is not at leisure But the true Cynic will have none of these things instead of them he must wrap himself in Modesty else he will but bring himself to shame naked and under the open sky That is his house that is his door that is the slave that guards his chamber that is his darkness CXII Death let it come when it will whether it smite but a part of the whole Fly you tell me fly But whither shall I fly Can any man cast me beyond the limits of the World It may not be And whithersoever I go there shall I still find Sun Moon and Stars there I shall find dreams and omens and converse with the Gods CXIII Furthermore the true Cynic must know that he is sent as a Messenger from God to men to show unto them that as touching good and evil they are in error looking for these where they are not to be found nor ever bethinking themselves where they are And like Diogenes when brought before Philip after the battle of Chaeronea the Cynic must remember that he is a Spy For a Spy he really is to bring back word what things are on Man s side and what against him And when he had diligently observed all he must come back with a true report not terrified into announcing them to be foes that are no foes nor otherwise perturbed or confounded by the things of sense CXIV How can it be that one who hath nothing neither raiment nor house nor home nor bodily tendance nor servant nor city should yet live tranquil and contented Behold God hath sent you a man to show you in act and deed that it may be so Behold me I have neither house nor possessions nor servants the ground is my couch I have no wife no children no shelter nothing but earth and sky and one poor cloak And what lack I yet am I not untouched by sorrow by fear am I not free when have I laid anything to the charge of God or Man when have I accused any hath any of you seen me with a sorrowful countenance And in what wise treat I those of whom you stand in fear and awe Is it not as slaves Who when he seeth me doth not think that he beholdeth his Master and his King CXV Give thyself more diligently to reflection know thyself take counsel with the Godhead without God put thine hand unto nothing CXVI But to marry and to rear offspring said the young man will the Cynic hold himself bound to undertake this as a chief duty Grant me a republic of wise men answered Epictetus and perhaps none will lightly take the Cynic life upon him For on whose account should he embrace that method of life Suppose however that he does there will then be nothing to hinder his marrying and rearing offspring For his wife will be even such another as himself and likewise her father and in like manner will his children be brought up But in the present condition of things which resembles an Army in battle array ought not the Cynic to be free from all distraction and given wholly to the service of God so that he can go in and out among men neither fettered by the duties nor entangled by the relations of common life For if he transgress them he will forfeit the character of a good man and true whereas if he observe them there is an end to him as the Messenger the Spy the Herald of the Gods CXVII Ask me if you choose if a Cynic shall engage in the administration of the State O fool seek you a nobler administration that that in which he is engaged Ask you if a man shall come forward in the Athenian assembly and talk about revenue and supplies when his business is to converse with all men Athenians Corinthians and Romans alike not about supplies not about revenue nor yet peace and war but about Happiness and Misery Prosperity and Adversity Slavery and Freedom Ask you whether a man shall engage in the administration of the State who has engaged in such an Administration as this Ask me too if he shall govern and again I will answer Fool what greater government shall he hold than he holds already CXVIII Such a man needs also to have a certain habit of body If he appears consumptive thin and pale his testimony has no longer the same authority He must not only prove to the unlearned by showing them what his Soul is that it is possible to be a good man apart from all that they admire but he must also show them by his body that a plain and simple manner of life under the open sky does no harm to the body either See I am proof of this and my body also As Diogenes used to do who went about fresh of look and by the very appearance of his body drew men s eyes But if a Cynic is an object of pity he seems a mere beggar all turn away all are offended at him Nor should he be slovenly of look so as not to scare men from him in this way either on the contrary his very roughness should be clean and attractive CXIX Kings and tyrants have armed guards wherewith to chastise certain persons though they themselves be evil But to the Cynic conscience gives this power not arms and guards When he knows that he has watched and laboured on behalf of mankind that sleep hath found him pure and left him purer still that his thoughts have been the thought of a Friend of the Gods of a servant yet one that hath a part in the government of the Supreme God that the words are ever on his lips Lead me O God and thou O Destiny as well as these If this be God s will so let it be Why should he not speak boldly unto his own brethren unto his children in a word unto all that are akin to him CXX Does a Philosopher apply to people to come and hear him does he not rather of his own nature attract those that will be benefited by him like the sun that warms the food that sustains them What Physician applies to men to come and be healed Though indeed I hear that the Physicians at Rome do nowadays apply for patients in my time they were applied to I apply to you to come and hear that you are in evil case that what deserves your attention most is the last thing to gain it that you know not good from evil and are in short a hapless wretch a fine way to apply though unless the words of the Philosopher affect you thus speaker and speech are alike dead CXXI A Philosopher s school is a Surgery pain not pleasure you should have felt therein For on entering none of you is whole One has a shoulder out of joint another an abscess a third suffers from an issue a fourth from pains in the head And am I then to sit down and treat you to pretty sentiments and empty flourishes so that you may applaud me and depart with neither shoulder nor head nor issue nor abscess a whit the better for your visit Is it then for this that young men are to quit their homes and leave parents friends kinsmen and substance to mouth out Bravo to your empty phrases CXXII If any be unhappy let him remember that he is unhappy by reason of himself alone For God hath made all men to enjoy felicity and constancy of good CXXII Shall we never wean ourselves shall we never heed the teachings of Philosophy unless perchance they have been sounding in our ears like an enchanter s drone This World is one great City and one is the substance whereof it is fashioned a certain period indeed there needs must be while these give place to those some must perish for others to succeed some move and some abide yet all is full of friends first God then Men whom Nature hath bound by ties of kindred each to each CXXIV Nor did the hero weep and lament at leaving his children orphans For he knew that no man is an orphan but it is the Father that careth for all continually and for evermore Not by mere report had he heard that the Supreme God is the Father of men seeing that he called Him Father believing Him so to be and in all that he did had ever his eyes fixed upon Him Wherefore in whatsoever place he was there is was given him to live happily CXXV Know you not that the thing is a warfare one man s duty is to mount guard another must go out to reconnoitre a third to battle all cannot be in one place nor would it even be expedient But you instead of executing you Commander s orders complain if aught harsher than usual is enjoined not understanding to what condition you are bringing the army so far as in you lies If all were to follow your example none would dig a trench none would cast a rampart around the camp none would keep watch or expose himself to danger but all turn out useless for the service of war Thus it is here also Every life is a warfare and that long and various You must fulfil a soldier s duty and obey each order at your commander s nod aye if it be possible divine what he would have done for between that Command and this there is no comparison either in might or in excellence CXXVI Have you again forgotten Know you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake but for the sake of having done right Is there no reward then Reward do you seek any greater reward for a good man than doing what is right and just Yet at the Great Games you look for nothing else there the victor s crown you deem enough Seems it to you so small a thing and worthless to be a good man and happy therein CXXVII It befits thee not to be unhappy by reason of any but rather to be happy by reason of all men and especially by reason of God who formed us to this end CXXVIII What did Diogenes love no man he that was so gentle so true a friend to men as cheerfully to endure such bodily hardships for the common weal of all mankind But how loved he them As behoved a minister of the Supreme God alike caring for men and subject unto God CXXIX I am by Nature made for my own good not for my own evil CXXX Remind thyself that he whom thou lovest is mortal that what thou lovest is not thine own it is given thee for the present not irrevocably nor for ever but even as a fig or a bunch of grapes at the appointed season of the year But these are words of evil omen What callest thou aught of evil omen save that which signifies some evil thing Cowardice is a word of evil omen if thou wilt and meanness of spirit and lamentation and mourning and shamelessness But do not I pray thee call of evil omen a word that is significant of any natural thing as well call of evil omen the reaping of the corn for that means the destruction of the ears though not of the World as well say that the fall of the leaf is of evil omen that the dried fig should take the place of the green that raisins should be made from grapes All these are changes from a former state into another not destruction but an ordered economy a fixed administration Such is leaving home a change of small account such is Death a greater change from what now is not to what is not but to what is not now Shall I then no longer be Not so thou wilt be but something different of which the World now hath need For thou too wert born not when thou chosest but when the World had need of thee CXXXI Wherefore a good man and true bearing in mind who he is and whence he came and from whom he sprang cares only how he may fill his post with due discipline and obedience to God Wilt thou that I continue to live Then will I live as one that is free and noble as Thou wouldst have me For Thou hast made me free from hindrance in what appertaineth unto me But hast Thou no further need of me I thank Thee Up to this hour have I stayed for Thy sake and none other s and now in obedience to Thee I depart How dost thou depart Again I say as Thou wouldst have me as one that is free as Thy servant as one whose ear is open unto what Thou dost enjoin what Thou dost forbid CXXXII Whatsoever place or post Thou assignest me sooner will I die a thousand deaths as Socrates said than desert it And where wilt Thou have me to be At Rome or Athens At Thebes or on a desert island Only remember me there Shouldst Thou send me where man cannot live as Nature would have him I will depart not in disobedience to Thee but as though Thou wert sounding the signal for my retreat I am not deserting Thee far be that from me I only perceive that thou needest me no longer CXXXIII If you are in Gyaros do not let your mind dwell upon life at Rome and all the pleasures it offered to you when living there and all that would attend your return Rather be intent on this how he that lives in Gyaros may live in Gyaros like a man of spirit And if you are at Rome do not let your mind dwell upon the life at Athens but study only how to live at Rome Finally in the room of all other pleasures put this the pleasure which springs from conscious obedience to God CXXXIV To a good man there is no evil either in life or death And if God supply not food has He not as a wise Commander sounded the signal for retreat and nothing more I obey I follow speaking good of my Commander and praising His acts For at His good pleasure I came and I depart when it pleases Him and while I was yet alive that was my work to sing praises unto God CXXXV Reflect that the chief source of all evils to Man and of baseness and cowardice is not death but the fear of death Against this fear then I pray you harden yourself to this let all your reasonings your exercises your reading tend Then shall you know that thus alone are men set free CXXXVI He is free who lives as he wishes to live to whom none can do violence none hinder or compel whose impulses are unimpeded whose desires are attain their purpose who falls not into what he would avoid Who then would live in error None Who would live deceived and prone to fall unjust intemperate in abject whining at his lot None Then doth no wicked man live as he would and therefore neither is he free CXXXVII Thus do the more cautious of travellers act The road is said to be beset by robbers The traveller will not venture alone but awaits the companionship on the road of an ambassador a quaestor or a proconsul To him he attaches himself and thus passes by in safety So doth the wise man in the world Many are the companies of robbers and tyrants many the storms the straits the losses of all a man holds dearest Whither shall he fall for refuge how shall he pass by unassailed What companion on the road shall he await for protection Such and such a wealthy man of consular rank And how shall I be profited if he is stripped and falls to lamentation and weeping And how if my fellow traveller himself turns upon me and robs me What am I to do I will become a friend of Caesar s in his train none will do me wrong In the first place O the indignities I must endure to win distinction O the multitude of hands there will be to rob me And if I succeed Caesar too is but a mortal While should it come to pass that I offend him whither shall I flee from his presence To the wilderness And may not fever await me there What then is to be done Cannot a fellow traveller be found that is honest and loyal strong and secure against surprise Thus doth the wise man reason considering that if he would pass through in safety he must attach himself unto God CXXXVIII How understandest thou attach himself to God That what God wills he should will also that what God wills not neither should he will How then may this come to pass By considering the movements of God and His administration CXXXIX And dost thou that hast received all from another s hands repine and blame the Giver if He takes anything from thee Why who art thou and to what end comest thou here was it not He that made the Light manifest unto thee that gave thee fellow workers and senses and the power to reason And how brought He thee into the world Was it not as one born to die as one bound to live out his earthly life in some small tabernacle of flesh to behold His administration and for a little while share with Him in the mighty march of this great Festival Procession Now therefore that thou hast beheld while it was permitted thee the Solemn Feast and Assembly wilt thou not cheerfully depart when He summons thee forth with adoration and thanksgiving for what thou hast seen and heard Nay but I would fain have stayed longer at the Festival Ah so would the mystics fain have the rites prolonged so perchance would the crowd at the Great Games fain behold more wrestlers still But the Solemn Assembly is over Come forth depart with thanksgiving and modesty give place to others that must come into being even as thyself CXL Why art thou thus insatiable why thus unreasonable why encumber the world Aye but I fain would have my wife and children with me too What are they then thine and not His that gave them His that made thee Give up then that which is not thine own yield it to One who is better than thou Nay but why did He bring one into the world on these conditions If it suits thee not depart He hath no need of a spectator who finds fault with his lot Them that will take part in the Feast he needeth that will lift their voices with the rest that men may applaud the more and exalt the Great Assembly in hymns and songs of praise But the wretched and the fearful He will not be displeased to see absent from it for when they were present they did not behave as at a Feast nor fulfil their proper office but moaned as though in pain and found fault with their fate their fortune and their companions insensible to what had fallen to their lot insensible to the powers they had received for a very different purpose the powers of Magnanimity Nobility of Heart of Fortitude or Freedom CXLI Art thou then free a man may say So help me heaven I long and pray for freedom But I cannot look my masters boldly in the face I still value the poor body I still set much store on its preservation whole and sound But I can point thee out a free man that thou mayest be no more in search of an example Diogenes was free How so Not because he was of free parentage for that indeed was not the case but because he was himself free He had cast away every handle whereby slavery might lay hold of him to enslave him nor was it possible for any to approach and take hold of him to enslave him All things sat loose upon him all things were to him attached by but slender ties Hadst thou seized upon his possessions he would rather have let them go than have followed thee for them aye had it been even a limb or mayhap his whole body and in like manner relatives friends and country For he knew whence they came from whose hands and on what terms he had received them His true forefathers the Gods his true Country he never would have abandoned nor would he have yielded to any man in obedience and submission to the one nor in cheerfully dying for the other For he was ever mindful that everything that comes to pass has its source and origin there being indeed brought about for the weal of that his true Country and directed by Him in whose governance it is CXLII Ponder on this on these convictions on these words fix thine eyes on these examples if thou wouldst be free if thou hast thine heart set upon the matter according to its worth And what marvel if thou purchase so great a thing at so great and high a price For the sake of this that men deem liberty some hang themselves others cast themselves down from the rock aye time has been when whole cities came utterly to an end while for the sake of Freedom that is true and sure and unassailable dost thou grudge to God what He gave when He claims it Wilt thou not study as Plato saith to endure not death alone but torture exile stripes in a word to render up all that is not thine own Else thou wilt be a slave amid slaves wert thou ten thousand times a consul aye not a whit the less though thou climb the Palace steps And thou shalt know how true the saying of Cleanthes that though the words of philosophers may run counter to the opinions of the world yet have they reason on their side CXLIII Asked how a man should best grieve his enemy Epictetus replied By setting himself to live the noblest life himself CXLIV I am free I am a friend of God ready to render Him willing obedience Of all else I may set store by nothing neither by mine own body nor possessions nor office nor good report nor in a word aught else beside For it is not His Will that I should so set store by these things Had it been His pleasure He would have placed my Good therein But now He hath not done so therefore I cannot transgress one jot of His commands In everything hold fast to that which is thy Good but to all else as far as is given thee within the measure of Reason only contented with this alone Else thou wilt meet with failure ill success let and hindrance These are the Laws ordained of God these are His Edicts these a man should expound and interpret to these submit himself not to the laws of Masurius and Cassius CXLV Remember that not the love of power and wealth sets us under the heel of others but even the love of tranquillity of leisure of change of scene of learning in general it matters not what the outward thing may be to set store by it is to place thyself in subjection to another Where is the difference then between desiring to be a Senator and desiring not to be one between thirsting for office and thirsting to be quit of it Where is the difference between crying Woe is me I know not what to do bound hand and foot as I am to my books so that I cannot stir and crying Woe is me I have not time to read As though a book were not as much an outward thing and independent of the will as office and power and the receptions of the great Or what reason hast thou tell me for desiring to read For if thou aim at nothing beyond the mere delight of it or gaining some scrap of knowledge thou art but a poor spiritless knave But if thou desirest to study to its proper end what else is this than a life that flows on tranquil and serene And if thy reading secures thee not serenity what profits it Nay but it doth secure it quoth he and that is why I repine at being deprived of it And what serenity is this that lies at the mercy of every passer by I say not at the mercy of the Emperor or Emperor s favorite but such as trembles at a raven s croak and piper s din a fever s touch or a thousand things of like sort Whereas the life serene has no more certain mark than this that it ever moves with constant unimpeded flow CXLVI If thou hast put malice and evil speaking from thee altogether or in some degree if thou hast put away from thee rashness foulness of tongue intemperance sluggishness if thou art not moved by what once moved thee or in like manner as thou once wert moved then thou mayest celebrate a daily festival to day because thou hast done well in this manner to morrow in that How much greater cause is here for offering sacrifice than if a man should become Consul or Prefect CXLVII These things hast thou from thyself and from the Gods only remember who it is that giveth them to whom and for what purpose they were given Feeding thy soul on thoughts like these dost thou debate in what place happiness awaits thee in what place thou shalt do God s pleasure Are not the Gods nigh unto all places alike see they not alike what everywhere comes to pass CXLVIII To each man God hath granted this inward freedom These are the principles that in a house create love in a city concord among nations peace teaching a man gratitude towards God and cheerful confidence wherever he may be in dealing with outward things that he knows are neither his nor worth striving after CXLIX If you seek Truth you will not seek to gain a victory by every possible means and when you have found Truth you need not fear being defeated CL What foolish talk is this how can I any longer lay claim to right principles if I am not content with being what I am but am all aflutter about what I am supposed to be CLI God hath made all things in the world nay the world itself free from hindrance and perfect and its parts for the use of the whole No other creature is capable of comprehending His administration thereof but the reasonable being Man possesses faculties for the consideration of all these things not only that he is himself a part but what part he is and how it is meet that the parts should give place to the whole Nor is this all Being naturally constituted noble magnanimous and free he sees that the things which surround him are of two kinds Some are free from hindrance and in the power of the will Other are subject to hindrance and depend on the will of other men If then he place his own good his own best interest only in that which is free from hindrance and in his power he will be free tranquil happy unharmed noble hearted and pious giving thanks to all things unto God finding fault with nothing that comes to pass laying no charge against anything Whereas if he place his good in outward things depending not on the will he must perforce be subject to hindrance and restraint the slave of those that have power over the things he desires and fears he must perforce be impious as deeming himself injured at the hands of God he must be unjust as ever prone to claim more than his due he must perforce be of a mean and abject spirit CLII Whom then shall I fear the lords of the Bedchamber lest they should shut me out If they find me desirous of entering in let them shut me out if they will Then why comest thou to the door Because I think it meet and right so long as the Play lasts to take part therein In what sense art thou then shut out Because unless I am admitted it is not my will to enter on the contrary my will is simply that which comes to pass For I esteem what God wills better than what I will To Him will I cleave as His minister and attendant having the same movements the same desires in a word the same Will as He There is no such thing as being shut out for me but only for them that would force their way in CLIII But what says Socrates One man finds pleasure in improving his land another his horses My pleasure lies in seeing that I myself grow better day by day CLIV The dress is suited to the craft the craftsman takes his name from the craft not from the dress For this reason Euphrates was right in saying I long endeavoured to conceal my following the philosophic life and this profited me much In the first place I knew that what I did aright I did not for the sake of lookers on but for my own I ate aright unto myself I kept the even tenor of my walk my glance composed and serene all unto myself and unto God Then as I fought alone I was alone in peril If I did anything amiss or shameful the cause of Philosophy was not in me endangered nor did I wrong the multitude by transgressing as a professed philosopher Wherefore those that knew not my purpose marvelled how it came about that whilst all my life and conversation was passed with philosophers without exception I was yet none myself And what harm that the philosopher should be known by his acts instead of mere outward signs and symbols CLV First study to conceal what thou art seek wisdom a little while unto thyself Thus grows the fruit first the seed must be buried in the earth for a little space there it must be hid and slowly grow that it may reach maturity But if it produce the ear before the jointed stalk it is imperfect a thing from the garden of Adonis Such a sorry growth art thou thou hast blossomed too soon the winter cold will wither thee away CLVI First of all condemn the life thou art now leading but when thou hast condemned it do not despair of thyself be not like them of mean spirit who once they have yielded abandon themselves entirely and as it were allow the torrent to sweep them away No learn what the wrestling masters do Has the boy fallen Rise they say wrestle again till thy strength come to thee Even thus should it be with thee For know that there is nothing more tractable than the human soul It needs but to will and the thing is done the soul is set upon the right path as on the contrary it needs but to nod over the task and all is lost For ruin and recovery alike are from within CLVII It is the critical moment that shows the man So when the crisis is upon you remember that God like a trainer of wrestlers has matched you with a rough and stalwart antagonist To what end you ask That you may prove the victor at the Great Games Yet without toil and sweat this may not be CLVIII If thou wouldst make progress be content to seem foolish and void of understanding with respect to outward things Care not to be thought to know anything If any should make account of thee distrust thyself CLIX Remember that in life thou shouldst order thy conduct as at a banquet Has any dish that is being served reached thee Stretch forth thy hand and help thyself modestly Doth it pass thee by Seek not to detain it Has it not yet come Send not forth thy desire to meet it but wait until it reaches thee Deal thus with children thus with wife thus with office thus with wealth and one day thou wilt be meet to share the Banquets of the Gods But if thou dost not so much as touch that which is placed before thee but despisest it then shalt thou not only share the Banquets of the Gods but their Empire also CLX Remember that thou art an actor in a play and of such sort as the Author chooses whether long or short If it be his good pleasure to assign thee the part of a beggar a ruler or a simple citizen thine it is to play it fitly For thy business is to act the part assigned thee well to choose it is another s CLXI Keep death and exile daily before thine eyes with all else that men deem terrible but more especially Death Then wilt thou never think a mean though nor covet anything beyond measure CLXII As a mark is not set up in order to be missed so neither is such a thing as natural evil produced in the World CLXIII Piety toward the Gods to be sure consists chiefly in thinking rightly concerning them that they are and that they govern the Universe with goodness and justice and that thou thyself art appointed to obey them and to submit under all circumstances that arise acquiescing cheerfully in whatever may happen sure it is brought to pass and accomplished by the most Perfect Understanding Thus thou wilt never find fault with the Gods nor charge them with neglecting thee CLXIV Lose no time in setting before you a certain stamp of character and behaviour both when by yourself and in company with others Let silence be your general rule or say only what is necessary and in few words We shall however when occasion demands enter into discourse sparingly avoiding common topics as gladiators horse races athletes and the perpetual talk about food and drink Above all avoid speaking of persons either in way of praise or blame or comparison If you can win over the conversation of your company to what it should be by your own But if you find yourself cut off without escape among strangers and aliens be silent CLXV Laughter should not be much nor frequent nor unrestrained CLXVI Refuse altogether to take an oath if you can if not as far as may be CLXVII Banquets of the unlearned and of them that are without avoid But if you have occasion to take part in them let not your attention be relaxed for a moment lest you slip after all into evil ways For you may rest assured that be a man ever so pure himself he cannot escape defilement if his associates are impure CLXVIII Take what relates to the body as far as the bare use warrants as meat drink raiment house and servants But all that makes for show and luxury reject CLXIX If you are told that such an one speaks ill of you make no defence against what was said but answer He surely knew not my other faults else he would not have mentioned these only CLXX When you visit any of those in power bethink yourself that you will not find him in that you may not be admitted that the door may be shut in your face that he may not concern himself about you If with all this it is your duty to go bear what happens and never say to yourself It was not worth the trouble For that would smack of the foolish and unlearned who suffer outward things to touch them CLXXI In company avoid frequent and undue talk about your own actions and dangers However pleasant it may be to you to enlarge upon the risks you have run others may not find such pleasure in listening to your adventures Avoid provoking laughter also it is a habit from which one easily slides into the ways of the foolish and apt to diminish the respect which your neighbors feel for you To border on coarse talk is also dangerous On such occasions if a convenient opportunity offer rebuke the speaker If not at least by relapsing into silence colouring and looking annoyed show that you are displeased with the subject CLXXII When you have decided that a thing ought to be done and are doing it never shun being seen doing it even though the multitude should be likely to judge the matter amiss For if you are not acting rightly shun the act itself if rightly however why fear misplaced censure CLXXIII It stamps a man of mean capacity to spend much time on the things of the body as to be long over bodily exercises long over eating long over drinking long over other bodily functions Rather should these things take the second place while all your care is directed to the understanding CLXXIV Everything has two handles one by which it may be borne the other by which it may not If your brother sin against you lay not hold of it by the handle of injustice for by that it may not be borne but rather by this that he is your brother the comrade of your youth and thus you will lay hold on it so that it may be borne CLXXV Never call yourself a Philosopher nor talk much among the unlearned about Principles but do that which follows from them Thus at a banquet do not discuss how people ought to eat but eat as you ought Remember that Socrates thus entirely avoided ostentation Men would come to him desiring to be recommended to philosophers and he would conduct them thither himself so well did he bear being overlooked Accordingly if any talk concerning principles should arise among the unlearned be you for the most part silent For you run great risk of spewing up what you have ill digested And when a man tells you that you know nothing and you are not nettled at it then you may be sure that you have begun the work CLXXVI When you have brought yourself to supply the needs of the body at small cost do not pique yourself on that nor if you drink only water keep saying on each occasion I drink water And if you ever want to practise endurance and toil do so unto yourself and not unto others do not embrace statues CLXXVII 
1827_143625_000001_000000	train-clean-360	When a man prides himself on being able to understand and interpret the writings of Chrysippus say to yourself 
1827_143625_000002_000000	train-clean-360	If Chrysippus had not written obscurely this fellow would have had nothing to be proud of 
1827_143625_000002_000001	train-clean-360	But what is it that I desire 
1827_143625_000002_000002	train-clean-360	To understand Nature and to follow her 
1827_143625_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Accordingly I ask who is the Interpreter On hearing that it is Chrysippus I go to him 
1827_143625_000002_000004	train-clean-360	But it seems I do not understand what he wrote 
1827_143625_000002_000005	train-clean-360	So I seek one to interpret that 
1827_143625_000002_000006	train-clean-360	So far there is nothing to pride myself on 
none	none	But when I have found my interpreter what remains is to put in practice his instructions 
1827_143625_000002_000008	train-clean-360	This itself is the only thing to be proud of 
1827_143625_000002_000009	train-clean-360	But if I admire the interpretation and that alone what else have I turned out but a mere commentator instead of a lover of wisdom except indeed that I happen to be interpreting Chrysippus instead of Homer

power for ever Lo the vast orb of the Worlds round the Earth evermore as it rolleth Feels Thee its Ruler and Guide and owns Thy lordship rejoicing Aye for Thy conquering hands have a servant of living fire Sharp is the bolt where it falls Nature shrinks at the shock and doth shudder Thus Thou directest the Word universal that pulses through all things Mingling its life with Lights that are great and Lights that are lesser E en as beseemeth its birth High King through ages unending Nought is done that is done without Thee in the earth or the waters Or in the heights of heaven save the deed of the fool and the sinner Thou canst make rough things smooth at Thy voice lo jarring disorder Moveth to music and Love is born where hatred abounded Thus hast Thou fitted alike things good and things evil together That over all might reign one Reason supreme and eternal Though thereunto the hearts of the wicked be hardened and heedless Woe unto them for while ever their hands are grasping at good things Blind are their eyes yea stopped are their ears to God s Law universal Calling through wise disobedience to live the life that is noble This they mark not but heedless of right turn each to his own way Here a heart fired with ambition in strife and straining unhallowed There thrusting honour aside fast set upon getting and gaining Others again given over to lusts and dissolute softness Working never God s Law but that which wareth upon it Nay but O Giver of all things good whose home is the dark cloud Thou that wields Heaven s bolt save men from their ignorance grievous Scatter its night from their souls and grant them to come to that Wisdom Wherewithal sistered with Justice Thou rulest and governest all things That we honoured by Thee may requite Thee with worship and honour
