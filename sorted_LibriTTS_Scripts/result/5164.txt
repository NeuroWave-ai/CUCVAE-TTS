none	none	stupidly at the door which had just been banged in my face I could scarcely believe that the thing was possible I had hardly expected to figure as a tramp but supposing it conceivable that I could become a tramp that I should be refused admission to that abode of all ignominy the tramp s ward was to have attained a depth of misery of which never even in nightmares I had dreamed As I stood wondering what I should do a man slouched towards me out of the shadow of the wall Won t e let yer in He says it s full Says it s full does e That s the lay at Fulham they always says it s full They wants to keep the number down I looked at the man askance His head hung forward his hands were in his trouser pockets his clothes were rags his tone was husky Do you mean that they say it s full when it isn t that they won t let me in although there s room That s it bloke s a kiddin yer But if there s room aren t they bound to let me in Course they are and blimey if I was you I d make em Blimey I would He broke into a volley of execrations But what am I to do Why give em another rouser let em know as you won t be kidded I hesitated then acting on his suggestion for the second time I rang the bell The door was flung wide open and the grizzled pauper who had previously responded to my summons stood in the open doorway Had he been the Chairman of the Board of Guardians himself he could not have addressed me with greater scorn What here again What s your little game Think I ve nothing better to do than to wait upon the likes of you I want to be admitted Then you won t be admitted I want to see someone in authority Ain t yer seein someone in authority I want to see someone besides you I want to see the master Then you won t see the master He moved the door swiftly to but prepared for such a manoeuvre I thrust my foot sufficiently inside to prevent his shutting it I continued to address him Are you sure that the ward is full Full two hours ago But what am I to do I don t know what you re to do Which is the next nearest workhouse Kensington Suddenly opening the door as he answered me putting out his arm he thrust me backwards Before I could recover the door was closed The man in rags had continued a grim spectator of the scene Now he spoke Nice bloke ain t he He s only one of the paupers has he any right to act as one of the officials I tell yer some of them paupers is wuss than the orficers a long sight wuss They thinks they owns the ouses blimey they do Oh it s a fine world this is He paused I hesitated For some time there had been a suspicion of rain in the air Now it was commencing to fall in a fine but soaking drizzle It only needed that to fill my cup to overflowing My companion was regarding me with a sort of sullen curiosity Ain t you got no money Not a farthing Done much of this sort of thing It s the first time I ve been to a casual ward and it doesn t seem as if I m going to get in now I thought you looked as if you was a bit fresh What are yer goin to do How far is it to Kensington Work us about three mile but if I was you I d try saint George s Where s that In the Fulham Road Kensington s only a small place they do you well there and it s always full as soon as the door s opened you d ave more chawnce at saint George s He was silent I turned his words over in my mind feeling as little disposed to try the one place as the other Presently he began again I ve travelled from Reading this day I ave tramped every foot and all the way as I come along I ll ave a shakedown at Ammersmith I says and now I m as fur off from it as ever This is a fine country this is I wish every soul in it was swept into the sea blimey I do But I ain t goin to go no further I ll ave a bed in Ammersmith or I ll know the reason why How are you going to manage it have you got any money Got any money My crikey I look as though I ad I sound as though I ad too I ain t ad no brads cept now and then a brown this larst six months How are you going to get a bed then Ow am I going to why like this way He picked up two stones one in either hand The one in his left he flung at the glass which was over the door of the casual ward It crashed through it and through the lamp beyond That s ow I m goin to get a bed The door was hastily opened The grizzled pauper reappeared He shouted as he peered at us in the darkness Who done that I done it guvnor and if you like you can see me do the other It might do your eyesight good Before the grizzled pauper could interfere he had hurled the stone in his right hand through another pane I felt that it was time for me to go He was earning a night s rest at a price which even in my extremity I was not disposed to pay When I left two or three other persons had appeared upon the scene and the man in rags was addressing them with a degree of frankness which in that direction left little to be desired I slunk away unnoticed But had not gone far before I had almost decided that I might as well have thrown in my fortune with the bolder wretch and smashed a window too Indeed more than once my feet faltered as I all but returned to do the feat which I had left undone A more miserable night for an out of door excursion I could hardly have chosen The rain was like a mist and was not only drenching me to the skin but it was rendering it difficult to see more than a little distance in any direction The neighbourhood was badly lighted It was one in which I was a stranger I had come to Hammersmith as a last resource It had seemed to me that I had tried to find some occupation which would enable me to keep body and soul together in every other part of London and that now only Hammersmith was left And at Hammersmith even the workhouse would have none of me Retreating from the inhospitable portal of the casual ward I had taken the first turning to the left and at the moment had been glad to take it In the darkness and the rain the locality which I was entering appeared unfinished I seemed to be leaving civilisation behind me The path was unpaved the road rough and uneven as if it had never been properly made Houses were few and far between Those which I did encounter seemed in the imperfect light amid the general desolation to be cottages which were crumbling to decay Exactly where I was I could not tell I had a faint notion that if I only kept on long enough I should strike some part of Walham Green How long I should have to keep on I could only guess Not a creature seemed to be about of whom I could make inquiries It was as if I was in a land of desolation I suppose it was between eleven o clock and midnight I had not given up my quest for work till all the shops were closed and in Hammersmith that night at any rate they were not early closers Then I had lounged about dispiritedly wondering what was the next thing I could do It was only because I feared that if I attempted to spend the night in the open air without food when the morning came I should be broken up and fit for nothing that I sought a night s free board and lodging It was really hunger which drove me to the workhouse door That was Wednesday Since the Sunday night preceding nothing had passed my lips save water from the public fountains with the exception of a crust of bread which a man had given me whom I had found crouching at the root of a tree in Holland Park For three days I had been fasting practically all the time upon my feet It seemed to me that if I had to go hungry till the morning I should collapse there would be an end Yet in that strange and inhospitable place where was I to get food at that time of night and how I do not know how far I went Every yard I covered my feet dragged more I was dead beat inside and out I had neither strength nor courage left And within there was that frightful craving which was as though it shrieked aloud I leant against some palings dazed and giddy If only death had come upon me quickly painlessly how true a friend I should have thought it It was the agony of dying inch by inch which was so hard to bear It was some minutes before I could collect myself sufficiently to withdraw from the support of the railings and to start afresh I stumbled blindly over the uneven road Once like a drunken man I lurched forward and fell upon my knees Such was my backboneless state that for some seconds I remained where I was half disposed to let things slide accept the good the gods had sent me and make a night of it just there A long night I fancy it would have been stretching from time unto eternity Having regained my feet I had gone perhaps another couple of hundred yards along the road Heaven knows that it seemed to me just then a couple of miles when there came over me again that overpowering giddiness which I take it was born of my agony of hunger I staggered helplessly against a low wall which just there was at the side of the path Without it I should have fallen in a heap The attack appeared to last for hours I suppose it was only seconds and when I came to myself it was as though I had been aroused from a swoon of sleep aroused to an extremity of pain I exclaimed aloud For a loaf of bread what wouldn t I do I looked about me in a kind of frenzy As I did so I for the first time became conscious that behind me was a house It was not a large one It was one of those so called villas which are springing up in multitudes all round London and which are let at rentals of from twenty five to forty pounds a year It was detached So far as I could see in the imperfect light there was not another building within twenty or thirty yards of either side of it It was in two storeys There were three windows in the upper storey Behind each the blinds were closely drawn The hall door was on my right It was approached by a little wooden gate The house itself was so close to the public road that by leaning over the wall I could have touched either of the windows on the lower floor There were two of them One of them was a bow window The bow window was open The bottom centre sash was raised about six inches CHAPTER II INSIDE I realised and so to speak mentally photographed all the little details of the house in front of which I was standing with what almost amounted to a gleam of preternatural perception An instant before the world swam before my eyes I saw nothing Now I saw everything with a clearness which as it were was shocking Above all I saw the open window I stared at it conscious as I did so of a curious catching of the breath It was so near to me so very near I had but to stretch out my hand to thrust it through the aperture Once inside my hand would at least be dry How it rained out there My scanty clothing was soaked I was wet to the skin I was shivering And each second it seemed to rain still faster My teeth were chattering The damp was liquefying the very marrow in my bones And inside that open window it was it must be so warm so dry There was not a soul in sight Not a human being anywhere near I listened there was not a sound I alone was at the mercy of the sodden night Of all God s creatures the only one unsheltered from the fountains of Heaven which He had opened There was not one to see what I might do not one to care I need fear no spy Perhaps the house was empty nay probably It was my plain duty to knock at the door rouse the inmates and call attention to their oversight the open window The least they could do would be to reward me for my pains But suppose the place was empty what would be the use of knocking It would be to make a useless clatter Possibly to disturb the neighbourhood for nothing And even if the people were at home I might go unrewarded I had learned in a hard school the world s ingratitude To have caused the window to be closed the inviting window the tempting window the convenient window and then to be no better for it after all but still to be penniless hopeless hungry out in the cold and the rain better anything than that In such a situation too late I should say to myself that mine had been the conduct of a fool And I should say it justly too To be sure Leaning over the low wall I found that I could very easily put my hand inside the room How warm it was in there I could feel the difference of temperature in my fingertips Very quietly I stepped right over the wall There was just room to stand in comfort between the window and the wall The ground felt to the foot as if it were cemented Stooping down I peered through the opening I could see nothing It was black as pitch inside The blind was drawn right up it seemed incredible that anyone could be at home and have gone to bed leaving the blind up and the window open I placed my ear to the crevice How still it was Beyond doubt the place was empty I decided to push the window up another inch or two so as to enable me to reconnoitre If anyone caught me in the act then there would be an opportunity to describe the circumstances and to explain how I was just on the point of giving the alarm Only I must go carefully In such damp weather it was probable that the sash would creak Not a bit of it It moved as readily and as noiselessly as if it had been oiled This silence of the sash so emboldened me that I raised it more than I intended In fact as far as it would go Not by a sound did it betray me Bending over the sill I put my head and half my body into the room But I was no forwarder I could see nothing Not a thing For all I could tell the room might be unfurnished Indeed the likelihood of such an explanation began to occur to me I might have chanced upon an empty house In the darkness there was nothing to suggest the contrary What was I to do Well if the house was empty in such a plight as mine I might be said to have a moral if not a legal right to its bare shelter Who with a heart in his bosom would deny it me Hardly the most punctilious landlord Raising myself by means of the sill I slipped my legs into the room The moment I did so I became conscious that at any rate the room was not entirely unfurnished The floor was carpeted I have had my feet on some good carpets in my time I know what carpets are but never did I stand upon a softer one than that It reminded me somehow even then of the turf in Richmond Park it caressed my instep and sprang beneath my tread To my poor travel worn feet it was luxury after the puddly uneven road Should I now I had ascertained that the room was at least partially furnished beat a retreat Or should I push my researches further It would have been rapture to have thrown off my clothes and to have sunk down on the carpet then and there to sleep But I was so hungry so famine goaded what would I not have given to have lighted on something good to eat I moved a step or two forward gingerly reaching out with my hands lest I struck unawares against some unseen thing When I had taken three or four such steps without encountering an obstacle or indeed anything at all I began all at once to wish I had not seen the house that I had passed it by that I had not come through the window that I were safely out of it again I became on a sudden aware that something was with me in the room There was nothing ostensible to lead me to such a conviction it may be that my faculties were unnaturally keen but all at once I knew that 
2769_176256_000079_000000	train-clean-360	there was something there 
none	none	What was more I had a horrible persuasion that though unseeing I was seen that my every movement was being watched What it was that was with me I could not tell I could not even guess It was as though something in my mental organisation had been stricken by a sudden paralysis It may seem childish to use such language but I was overwrought played out physically speaking at my last counter and in an instant without the slightest warning I was conscious of a very curious sensation the like of which I had never felt before and the like of which I pray that I never may feel again a sensation of panic fear I remained rooted to the spot on which I stood not daring to move fearing to draw my breath I felt that the presence with me in the room was something strange something evil I do not know how long I stood there spell bound but certainly for some considerable space of time By degrees as nothing moved nothing was seen nothing was heard and nothing happened I made an effort to better play the man I knew that at the moment I played the cur And endeavoured to ask myself of what it was I was afraid I was shivering at my own imaginings What could be in the room to have suffered me to open the window and to enter unopposed Whatever it was was surely to the full as great a coward as I was or why permit unchecked my burglarious entry Since I had been allowed to enter the probability was that I should be at liberty to retreat and I was sensible of a much keener desire to retreat than I had ever had to enter I had to put the greatest amount of pressure upon myself before I could summon up sufficient courage to enable me to even turn my head upon my shoulders and the moment I did so I turned it back again What constrained me to save my soul I could not have said but I was constrained My heart was palpitating in my bosom I could hear it beat I was trembling so that I could scarcely stand I was overwhelmed by a fresh flood of terror I stared in front of me with eyes in which had it been light would have been seen the frenzy of unreasoning fear My ears were strained so that I listened with an acuteness of tension which was painful Something moved Slightly with so slight a sound that it would scarcely have been audible to other ears save mine But I heard I was looking in the direction from which the movement came and as I looked I saw in front of me two specks of light They had not been there a moment before that I would swear They were there now They were eyes I told myself they were eyes I had heard how cats eyes gleam in the dark though I had never seen them and I said to myself that these were cats eyes that the thing in front of me was nothing but a cat But I knew I lied I knew that these were eyes and I knew they were not cats eyes but what eyes they were I did not know nor dared to think They moved towards me The creature to which the eyes belonged was coming closer So intense was my desire to fly that I would much rather have died than stood there still yet I could not control a limb my limbs were as if they were not mine The eyes came on noiselessly At first they were between two and three feet from the ground but on a sudden there was a squelching sound as if some yielding body had been squashed upon the floor The eyes vanished to reappear a moment afterwards at what I judged to be a distance of some six inches from the floor And they again came on So it seemed that the creature whatever it was to which the eyes belonged was after all but small Why I did not obey the frantic longing which I had to flee from it I cannot tell I only know I could not I take it that the stress and privations which I had lately undergone and which I was even then still undergoing had much to do with my conduct at that moment and with the part I played in all that followed Ordinarily I believe that I have as high a spirit as the average man and as solid a resolution but when one has been dragged through the Valley of Humiliation and plunged again and again into the Waters of Bitterness and Privation a man can be constrained to a course of action of which in his happier moments he would have deemed himself incapable I know this of my own knowledge Slowly the eyes came on with a strange slowness and as they came they moved from side to side as if their owner walked unevenly Nothing could have exceeded the horror with which I awaited their approach except my incapacity to escape them Not for an instant did my glance pass from them I could not have shut my eyes for all the gold the world contains so that as they came closer I had to look right down to what seemed to be almost the level of my feet And at last they reached my feet They never paused On a sudden I felt something on my boot and with a sense of shrinking horror nausea rendering me momentarily more helpless I realised that the creature was beginning to ascend my legs to climb my body Even then what it was I could not tell it mounted me apparently with as much ease as if I had been horizontal instead of perpendicular It was as though it were some gigantic spider a spider of the nightmares a monstrous conception of some dreadful vision It pressed lightly against my clothing with what might for all the world have been spider s legs There was an amazing host of them I felt the pressure of each separate one They embraced me softly stickily as if the creature glued and unglued them each time it moved Higher and higher It had gained my loins It was moving towards the pit of my stomach The helplessness with which I suffered its invasion was not the least part of my agony it was that helplessness which we know in dreadful dreams I understood quite well that if I did but give myself a hearty shake the creature would fall off but I had not a muscle at my command As the creature mounted its eyes began to play the part of two small lamps they positively emitted rays of light By their rays I began to perceive faint outlines of its body It seemed larger than I had supposed Either the body itself was slightly phosphorescent or it was of a peculiar yellow hue It gleamed in the darkness What it was there was still nothing to positively show but the impression grew upon me that it was some member of the spider family some monstrous member of the like of which I had never heard or read It was heavy so heavy indeed that I wondered how with so slight a pressure it managed to retain its hold that it did so by the aid of some adhesive substance at the end of its legs I was sure I could feel it stick Its weight increased as it ascended and it smelt I had been for some time aware that it emitted an unpleasant foetid odour as it neared my face it became so intense as to be unbearable It was at my chest I became more and more conscious of an uncomfortable wobbling motion as if each time it breathed its body heaved Its forelegs touched the bare skin about the base of my neck they stuck to it shall I ever forget the feeling I have it often in my dreams While it hung on with those in front it seemed to draw its other legs up after it It crawled up my neck with hideous slowness a quarter of an inch at a time its weight compelling me to brace the muscles of my back It reached my chin it touched my lips and I stood still and bore it all while it enveloped my face with its huge slimy evil smelling body and embraced me with its myriad legs The horror of it made me mad I shook myself like one stricken by the shaking ague I shook the creature off It squashed upon the floor Shrieking like some lost spirit turning I dashed towards the window As I went my foot catching in some obstacle I fell headlong to the floor Picking myself up as quickly as I could I resumed my flight rain or no rain oh to get out of that room I already had my hand upon the sill in another instant I should have been over it then despite my hunger my fatigues let anyone have stopped me if they could when someone behind me struck a light CHAPTER III THE MAN IN THE BED The illumination which instantly followed was unexpected It startled me causing a moment s check from which I was just recovering when a voice said Keep still There was a quality in the voice which I cannot describe Not only an accent of command but a something malicious a something saturnine It was a little guttural though whether it was a man speaking I could not have positively said but I had no doubt it was a foreigner It was the most disagreeable voice I had ever heard and it had on me the most disagreeable effect for when it said Keep still I kept still It was as though there was nothing else for me to do Turn round I turned round mechanically like an automaton Such passivity was worse than undignified it was galling I knew that well I resented it with secret rage But in that room in that presence I was invertebrate When I turned I found myself confronting someone who was lying in bed At the head of the bed was a shelf On the shelf was a small lamp which gave the most brilliant light I had ever seen It caught me full in the eyes having on me such a blinding effect that for some seconds I could see nothing Throughout the whole of that strange interview I cannot affirm that I saw clearly the dazzling glare caused dancing specks to obscure my vision Yet after an interval of time I did see something and what I did see I had rather have left unseen I saw someone in front of me lying in a bed I could not at once decide if it was a man or a woman Indeed at first I doubted if it was anything human But afterwards I knew it to be a man for this reason if for no other that it was impossible such a creature could be feminine The bedclothes were drawn up to his shoulders only his head was visible He lay on his left side his head resting on his left hand motionless eyeing me as if he sought to read my inmost soul And in very truth I believe he read it His age I could not guess such a look of age I had never imagined Had he asserted that he had been living through the ages I should have been forced to admit that at least he looked it And yet I felt that it was quite within the range of possibility that he was no older than myself there was a vitality in his eyes which was startling It might have been that he had been afflicted by some terrible disease and it was that which had made him so supernaturally ugly There was not a hair upon his face or head but to make up for it the skin which was a saffron yellow was an amazing mass of wrinkles The cranium and indeed the whole skull was so small as to be disagreeably suggestive of something animal The nose on the other hand was abnormally large so extravagant were its dimensions and so peculiar its shape it resembled the beak of some bird of prey A characteristic of the face and an uncomfortable one was that practically it stopped short at the mouth The mouth with its blubber lips came immediately underneath the nose and chin to all intents and purposes there was none This deformity for the absence of chin amounted to that it was which gave to the face the appearance of something not human that and the eyes For so marked a feature of the man were his eyes that ere long it seemed to me that he was nothing but eyes His eyes ran literally across the whole of the upper portion of his face remember the face was unwontedly small and the columna of the nose was razor edged They were long and they looked out of narrow windows and they seemed to be lighted by some internal radiance for they shone out like lamps in a lighthouse tower Escape them I could not while as I endeavoured to meet them it was as if I shrivelled into nothingness Never before had I realised what was meant by the power of the eye They held me enchained helpless spell bound I felt that they could do with me as they would and they did Their gaze was unfaltering having the bird like trick of never blinking this man could have glared at me for hours and never moved an eyelid It was he who broke the silence I was speechless Shut the window I did as he bade me Pull down the blind I obeyed Turn round again I was still obedient What is your name Then I spoke to answer him There was this odd thing about the words I uttered that they came from me not in response to my will power but in response to his It was not I who willed that I should speak it was he What he willed that I should say I said Just that and nothing more For the time I was no longer a man my manhood was merged in his I was in the extremest sense an example of passive obedience Robert Holt What are you A clerk You look as if you were a clerk There was a flame of scorn in his voice which scorched me even then What sort of a clerk are you I am out of a situation You look as if you were out of a situation Again the scorn Are you the sort of clerk who is always out of a situation You are a thief I am not a thief Do clerks come through the window I was still he putting no constraint on me to speak Why did you come through the window Because it was open So Do you always come through a window which is open No Then why through this Because I was wet and cold and hungry and tired The words came from me as if he had dragged them one by one which in fact he did Have you no home No Money No Friends No Then what sort of a clerk are you I did not answer him I did not know what it was he wished me to say I was the victim of bad luck nothing else I swear it Misfortune had followed hard upon misfortune The firm by whom I had been employed for years suspended payment I obtained a situation with one of their creditors at a lower salary They reduced their staff which entailed my going After an interval I obtained a temporary engagement the occasion which required my services passed and I with it After another and a longer interval I again found temporary employment the pay for which was but a pittance When that was over I could find nothing That was nine months ago and since then I had not earned a penny It is so easy to grow shabby when you are on the everlasting tramp and are living on your stock of clothes I had trudged all over London in search of work work of any kind would have been welcome so long as it would have enabled me to keep body and soul together And I had trudged in vain Now I had been refused admittance as a casual how easy is the descent But I did not tell the man lying on the bed all this He did not wish to hear had he wished he would have made me tell him It may be that he read my story unspoken though it was it is conceivable His eyes had powers of penetration which were peculiarly their own that I know Undress When he spoke again that was what he said in those guttural tones of his in which there was a reminiscence of some foreign land I obeyed letting my sodden shabby clothes fall anyhow upon the floor A look came on his face as I stood naked in front of him which if it was meant for a smile was a satyr s smile and which filled me with a sensation of shuddering repulsion What a white skin you have how white What would I not give for a skin as white as that ah yes He paused devouring me with his glances then continued Go to the cupboard you will find a cloak put it on I went to a cupboard which was in a corner of the room his eyes following me as I moved It was full of clothing garments which might have formed the stock in trade of a costumier whose speciality was providing costumes for masquerades A long dark cloak hung on a peg My hand moved towards it apparently of its own volition I put it on its ample folds falling to my feet In the other cupboard you will find meat and bread and wine Eat and drink On the opposite side of the room near the head of his bed there was a second cupboard In this upon a shelf I found what looked like pressed beef several round cakes of what tasted like rye bread and some thin sour wine in a straw covered flask But I was in no mood to criticise I crammed myself I believe like some famished wolf he watching me in silence all the time When I had done which was when I had eaten and drunk as much as I could hold there returned to his face that satyr s grin I would that I could eat and drink like that ah yes Put back what is left I put it back which seemed an unnecessary exertion there was so little to put Look me in the face I looked him in the face and immediately became conscious as I did so that something was going from me the capacity as it were to be myself His eyes grew larger and larger till they seemed to fill all space till I became lost in their immensity He moved his hand doing something to me I know not what as it passed through the air cutting the solid ground from underneath my feet so that I fell headlong to the ground Where I fell there I lay like a log And the light went out CHAPTER IV A LONELY VIGIL I knew that the light went out For not the least singular nor indeed the least distressing part of my condition was the fact that to the best of my knowledge and belief I never once lost consciousness during the long hours which followed I was aware of the extinction of the lamp and of the black darkness which ensued I heard a rustling sound as if the man in the bed was settling himself between the sheets Then all was still And throughout that interminable night I remained my brain awake my body dead waiting watching for the day What had happened to me I could not guess That I probably wore some of the external evidences of death my instinct told me I knew I did Paradoxical though it may sound I felt as a man might feel who had actually died as in moments of speculation in the days gone by I had imagined it as quite possible that he would feel It is very far from certain that feeling necessarily expires with what we call life I continually asked myself if I could be dead the inquiry pressed itself on me with awful iteration Does the body die and the brain the I the ego still live on God only knows But then the agony of the thought The hours passed By slow degrees the silence was eclipsed Sounds of traffic of hurrying footsteps life were ushers of the morn Outside the window sparrows twittered a cat mewed a dog barked there was the clatter of a milk can Shafts of light stole past the blind increasing in intensity It still rained now and again it pattered against the pane The wind must have shifted because for the first time there came on a sudden the clang of a distant clock striking the hour seven Then with the interval of a lifetime between each chiming eight nine ten So far in the room itself there had not been a sound When the clock had struck ten as it seemed to me years ago there came a rustling noise from the direction of the bed Feet stepped upon the floor moving towards where I was lying It was of course now broad day and I presently perceived that a figure clad in some queer coloured garment was standing at my side looking down at me It stooped then knelt My only covering was unceremoniously thrown from off me so that I lay there in my nakedness Fingers prodded me then and there as if I had been some beast ready for the butcher s stall A face looked into mine and in front of me were those dreadful eyes Then whether I was dead or living I said to myself that this could be nothing human nothing fashioned in God s image could wear such a shape as that Fingers were pressed into my cheeks they were thrust into my mouth they touched my staring eyes shut my eyelids then opened them again and horror of horrors the blubber lips were pressed to mine the soul of something evil entered into me in the guise of a kiss Then this travesty of manhood reascended to his feet and said whether speaking to me or to himself I could not tell Dead dead as good as dead and better We ll have him buried He moved away from me I heard a door open and shut and knew that he was gone And he continued gone throughout the day I had no actual knowledge of his issuing out into the street but he must have done so because the house appeared deserted What had become of the dreadful creature of the night before I could not guess My first fear was that he had left it behind him in the room with me it might be as a sort of watchdog But as the minutes and the hours passed and there was still no sign or sound of anything living I concluded that if the thing was there it was possibly as helpless as myself and that during its owner s absence at any rate I had nothing to fear from its too pressing attentions That with the exception of myself the house held nothing human I had strong presumptive proof more than once in the course of the day Several times both in the morning and the afternoon people without endeavoured to attract the attention of whoever was within Vehicles probably tradesmen s carts drew up in front their stopping being followed by more or less assiduous assaults upon the knocker and the bell But in every case their appeals remained unheeded Whatever it was they wanted they had to go unsatisfied away Lying there torpid with nothing to do but listen I was possibly struck by very little but it did occur to me that one among the callers was more persistent than the rest The distant clock had just struck noon when I heard the gate open and someone approached the front door Since nothing but silence followed I supposed that the occupant of the place had returned and had chosen to do so as silently as he had gone Presently however there came from the doorstep a slight but peculiar call as if a rat was squeaking It was repeated three times and then there was the sound of footsteps quietly retreating and the gate re closing Between one and two the caller came again there was a repetition of the same signal that it was a signal I did not doubt followed by the same retreat About three the mysterious visitant returned The signal was repeated and when there was no response fingers tapped softly against the panels of the front door When there was still no answer footsteps stole softly round the side of the house and there came the signal from the rear and then again tapping of fingers against what was apparently the back door No notice being taken of these various proceedings the footsteps returned the way they went and as before the gate was closed Shortly after darkness had fallen this assiduous caller returned to make a fourth and more resolute attempt to call attention to his presence From the peculiar character of his manoeuvres it seemed that he suspected that whoever was within had particular reasons for ignoring him without He went through the familiar pantomime of the three squeaky calls both at the front door and the back followed by the tapping of the fingers on the panels This time however he also tried the window panes I could hear quite distinctly the clear yet distinct noise of what seemed like knuckles rapping against the windows behind Disappointed there he renewed his efforts at the front The curiously quiet footsteps came round the house to pause before the window of the room in which I lay and then something singular occurred While I waited for the tapping there came instead the sound of someone or something scrambling on to the window sill as if some creature unable to reach the window from the ground was endeavouring to gain the vantage of the sill Some ungainly creature unskilled in surmounting such an obstacle as a perpendicular brick wall There was the noise of what seemed to be the scratching of claws as if it experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining a hold on the unyielding surface What kind of creature it was I could not think I was astonished to find that it was a creature at all I had taken it for granted that the persevering visitor was either a woman or a man If however as now seemed likely it was some sort of animal the fact explained the squeaking sounds though what except a rat did squeak like that was more than I could say and the absence of any knocking or ringing Whatever it was it had gained the summit of its desires the window sill It panted as if its efforts at climbing had made it short of breath Then began the tapping In the light of my new discovery I perceived clearly enough that the tapping was hardly that which was likely to be the product of human fingers it was sharp and definite rather resembling the striking of the point of a nail against the glass It was not loud but in time it continued with much persistency it became plainly vicious It was accompanied by what I can only describe as the most extraordinary noises There were squeaks growing angrier and shriller as the minutes passed what seemed like gaspings for breath and a peculiar buzzing sound like yet unlike the purring of a cat The creature s resentment at its want of success in attracting attention was unmistakable The tapping became like the clattering of hailstones it kept up a continuous noise with its cries and pantings there was the sound as of some large body being rubbed against the glass as if it were extending itself against the window and endeavouring by force of pressure to gain an entrance through the pane So violent did its contortions become that I momentarily anticipated the yielding of the glass and the excited assailant coming crashing through Considerably to my relief the window proved more impregnable than seemed at one time likely The stolid resistance proved in the end to be too much either for its endurance or its patience Just as I was looking for some fresh manifestation of fury it seemed rather to tumble than to spring off the sill then came once more the same sound of quietly retreating footsteps and what under the circumstances seemed odder still the same closing of the gate During the two or three hours which immediately ensued nothing happened at all out of the way and then took place the most surprising incident of all The clock had struck ten some time before Since before the striking of the hour nothing and no one had passed along what was evidently the little frequented road in front of that uncanny house On a sudden two sounds broke the stillness without of someone running and of cries Judging from his hurrying steps someone seemed to be flying for his life to the accompaniment of curious cries It was only when the runner reached the front of the house that in the cries I recognised the squeaks of the persistent caller I imagined that he had returned as before alone to renew his attacks upon the window until it was made plain as it quickly was that with him was some sort of a companion Immediately there arose from without the noise of battle Two creatures whose cries were to me of so unusual a character that I found it impossible to even guess at their identity seemed to be waging war to the knife upon the doorstep After a minute or two of furious contention victory seemed to rest with one of the combatants for the other fled squeaking as with pain While I listened with strained attention for the next episode in this queer drama expecting that now would come another assault upon the window to my unbounded surprise I heard a key thrust in the keyhole the lock turned and the front door thrown open with a furious bang It was closed as loudly as it was opened Then the door of the room in which I was was dashed open with the same display of excitement and of clamour footsteps came hurrying in the door was slammed to with a force which shook the house to its foundations there was a rustling as of bed clothes the brilliant illumination of the night before and a voice which I had only too good reason to remember said Stand up I stood up automatically at the word of command facing towards the bed There between the sheets with his head resting on his hand in the attitude in which I had seen him last was the being I had made acquaintance with under circumstances which I was never likely to forget the same yet not the same CHAPTER V AN INSTRUCTION TO COMMIT BURGLARY That the man in the bed was the one whom to my cost I had suffered myself to stumble on the night before there could of course not be the faintest doubt And yet directly I saw him I recognised that some astonishing alteration had taken place in his appearance To begin with he seemed younger the decrepitude of age had given place to something very like the fire of youth His features had undergone some subtle change His nose for instance was not by any means so grotesque its beak like quality was less conspicuous The most part of his wrinkles had disappeared as if by magic And though his skin was still as yellow as saffron his contours had rounded he had even come into possession of a modest allowance of chin But the most astounding novelty was that about the face there was something which was essentially feminine so feminine indeed that I wondered if I could by any possibility have blundered and mistaken a woman for a man some ghoulish example of her sex who had so yielded to her depraved instincts as to have become nothing but a ghastly reminiscence of womanhood The effect of the changes which had come about in his appearance for after all I told myself that it was impossible that I could have been such a simpleton as to have been mistaken on such a question as gender was heightened by the self evident fact that very recently he had been engaged in some pitched battle some hand to hand and probably discreditable encounter from which he had borne away uncomfortable proofs of his opponent s prowess His antagonist could hardly have been a chivalrous fighter for his countenance was marked by a dozen different scratches which seemed to suggest that the weapons used had been someone s finger nails It was perhaps because the heat of the battle was still in his veins that he was in such a state of excitement He seemed to be almost overwhelmed by the strength of his own feelings His eyes seemed literally to flame with fire The muscles of his face were working as if they were wholly beyond his own control When he spoke his accent was markedly foreign the words rushed from his lips in an inarticulate torrent he kept repeating the same thing over and over again in a fashion which was not a little suggestive of insanity So you re not dead you re not dead you re alive you re alive Well how does it feel to be dead I ask you Is it not good to be dead To keep dead is better it is the best of all To have made an end of all things to cease to strive and to cease to weep to cease to want and to cease to have to cease to annoy and to cease to long to no more care no not for anything to put from you the curse of life forever is that not the best Oh yes I tell you do I not know But for you such knowledge is not yet For you there is the return to life the coming out of death you shall live on for me Live on He made a movement with his hand and directly he did so it happened as on the previous evening that a metamorphosis took place in the very abysses of my being I woke from my torpor as he put it I came out of death and was alive again I was far yet from being my own man I realised that he exercised on me a degree of mesmeric force which I had never dreamed that one creature could exercise on another but at least I was no longer in doubt as to whether I was or was not dead I knew I was alive He lay watching me as if he was reading the thoughts which occupied my brain and for all I know he was Robert Holt you are a thief I am not My own voice as I heard it startled me it was so long since it had sounded in my ears You are a thief Only thieves come through windows did you not come through the window I was still what would my contradiction have availed me But it is well that you came through the window well you are a thief well for me for me It is you that I am wanting at the happy moment you have dropped yourself into my hands in the nick of time For you are my slave at my beck and call my familiar spirit to do with as I will you know this eh I did know it and the knowledge of my impotence was terrible I felt that if I could only get away from him only release myself from the bonds with which he had bound me about only remove myself from the horrible glamour of his near neighbourhood only get one or two square meals and have an opportunity of recovering from the enervating stress of mental and bodily fatigue I felt that then I might be something like his match and that a second time he would endeavour in vain to bring me within the compass of his magic But as it was I was conscious that I was helpless and the consciousness was agony He persisted in reiterating his former falsehood I say you are a thief a thief Robert Holt a thief You came through a window for your own pleasure now you will go through a window for mine not this window but another Where the jest lay I did not perceive but it tickled him for a grating sound came from his throat which was meant for laughter This time it is as a thief that you will go oh yes be sure He paused as it seemed to transfix me with his gaze His unblinking eyes never for an instant quitted my face With what a frightful fascination they constrained me and how I loathed them When he spoke again there was a new intonation in his speech something bitter cruel unrelenting Do you know Paul Lessingham He pronounced the name as if he hated it and yet as if he loved to have it on his tongue What Paul Lessingham There is only one Paul Lessingham THE Paul Lessingham the GREAT Paul Lessingham He shrieked rather than said this with an outburst of rage so frenzied that I thought for the moment that he was going to spring on me and rend me I shook all over I do not doubt that as I replied my voice was sufficiently tremulous All the world knows Paul Lessingham the politician the statesman As he glared at me his eyes dilated I still stood in expectation of a physical assault But for the present he contented himself with words To night you are going through his window like a thief I had no inkling of his meaning and apparently judging from his next words I looked something of the bewilderment I felt You do not understand no it is simple what could be simpler I say that to night to night you are going through his window like a thief You came through my window why not through the window of Paul Lessingham the politician the statesman He repeated my words as if in mockery I am I make it my boast of that great multitude which regards Paul Lessingham as the greatest living force in practical politics and which looks to him with confidence to carry through that great work of constitutional and social reform which he has set himself to do I daresay that my tone in speaking of him savoured of laudation which plainly the man in the bed resented What he meant by his wild words about my going through Paul Lessingham s window like a thief I still had not the faintest notion They sounded like the ravings of a madman As I continued silent and he yet stared there came into his tone another note a note of tenderness a note of which I had not deemed him capable He is good to look at Paul Lessingham is he not good to look at I was aware that physically mister Lessingham was a fine specimen of manhood but I was not prepared for the assertion of the fact in such a quarter nor for the manner in which the temporary master of my fate continued to harp and enlarge upon the theme He is straight straight as the mast of a ship he is tall his skin is white he is strong do I not know that he is strong how strong oh yes Is there a better thing than to be his wife his well beloved the light of his eyes Is there for a woman a happier chance Oh no not one His wife Paul Lessingham As with soft cadences he gave vent to these unlooked for sentiments the fashion of his countenance was changed A look of longing came into his face of savage frantic longing which unalluring though it was for the moment transfigured him But the mood was transient To be his wife oh yes the wife of his scorn the despised and rejected The return to the venom of his former bitterness was rapid I could not but feel that this was the natural man Though why a creature such as he was should go out of his way to apostrophise in such a manner a publicist of mister Lessingham s eminence surpassed my comprehension Yet he stuck to his subject like a leech as if it had been one in which he had an engrossing personal interest He is a devil hard as the granite rock cold as the snows of Ararat In him there is none of life s warm blood he is accursed He is false ay false as the fables of those who lie for love of lies he is all treachery Her whom he has taken to his bosom he would put away from him as if she had never been he would steal from her like a thief in the night he would forget she ever was But the avenger follows after lurking in the shadows hiding among the rocks waiting watching till his time shall come And it shall come the day of the avenger ay the day Raising himself to a sitting posture he threw his arms above his head and shrieked with a demoniac fury Presently he became a trifle calmer Reverting to his recumbent position resting his head upon his hand he eyed me steadily then asked me a question which struck me as being under the circumstances more than a little singular You know his house the house of the great Paul Lessingham the politician the statesman I do not You lie you do The words came from him with a sort of snarl as if he would have lashed me across the face with them I do not Men in my position are not acquainted with the residences of men in his I may at some time have seen his address in print but if so I have forgotten it He looked at me intently for some moments as if to learn if I spoke the truth and apparently at last was satisfied that I did You do not know it Well I will show it you I will show the house of the great Paul Lessingham What he meant I did not know but I was soon to learn an astounding revelation it proved to be There was about his manner something hardly human something which for want of a better phrase I would call vulpine In his tone there was a mixture of mockery and bitterness as if he wished his words to have the effect of corrosive sublimate and to sear me as he uttered them Listen with all your ears Give me your whole attention Hearken to my bidding so that you may do as I bid you Not that I fear your obedience oh no He paused as if to enable me to fully realise the picture of my helplessness conjured up by his jibes You came through my window like a thief You will go through my window like a fool You will go to the house of the great Paul Lessingham You say you do not know it Well I will show it you I will be your guide Unseen in the darkness and the night I will stalk beside you and will lead you to where I would have you go You will go just as you are with bare feet and head uncovered and with but a single garment to hide your nakedness You will be cold your feet will be cut and bleeding but what better does a thief deserve If any see you at the least they will take you for a madman there will be trouble But have no fear bear a bold heart None shall see you while I stalk at your side I will cover you with the cloak of invisibility so that you may come in safety to the house of the great Paul Lessingham He paused again What he said wild and wanton though it was was beginning to fill me with a sense of the most extreme discomfort His sentences in some strange indescribable way seemed as they came from his lips to warp my limbs to enwrap themselves about me to confine me tighter and tighter within as it were swaddling clothes to make me more and more helpless I was already conscious that whatever mad freak he chose to set me on I should have no option but to carry it through When you come to the house you will stand and look and seek for a window convenient for entry It may be that you will find one open as you did mine if not you will open one How that is your affair not mine You will practise the arts of a thief to steal into his house The monstrosity of his suggestion fought against the spell which he again was casting upon me and forced me into speech endowed me with the power to show that there still was in me something of a man though every second the strands of my manhood as it seemed were slipping faster through the fingers which were strained to clutch them I will not He was silent He looked at me The pupils of his eyes dilated until they seemed all pupil You will Do you hear I say you will I am not a thief I am an honest man why should I do this thing Because I bid you Have mercy On whom on you or on Paul Lessingham Who at any time has shown mercy unto me that I should show mercy unto any He stopped and then again went on reiterating his former incredible suggestion with an emphasis which seemed to eat its way into my brain You will practise the arts of a thief to steal into his house and being in will listen If all be still you will make your way to the room he calls his study How shall I find it I know nothing of his house The question was wrung from me I felt that the sweat was standing in great drops upon my brow I will show it you Shall you go with me Ay I shall go with you All the time I shall be with you You will not see me but I shall be there Be not afraid His claim to supernatural powers for what he said amounted to nothing less was on the face of it preposterous but then I was in no condition to even hint at its absurdity He continued When you have gained the study you will go to a certain drawer which is in a certain bureau in a corner of the room I see it now when you are there you shall see it too and you will open it Should it be locked You still will open it But how shall I open it if it is locked By those arts in which a thief is skilled I say to you again that that is your affair not mine I made no attempt to answer him Even supposing that he forced me by the wicked and unconscionable exercise of what I presumed were the hypnotic powers with which nature had to such a dangerous degree endowed him to carry the adventure to a certain stage since he could hardly at an instant s notice endow me with the knack of picking locks should the drawer he alluded to be locked which might Providence permit nothing serious might issue from it after all He read my thoughts You will open it though it be doubly and trebly locked I say that you will open it In it you will find he hesitated as if to reflect some letters it may be two or three I know not just how many they are bound about by a silken ribbon You will take them out of the drawer and having taken them you will make the best of your way out of the house and bear them back to me And should anyone come upon me while engaged in these nefarious proceedings for instance should I encounter mister Lessingham himself what then Paul Lessingham You need have no fear if you encounter him I need have no fear If he finds me in his own house at dead of night committing burglary You need have no fear of him On your account or on my own At least he will have me haled to gaol I say you need have no fear of him I say what I mean How then shall I escape his righteous vengeance He is not the man to suffer a midnight robber to escape him scatheless shall I have to kill him You will not touch him with a finger nor will he touch you By what spell shall I prevent him By the spell of two words What words are they Should Paul Lessingham chance to come upon you and find you in his house a thief and should seek to stay you from whatever it is you may be at you will not flinch nor flee from him but you will stand still and you will say Something in the crescendo accents of his voice something weird and ominous caused my heart to press against my ribs so that when he stopped in my eagerness I cried out What THE BEETLE As the words came from him in a kind of screech the lamp went out and the place was all in darkness and I knew so that the knowledge filled me with a sense of loathing that with me in the room was the evil presence of the night before Two bright specks gleamed in front of me something flopped from off the bed on to the ground the thing was coming towards me across the floor It came slowly on and on and on I stood still speechless in the sickness of my horror Until on my bare feet it touched me with slimy feelers and my terror lest it should creep up my naked body lent me voice and I fell shrieking like a soul in agony It may be that my shrieking drove it from me At least it went I knew it went And all was still Until on a sudden the lamp flamed out again and there lying as before in bed glaring at me with his baleful eyes was the being whom in my folly or in my wisdom whichever it was I was beginning to credit with the possession of unhallowed unlawful powers You will say that to him those two words they only no more And you will see what you will see But Paul Lessingham is a man of resolution Should he still persist in interference or seek to hinder you you will say those two words again You need do no more Twice will suffice I promise you Now go Draw up the blind open the window climb through it Hasten to do what I have bidden you I wait here for your return and all the way I shall be with you CHAPTER VI A SINGULAR FELONY I went to the window I drew up the blind unlatching the sash I threw it open and clad or rather unclad as I was I clambered through it into the open air I was not only incapable of resistance I was incapable of distinctly formulating the desire to offer resistance Some compelling influence moved me hither and hither with completest disregard of whether I would or would not And yet when I found myself without I was conscious of a sense of exultation at having escaped from the miasmic atmosphere of that room of unholy memories And a faint hope began to dawn within my bosom that as I increased the distance between myself and it I might shake off something of the nightmare helplessness which numbed and tortured me I lingered for a moment by the window then stepped over the short dividing wall into the street and then again I lingered My condition was one of dual personality while physically I was bound mentally to a considerable extent I was free But this measure of freedom on my mental side made my plight no better For among other things I realised what a ridiculous figure I must be cutting barefooted and bareheaded abroad at such an hour of the night in such a boisterous breeze for I quickly discovered that the wind amounted to something like a gale Apart from all other considerations the notion of parading the streets in such a condition filled me with profound disgust And I do believe that if my tyrannical oppressor had only permitted me to attire myself in my own garments I should have started with a comparatively light heart on the felonious mission on which he apparently was sending me I believe too that the consciousness of the incongruity of my attire increased my sense of helplessness and that had I been dressed as Englishmen are wont to be who take their walks abroad he would not have found in me on that occasion the facile instrument which in fact he did There was a moment in which the gravelled pathway first made itself known to my naked feet and the cutting wind to my naked flesh when I think it possible that had I gritted my teeth and strained my every nerve I might have shaken myself free from the bonds which shackled me and bade defiance to the ancient sinner who for all I knew was peeping at me through the window But so depressed was I by the knowledge of the ridiculous appearance I presented that before I could take advantage of it the moment passed not to return again that night I did catch as it were at its fringe as it was flying past me making a hurried movement to one side the first I had made of my own initiative for hours But it was too late My tormentor as if though unseen he saw tightened his grip I was whirled round and sped hastily onwards in a direction in which I certainly had no desire of travelling All the way I never met a soul I have since wondered whether in that respect my experience was not a normal one whether it might not have happened to any If so there are streets in London long lines of streets which at a certain period of the night in a certain sort of weather probably the weather had something to do with it are clean deserted in which there is neither foot passenger nor vehicle not even a policeman The greater part of the route along which I was driven I know no juster word was one with which I had some sort of acquaintance It led at first through what I take it was some part of Walham Green then along the Lillie Road through Brompton across the Fulham Road through the network of streets leading to Sloane Street across Sloane Street into Lowndes Square Who goes that way goes some distance and goes through some important thorough fares yet not a creature did I see nor I imagine was there a creature who saw me As I crossed Sloane Street I fancied that I heard the distant rumbling of a vehicle along the Knightsbridge Road but that was the only sound I heard It is painful even to recollect the plight in which I was when I was stopped for stopped I was as shortly and as sharply as the beast of burden with a bridle in its mouth whose driver puts a period to his career I was wet intermittent gusts of rain were borne on the scurrying wind in spite of the pace at which I had been brought I was chilled to the bone and worst of all my mud stained feet all cut and bleeding were so painful for unfortunately I was still susceptible enough to pain that it was agony to have them come into contact with the cold and the slime of the hard unyielding pavement I had been stopped on the opposite side of the square that nearest to the hospital in front of a house which struck me as being somewhat smaller than the rest It was a house with a portico about the pillars of this portico was trelliswork and on the trelliswork was trained some climbing plant As I stood shivering wondering what would happen next some strange impulse mastered me and immediately to my own unbounded amazement I found myself scrambling up the trellis towards the verandah above I am no gymnast either by nature or by education I doubt whether previously I had ever attempted to climb anything more difficult than a step ladder The result was that though the impulse might be given me the skill could not and I had only ascended a yard or so when losing my footing I came slithering down upon my back Bruised and shaken though I was I was not allowed to inquire into my injuries In a moment I was on my feet again and again I was impelled to climb only however again to come to grief This time the demon or whatever it was that had entered into me seeming to appreciate the impossibility of getting me to the top of that verandah directed me to try another way I mounted the steps leading to the front door got on to the low parapet which was at one side thence on to the sill of the adjacent window had I slipped then I should have fallen a sheer descent of at least twenty feet to the bottom of the deep area down below But the sill was broad and if it is proper to use such language in connection with a transaction of the sort in which I was engaged fortune favoured me I did not fall In my clenched fist I had a stone With this I struck the pane of glass as with a hammer Through the hole which resulted I could just insert my hand and reach the latch within In another minute the sash was raised and I was in the house I had committed burglary As I look back and reflect upon the audacity of the whole proceeding even now I tremble Hapless slave of another s will although in very truth I was I cannot repeat too often that I realised to the full just what it was that I was being compelled to do a fact which was very far from rendering my situation less distressful and every detail of my involuntary actions was projected upon my brain in a series of pictures whose clear cut outlines so long as memory endures will never fade Certainly no professional burglar nor indeed any creature in his senses would have ventured to emulate my surprising rashness The process of smashing the pane of glass it was plate glass was anything but a noiseless one There was first the blow itself then the shivering of the glass then the clattering of fragments into the area beneath One would have thought that the whole thing would have made din enough to have roused the Seven Sleepers But here again the weather was on my side About that time the wind was howling wildly it came shrieking across the square It is possible that the tumult which it made deadened all other sounds Anyhow as I stood within the room which I had violated listening for signs of someone being on the alert I could hear nothing Within the house there seemed to be the silence of the grave I drew down the window and made for the door It proved by no means easy to find The windows were obscured by heavy curtains so that the room inside was dark as pitch It appeared to be unusually full of furniture an appearance due perhaps to my being a stranger in the midst of such Cimmerian blackness I had to feel my way very gingerly indeed among the various impedimenta As it was I seemed to come into contact with most of the obstacles there were to come into contact with stumbling more than once over footstools and over what seemed to be dwarf chairs It was a miracle that my movements still continued to be unheard but I believe that the explanation was that the house was well built that the servants were the only persons in it at the time that their bedrooms were on the top floor that they were fast asleep and that they were little likely to be disturbed by anything that might occur in the room which I had entered Reaching the door at last I opened it listening for any promise of being interrupted and to adapt a hackneyed phrase directed by the power which shaped my end I went across the hall and up the stairs I passed up the first landing and on the second moved to a door upon the right I turned the handle it yielded the door opened I entered closing it behind me I went to the wall just inside the door found a handle jerked it and switched on the electric light doing I make no doubt all these things from a spectator s point of view so naturally that a judge and jury would have been with difficulty persuaded that they were not the product of my own volition In the brilliant glow of the electric light I took a leisurely survey of the contents of the room It was as the man in the bed had said it would be a study a fine spacious apartment evidently intended rather for work than for show There were three separate writing tables one very large and two smaller ones all covered with an orderly array of manuscripts and papers A typewriter stood at the side of one On the floor under and about them were piles of books portfolios and official looking documents Every available foot of wall space on three sides of the room was lined with shelves full as they could hold with books On the fourth side facing the door was a large lock up oak bookcase and in the farther corner a quaint old bureau So soon as I saw this bureau I went for it straight as an arrow from a bow indeed it would be no abuse of metaphor to say that I was propelled towards it like an arrow from a bow It had drawers below glass doors above and between the drawers and the doors was a flap to let down It was to this flap my attention was directed I put out my hand to open it it was locked at the top I pulled at it with both hands it refused to budge So this was the lock I was if necessary to practise the arts of a thief to open I was no picklock I had flattered myself that nothing and no one could make me such a thing Yet now that I found myself confronted by that unyielding flap I found that pressure irresistible pressure was being put upon me to gain by any and every means access to its interior I had no option but to yield I looked about me in search of some convenient tool with which to ply the felon s trade I found it close beside me Leaning against the wall within a yard of where I stood were examples of various kinds of weapons among them spear heads Taking one of these spear heads with much difficulty I forced the point between the flap and the bureau Using the leverage thus obtained I attempted to prise it open The flap held fast the spear head snapped in two I tried another with the same result a third to fail again There were no more The most convenient thing remaining was a queer heavy headed sharp edged hatchet This I took brought the sharp edge down with all my force upon the refractory flap The hatchet went through before I had done with it it was open with a vengeance But I was destined on the occasion of my first and I trust last experience of the burglar s calling to carry the part completely through I had gained access to the flap itself only to find that at the back were several small drawers on one of which my observation was brought to bear in a fashion which it was quite impossible to disregard As a matter of course it was locked and once more I had to search for something which would serve as a rough and ready substitute for the missing key There was nothing at all suitable among the weapons I could hardly for such a purpose use the hatchet the drawer in question was such a little one that to have done so would have been to shiver it to splinters On the mantelshelf in an open leather case were a pair of revolvers Statesmen nowadays sometimes stand in actual peril of their lives It is possible that mister Lessingham conscious of continually threatened danger carried them about with him as a necessary protection They were serviceable weapons large and somewhat weighty of the type with which I believe upon occasion the police are armed Not only were all the barrels loaded but in the case itself there was a supply of cartridges more than sufficient to charge them all again I was handling the weapons wondering if in my condition the word was applicable what use I could make of them to enable me to gain admission to that drawer when there came on a sudden from the street without the sound of approaching wheels There was a whirring within my brain as if someone was endeavouring to explain to me to what service to apply the revolvers and I perforce strained every nerve to grasp the meaning of my invisible mentor While I did so the wheels drew rapidly nearer and just as I was expecting them to go whirling by stopped in front of the house My heart leapt in my bosom In a convulsion of frantic terror again during the passage of one frenzied moment I all but burst the bonds that held me and fled haphazard from the imminent peril But the bonds were stronger than I it was as if I had been rooted to the ground A key was inserted in the keyhole of the front door the lock was turned the door thrown open firm footsteps entered the house If I could I would not have stood upon the order of my going but gone at once anywhere anyhow but at that moment my comings and goings were not matters in which I was consulted Panic fear raging within outwardly I was calm as possible and stood turning the revolvers over and over asking myself what it could be that I was intended to do with them All at once it came to me in an illuminating flash I was to fire at the lock of the drawer and blow it open A madder scheme it would have been impossible to hit upon The servants had slept through a good deal but they would hardly sleep through the discharge of a revolver in a room below them not to speak of the person who had just entered the premises and whose footsteps were already audible as he came up the stairs I struggled to make a dumb protest against the insensate folly which was hurrying me to infallible destruction without success For me there was only obedience With a revolver in either hand I marched towards the bureau as unconcernedly as if I would not have given my life to have escaped the denouement which I needed but a slight modicum of common sense to be aware was close at hand I placed the muzzle of one of the revolvers against the keyhole of the drawer to which my unseen guide had previously directed me and pulled the trigger The lock was shattered the contents of the drawer were at my mercy I snatched up a bundle of letters about which a pink ribbon was wrapped Startled by a noise behind me immediately following the report of the pistol I glanced over my shoulder The room door was open and mister Lessingham was standing with the handle in his hand CHAPTER VII THE GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM He was in evening dress He carried a small portfolio in his left hand If the discovery of my presence startled him as it could scarcely have failed to do he allowed no sign of surprise to escape him Paul Lessingham s inpenetrability is proverbial Whether on platforms addressing excited crowds or in the midst of heated discussion in the House of Commons all the world knows that his coolness remains unruffled It is generally understood that he owes his success in the political arena in no slight measure to the adroitness which is born of his invulnerable presence of mind He gave me a taste of its quality then Standing in the attitude which has been familiarised to us by caricaturists his feet apart his broad shoulders well set back his handsome head a little advanced his keen blue eyes having in them something suggestive of a bird of prey considering just when where and how to pounce he regarded me for some seconds in perfect silence whether outwardly I flinched I cannot say inwardly I know I did When he spoke it was without moving from where he stood and in the calm airy tones in which he might have addressed an acquaintance who had just dropped in May I ask sir to what I am indebted for the pleasure of your company He paused as if waiting for my answer When none came he put his question in another form Pray sir who are you and on whose invitation do I find you here As I still stood speechless motionless meeting his glance without a twitching of an eyebrow nor a tremor of the hand I imagine that he began to consider me with an even closer intentness than before And that the to say the least of it peculiarity of my appearance caused him to suspect that he was face to face with an adventure of a peculiar kind Whether he took me for a lunatic I cannot certainly say but from his manner I think it possible he did He began to move towards me from across the room addressing me with the utmost suavity and courtesy Be so good as to give me the revolver and the papers you are holding in your hand As he came on something entered into me and forced itself from between my lips so that I said in a low hissing voice which I vow was never mine THE BEETLE Whether it was or was not owing in some degree to a trick of my imagination I cannot determine but as the words were spoken it seemed to me that the lights went low so that the place was all in darkness and I again was filled with the nauseous consciousness of the presence of something evil in the room But if in that matter my abnormally strained imagination played me a trick there could be no doubt whatever as to the effect which the words had on mister Lessingham When the mist of the blackness real or supposititious had passed from before my eyes I found that he had retreated to the extremest limits of the room and was crouching his back against the bookshelves clutching at them in the attitude of a man who has received a staggering blow from which as yet he has had no opportunity of recovering A most extraordinary change had taken place in the expression of his face in his countenance amazement fear and horror seemed struggling for the mastery I was filled with a most discomforting qualm as I gazed at the frightened figure in front of me and realised that it was that of the great Paul Lessingham the god of my political idolatry Who are you In God s name who are you His very voice seemed changed his frenzied choking accents would hardly have been recognised by either friend or foe Who are you Do you hear me ask who are you In the name of God I bid you say As he perceived that I was still he began to show a species of excitement which it was unpleasant to witness especially as he continued to crouch against the bookshelf as if he was afraid to stand up straight So far from exhibiting the impassivity for which he was renowned all the muscles in his face and all the limbs in his body seemed to be in motion at once he was like a man afflicted with the shivering ague his very fingers were twitching aimlessly as they were stretched out on either side of him as if seeking for support from the shelves against which he leaned Where have you come from what do you want who sent you here what concern have you with me is it necessary that you should come and play these childish tricks with me why why The questions came from him with astonishing rapidity When he saw that I continued silent they came still faster mingled with what sounded to me like a stream of inchoate abuse Why do you stand there in that extraordinary garment it s worse than nakedness yes worse than nakedness For that alone I could have you punished and I will and try to play the fool Do you think I am a boy to be bamboozled by every bogey a blunderer may try to conjure up If so you re wrong as whoever sent you might have had sense enough to let you know If you tell me who you are and who sent you here and what it is you want I will be merciful if not the police shall be sent for and the law shall take its course to the bitter end I warn you Do you hear You fool tell me who you are The last words came from him in what was very like a burst of childish fury He himself seemed conscious the moment after that his passion was sadly lacking in dignity and to be ashamed of it He drew himself straight up With a pocket handkerchief which he took from an inner pocket of his coat he wiped his lips Then clutching it tightly in his hand he eyed me with a fixedness which under any other circumstances I should have found unbearable Well sir is your continued silence part of the business of the role you have set yourself to play His tone was firmer and his bearing more in keeping with his character If it be so I presume that I at least have liberty to speak When I find a gentleman even one gifted with your eloquence of silence playing the part of burglar I think you will grant that a few words on my part cannot justly be considered to be out of place Again he paused I could not but feel that he was employing the vehicle of somewhat cumbrous sarcasm to gain time and to give himself the opportunity of recovering if the thing was possible his pristine courage That for some cause wholly hidden from me the mysterious utterance had shaken his nature to its deepest foundations was made plainer by his endeavour to treat the whole business with a sort of cynical levity To commence with may I ask if you have come through London or through any portion of it in that costume or rather in that want of costume It would seem out of place in a Cairene street would it not even in the Rue de Rabagas was it not the Rue de Rabagas He asked the question with an emphasis the meaning of which was wholly lost on me What he referred to either then or in what immediately followed I of course knew no more than the man in the moon though I should probably have found great difficulty in convincing him of my ignorance I take it that you are a reminiscence of the Rue de Rabagas that of course is it not of course The little house with the blue grey Venetians and the piano with the F sharp missing Is there still the piano with the tinny treble indeed the whole atmosphere was it not tinny You agree with me I have not forgotten I am not even afraid to remember you perceive it A new idea seemed to strike him born perhaps of my continued silence You look English is it possible that you are not English What are you then French We shall see He addressed me in a tongue which I recognised as French but with which I was not sufficiently acquainted to understand Although I flatter myself that as the present narrative should show I have not made an ill use of the opportunities which I have had to improve my originally modest education I regret that I have never had so much as a ghost of a chance to acquire an even rudimentary knowledge of any language except my own Recognising I suppose from my looks that he was addressing me in a tongue to which I was a stranger after a time he stopped added something with a smile and then began to talk to me in a lingo to which in a manner of speaking I was even stranger for this time I had not the faintest notion what it was it might have been gibberish for all that I could tell Quickly perceiving that he had succeeded no better than before he returned to English You do not know French nor the patois of the Rue de Rabagas Very good then what is it that you do know Are you under a vow of silence or are you dumb except upon occasion Your face is English what can be seen of it and I will take it therefore that English spoken words convey some meaning to your brain So listen sir to what I have to say do me the favour to listen carefully He was becoming more and more his former self In his clear modulated tones there was a ring of something like a threat a something which went very far beyond his words You know something of a period which I choose to have forgotten that is plain you come from a person who probably knows still more Go back to that person and say that what I have forgotten I have forgotten nothing will be gained by anyone by an endeavour to induce me to remember be very sure upon that point say that nothing will be gained by anyone That time was one of mirage of delusion of disease I was in a condition mentally and bodily in which pranks could have been played upon me by any trickster Such pranks were played I know that now quite well I do not pretend to be proficient in the modus operandi of the hankey pankey man but I know that he has a method all the same one susceptible too of facile explanation Go back to your friend and tell him that I am not again likely to be made the butt of his old method nor of his new one either You hear me sir I remained motionless and silent an attitude which plainly he resented Are you deaf and dumb You certainly are not dumb for you spoke to me just now Be advised by me and do not compel me to resort to measures which will be the cause to you of serious discomfort You hear me sir Still from me not a sign of comprehension to his increased annoyance So be it Keep your own counsel if you choose Yours will be the bitterness not mine You may play the lunatic and play it excellently well but that you do understand what is said to you is clear Come to business sir Give me that revolver and the packet of letters which you have stolen from my desk He had been speaking with the air of one who desired to convince himself as much as me and about his last words there was almost a flavour of braggadocio I remained unheeding Are you going to do as I require or are you insane enough to refuse in which case I shall summon assistance and there will quickly be an end of it Pray do not imagine that you can trick me into supposing that you do not grasp the situation I know better Once more are you going to give me that revolver and those letters Yet no reply His anger was growing momentarily greater and his agitation too On my first introduction to Paul Lessingham I was not destined to discover in him any one of those qualities of which the world held him to be the undisputed possessor He showed himself to be as unlike the statesman I had conceived and esteemed as he easily could have done Do you think I stand in awe of you you of such a thing as you Do as I tell you or I myself will make you and at the same time teach you a much needed lesson He raised his voice In his bearing there was a would be defiance He might not have been aware of it but the repetitions of the threats were in themselves confessions of weakness He came a step or two forward then stopping short began to tremble The perspiration broke out upon his brow he made spasmodic little dabs at it with his crumpled up handkerchief His eyes wandered hither and thither as if searching for something which they feared to see yet were constrained to seek He began to talk to himself out loud in odd disconnected sentences apparently ignoring me entirely What was that It was nothing It was my imagination My nerves are out of order I have been working too hard I am not well WHAT S THAT This last inquiry came from him in a half stifled shriek as the door opened to admit the head and body of an elderly man in a state of considerable undress He had the tousled appearance of one who had been unexpectedly roused out of slumber and unwillingly dragged from bed mister Lessingham stared at him as if he had been a ghost while he stared back at mister Lessingham as if he found a difficulty in crediting the evidence of his own eyes It was he who broke the silence stutteringly I am sure I beg your pardon sir but one of the maids thought that she heard the sound of a shot and we came down to see if there was anything the matter I had no idea sir that you were here His eyes travelled from mister Lessingham towards me suddenly increasing when they saw me to about twice their previous size God save us who is that The man s self evident cowardice possibly impressed mister Lessingham with the conviction that he himself was not cutting the most dignified of figures At any rate he made a notable effort to once more assume a bearing of greater determination You are quite right Matthews quite right I am obliged by your watchfulness At present you may leave the room I propose to deal with this fellow myself only remain with the other men upon the landing so that if I call you may come to my assistance Matthews did as he was told he left the room with I fancy more rapidity than he had entered it mister Lessingham returned to me his manner distinctly more determined as if he found his resolution reinforced by the near neighbourhood of his retainers Now my man you see how the case stands at a word from me you will be overpowered and doomed to undergo a long period of imprisonment Yet I am still willing to listen to the dictates of mercy Put down that revolver give me those letters you will not find me disposed to treat you hardly For all the attention I paid him I might have been a graven image He misunderstood or pretended to misunderstand the cause of my silence Come I see that you suppose my intentions to be harsher than they really are do not let us have a scandal and a scene be sensible give me those letters Again he moved in my direction again after he had taken a step or two to stumble and stop and look about him with frightened eyes again to begin to mumble to himself aloud It s a conjurer s trick Of course Nothing more What else could it be I m not to be fooled I m older than I was I ve been overdoing it that s all Suddenly he broke into cries Matthews Matthews Help help Matthews entered the room followed by three other men younger than himself Evidently all had slipped into the first articles of clothing they could lay their hands upon and each carried a stick or some similar rudimentary weapon Their master spurred them on Strike the revolver out of his hand Matthews knock him down take the letters from him don t be afraid I m not afraid In proof of it he rushed at me as it seemed half blindly As he did so I was constrained to shout out in tones which I should not have recognised as mine THE BEETLE And that moment the room was all in darkness and there were screams as of someone in an agony of terror or of pain I felt that something had come into the room I knew not whence nor how something of horror And the next action of which I was conscious was that under cover of the darkness I was flying from the room propelled by I knew not what CHAPTER VIII THE MAN IN THE STREET Whether anyone pursued I cannot say I have some dim recollection as I came out of the room of women being huddled against the wall upon the landing and of their screaming as I went past But whether any effort was made to arrest my progress I cannot tell My own impression is that not the slightest attempt to impede my headlong flight was made by anyone In what direction I was going I did not know I was like a man flying through the phantasmagoric happenings of a dream knowing neither how nor whither I tore along what I suppose was a broad passage through a door at the end into what I fancy was a drawing room Across this room I dashed helter skelter bringing down in the gloom unseen articles of furniture with myself sometimes on top and sometimes under them In a trice each time I fell I was on my feet again until I went crashing against a window which was concealed by curtains It would not have been strange had I crashed through it but I was spared that Thrusting aside the curtains I fumbled for the fastening of the window It was a tall French casement extending so far as I could judge from floor to ceiling When I had it open I stepped through it on to the verandah without to find that I was on the top of the portico which I had vainly essayed to ascend from below I tried the road down which I had tried up proceeding with a breakneck recklessness of which now I shudder to think It was probably some thirty feet above the pavement yet I rushed at the descent with as much disregard for the safety of life and limb as if it had been only three Over the edge of the parapet I went obtaining with my naked feet a precarious foothold on the latticework then down I commenced to scramble I never did get a proper hold and when I had descended perhaps rather more than half the distance scraping as it seemed to me every scrap of skin off my body in the process I lost what little hold I had Down to the bottom I went tumbling rolling right across the pavement into the muddy road It was a miracle I was not seriously injured but in that sense certainly that night the miracles were on my side Hardly was I down than I was up again mud and all Just as I was getting on to my feet I felt a firm hand grip me by the shoulder Turning I found myself confronted by a tall slenderly built man with a long drooping moustache and an overcoat buttoned up to the chin who held me with a grasp of steel He looked at me and I looked back at him After the ball eh Even then I was struck by something pleasant in his voice and some quality as of sunshine in his handsome face Seeing that I said nothing he went on with a curious half mocking smile Is that the way to come slithering down the Apostle s pillar Is it simple burglary or simpler murder Tell me the glad tidings that you ve killed saint Paul and I ll let you go Whether he was mad or not I cannot say there was some excuse for thinking so He did not look mad though his words and actions alike were strange Although you have confined yourself to gentle felony shall I not shower blessings on the head of him who has been robbing Paul Away with you He removed his grip giving me a gentle push as he did so and I was away I neither stayed nor paused I knew little of records but if anyone has made a better record than I did that night between Lowndes Square and Walham Green I should like to know just what it was I should too like to have seen it done In an incredibly short space of time I was once more in front of the house with the open window the packet of letters which were like to have cost me so dear gripped tightly in my hand CHAPTER IX THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET I pulled up sharply as if a brake had been suddenly and even mercilessly applied to bring me to a standstill 
1938-176228-0001	train-other-500	In front of the window I stood shivering A shower had recently commenced the falling rain was being blown before the breeze I was in a terrible sweat yet tremulous as with cold covered with mud
1938-176228-0002	train-other-500	bruised and cut and bleeding as piteous an object as you would care to see Every limb in my body ached every muscle was exhausted mentally and physically I was done
1938-176228-0003	train-other-500	had I not been held up willy nilly by the spell which was upon me I should have sunk down then and there in a hopeless helpless hapless heap But my tormentor was not yet at an end with me
1938-176228-0004	train-other-500	As I stood there like some broken and beaten hack waiting for the word of command it came It was as if some strong magnetic current had been switched on to me through the window to draw me into the room
1938-176228-0005	train-other-500	Over the low wall I went over the sill once more I stood in that chamber of my humiliation and my shame And once again I was conscious of that awful sense of the presence of an evil thing
1938-176228-0006	train-other-500	How much of it was fact and how much of it was the product of imagination I cannot say but looking back it seems to me that it was as if I had been taken out of the corporeal body
none	none	 to be plunged into the inner chambers of all nameless sin 
1938-176228-0007	train-other-500	There was the sound of something flopping from off the bed on to the ground and I knew that the thing was coming at me across the floor My stomach quaked my heart melted within me
1938-176228-0008	train-other-500	the very anguish of my terror gave me strength to scream and scream Sometimes even now I seem to hear those screams of mine ringing through the night and I bury my face in the pillow
1938-176228-0009	train-other-500	and it is as though I was passing through the very Valley of the Shadow The thing went back I could hear it slipping and sliding across the floor There was silence And presently the lamp was lit
1938-176228-0010	train-other-500	and the room was all in brightness There on the bed in the familiar attitude between the sheets his head resting on his hand his eyes blazing like living coals was the dreadful cause of all my agonies
1938-176228-0011	train-other-500	He looked at me with his unpitying unblinking glance So Through the window again like a thief Is it always through that door that you come into a house He paused
1938-176228-0012	train-other-500	as if to give me time to digest his gibe You saw Paul Lessingham well the great Paul Lessingham Was he then so great
none	none	 His rasping voice with its queer foreign twang 
1938-176228-0013	train-other-500	reminded me in some uncomfortable way of a rusty saw the things he said and the manner in which he said them were alike intended to add to my discomfort It was solely because the feat was barely possible
1938-176228-0014	train-other-500	that he only partially succeeded Like a thief you went into his house did I not tell you that you would Like a thief he found you were you not ashamed Since like a thief he found you how comes it that you have escaped
none	none	 by what robber s artifice have you saved yourself from gaol His manner changed so that all at once he seemed to snarl at me Is he great well is he great Paul Lessingham 
1938-176228-0016	train-other-500	You are small but he is smaller your great Paul Lessingham
none	none	 Was there ever a man so less than nothing With the recollection fresh upon me of mister Lessingham as I had so lately seen him 
1938-176228-0017	train-other-500	I could not but feel that there might be a modicum of truth in what with such an intensity of bitterness the speaker suggested The picture which in my mental gallery I had hung in the place of honour seemed to say the least
1938-176228-0018	train-other-500	to have become a trifle smudged As usual the man in the bed seemed to experience not the slightest difficulty in deciphering what was passing through my mind That is so you and he you are a pair
1938-176228-0019	train-other-500	the great Paul Lessingham is as great a thief as you and greater for at least than you he has more courage For some moments he was still then exclaimed with sudden fierceness
1938-176228-0020	train-other-500	Give me what you have stolen I moved towards the bed most unwillingly and held out to him the packet of letters which I had abstracted from the little drawer Perceiving my disinclination to his near neighbourhood
1938-176228-0021	train-other-500	he set himself to play with it Ignoring my outstretched hand he stared me straight in the face What ails you
none	none	 Are you not well 
1938-176228-0022	train-other-500	Is it not sweet to stand close at my side You with your white skin if I were a woman would you not take me for a wife There was something about the manner in which this was said which was so essentially feminine
1938-176228-0023	train-other-500	that once more I wondered if I could possibly be mistaken in the creature s sex I would have given much to have been able to strike him across the face or better to have taken him by the neck and thrown him through the window and rolled him in the mud
1938-176228-0024	train-other-500	He condescended to notice what I was holding out to him So that is what you have stolen That is what you have taken from the drawer in the bureau the drawer which was locked
1938-176228-0025	train-other-500	and which you used the arts in which a thief is skilled to enter Give it to me thief He snatched the packet from me scratching the back of my hand as he did so as if his nails had been talons
1938-176228-0026	train-other-500	He turned the packet over and over glaring at it as he did so it was strange what a relief it was to have his glance removed from off my face You kept it in your inner drawer Paul Lessingham
none	none	 where none but you could see it did you 
1938-176228-0027	train-other-500	You hid it as one hides treasure There should be something here worth having worth seeing worth knowing yes worth knowing since you found it worth your while to hide it up so closely As I have said
1938-176228-0028	train-other-500	the packet was bound about by a string of pink ribbon a fact on which he presently began to comment With what a pretty string you have encircled it and how neatly it is tied Surely only a woman s hand could tie a knot like that
1938-176228-0029	train-other-500	who would have guessed yours were such agile fingers So An endorsement on the cover What s this let s see what s written The letters of my dear love Marjorie Lindon
2769_176256_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Marjorie 
2769_176256_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Marjorie 
none	none	Lindon 
1938-176228-0030	train-other-500	As he read these words which as he said were endorsed upon the outer sheet of paper which served as a cover for the letters which were enclosed within his face became transfigured Never did I suppose that rage could have so possessed a human countenance
1938-176228-0031	train-other-500	His jaw dropped open so that his yellow fangs gleamed though his parted lips he held his breath so long that each moment I looked to see him fall down in a fit the veins stood out all over his face and head like seams of blood
1938-176228-0032	train-other-500	I know not how long he continued speechless When his breath returned it was with chokings and gaspings in the midst of which he hissed out his words as if their mere passage through his throat brought him near to strangulation
1938-176228-0033	train-other-500	The letters of his dear love of his dear love his Paul Lessingham s So It is as I guessed as I knew as I saw Marjorie Lindon
1938-176228-0034	train-other-500	Sweet Marjorie His dear love Paul Lessingham s dear love She with the lily face the corn hued hair What is it his dear love has found in her fond heart to write Paul Lessingham
1938-176228-0035	train-other-500	Sitting up in bed he tore the packet open It contained perhaps eight or nine letters some mere notes some long epistles But short or long
1938-176228-0036	train-other-500	he devoured them with equal appetite each one over and over again till I thought he never would have done re reading them They were on thick white paper of a peculiar shade of whiteness with untrimmed edges
1938-176228-0037	train-other-500	On each sheet a crest and an address were stamped in gold and all the sheets were of the same shape and size I told myself that if anywhere at any time I saw writing paper like that again
1938-176228-0038	train-other-500	I should not fail to know it The caligraphy was like the paper unusual bold decided and I should have guessed produced by a J pen All the time that he was reading
1938-176228-0039	train-other-500	he kept emitting sounds more resembling yelps and snarls than anything more human like some savage beast nursing its pent up rage When he had made an end of reading for the season he let his passion have full vent
1938-176228-0040	train-other-500	So That is what his dear love has found it in her heart to write Paul Lessingham Paul Lessingham Pen cannot describe the concentrated frenzy of hatred with which the speaker dwelt upon the name
none	none	 it was demoniac It is enough it is the end it is his doom 
1938-176228-0041	train-other-500	He shall be ground between the upper and the nether stones in the towers of anguish
none	none	 and all that is left of him shall be cast on the accursed stream of the bitter waters 
1938-176228-0042	train-other-500	to stink under the blood grimed sun
none	none	 And for her

none	none	 and then God in His mercy sent oblivion BOOK II The Haunted Man The Story according to Sydney Atherton Esquire CHAPTER X REJECTED It was after our second waltz I did it In the usual quiet corner which that time was in the shadow of a palm in the hall Before I had got into my stride she checked me touching my sleeve with her fan turning towards me with startled eyes Stop please But I was not to be stopped Cliff Challoner passed with Gerty Cazell I fancy that as he passed he nodded I did not care I was wound up to go and I went it No man knows how he can talk till he does talk to the girl he wants to marry It is my impression that I gave her recollections of the Restoration poets She seemed surprised not having previously detected in me the poetic strain and insisted on cutting in mister Atherton I am so sorry Then I did let fly Sorry that I love you why Why should you be sorry that you have become the one thing needful in any man s eyes even in mine The one thing precious the one thing to be altogether esteemed Is it so common for a woman to come across a man who would be willing to lay down his life for her that she should be sorry when she finds him I did not know that you felt like this though I confess that I have had my my doubts Doubts I thank you You are quite aware mister Atherton that I like you very much Like me Bah I cannot help liking you though it may be bah I don t want you to like me I want you to love me Precisely that is your mistake My mistake in wanting you to love me when I love you Then you shouldn t though I can t help thinking that you are mistaken even there Mistaken in supposing that I love you when I assert and reassert it with the whole force of my being What do you want me to do to prove I love you take you in my arms and crush you to my bosom and make a spectacle of you before every creature in the place I d rather you wouldn t and perhaps you wouldn t mind not talking quite so loud mister Challoner seems to be wondering what you re shouting about You shouldn t torture me She opened and shut her fan as she looked down at it I am disposed to suspect that she smiled I am glad we have had this little explanation because of course you are my friend I am not your friend Pardon me you are I say I m not if I can t be something else I ll be no friend She went on calmly ignoring me playing with her fan As it happens I am just now in rather a delicate position in which a friend is welcome What s the matter Who s been worrying you your father Well he has not as yet but he may be soon What s in the wind mister Lessingham She dropped her voice and her eyes For the moment I did not catch her meaning What Your friend mister Lessingham Excuse me Miss Lindon but I am by no means sure that anyone is entitled to call mister Lessingham a friend of mine What Not when I am going to be his wife That took me aback I had had my suspicions that Paul Lessingham was more with Marjorie than he had any right to be but I had never supposed that she could see anything desirable in a stick of a man like that Not to speak of a hundred and one other considerations Lessingham on one side of the House and her father on the other and old Lindon girding at him anywhere and everywhere with his high dried Tory notions of his family importance to say nothing of his fortune I don t know if I looked what I felt if I did I looked uncommonly blank You have chosen an appropriate moment Miss Lindon to make to me such a communication She chose to disregard my irony I am glad you think so because now you will understand what a difficult position I am in I offer you my hearty congratulations And I thank you for them mister Atherton in the spirit in which they are offered because from you I know they mean so much I bit my lip for the life of me I could not tell how she wished me to read her words Do I understand that this announcement has been made to me as one of the public You do not It is made to you in confidence as my friend as my greatest friend because a husband is something more than friend My pulses tingled You will be on my side She had paused and I stayed silent On your side or mister Lessingham s His side is my side and my side is his side you will be on our side I am not sure that I altogether follow you You are the first I have told When papa hears it is possible that there will be trouble as you know He thinks so much of you and of your opinion when that trouble comes I want you to be on our side on my side Why should I what does it matter You are stronger than your father it is just possible that Lessingham is stronger than you together from your father s point of view you will be invincible You are my friend are you not my friend In effect you offer me an Apple of Sodom Thank you I did not think you so unkind And you are you kind I make you an avowal of my love and straightway you ask me to act as chorus to the love of another How could I tell you loved me as you say I had no notion You have known me all your life yet you have not breathed a word of it till now If I had spoken before I imagine that there was a slight movement of her shoulders almost amounting to a shrug I do not know that it would have made any difference I do not pretend that it would But I do know this I believe that you yourself have only discovered the state of your own mind within the last half hour If she had slapped my face she could not have startled me more I had no notion if her words were uttered at random but they came so near the truth they held me breathless It was a fact that only during the last few minutes had I really realised how things were with me only since the end of that first waltz that the flame had burst out in my soul which was now consuming me She had read me by what seemed so like a flash of inspiration that I hardly knew what to say to her I tried to be stinging You flatter me Miss Lindon you flatter me at every point Had you only discovered to me the state of your mind a little sooner I should not have discovered to you the state of mine at all We will consider it terra incognita Since you wish it Her provoking calmness stung me and the suspicion that she was laughing at me in her sleeve I gave her a glimpse of the cloven hoof But at the same time since you assert that you have so long been innocent I beg that you will continue so no more At least your innocence shall be without excuse For I wish you to understand that I love you that I have loved you that I shall love you Any understanding you may have with mister Lessingham will not make the slightest difference I warn you Miss Lindon that until death you will have to write me down your lover She looked at me with wide open eyes as if I almost frightened her To be frank that was what I wished to do mister Atherton Miss Lindon That is not like you at all We seem to be making each other s acquaintance for the first time She continued to gaze at me with her big eyes which to be candid I found it difficult to meet On a sudden her face was lighted by a smile which I resented Not after all these years not after all these years I know you and though I daresay you re not flawless I fancy you ll be found to ring pretty true Her manner was almost sisterly elder sisterly I could have shaken her Hartridge coming to claim his dance gave me an opportunity to escape with such remnants of dignity as I could gather about me He dawdled up his thumbs as usual in his waistcoat pockets I believe Miss Lindon this is our dance She acknowledged it with a bow and rose to take his arm I got up and left her without a word As I crossed the hall I chanced on Percy Woodville He was in his familiar state of fluster and was gaping about him as if he had mislaid the Koh i noor and wondered where in thunder it had got to When he saw it was I he caught me by the arm I say Atherton have you seen Miss Lindon I have No Have you By Jove Where I ve been looking for her all over the place except in the cellars and the attics and I was just going to commence on them This is our dance In that case she s shunted you No Impossible His mouth went like an O and his eyes ditto his eyeglass clattering down on to his shirt front I expect the mistake s mine Fact is I ve made a mess of my programme It s either the last dance or this dance or the next that I ve booked with her but I m hanged if I know which Just take a squint at it there s a good chap and tell me which one you think it is I took a squint since he held the thing within an inch of my nose I could hardly help it one squint and that was enough and more Some men s ball programmes are studies in impressionism Percy s seemed to me to be a study in madness It was covered with hieroglyphics but what they meant or what they did there anyhow it was absurd to suppose that I could tell I never put them there Proverbially the man s a champion hasher I regret my dear Percy that I am not an expert in cuneiform writing If you have any doubt as to which dance is yours you d better ask the lady she ll feel flattered Leaving him to do his own addling I went to find my coat I panted to get into the open air as for dancing I felt that I loathed it Just as I neared the cloak room someone stopped me It was Dora Grayling Have you forgotten that this is our dance I had forgotten clean And I was not obliged by her remembering Though as I looked at her sweet grey eyes and at the soft contours of her gentle face I felt that I deserved well kicking She is an angel one of the best but I was in no mood for angels Not for a very great deal would I have gone through that dance just then nor with Dora Grayling of all women in the world would I have sat it out So I was a brute and blundered You must forgive me Miss Grayling but I am not feeling very well and I don t think I m up to any more dancing Good night CHAPTER XI A MIDNIGHT EPISODE The weather out of doors was in tune with my frame of mind I was in a deuce of a temper and it was a deuce of a night A keen north east wind warranted to take the skin right off you was playing catch who catch can with intermittent gusts of blinding rain Since it was not fit for a dog to walk none of your cabs for me nothing would serve but pedestrian exercise So I had it I went down Park Lane and the wind and rain went with me also thoughts of Dora Grayling What a bounder I had been and was If there is anything in worse taste than to book a lady for a dance and then to leave her in the lurch I should like to know what that thing is when found it ought to be made a note of If any man of my acquaintance allowed himself to be guilty of such a felony in the first degree I should cut him I wished someone would try to cut me I should like to see him at it It was all Marjorie s fault everything past present and to come I had known that girl when she was in long frocks I had at that period of our acquaintance pretty recently got out of them when she was advanced to short ones and when once more she returned to long And all that time well I was nearly persuaded that the whole of the time I had loved her If I had not mentioned it it was because I had suffered my affection like the worm to lie hidden in the bud or whatever it is the fellow says At any rate I was perfectly positive that if I had had the faintest nation that she would ever seriously consider such a man as Lessingham I should have loved her long ago Lessingham Why he was old enough to be her father at least he was a good many years older than I was And a wretched Radical It is true that on certain points I also am what some people would call a Radical but not a Radical of the kind he is Thank Heaven no No doubt I have admired traits in his character until I learnt this thing of him I am even prepared to admit that he is a man of ability in his way which is emphatically not mine But to think of him in connection with such a girl as Marjorie Lindon preposterous Why the man s as dry as a stick drier And cold as an iceberg Nothing but a politician absolutely He a lover how I could fancy such a stroke of humour setting all the benches in a roar Both by education and by nature he was incapable of even playing such a part as for being the thing absurd If you were to sink a shaft from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet you would find inside him nothing but the dry bones of parties and of politics What my Marjorie if everyone had his own she is mine and in that sense she always will be mine what my Marjorie could see in such a dry as dust out of which even to construct the rudiments of a husband was beyond my fathoming Suchlike agreeable reflections were fit company for the wind and the wet so they bore me company all down the lane I crossed at the corner going round the hospital towards the square This brought me to the abiding place of Paul the Apostle Like the idiot I was I went out into the middle of the street and stood awhile in the mud to curse him and his house on the whole when one considers that that is the kind of man I can be it is perhaps not surprising that Marjorie disdained me May your following I cried it is an absolute fact that the words were shouted both in the House and out of it no longer regard you as a leader May your party follow after other gods May your political aspirations wither and your speeches be listened to by empty benches May the Speaker persistently and strenuously refuse to allow you to catch his eye and at the next election may your constituency reject you Jehoram what s that I might well ask Until that moment I had appeared to be the only lunatic at large either outside the house or in it but on a sudden a second lunatic came on the scene and that with a vengeance A window was crashed open from within the one over the front door and someone came plunging through it on to the top of the portico That it was a case of intended suicide I made sure and I began to be in hopes that I was about to witness the suicide of Paul But I was not so assured of the intention when the individual in question began to scramble down the pillar of the porch in the most extraordinary fashion I ever witnessed I was not even convinced of a suicidal purpose when he came tumbling down and lay sprawling in the mud at my feet I fancy if I had performed that portion of the act I should have lain quiet for a second or two to consider whereabouts I was and which end of me was uppermost But there was no nonsense of that sort about that singularly agile stranger if he was not made of india rubber he ought to have been So to speak before he was down he was up it was all I could do to grab at him before he was off like a rocket Such a figure as he presented is seldom seen at least in the streets of London What he had done with the rest of his apparel I am not in a position to say all that was left of it was a long dark cloak which he strove to wrap round him Save for that and mud he was bare as the palm of my hand Yet it was his face that held me In my time I have seen strange expressions on men s faces but never before one such as I saw on his He looked like a man might look who after living a life of undiluted crime at last finds himself face to face with the devil It was not the look of a madman far from it it was something worse It was the expression on the man s countenance as much as anything else which made me behave as I did I said something to him some nonsense I know not what He regarded me with a silence which was supernatural I spoke to him again not a word issued from those rigid lips there was not a tremor of those awful eyes eyes which I was tolerably convinced saw something which I had never seen or ever should Then I took my hand from off his shoulder and let him go I know not why I did He had remained as motionless as a statue while I held him indeed for any evidence of life he gave he might have been a statue but when my grasp was loosed how he ran He had turned the corner and was out of sight before I could say How do It was only then when he had gone and I had realised the extra double express flash of lightning rate at which he had taken his departure that it occurred to me of what an extremely sensible act I had been guilty in letting him go at all Here was an individual who had been committing burglary or something very like it in the house of a budding cabinet minister and who had tumbled plump into my arms so that all I had to do was to call a policeman and get him quodded and all that I had done was something of a totally different kind You re a nice type of an ideal citizen I was addressing myself A first chop specimen of a low down idiot to connive at the escape of the robber who s been robbing Paul Since you ve let the villain go the least you can do is to leave a card on the Apostle and inquire how he s feeling I went to Lessingham s front door and knocked I knocked once I knocked twice I knocked thrice and the third time I give you my word I made the echoes ring but still there was not a soul that answered If this is a case of a seven or seventy fold murder and the gentleman in the cloak has made a fair clearance of every living creature the house contains perhaps it s just as well I ve chanced upon the scene still I do think that one of the corpses might get up to answer the door If it is possible to make noise enough to waken the dead you bet I m on to it And I was I punished that knocker until I warrant the pounding I gave it was audible on the other side of Green Park And at last I woke the dead or rather I roused Matthews to a consciousness that something was going on Opening the door about six inches through the interstice he protruded his ancient nose Who s there Nothing my dear sir nothing and no one It must have been your vigorous imagination which induced you to suppose that there was you let it run away with you Then he knew me and opened the door about two feet Oh it s you mister Atherton I beg your pardon sir I thought it might have been the police What then Do you stand in terror of the minions of the law at last A most discreet servant Matthews just the fellow for a budding cabinet minister He glanced over his shoulder I had suspected the presence of a colleague at his back now I was assured He put his hand up to his mouth and I thought how exceedingly discreet he looked in his trousers and his stockinged feet and with his hair all rumpled and his braces dangling behind and his nightshirt creased Well sir I have received instructions not to admit the police The deuce you have From whom Coughing behind his hand leaning forward he addressed me with an air which was flatteringly confidential From mister Lessingham sir Possibly mister Lessingham is not aware that a robbery has been committed on his premises that the burglar has just come out of his drawing room window with a hop skip and a jump bounded out of the window like a tennis ball flashed round the corner like a rocket Again Matthews glanced over his shoulder as if not clear which way discretion lay whether fore or aft Thank you sir I believe that mister Lessingham is aware of something of the kind He seemed to come to a sudden resolution dropping his voice to a whisper The fact is sir that I fancy mister Lessingham s a good deal upset Upset I stared at him There was something in his manner I did not understand
2769_176256_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you mean 
none	none	by upset Has the scoundrel attempted violence Who s there The voice was Lessingham s calling to Matthews from the staircase though for an instant I hardly recognised it it was so curiously petulant Pushing past Matthews I stepped into the hall A young man I suppose a footman in the same undress as Matthews was holding a candle it seemed the only light about the place By its glimmer I perceived Lessingham standing half way up the stairs He was in full war paint as he is not the sort of man who dresses for the House I took it that he had been mixing pleasure with business It s I Lessingham Atherton Do you know that a fellow has jumped out of your drawing room window It was a second or two before he answered When he did his voice had lost its petulance Has he escaped Clean he s a mile away by now It seemed to me that in his tone when he spoke again there was a note of relief I wondered if he had Poor fellow more sinned against than sinning Take my advice Atherton and keep out of politics They bring you into contact with all the lunatics at large Good night I am much obliged to you for knocking us up Matthews shut the door Tolerably cool on my honour a man who brings news big with the fate of Rome does not expect to receive such treatment He expects to be listened to with deference and to hear all that there is to hear and not to be sent to the right about before he has had a chance of really opening his lips Before I knew it almost the door was shut and I was on the doorstep Confound the Apostle s impudence next time he might have his house burnt down and him in it before I took the trouble to touch his dirty knocker What did he mean by his allusion to lunatics in politics did he think to fool me There was more in the business than met the eye and a good deal more than he wished to meet mine hence his insolence The creature What Marjorie Lindon could see in such an opusculum surpassed my comprehension especially when there was a man of my sort walking about who adored the very ground she trod upon CHAPTER XII A MORNING VISITOR All through the night waking and sleeping and in my dreams I wondered what Marjorie could see in him In those same dreams I satisfied myself that she could and did see nothing in him but everything in me oh the comfort The misfortune was that when I awoke I knew it was the other way round so that it was a sad awakening An awakening to thoughts of murder So swallowing a mouthful and a peg I went into my laboratory to plan murder legalised murder on the biggest scale it ever has been planned I was on the track of a weapon which would make war not only an affair of a single campaign but of a single half hour It would not want an army to work it either Once let an individual or two or three at most in possession of my weapon that was to be get within a mile or so of even the largest body of disciplined troops that ever yet a nation put into the field and pouf in about the time it takes you to say that they would be all dead men If weapons of precision which may be relied upon to slay are preservers of the peace and the man is a fool who says that they are not then I was within reach of the finest preserver of the peace imagination ever yet conceived What a sublime thought to think that in the hollow of your own hand lies the life and death of nations and it was almost in mine I had in front of me some of the finest destructive agents you could wish to light upon carbon monoxide chlorine trioxide mercuric oxide conine potassamide potassium carboxide cyanogen when Edwards entered I was wearing a mask of my own invention a thing that covered ears and head and everything something like a diver s helmet I was dealing with gases a sniff of which meant death only a few days before unmasked I had been doing some fool s trick with a couple of acids sulphuric and cyanide of potassium when somehow my hand slipped and before I knew it minute portions of them combined By the mercy of Providence I fell backwards instead of forwards sequel about an hour afterwards Edwards found me on the floor and it took the remainder of that day and most of the doctors in town to bring me back to life again Edwards announced his presence by touching me on the shoulder when I am wearing that mask it isn t always easy to make me hear Someone wishes to see you sir Then tell someone that I don t wish to see him Well trained servant Edwards he walked off with the message as decorously as you please And then I thought there was an end but there wasn t I was regulating the valve of a cylinder in which I was fusing some oxides when once more someone touched me on the shoulder Without turning I took it for granted it was Edwards back again I have only to give a tiny twist to this tap my good fellow and you will be in the land where the bogies bloom Why will you come where you re not wanted Then I looked round Who the devil are you For it was not Edwards at all but quite a different class of character I found myself confronting an individual who might almost have sat for one of the bogies I had just alluded to His costume was reminiscent of the Algerians whom one finds all over France and who are the most persistent insolent and amusing of pedlars I remember one who used to haunt the repetitions at the Alcazar at Tours but there This individual was like the originals yet unlike he was less gaudy and a good deal dingier than his Gallic prototypes are apt to be Then he wore a burnoose the yellow grimy looking article of the Arab of the Soudan not the spick and span Arab of the boulevard Chief difference of all his face was clean shaven and whoever saw an Algerian of Paris whose chiefest glory was not his well trimmed moustache and beard I expected that he would address me in the lingo which these gentlemen call French but he didn t You are mister Atherton And you are mister Who how did you come here Where s my servant The fellow held up his hand As he did so as if in accordance with a pre arranged signal Edwards came into the room looking excessively startled I turned to him Is this the person who wished to see me Yes sir Didn t I tell you to say that I didn t wish to see him Yes sir Then why didn t you do as I told you I did sir Then how comes he here Really sir Edwards put his hand up to his head as if be was half asleep I don t quite know What do you mean by you don t know Why didn t you stop him I think sir that I must have had a touch of sudden faintness because I tried to put out my hand to stop him and I couldn t You re an idiot Go And he went I turned to the stranger Pray sir are you a magician He replied to my question with another You mister Atherton are you also a magician He was staring at my mask with an evident lack of comprehension I wear this because in this place death lurks in so many subtle forms that without it I dare not breathe He inclined his head though I doubt if he understood Be so good as to tell me briefly what it is you wish with me He slipped his hand into the folds of his burnoose and taking out a slip of paper laid it on the shelf by which we were standing I glanced at it expecting to find on it a petition or a testimonial or a true statement of his sad case instead it contained two words only Marjorie Lindon The unlooked for sight of that well loved name brought the blood into my cheeks You come from Miss Lindon He narrowed his shoulders brought his finger tips together inclined his head in a fashion which was peculiarly Oriental but not particularly explanatory so I repeated my question Do you wish me to understand that you do come from Miss Lindon Again he slipped his hand into his burnoose again he produced a slip of paper again he laid it on the shelf again I glanced at it again nothing was written on it but a name Paul Lessingham Well I see Paul Lessingham What then She is good he is bad is it not so He touched first one scrap of paper then the other I stared Pray how do you happen to know He shall never have her eh What on earth do you mean Ah what do I mean Precisely what do you mean And also and at the same time who the devil are you It is as a friend I come to you Then in that case you may go I happen to be over stocked in that line just now Not with the kind of friend I am The saints forefend You love her you love Miss Lindon Can you bear to think of him in her arms I took off my mask feeling that the occasion required it As I did so he brushed aside the hanging folds of the hood of his burnoose so that I saw more of his face I was immediately conscious that in his eyes there was in an especial degree what for want of a better term one may call the mesmeric quality That his was one of those morbid organisations which are oftener found thank goodness in the east than in the west and which are apt to exercise an uncanny influence over the weak and the foolish folk with whom they come in contact the kind of creature for whom it is always just as well to keep a seasoned rope close handy I was also conscious that he was taking advantage of the removal of my mask to try his strength on me than which he could not have found a tougher job The sensitive something which is found in the hypnotic subject happens in me to be wholly absent I see you are a mesmerist He started I am nothing a shadow And I m a scientist I should like with your permission or without it to try an experiment or two on you He moved further back There came a gleam into his eyes which suggested that he possessed his hideous power to an unusual degree that in the estimation of his own people he was qualified to take his standing as a regular devil doctor We will try experiments together you and I on Paul Lessingham Why on him You do not know I do not Why do you lie to me I don t lie to you I haven t the faintest notion what is the nature of your interest in mister Lessingham My interest that is another thing it is your interest of which we are speaking Pardon me it is yours Listen you love her and he But at a word from you he shall not have her never It is I who say it I And once more sir who are you I am of the children of Isis Is that so It occurs to me that you have made a slight mistake this is London not a dog hole in the desert Do I not know what does it matter you shall see There will come a time when you will want me you will find that you cannot bear to think of him in her arms her whom you love You will call to me and I shall come and of Paul Lessingham there shall be an end While I was wondering whether he was really as mad as he sounded or whether he was some impudent charlatan who had an axe of his own to grind and thought that he had found in me a grindstone he had vanished from the room I moved after him Hang it all stop I cried He must have made pretty good travelling because before I had a foot in the hall I heard the front door slam and when I reached the street intent on calling him back neither to the right nor to the left was there a sign of him to be seen CHAPTER XIII THE PICTURE I wonder what that nice looking beggar really means and who he happens to be That was what I said to myself when I returned to the laboratory If it is true that now and again Providence does write a man s character on his face then there can t be the slightest shred of a doubt that a curious one s been written on his I wonder what his connection has been with the Apostle or if it s only part of his game of bluff I strode up and down for the moment my interest in the experiments I was conducting had waned If it was all bluff I never saw a better piece of acting and yet what sort of finger can such a precisian as saint Paul have in such a pie The fellow seemed to squirm at the mere mention of the rising hope of the Radicals name Can the objection be political Let me consider what has Lessingham done which could offend the religious or patriotic susceptibilities of the most fanatical of Orientals Politically I can recall nothing Foreign affairs as a rule he has carefully eschewed If he has offended and if he hasn t the seeming was uncommonly good the cause will have to be sought upon some other track But then what track The more I strove to puzzle it out the greater the puzzlement grew Absurd The rascal has had no more connection with saint Paul than saint Peter The probability is that he s a crackpot and if he isn t he has some little game on foot in close association with the hunt of the oof bird which he tried to work off on me but couldn t As for for Marjorie my Marjorie only she isn t mine confound it if I had had my senses about me I should have broken his head in several places for daring to allow her name to pass his lips the unbaptised Mohammedan Now to return to the chase of splendid murder I snatched up my mask one of the most ingenious inventions by the way of recent years if the armies of the future wear my mask they will defy my weapon and was about to re adjust it in its place when someone knocked at the door Who s there Come in It was Edwards He looked round him as if surprised I beg your pardon sir I thought you were engaged I didn t know that that gentleman had gone He went up the chimney as all that kind of gentlemen do Why the deuce did you let him in when I told you not to Really sir I don t know I gave him your message and he looked at me and that is all I remember till I found myself standing in this room Had it not been Edwards I might have suspected him of having had his palm well greased but in his case I knew better It was as I thought my visitor was a mesmerist of the first class he had actually played some of his tricks in broad daylight on my servant at my own front door a man worth studying Edwards continued There is someone else sir who wishes to see you mister Lessingham mister Lessingham At that moment the juxtaposition seemed odd though I daresay it was so rather in appearance than in reality Show him in Presently in came Paul I am free to confess I have owned it before that in a sense I admire that man so long as he does not presume to thrust himself into a certain position He possesses physical qualities which please my eye speaking as a mere biologist like the suggestion conveyed by his every pose his every movement of a tenacious hold on life of reserve force of a repository of bone and gristle on which he can fall back at pleasure The fellow s lithe and active not hasty yet agile clean built well hung the sort of man who might be relied upon to make a good recovery You might beat him in a sprint mental or physical though to do that you would have to be spry but in a staying race he would see you out I do not know that he is exactly the kind of man whom I would trust unless I knew that he was on the job which knowledge in his case would be uncommonly hard to attain He is too calm too self contained with the knack of looking all round him even in moments of extremest peril and for whatever he does he has a good excuse He has the reputation both in the House and out of it of being a man of iron nerve and with some reason yet I am not so sure Unless I read him wrongly his is one of those individualities which confronted by certain eventualities collapse to rise the moment of trial having passed like Phoenix from her ashes However it might be with his adherents he would show no trace of his disaster And this was the man whom Marjorie loved Well she could show some cause He was a man of position destined probably to rise much higher a man of parts with capacity to make the most of them not ill looking with agreeable manners when he chose and he came within the lady s definition of a gentleman he always did the right thing at the right time in the right way And yet Well I take it that we are all cads and that we most of us are prigs for mercy s sake do not let us all give ourselves away He was dressed as a gentleman should be dressed black frock coat black vest dark grey trousers stand up collar smartly tied bow gloves of the proper shade neatly brushed hair and a smile which if was not childlike at any rate was bland I am not disturbing you Not at all Sure I never enter a place like this where a man is matching himself with nature to wrest from her her secrets without feeling that I am crossing the threshold of the unknown The last time I was in this room was just after you had taken out the final patents for your System of Telegraphy at Sea which the Admiralty purchased wisely What is it now Death No really what do you mean If you are a member of the next government you will possibly learn I may offer them the refusal of a new wrinkle in the art of murder I see a new projectile How long is this race to continue between attack and defence Until the sun grows cold And then There ll be no defence nothing to defend He looked at me with his calm grave eyes The theory of the Age of Ice towards which we are advancing is not a cheerful one He began to finger a glass retort which lay upon a table By the way it was very good of you to give me a look in last night I am afraid you thought me peremptory I have come to apologise I don t know that I thought you peremptory I thought you queer Yes He glanced at me with that expressionless look upon his face which he could summon at will and which is at the bottom of the superstition about his iron nerve I was worried and not well Besides one doesn t care to be burgled even by a maniac Was he a maniac Did you see him Very clearly Where In the street How close were you to him Closer than I am to you Indeed I didn t know you were so close to him as that Did you try to stop him Easier said than done he was off at such a rate Did you see how he was dressed or rather undressed I did In nothing but a cloak on such a night Who but a fanatic would have attempted burglary in such a costume Did he take anything Absolutely nothing It seems to have been a curious episode He moved his eyebrows according to members of the House the only gesture in which he has been known to indulge We become accustomed to curious episodes Oblige me by not mentioning it to anyone to anyone He repeated the last two words as if to give them emphasis I wondered if he was thinking of Marjorie I am communicating with the police Until they move I don t want it to get into the papers or to be talked about It s a worry you understand I nodded He changed the theme This that you re engaged upon is it a projectile or a weapon If you are a member of the next government you will possibly know if you aren t you possibly won t I suppose you have to keep this sort of thing secret I do It seems that matters of much less moment you wish to keep secret You mean that business of last night If a trifle of that sort gets into the papers or gets talked about which is the same thing you have no notion how we are pestered It becomes an almost unbearable nuisance Jones the Unknown can commit murder with less inconvenience to himself than Jones the Notorious can have his pocket picked there is not so much exaggeration in that as there sounds Good bye thanks for your promise I had given him no promise but that was by the way He turned as to go then stopped There s another thing I believe you re a specialist on questions of ancient superstitions and extinct religions I am interested in such subjects but I am not a specialist Can you tell me what were the exact tenets of the worshippers of Isis Neither I nor any man with scientific certainty As you know she had a brother the cult of Osiris and Isis was one and the same What precisely were its dogmas or its practices or anything about it none now can tell The Papyri hieroglyphics and so on which remain are very far from being exhaustive and our knowledge of those which do remain is still less so I suppose that the marvels which are told of it are purely legendary To what marvels do you particularly refer Weren t supernatural powers attributed to the priests of Isis Broadly speaking at that time supernatural powers were attributed to all the priests of all the creeds I see Presently he continued I presume that her cult is long since extinct that none of the worshippers of Isis exist to day I hesitated I was wondering why he had hit on such a subject if he really had a reason or if he was merely asking questions as a cover for something else you see I knew my Paul That is not so sure He looked at me with that passionless yet searching glance of his You think that she still is worshipped I think it possible even probable that here and there in Africa Africa is a large order homage is paid to Isis quite in the good old way Do you know that as a fact Excuse me but do you know it as a fact Are you aware that you are treating me as if I was on the witness stand Have you any special purpose in making these inquiries He smiled In a kind of a way I have I have recently come across rather a curious story I am trying to get to the bottom of it What is the story I am afraid that at present I am not at liberty to tell it you when I am I will You will find it interesting as an instance of a singular survival Didn t the followers of Isis believe in transmigration Some of them no doubt What did they understand by transmigration Transmigration Yes but of the soul or of the body How do you mean transmigration is transmigration Are you driving at something in particular If you ll tell me fairly and squarely what it is I ll do my best to give you the information you require as it is your questions are a bit perplexing Oh it doesn t matter as you say transmigration is transmigration I was eyeing him keenly I seemed to detect in his manner an odd reluctance to enlarge on the subject he himself had started He continued to trifle with the retort upon the table Hadn t the followers of Isis a what shall I say a sacred emblem How Hadn t they an especial regard for some sort of a wasn t it some sort of a beetle You mean Scarabaeus sacer according to Latreille Scarabaeus Egyptiorum Undoubtedly the scarab was venerated throughout Egypt indeed speaking generally most things that had life for instance cats as you know Orisis continued among men in the figure of Apis the bull Weren t the priests of Isis or some of them supposed to assume after death the form of a scarabaeus I never heard of it Are you sure think I shouldn t like to answer such a question positively offhand but I don t on the spur of the moment recall any supposition of the kind Don t laugh at me I m not a lunatic but I understand that recent researches have shown that even in some of the most astounding of the ancient legends there was a substratum of fact Is it absolutely certain that there could be no shred of truth in such a belief In what belief In the belief that a priest of Isis or anyone assumed after death the form of a scarabaeus It seems to me Lessingham that you have lately come across some uncommonly interesting data of a kind too which it is your bounden duty to give to the world or at any rate to that portion of the world which is represented by me Come tell us all about it what are you afraid of I am afraid of nothing and some day you shall be told but not now At present answer my question Then repeat your question clearly Is it absolutely certain that there could be no foundation of truth in the belief that a priest of Isis or anyone assumed after death the form of a beetle I know no more than the man in the moon how the dickens should I Such a belief may have been symbolical Christians believe that after death the body takes the shape of worms and so in a sense it does and sometimes eels That is not what I mean Then what do you mean Listen If a person of whose veracity there could not be a vestige of a doubt assured you that he had seen such a transformation actually take place could it conceivably be explained on natural grounds Seen a priest of Isis assume the form of a beetle Or a follower of Isis Before or after death He hesitated I had seldom seen him wear such an appearance of interest to be frank I was keenly interested too but on a sudden there came into his eyes a glint of something that was almost terror When he spoke it was with the most unwonted awkwardness In in the very act of dying In the very act of dying If he had seen a follower of Isis in the very act of dying assume the form of a a beetle on any conceivable grounds would such a transformation be susceptible of a natural explanation I stared as who would not Such an extraordinary question was rendered more extraordinary by coming from such a man yet I was almost beginning to suspect that there was something behind it more extraordinary still Look here Lessingham I can see you ve a capital tale to tell so tell it man Unless I m mistaken it s not the kind of tale in which ordinary scruples can have any part or parcel anyhow it s hardly fair of you to set my curiosity all agog and then to leave it unappeased He eyed me steadily the appearance of interest fading more and more until presently his face assumed its wonted expressionless mask somehow I was conscious that what he had seen in my face was not altogether to his liking His voice was once more bland and self contained I perceive you are of opinion that I have been told a taradiddle I suppose I have But what is the taradiddle don t you see I m burning Unfortunately Atherton I am on my honour Until I have permission to unloose it my tongue is tied He picked up his hat and umbrella from where he had placed them on the table Holding them in his left hand he advanced to me with his right outstretched It is very good of you to suffer my continued interruption I know to my sorrow what such interruptions mean believe me I am not ungrateful What is this On the shelf within a foot or so of where I stood was a sheet of paper the size and shape of half a sheet of post note At this he stooped to glance As he did so something surprising occurred On the instant a look came on to his face which literally transfigured him His hat and umbrella fell from his grasp on to the floor He retreated gibbering his hands held out as if to ward something off from him until he reached the wall on the other side of the room A more amazing spectacle than he presented I never saw Lessingham I exclaimed What s wrong with you My first impression was that he was struck by a fit of epilepsy though anyone less like an epileptic subject it would be hard to find In my bewilderment I looked round to see what could be the immediate cause My eye fell upon the sheet of paper I stared at it with considerable surprise I had not noticed it there previously I had not put it there where had it come from The curious thing was that on it produced apparently by some process of photogravure was an illustration of a species of beetle with which I felt that I ought to be acquainted and yet was not It was of a dull golden green the colour was so well brought out even to the extent of seeming to scintillate and the whole thing was so dexterously done that the creature seemed alive The semblance of reality was indeed so vivid that it needed a second glance to be assured that it was a mere trick of the reproducer Its presence there was odd after what we had been talking about it might seem to need explanation but it was absurd to suppose that that alone could have had such an effect on a man like Lessingham With the thing in my hand I crossed to where he was pressing his back against the wall he had shrunk lower inch by inch till he was actually crouching on his haunches Lessingham come man what s wrong with you Taking him by the shoulder I shook him with some vigour My touch had on him the effect of seeming to wake him out of a dream of restoring him to consciousness as against the nightmare horrors with which he was struggling He gazed up at me with that look of cunning on his face which one associates with abject terror Atherton Is it you It s all right quite right I m well very well As he spoke he slowly drew himself up till he was standing erect Then in that case all I can say is that you have a queer way of being very well He put his hand up to his mouth as if to hide the trembling of his lips It s the pressure of overwork I ve had one or two attacks like this but it s nothing only a local lesion I observed him keenly to my thinking there was something about him which was very odd indeed Only a local lesion If you take my strongly urged advice you ll get a medical opinion without delay if you haven t been wise enough to have done so already I ll go to day at once but I know it s only mental overstrain You re sure it s nothing to do with this I held out in front of him the photogravure of the beetle As I did so he backed away from me shrieking trembling as with palsy Take it away take it away he screamed I stared at him for some seconds astonished into speechlessness Then I found my tongue Lessingham It s only a picture Are you stark mad He persisted in his ejaculations Take it away take it away Tear it up Burn it His agitation was so unnatural from whatever cause it arose that fearing the recurrence of the attack from which he had just recovered I did as he bade me I tore the sheet of paper into quarters and striking a match set fire to each separate piece He watched the process of incineration as if fascinated When it was concluded and nothing but ashes remained he gave a gasp of relief Lessingham I said you re either mad already or you re going mad which is it I think it s neither I believe I am as sane as you It s it s that story of which I was speaking it it seems curious but I ll tell you all about it some day As I observed I think you will find it an interesting instance of a singular survival He made an obvious effort to become more like his usual self It is extremely unfortunate Atherton that I should have troubled you with such a display of weakness especially as I am able to offer you so scant an explanation One thing I would ask of you to observe strict confidence What has taken place has been between ourselves I am in your hands but you are my friend I know I can rely on you not to speak of it to anyone and in particular not to breathe a hint of it to Miss Lindon Why in particular not to Miss Lindon Can you not guess I hunched my shoulder If what I guess is what you mean is not that a cause the more why silence would be unfair to her It is for me to speak if for anyone I shall not fail to do what should be done Give me your promise that you will not hint a word to her of what you have so unfortunately seen I gave him the promise he required There was no more work for me that day The Apostle his divagations his example of the coleoptera his Arabian friend these things were as microbes which acting on a system already predisposed for their reception produced high fever I was in a fever of unrest Brain in a whirl Marjorie Paul Isis beetle mesmerism in delirious jumble Love s upsetting in itself a sufficiently severe disease but when complications intervene suggestive of mystery and novelties so that you do not know if you are moving in an atmosphere of dreams or of frozen facts if then your temperature does not rise like that rocket of M Verne s which reached the moon then you are a freak of an entirely genuine kind and if the surgeons do not preserve you and place you on view in pickle they ought to for the sake of historical doubters for no one will believe that there ever was a man like you unless you yourself are somewhere around to prove them Thomases Myself I am not that kind of man When I get warm I grow heated and when I am heated there is likely to be a variety show of a gaudy kind When Paul had gone I tried to think things out and if I had kept on trying something would have happened so I went on the river instead CHAPTER XIV THE DUCHESS BALL That night was the Duchess of Datchet s ball the first person I saw as I entered the dancing room was Dora Grayling I went straight up to her Miss Grayling I behaved very badly to you last night I have come to make to you my apologies to sue for your forgiveness My forgiveness Her head went back she has a pretty bird like trick of cocking it a little on one side You were not well Are you better Quite You forgive me Then grant me plenary absolution by giving me a dance for the one I lost last night She rose A man came up a stranger to me she s one of the best hunted women in England there s a million with her This is my dance Miss Grayling She looked at him You must excuse me I am afraid I have made a mistake I had forgotten that I was already engaged I had not thought her capable of it She took my arm and away we went and left him staring It s he who s the sufferer now I whispered as we went round she can waltz You think so It was I last night I did not mean if I could help it to suffer again To me a dance with you means something She went all red adding as an afterthought Nowadays so few men really dance I expect it s because you dance so well Thank you We danced the waltz right through then we went to an impromptu shelter which had been rigged up on a balcony And we talked There s something sympathetic about Miss Grayling which leads one to talk about one s self before I was half aware of it I was telling her of all my plans and projects actually telling her of my latest notion which ultimately was to result in the destruction of whole armies as by a flash of lightning She took an amount of interest in it which was surprising What really stands in the way of things of this sort is not theory but practice one can prove one s facts on paper or on a small scale in a room what is wanted is proof on a large scale by actual experiment If for instance I could take my plant to one of the forests of South America where there is plenty of animal life but no human I could demonstrate the soundness of my position then and there Why don t you Think of the money it would cost I thought I was a friend of yours I had hoped you were Then why don t you let me help you Help me How By letting you have the money for your South American experiment it would be an investment on which I should expect to receive good interest I fidgeted It is very good of you Miss Grayling to talk like that She became quite frigid Please don t be absurd I perceive quite clearly that you are snubbing me and that you are trying to do it as delicately as you know how Miss Grayling I understand that it was an impertinence on my part to volunteer assistance which was unasked you have made that sufficiently plain I assure you Pray don t Of course if it had been Miss Lindon it would have been different she would at least have received a civil answer But we are not all Miss Lindon I was aghast The outburst was so uncalled for I had not the faintest notion what I had said or done to cause it she was in such a surprising passion and it suited her I thought I had never seen her look prettier I could do nothing else but stare So she went on with just as little reason Here is someone coming to claim this dance I can t throw all my partners over Have I offended you so irremediably that it will be impossible for you to dance with me again Miss Grayling I shall be only too delighted She handed me her card Which may I have For your own sake you had better place it as far off as you possibly can They all seem taken That doesn t matter strike off any name you please anywhere and put your own instead It was giving me an almost embarrassingly free hand I booked myself for the next waltz but two who it was who would have to give way to me I did not trouble to inquire mister Atherton is that you It was it was also she It was Marjorie And so soon as I saw her I knew that there was only one woman in the world for me the mere sight of her sent the blood tingling through my veins Turning to her attendant cavalier she dismissed him with a bow Is there an empty chair She seated herself in the one Miss Grayling had just vacated I sat down beside her She glanced at me laughter in her eyes I was all in a stupid tremblement You remember that last night I told you that I might require your friendly services in diplomatic intervention I nodded I felt that the allusion was unfair Well the occasion s come or at least it s very near She was still and I said nothing to help her You know how unreasonable papa can be I did never a more pig headed man in England than Geoffrey Lindon or in a sense a duller But just then I was not prepared to admit it to his child You know what an absurd objection he has to Paul There was an appreciative hesitation before she uttered the fellow s Christian name when it came it was with an accent of tenderness which stung me like a gadfly To speak to me of all men of the fellow in such a tone was like a woman Has mister Lindon no notion of how things stand between you Except what he suspects That is just where you are to come in papa thinks so much of you I want you to sound Paul s praises in his ear to prepare him for what must come Was ever rejected lover burdened with such a task Its enormity kept me still Sydney you have always been my friend my truest dearest friend When I was a little girl you used to come between papa and me to shield me from his wrath Now that I am a big girl I want you to be on my side once more and to shield me still Her voice softened She laid her hand upon my arm How under her touch I burned But I don t understand what cause there has been for secrecy why should there have been any secrecy from the first It was Paul s wish that papa should not be told Is mister Lessingham ashamed of you Sydney Or does he fear your father You are unkind You know perfectly well that papa has been prejudiced against him all along you know that his political position is just now one of the greatest difficulty that every nerve and muscle is kept on the continual strain that it is in the highest degree essential that further complications of every and any sort should be avoided He is quite aware that his suit will not be approved of by papa and he simply wishes that nothing shall be said about it till the end of the session that is all I see mister Lessingham is cautious even in love making politician first and lover afterwards Well why not would you have him injure the cause he has at heart for want of a little patience It depends what cause it is he has at heart What is the matter with you why do you speak to me like that it is not like you at all She looked at me shrewdly with flashing eyes Is it possible that you are jealous that you were in earnest in what you said last night I thought that was the sort of thing you said to every girl I would have given a great deal to take her in my arms and press her to my bosom then and there to think that she should taunt me with having said to her the sort of thing I said to every girl What do you know of mister Lessingham What all the world knows that history will be made by him There are kinds of history in the making of which one would not desire to be associated What do you know of his private life it was to that that I was referring Really you go too far I know that he is one of the best just as he is one of the greatest of men for me that is sufficient If you do know that it is sufficient I do know it all the world knows it Everyone with whom he comes in contact is aware must be aware that he is incapable of a dishonourable thought or action Take my advice don t appreciate any man too highly In the book of every man s life there is a page which he would wish to keep turned down There is no such page in Paul s there may be in yours I think that probable Thank you I fear it is more than probable I fear that in my case the page may extend to several There is nothing Apostolic about me not even the name Sydney you are unendurable It is the more strange to hear you talk like this since Paul regards you as his friend He flatters me Are you not his friend Is it not sufficient to be yours No who is against Paul is against me That is hard How is it hard Who is against the husband can hardly be for the wife when the husband and the wife are one But as yet you are not one Is my cause so hopeless What do you call your cause are you thinking of that nonsense you were talking about last night She laughed You call it nonsense You ask for sympathy and give so much I will give you all the sympathy you stand in need of I promise it My poor dear Sydney don t be so absurd Do you think that I don t know you You re the best of friends and the worst of lovers as the one so true so fickle as the other To my certain knowledge with how many girls have you been in love and out again It is true that to the best of my knowledge and belief you have never been in love with me before but that s the merest accident Believe me my dear dear Sydney you ll be in love with someone else tomorrow if you re not half way there to night I confess quite frankly that in that direction all the experience I have had of you has in nowise strengthened my prophetic instinct Cheer up one never knows Who is this that s coming It was Dora Grayling who was coming I went off with her without a word we were half way through the dance before she spoke to me I am sorry that I was cross to you just now and disagreeable Somehow I always seem destined to show to you my most unpleasant side The blame was mine what sort of side do I show you You are far kinder to me than I deserve now and always That is what you say Pardon me it s true else how comes it that at this time of day I m without a friend in all the world You without a friend I never knew a man who had so many I never knew a person of whom so many men and women join in speaking well Miss Grayling As for never having done anything worth doing think of what you have done Think of your discoveries think of your inventions think of but never mind The world knows you have done great things and it confidently looks to you to do still greater You talk of being friendless and yet when I ask as a favour as a great favour to be allowed to do something to show my friendship you well you snub me I snub you You know you snubbed me Do you really mean that you take an interest in in my work You know I mean it She turned to me her face all glowing and I did know it Will you come to my laboratory to morrow morning Will I won t I With your aunt Yes with my aunt I ll show you round and tell you all there is to be told and then if you still think there s anything in it I ll accept your offer about that South American experiment that is if it still holds good Of course it still holds good And we ll be partners Partners Yes we will be partners It will cost a terrific sum There are some things which never can cost too much That s not my experience I hope it will be mine It s a bargain On my side I promise you that it s a bargain When I got outside the room I found that Percy Woodville was at my side His round face was in a manner of speaking as long as my arm He took his glass out of his eye and rubbed it with his handkerchief and directly he put it back he took it out and rubbed it again I believe that I never saw him in such a state of fluster and when one speaks of Woodville that means something Atherton I am in a devil of a stew He looked it All of a heap I ve had a blow which I shall never get over Then get under Woodville is one of those fellows who will insist on telling me their most private matters even to what they owe their washerwomen for the ruination of their shirts Why goodness alone can tell heaven knows I am not sympathetic Don t be an idiot you don t know what I m suffering I m as nearly as possible stark mad That s all right old chap I ve seen you that way more than once before Don t talk like that you re not a perfect brute I bet you a shilling that I am Don t torture me you re not Atherton He seized me by the lapels of my coat seeming half beside himself fortunately he had drawn me into a recess so that we were noticed by few observers What do you think has happened My dear chap how on earth am I to know She s refused me Has she Well I never Buck up try some other address there are quite as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it Atherton you re a blackguard He had crumpled his handkerchief into a ball and was actually bobbing at his eyes with it the idea of Percy Woodville being dissolved in tears was excruciatingly funny but just then I could hardly tell him so There s not a doubt of it it s my way of being sympathetic Don t be so down man try her again It s not the slightest use I know it isn t from the way she treated me Don t be so sure women often say what they mean least Who s the lady Who Is there more women in the world than one for me or has there ever been You ask me who What does the word mean to me but Marjorie Lindon Marjorie Lindon I fancy that my jaw dropped open that to use his own vernacular I was all of a heap I felt like it I strode away leaving him mazed and all but ran into Marjorie s arms I m just leaving Will you see me to the carriage mister Atherton I saw her to the carriage Are you off can I give you a lift Thank you I am not thinking of being off I m going to the House of Commons won t you come What are you going there for Directly she spoke of it I knew why she was going and she knew that I knew as her words showed You are quite well aware of what the magnet is You are not so ignorant as not to know that the Agricultural Amendment Act is on to night and that Paul is to speak I always try to be there when Paul is to speak and I mean to always keep on trying He is a fortunate man Indeed and again indeed A man with such gifts as his is inadequately described as fortunate But I must be off He expected to be up before but I heard from him a few minutes ago that there has been a delay but that he will be up within half an hour Till our next meeting As I returned into the house in the hall I met Percy Woodville He had his hat on Where are you off to I m off to the House To hear Paul Lessingham Damn Paul Lessingham With all my heart There s a division expected I ve got to go Someone else has gone to hear Paul Lessingham Marjorie Lindon No you don t say so by Jove I say Atherton I wish I could make a speech I never can When I m electioneering I have to have my speeches written for me and then I have to read em But by Jove if I knew Miss Lindon was in the gallery and if I knew anything about the thing or could get someone to tell me something hang me if I wouldn t speak I d show her I m not the fool she thinks I am Speak Percy speak you d knock em silly sir I tell you what I ll do I ll come with you I ll to the House as well Paul Lessingham shall have an audience of three CHAPTER XV mister LESSINGHAM SPEAKS The House was full Percy and I went upstairs to the gallery which is theoretically supposed to be reserved for what are called distinguished strangers those curious animals Trumperton was up hammering out those sentences which smell not so much of the lamp as of the dunderhead Nobody was listening except the men in the Press Gallery where is the brain of the House and ninety per cent of its wisdom It was not till Trumperton had finished that I discovered Lessingham The tedious ancient resumed his seat amidst a murmur of sounds which I have no doubt some of the press men interpreted next day as loud and continued applause There was movement in the House possibly expressive of relief a hum of voices men came flocking in Then from the Opposition benches there rose a sound which was applause and I perceived that on a cross bench close to the gangway Paul Lessingham was standing up bareheaded I eyed him critically as a collector might eye a valuable specimen or a pathologist a curious subject During the last four and twenty hours my interest in him had grown apace Just then to me he was the most interesting man the world contained When I remembered how I had seen him that same morning a nerveless terror stricken wretch grovelling like some craven cur upon the floor frightened to the verge of imbecility by a shadow and less than a shadow I was confronted by two hypotheses Either I had exaggerated his condition then or I exaggerated his condition now So far as appearance went it was incredible that this man could be that one I confess that my feeling rapidly became one of admiration I love the fighter I quickly recognised that here we had him in perfection There was no seeming about him then the man was to the manner born To his finger tips a fighting man I had never realised it so clearly before He was coolness itself He had all his faculties under complete command While never for a moment really exposing himself he would be swift in perceiving the slightest weakness in his opponents defence and so soon as he saw it like lightning he would slip in a telling blow Though defeated he would hardly be disgraced and one might easily believe that their very victories would be so expensive to his assailants that in the end they would actually conduce to his own triumph Hang me I told myself if after all I am surprised if Marjorie does see something in him For I perceived how a clever and imaginative young woman seeing him at his best holding his own like a gallant knight against overwhelming odds in the lists in which he was so much at home might come to think of him as if he were always and only there ignoring altogether the kind of man he was when the joust was finished It did me good to hear him I do know that and I could easily imagine the effect he had on one particular auditor who was in the Ladies Cage It was very far from being an oration in the American sense it had little or nothing of the fire and fury of the French Tribune it was marked neither by the ponderosity nor the sentiment of the eloquent German yet it was as satisfying as are the efforts of either of the three producing without doubt precisely the effect which the speaker intended His voice was clear and calm not exactly musical yet distinctly pleasant and it was so managed that each word he uttered was as audible to every person present as if it had been addressed particularly to him His sentences were short and crisp the words which he used were not big ones but they came from him with an agreeable ease and he spoke just fast enough to keep one s interest alert without invoking a strain on the attention He commenced by making in the quietest and most courteous manner sarcastic comments on the speeches and methods of Trumperton and his friends which tickled the House amazingly But he did not make the mistake of pushing his personalities too far To a speaker of a certain sort nothing is easier than to sting to madness If he likes his every word is barbed Wounds so given fester they are not easily forgiven it is essential to a politician that he should have his firmest friends among the fools or his climbing days will soon be over Soon his sarcasms were at an end He began to exchange them for sweet sounding phrases He actually began to say pleasant things to his opponents apparently to mean them To put them in a good conceit with themselves He pointed out how much truth there was in what they said and then as if by accident with what ease and at how little cost amendments might be made He found their arguments and took them for his own and flattered them whether they would or would not by showing how firmly they were founded upon fact and grafted other arguments upon them which seemed their natural sequelae and transformed them and drove them hither and thither and brought them their own arguments to a round irrefragable conclusion which was diametrically the reverse of that to which they themselves had brought them And he did it all with an aptness a readiness a grace which was incontestable So that when he sat down he had performed that most difficult of all feats he had delivered what in a House of Commons sense was a practical statesmanlike speech and yet one which left his hearers in an excellent humour It was a great success an immense success A parliamentary triumph of almost the highest order Paul Lessingham had been coming on by leaps and bounds When he resumed his seat amidst applause which this time really was applause there were probably few who doubted that he was destined to go still farther How much farther it is true that time alone could tell but so far as appearances went all the prizes which are as the crown and climax of a statesman s career were well within his reach For my part I was delighted I had enjoyed an intellectual exercise a species of enjoyment not so common as it might be The Apostle had almost persuaded me that the political game was one worth playing and that its triumphs were things to be desired It is something after all to be able to appeal successfully to the passions and aspirations of your peers to gain their plaudits to prove your skill at the game you yourself have chosen to be looked up to and admired And when a woman s eyes look down on you and her ears drink in your every word and her heart beats time with yours each man to his own temperament but when that woman is the woman whom you love to know that your triumph means her glory and her gladness to me that would be the best part of it all In that hour the Apostle s hour I almost wished that I were a politician too The division was over The business of the night was practically done I was back again in the lobby The theme of conversation was the Apostle s speech on every side they talked of it Suddenly Marjorie was at my side Her face was glowing I never saw her look more beautiful or happier She seemed to be alone So you have come after all Wasn t it splendid wasn t it magnificent Isn t it grand to have such great gifts and to use them to such good purpose Speak Sydney Don t feign a coolness which is foreign to your nature I saw that she was hungry for me to praise the man whom she delighted to honour But somehow her enthusiasm cooled mine It was not a bad speech of a kind Of a kind How her eyes flashed fire With what disdain she treated me What do you mean by of a kind My dear Sydney are you not aware that it is an attribute of small minds to attempt to belittle those which are greater Even if you are conscious of inferiority it s unwise to show it mister Lessingham s was a great speech of any kind your incapacity to recognise the fact simply reveals your lack of the critical faculty It is fortunate for mister Lessingham that there is at least one person in whom the critical faculty is so bountifully developed Apparently in your judgment he who discriminates is lost I thought she was going to burst into passion But instead laughing she placed her hand upon my shoulder Poor Sydney I understand It is so sad Do you know you are like a little boy who when he is beaten declares that the victor has cheated him Never mind as you grow older you will learn better She stung me almost beyond bearing I cared not what I said You unless I am mistaken will learn better before you are older What do you mean Before I could have told her if I had meant to tell which I did not Lessingham came up I hope I have not kept you waiting I have been delayed longer than I expected Not at all though I am quite ready to get away it s a little tiresome waiting here This with a mischievous glance towards me a glance which compelled Lessingham to notice me You do not often favour us I don t I find better employment for my time You are wrong It s the cant of the day to underrate the House of Commons and the work which it performs don t you suffer yourself to join in the chorus of the simpletons Your time cannot be better employed than in endeavouring to improve the body politic I am obliged to you I hope you are feeling better than when I saw you last A gleam came into his eyes fading as quickly as it came He showed no other sign of comprehension surprise or resentment Thank you I am very well Marjorie perceived that I meant more than met the eye and that what I meant was meant unpleasantly Come let us be off It is mister Atherton to night who is not well She had just slipped her arm through Lessingham s when her father approached Old Lindon stared at her on the Apostle s arm as if he could hardly believe that it was she I thought that you were at the Duchess So I have been papa and now I m here Here Old Lindon began to stutter and stammer and to grow red in the face as is his wont when at all excited W what do you mean by here wh where s the carriage Where should it be except waiting for me outside unless the horses have run away I I I ll take you down to it I I don t approve of y your w w waiting in a place like this Thank you papa but mister Lessingham is going to take me down I shall see you afterwards Good bye Anything cooler than the way in which she walked off I do not think I ever saw This is the age of feminine advancement Young women think nothing of twisting their mothers round their fingers let alone their fathers but the fashion in which that young woman walked off on the Apostle s arm and left her father standing there was in its way a study Lindon seemed scarcely able to realise that the pair of them had gone Even after they had disappeared in the crowd he stood staring after them growing redder and redder till the veins stood out upon his face and I thought that an apoplectic seizure threatened Then with a gasp he turned to me Damned scoundrel I took it for granted that he alluded to the gentleman even though his following words hardly suggested it Only this morning I forbade her to have anything to do with him and n now he s w walked off with her C confounded adventurer That s what he is an adventurer and before many hours have passed I ll take the liberty to tell him so Jamming his fists into his pockets and puffing like a grampus in distress he took himself away and it was time he did for his words were as audible as they were pointed and already people were wondering what the matter was Woodville came up as Lindon was going just as sorely distressed as ever She went away with Lessingham did you see her Of course I saw her When a man makes a speech like Lessingham s any girl would go away with him and be proud to When you are endowed with such great powers as he is and use them for such lofty purposes she ll walk away with you but till then never He was at his old trick of polishing his eyeglass It s bitter hard When I knew that she was there I d half a mind to make a speech myself upon my word I had only I didn t know what to speak about and I can t speak anyhow how can a fellow speak when he s shoved into the gallery As you say how can he he can t stand on the railing and shout even with a friend holding him behind I know I shall speak one day bound to and then she won t be there It ll be better for you if she isn t Think so Perhaps you re right I d be safe to make a mess of it and then if she were to see me at it it d be the devil Pon my word I ve been wishing lately I was clever He rubbed his nose with the rim of his eyeglass looking the most comically disconsolate figure Put black care behind you Percy buck up my boy The division s over you are free now we ll go on the fly And we did go on the fly CHAPTER XVI ATHERTON S MAGIC VAPOUR I bore him off to supper at the Helicon All the way in the cab he was trying to tell me the story of how he proposed to Marjorie and he was very far from being through with it when we reached the club There was the usual crowd of supperites but we got a little table to ourselves in a corner of the room and before anything was brought for us to eat he was at it again A good many of the people were pretty near to shouting and as they seemed to be all speaking at once and the band was playing and as the Helicon supper band is not piano Percy did not have it quite all to himself but considering the delicacy of his subject he talked as loudly as was decent getting more so as he went on But Percy is peculiar I don t know how many times I ve tried to tell her over and over again Have you now Yes pretty near every time I met her but I never seemed to get quite to it don t you know How was that Why just as I was going to say Miss Lindon may I offer you the gift of my affection Was that how you invariably intended to begin Well not always one time like that another time another way Fact is I got off a little speech by heart but I never got a chance to reel it off so I made up my mind to just say anything And what did you say Well nothing you see I never got there Just as I was feeling my way she d ask me if I preferred big sleeves to little ones or top hats to billycocks or some nonsense of the kind Would she now Yes of course I had to answer and by the time I d answered the chance was lost Percy was polishing his eye glass I tried to get there so many times and she choked me off so often that I can t help thinking that she suspected what it was that I was after You think she did She must have done Once I followed her down Piccadilly and chivied her into a glove shop in the Burlington Arcade I meant to propose to her in there I hadn t had a wink of sleep all night through dreaming of her and I was just about desperate And did you propose The girl behind the counter made me buy a dozen pairs of gloves instead They turned out to be three sizes too large for me when they came home I believe she thought I d gone to spoon the glove girl she went out and left me there That girl loaded me with all sorts of things when she was gone I couldn t get away She held me with her blessed eye I believe it was a glass one Miss Linden s or the glove girl s The glove girl s She sent me home a whole cartload of green ties and declared I d ordered them I shall never forget that day I ve never been up the Arcade since and never mean to You gave Miss Lindon a wrong impression I don t know I was always giving her wrong impressions Once she said that she knew I was not a marrying man that I was the sort of chap who never would marry because she saw it in my face Under the circumstances that was trying Bitter hard Percy sighed again I shouldn t mind if I wasn t so gone I m not a fellow who does get gone but when I do get gone I get so beastly gone I tell you what Percy have a drink I m a teetotaler you know I am You talk of your heart being broken and of your being a teetotaler in the same breath if your heart were really broken you d throw teetotalism to the winds Do you think so why Because you would men whose hearts are broken always do you d swallow a magnum at the least Percy groaned When I drink I m always ill but I ll have a try He had a try making a good beginning by emptying at a draught the glass which the waiter had just now filled Then he relapsed into melancholy Tell me Percy honest Indian do you really love her Love her His eyes grew round as saucers Don t I tell you that I love her I know you tell me but that sort of thing is easy telling What does it make you feel like this love you talk so much about Feel like Just anyhow and nohow You should look inside me and then you d know I see It s like that is it Suppose she loved another man what sort of feeling would you feel towards him Does she love another man I say suppose I dare say she does I expect that s it What an idiot I am not to have thought of that before He sighed and refilled his glass He s a lucky chap whoever he is I d I d like to tell him so You d like to tell him so He s such a jolly lucky chap you know Possibly but his jolly good luck is your jolly bad luck Would you be willing to resign her to him without a word If she loves him But you say you love her Of course I do Well then You don t suppose that because I love her I shouldn t like to see her happy I m not such a beast I d sooner see her happy than anything else in all the world I see Even happy with another I m afraid that my philosophy is not like yours If I loved Miss Lindon and she loved say Jones I m afraid I shouldn t feel like that towards Jones at all What would you feel like Murder Percy you come home with me we ve begun the night together let s end it together and I ll show you one of the finest notions for committing murder on a scale of real magnificence you ever dreamed of I should like to make use of it to show my feelings towards the supposititious Jones he d know what I felt for him when once he had been introduced to it Percy went with me without a word He had not had much to drink but it had been too much for him and he was in a condition of maundering sentimentality I got him into a cab We dashed along Piccadilly He was silent and sat looking in front of him with an air of vacuous sullenness which ill became his cast of countenance I bade the cabman pass though Lowndes Square As we passed the Apostle s I pulled him up I pointed out the place to Woodville You see Percy that s Lessingham s house that s the house of the man who went away with Marjorie Yes Words came from him slowly with a quite unnecessary stress on each Because he made a speech I d like to make a speech One day I ll make a speech Because he made a speech only that and nothing more When a man speaks with an Apostle s tongue he can witch any woman in the land Hallo who s that Lessingham is that you I saw or thought I saw someone or something glide up the steps and withdraw into the shadow of the doorway as if unwilling to be seen When I hailed no one answered I called again Don t be shy my friend I sprang out of the cab ran across the pavement and up the steps To my surprise there was no one in the doorway It seemed incredible but the place was empty I felt about me with my hands as if I had been playing at blind man s buff and grasped at vacancy I came down a step or two Ostensibly there s a vacuum which nature abhors I say driver didn t you see someone come up the steps I thought I did sir I could have sworn I did So could I It s very odd Perhaps whoever it was has gone into the ouse sir I don t see how We should have heard the door open if we hadn t seen it and we should have seen it it s not so dark as that I ve half a mind to ring the bell and inquire I shouldn t do that if I was you sir you jump in and I ll get along This is mister Lessingham s the great mister Lessingham s I believe the cabman thought that I was drunk and not respectable enough to claim acquaintance with the great mister Lessingham Wake up Woodville Do you know I believe there s some mystery about this place I feel assured of it I feel as if I were in the presence of something uncanny something which I can neither see nor touch nor hear The cabman bent down from his seat wheedling me Jump in sir and we ll be getting along I jumped in and we got along but not far Before we had gone a dozen yards I was out again without troubling the driver to stop He pulled up aggrieved Well sir what s the matter now You ll be damaging yourself before you ve done and then you ll be blaming me I had caught sight of a cat crouching in the shadow of the railings a black one That cat was my quarry Either the creature was unusually sleepy or slow or stupid or it had lost its wits which a cat seldom does lose anyhow without making an attempt to escape it allowed me to grab it by the nape of the neck So soon as we were inside my laboratory I put the cat into my glass box Percy stared What have you put it there for That my dear Percy is what you are shortly about to see You are about to be the witness of an experiment which to a legislator such as you are ought to be of the greatest possible interest I am going to demonstrate on a small scale the action of the force which on a large scale I propose to employ on behalf of my native land He showed no signs of being interested Sinking into a chair he recommenced his wearisome reiteration I hate cats Do let it go I m always miserable when there s a cat in the room Nonsense that s your fancy What you want s a taste of whisky you ll be as chirpy as a cricket I don t want anything more to drink I ve had too much already I paid no heed to what he said I poured two stiff doses into a couple of tumblers Without seeming to be aware of what it was that he was doing he disposed of the better half of the one I gave him at a draught Putting his glass upon the table he dropped his head upon his hands and groaned What would Marjorie think of me if she saw me now Think nothing Why should she think of a man like you when she has so much better fish to fry I m feeling frightfully ill I ll be drunk before I ve done Then be drunk only for gracious sake be lively drunk not deadly doleful Cheer up Percy I clapped him on the shoulder almost knocking him off his seat on to the floor I am now going to show you that little experiment of which I was speaking You see that cat Of course I see it the beast I wish you d let it go Why should I let it go Do you know whose cat that is That cat s Paul Lessingham s Paul Lessingham s Yes Paul Lessingham s the man who made the speech the man whom Marjorie went away with How do you know it s his I don t know it is but I believe it is I choose to believe it is I intend to believe it is It was outside his house therefore it s his cat that s how I argue I can t get Lessingham inside that box so I get his cat instead Whatever for You shall see You observe how happy it is It don t seem happy We ve all our ways of seeming happy that s its way The creature was behaving like a cat gone mad dashing itself against the sides of its glass prison leaping to and fro and from side to side squealing with rage or with terror or with both Perhaps it foresaw what was coming there is no fathoming the intelligence of what we call the lower animals It s a funny way We some of us have funny ways beside cats Now attention Observe this little toy you ve seen something of its kind before It s a spring gun you pull the spring drop the charge into the barrel release the spring and the charge is fired I ll unlock this safe which is built into the wall It s a letter lock the combination just now is whisky you see that s a hint to you You ll notice the safe is strongly made it s air tight fire proof the outer casing is of triple plated drill proof steel the contents are valuable to me and devilish dangerous I d pity the thief who in his innocent ignorance broke in to steal Look inside you see it s full of balls glass balls each in its own little separate nest light as feathers transparent you can see right through them Here are a couple like tiny pills They contain neither dynamite nor cordite nor anything of the kind yet given a fair field and no favour they ll work more mischief than all the explosives man has fashioned Take hold of one you say your heart is broken squeeze this under your nose it wants but a gentle pressure and in less time than no time you ll be in the land where they say there are no broken hearts He shrunk back I don t know what you re talking about I don t want the thing Take it away Think twice the chance may not recur I tell you I don t want it Sure Consider Of course I m sure Then the cat shall have it Let the poor brute go The poor brute s going to the land which is so near and yet so far Once more if you please attention Notice what I do with this toy gun I pull back the spring I insert this small glass pellet I thrust the muzzle of the gun through the opening in the glass box which contains the Apostle s cat you ll observe it fits quite close which on the whole is perhaps as well for us I am about to release the spring Close attention please Notice the effect Atherton let the brute go The brute s gone I ve released the spring the pellet has been discharged it has struck against the roof of the glass box it has been broken by the contact and hey presto the cat lies dead and that in face of its nine lives You perceive how still it is how still Let s hope that now it s really happy The cat which I choose to believe is Paul Lessingham s has received its quietus in the morning I ll send it back to him with my respectful compliments He ll miss it if I don t Reflect think of a huge bomb filled with what we ll call Atherton s Magic Vapour fired say from a hundred and twenty ton gun bursting at a given elevation over the heads of an opposing force Properly managed in less than an instant of time a hundred thousand men quite possibly more would drop down dead as if smitten by the lightning of the skies Isn t that something like a weapon sir I m not well I want to get away I wish I d never come That was all Woodville had to say Rubbish You re adding to your stock of information every second and in these days when a member of Parliament is supposed to know all about everything information s the one thing wanted Empty your glass man that s the time of day for you I handed him his tumbler He drained what was left of its contents then in a fit of tipsy childish temper he flung the tumbler from him I had placed carelessly enough the second pellet within a foot of the edge of the table The shock of the heavy beaker striking the board close to it set it rolling I was at the other side I started forward to stop its motion but I was too late Before I could reach the crystal globule it had fallen off the edge of the table on to the floor at Woodville s feet and smashed in falling As it smashed he was looking down wondering no doubt in his stupidity what the pother was about for I was shouting and making something of a clatter in my efforts to prevent the catastrophe which I saw was coming On the instant as the vapour secreted in the broken pellet gained access to the air he fell forward on to his face Rushing to him I snatched his senseless body from the ground and dragged it staggeringly towards the door which opened on to the yard Flinging the door open I got him into the open air As I did so I found myself confronted by someone who stood outside It was Lessingham s mysterious Egypto Arabian friend my morning s visitor CHAPTER XVII MAGIC OR MIRACLE The passage into the yard from the electrically lit laboratory was a passage from brilliancy to gloom The shrouded figure standing in the shadow was like some object in a dream My own senses reeled It was only because I had resolutely held my breath and kept my face averted that I had not succumbed to the fate which had overtaken Woodville Had I been a moment longer in gaining the open air it would have been too late As it was in placing Woodville on the ground I stumbled over him My senses left me Even as they went I was conscious of exclaiming remembering the saying about the engineer being hoist by his own petard Atherton s Magic Vapour My sensations on returning to consciousness were curious I found myself being supported in someone s arms a stranger s face was bending over me and the most extraordinary pair of eyes I had ever seen were looking into mine Who the deuce are you I asked Then understanding that it was my uninvited visitor with scant ceremony I drew myself away from him By the light which was streaming through the laboratory door I saw that Woodville was lying close beside me stark and still Is he dead I cried Percy speak man it s not so bad with you as that But it was pretty bad so bad that as I bent down and looked at him my heart beat uncomfortably fast lest it was as bad as it could be His heart seemed still the vapour took effect directly on the cardiac centres To revive their action and that instantly was indispensable Yet my brain was in such a whirl that I could not even think of how to set about beginning Had I been alone it is more than probable Woodville would have died As I stared at him senselessly aimlessly the stranger passing his arms beneath his body extended himself at full length upon his motionless form Putting his lips to Percy s he seemed to be pumping life from his own body into the unconscious man s As I gazed bewildered surprised presently there came a movement of Percy s body His limbs twitched as if he was in pain By degrees the motions became convulsive till on a sudden he bestirred himself to such effect that the stranger was rolled right off him I bent down to find that the young gentleman s condition still seemed very far from satisfactory There was a rigidity about the muscles of his face a clamminess about his skin a disagreeable suggestiveness about the way in which his teeth and the whites of his eyes were exposed which was uncomfortable to contemplate The stranger must have seen what was passing through my mind not a very difficult thing to see Pointing to the recumbent Percy he said with that queer foreign twang of his which whatever it had seemed like in the morning sounded musical enough just then All will be well with him I am not so sure The stranger did not deign to answer He was kneeling on one side of the victim of modern science I on the other Passing his hand to and fro in front of the unconscious countenance as if by magic all semblance of discomfort vanished from Percy s features and to all appearances he was placidly asleep Have you hypnotised him What does it matter If it was a case of hypnotism it was very neatly done The conditions were both unusual and trying the effect produced seemed all that could be desired the change brought about in half a dozen seconds was quite remarkable I began to be aware of a feeling of quasi respect for Paul Lessingham s friend His morals might be peculiar and manners he might have none but in this case at any rate the end seemed to have justified the means He went on He sleeps When he awakes he will remember nothing that has been Leave him the night is warm all will be well As he said the night was warm and it was dry Percy would come to little harm by being allowed to enjoy for a while the pleasant breezes So I acted on the stranger s advice and left him lying in the yard while I had a little interview with the impromptu physician CHAPTER XVIII THE APOTHEOSIS OF THE BEETLE The laboratory door was closed The stranger was standing a foot or two away from it I was further within the room and was subjecting him to as keen a scrutiny as circumstances permitted Beyond doubt he was conscious of my observation yet he bore himself with an air of indifference which was suggestive of perfect unconcern The fellow was oriental to the finger tips that much was certain yet in spite of a pretty wide personal knowledge of oriental people I could not make up my mind as to the exact part of the east from which he came He was hardly an Arab he was not a fellah he was not unless I erred a Mohammedan at all There was something about him which was distinctly not Mussulmanic So far as looks were concerned he was not a flattering example of his race whatever his race might be The portentous size of his beak like nose would have been in itself sufficient to damn him in any court of beauty His lips were thick and shapeless and this joined to another peculiarity in his appearance seemed to suggest that in his veins there ran more than a streak of negro blood The peculiarity alluded to was his semblance of great age As one eyed him one was reminded of the legends told of people who have been supposed to have retained something of their pristine vigour after having lived for centuries As however one continued to gaze one began to wonder if he really was so old as he seemed if indeed he was exceptionally old at all Negroes and especially negresses are apt to age with extreme rapidity Among coloured folk one sometimes encounters women whose faces seem to have been lined by the passage of centuries yet whose actual tale of years would entitle them to regard themselves here in England as in the prime of life The senility of the fellow s countenance besides was contradicted by the juvenescence of his eyes No really old man could have had eyes like that They were curiously shaped reminding me of the elongated faceted eyes of some queer creature with whose appearance I was familiar although I could not at the instant recall its name They glowed not only with the force and fire but also with the frenzy of youth More uncanny looking eyes I had never encountered their possessor could not be in any sense of the word a clubable person Owing probably to some peculiar formation of the optic nerve one felt as one met his gaze that he was looking right through you More obvious danger signals never yet were placed in a creature s head The individual who having once caught sight of him still sought to cultivate their owner s acquaintance had only himself to thank if the very worst results of frequenting evil company promptly ensued It happens that I am myself endowed with an unusual tenacity of vision I could for instance easily outstare any man I ever met Yet as I continued to stare at this man I was conscious that it was only by an effort of will that I was able to resist a baleful something which seemed to be passing from his eyes to mine It might have been imagination but in that sense I am not an imaginative man and if it was it was imagination of an unpleasantly vivid kind I could understand how in the case of a nervous or a sensitive temperament the fellow might exercise by means of the peculiar quality of his glance alone an influence of a most disastrous sort which given an appropriate subject in the manifestation of its power might approach almost to the supernatural If ever man was endowed with the traditional evil eye in which Italians among modern nations are such profound believers it was he When we had stared at each other for I daresay quite five minutes I began to think I had had about enough of it So by way of breaking the ice I put to him a question May I ask how you found your way into my back yard He did not reply in words but raising his hands he lowered them palms downward with a gesture which was peculiarly oriental Indeed Is that so Your meaning may be lucidity itself to you but for my benefit perhaps you would not mind translating it into words Once more I ask how did you find your way into my back yard Again nothing but the gesture Possibly you are not sufficiently acquainted with English manners and customs to be aware that you have placed yourself within reach of the pains and penalties of the law Were I to call in the police you would find yourself in an awkward situation and unless you are presently more explanatory called in they will be By way of answer he indulged in a distortion of the countenance which might have been meant for a smile and which seemed to suggest that he regarded the police with a contempt which was too great for words Why do you laugh do you think that being threatened with the police is a joke You are not likely to find it so Have you suddenly been bereft of the use of your tongue He proved that he had not by using it I have still the use of my tongue That at least is something Perhaps since the subject of how you got into my back yard seems to be a delicate one you will tell me why you got there You know why I have come Pardon me if I appear to flatly contradict you but that is precisely what I do not know You do know Do I Then in that case I presume that you are here for the reason which appears upon the surface to commit a felony You call me thief What else are you I am no thief You know why I have come He raised his head a little A look came into his eyes which I felt that I ought to understand yet to the meaning of which I seemed for the instant to have mislaid the key I shrugged my shoulders I have come because you wanted me Because I wanted you On my word That s sublime All night you have wanted me do I not know When she talked to you of him and the blood boiled in your veins when he spoke and all the people listened and you hated him because he had honour in her eyes I was startled Either he meant what it appeared incredible that he could mean or there was confusion somewhere Take my advice my friend and don t try to come the bunco steerer over me I m a bit in that line myself you know This time the score was mine he was puzzled I know not what you talk of In that case we re equal I know not what you talk of either His manner for him was childlike and bland What is it you do not know This morning did I not say if you want me then I come I fancy I have some faint recollection of your being so good as to say something of the kind but where s the application Do you not feel for him the same as I Who s the him Paul Lessingham It was spoken quietly but with a degree of to put it gently spitefulness which showed that at least the will to do the Apostle harm would not be lacking And pray what is the common feeling which we have for him Hate Plainly with this gentleman hate meant hate in the solid oriental sense I should hardly have been surprised if the mere utterance of the words had seared his lips I am by no means prepared to admit that I have this feeling which you attribute to me but even granting that I have what then Those who hate are kin That also I should be slow to admit but to go a step farther what has all this to do with your presence on my premises at this hour of the night You love her This time I did not ask him to supply the name being unwilling that it should be soiled by the traffic of his lips She loves him that is not well If you choose she shall love you that will be well Indeed And pray how is this consummation which is so devoutly to be desired to be brought about Put your hand into mine Say that you wish it It shall be done Moving a step forward he stretched out his hand towards me I hesitated There was that in the fellow s manner which for the moment had for me an unwholesome fascination Memories flashed through my mind of stupid stories which have been told of compacts made with the devil I almost felt as if I was standing in the actual presence of one of the powers of evil I thought of my love for Marjorie which had revealed itself after all these years of the delight of holding her in my arms of feeling the pressure of her lips to mine As my gaze met his the lower side of what the conquest of this fair lady would mean burned in my brain fierce imaginings blazed before my eyes To win her only to win her What nonsense he was talking What empty brag it was Suppose just for the sake of the joke I did put my hand in his and did wish right out what it was plain he knew If I wished what harm would it do It would be the purest jest Out of his own mouth he would be confounded for it was certain that nothing would come of it Why should I not do it then I would act on his suggestion I would carry the thing right through Already I was advancing towards him when I stopped I don t know why On the instant my thoughts went off at a tangent What sort of a blackguard did I call myself that I should take a woman s name in vain for the sake of playing fool s tricks with such scum of the earth as the hideous vagabond in front of me and that the name of the woman whom I loved Rage took hold of me You hound I cried In my sudden passage from one mood to another I was filled with the desire to shake the life half out of him But so soon as I moved a step in his direction intending war instead of peace he altered the position of his hand holding it out towards me as if forbidding my approach Directly he did so quite involuntarily I pulled up dead as if my progress had been stayed by bars of iron and walls of steel For the moment I was astonished to the verge of stupefaction The sensation was peculiar I was as incapable of advancing another inch in his direction as if I had lost the use of my limbs I was even incapable of attempting to attempt to advance At first I could only stare and gape Presently I began to have an inkling of what had happened The scoundrel had almost succeeded in hypnotising me That was a nice thing to happen to a man of my sort at my time of life A shiver went down my back what might have occurred if I had not pulled up in time What pranks might a creature of that character not have been disposed to play It was the old story of the peril of playing with edged tools I had made the dangerous mistake of underrating the enemy s strength Evidently in his own line the fellow was altogether something out of the usual way I believe that even as it was he thought he had me As I turned away and leaned against the table at my back I fancy that he shivered as if this proof of my being still my own master was unexpected I was silent it took some seconds to enable me to recover from the shock of the discovery of the peril in which I had been standing Then I resolved that I would endeavour to do something which should make me equal to this gentleman of many talents Take my advice my friend and don t attempt to play that hankey pankey off on to me again I don t know what you talk of Don t lie to me or I ll burn you into ashes Behind me was an electrical machine giving an eighteen inch spark It was set in motion by a lever fitted into the table which I could easily reach from where I sat As I spoke the visitor was treated to a little exhibition of electricity The change in his bearing was amusing He shook with terror He salaamed down to the ground My lord my lord have mercy oh my lord Then you be careful that s all You may suppose yourself to be something of a magician but it happens unfortunately for you that I can do a bit in that line myself perhaps I m a trifle better at the game than you are Especially as you have ventured into my stronghold which contains magic enough to make a show of a hundred thousand such as you Taking down a bottle from a shelf I sprinkled a drop or two of its contents on the floor Immediately flames arose accompanied by a blinding vapour It was a sufficiently simple illustration of one of the qualities of phosphorous bromide but its effect upon my visitor was as startling as it was unexpected If I could believe the evidence of my own eyesight in the very act of giving utterance to a scream of terror he disappeared how or why or whither there was nothing to show in his place where he had been standing there seemed to be a dim object of some sort in a state of frenzied agitation on the floor The phosphorescent vapour was confusing the lights appeared to be suddenly burning low before I had sense enough to go and see if there was anything there and if so what the flames had vanished the man himself had reappeared and prostrated on his knees was salaaming in a condition of abject terror My lord my lord he whined I entreat you my lord to use me as your slave I ll use you as my slave Whether he or I was the more agitated it would have been difficult to say but at least it would not have done to betray my feelings as he did his Stand up He stood up I eyed him as he did with an interest which so far as I was concerned was of a distinctly new and original sort Whether or not I had been the victim of an ocular delusion I could not be sure It was incredible to suppose that he could have disappeared as he had seemed to disappear it was also incredible that I could have imagined his disappearance If the thing had been a trick I had not the faintest notion how it had been worked and if it was not a trick then what was it Was it something new in scientific marvels Could he give me as much instruction in the qualities of unknown forces as I could him In the meanwhile he stood in an attitude of complete submission with downcast eyes and hands crossed upon his breast I started to cross examine him I am going to ask you some questions So long as you answer them promptly truthfully you will be safe Otherwise you had best beware Ask oh my lord What is the nature of your objection to mister Lessingham Revenge What has he done to you that you should wish to be revenged on him It is the feud of the innocent blood What do you mean by that On his hands is the blood of my kin It cries aloud for vengeance Who has he killed That my lord is for me and for him I see Am I to understand that you do not choose to answer me and that I am again to use my magic I saw that he quivered My lord he has spilled the blood of her who has lain upon his breast I hesitated What he meant appeared clear enough Perhaps it would be as well not to press for further details The words pointed to what it might be courteous to call an Eastern Romance though it was hard to conceive of the Apostle figuring as the hero of such a theme It was the old tale retold that to the life of every man there is a background that it is precisely in the unlikeliest cases that the background s darkest What would that penny plain and twopence coloured bogey the Nonconformist Conscience make of such a story if it were blazoned through the land Would Paul not come down with a run Spilling blood is a figure of speech pretty perhaps but vague If you mean that mister Lessingham has been killing someone your surest and most effectual revenge would be gained by an appeal to the law What has the Englishman s law to do with me If you can prove that he has been guilty of murder it would have a great deal to do with you I assure you that at any rate in that sense the Englishman s law is no respecter of persons Show him to be guilty and it would hang Paul Lessingham as indifferently and as cheerfully as it would hang Bill Brown Is that so It is so as if you choose you will be easily able to prove to your own entire satisfaction He had raised his head and was looking at something which he seemed to see in front of him with a maleficent glare in his sensitive eyes which it was not nice to see He would be shamed Indeed he would be shamed Before all men Before all men and I take it before all women too And he would hang If shown to have been guilty of wilful murder yes His hideous face was lighted up by a sort of diabolical exultation which made it if that were possible more hideous still I had apparently given him a wrinkle which pleased him most consummately Perhaps I will do that in the end in the end He opened his eyes to their widest limits then shut them tight as if to gloat on the picture which his fancy painted Then reopened them In the meantime I will have vengeance in my own fashion He knows already that the avenger is upon him he has good reason to know it And through the days and the nights the knowledge shall be with him still and it shall be to him as the bitterness of death aye of many deaths For he will know that escape there is none and that for him there shall be no more sun in the sky and that the terror shall be with him by night and by day at his rising up and at his lying down wherever his eyes shall turn it shall be there yet behold the sap and the juice of my vengeance is in this in that though he shall be very sure that the days that are are as the days of his death yet shall he know that THE DEATH THE GREAT DEATH is coming coming and shall be on him when I will The fellow spoke like an inspired maniac If he meant half what he said and if he did not then his looks and his tones belied him then a promising future bade fair to be in store for mister Lessingham and also circumstances being as they were for Marjorie It was this latter reflection which gave me pause Either this imprecatory fanatic would have to be disposed of by Lessingham himself or by someone acting on his behalf and so far as their power of doing mischief went his big words proved empty windbags or Marjorie would have to be warned that there was at least one passage in her suitor s life into which ere it was too late it was advisable that inquiry should be made To allow Marjorie to irrevocably link her fate with the Apostle s without being first of all made aware that he was to all intents and purposes a haunted man that was not to be thought of You employ large phrases My words cooled the other s heated blood Once more his eyes were cast down his hands crossed upon his breast I crave my lord s pardon My wound is ever new By the way what was the secret history this morning of that little incident of the cockroach He glanced up quickly Cockroach I know not what you say Well was it beetle then Beetle He seemed all at once to have lost his voice the word was gasped After you went we found upon a sheet of paper a capitally executed drawing of a beetle which I fancy you must have left behind you Scaraboeus sacer wasn t it I know not what you talk of Its discovery seemed to have quite a singular effect on mister Lessingham Now why was that I know nothing Oh yes you do and before you go I mean to know something too The man was trembling looking this way and that showing signs of marked discomfiture That there was something about that ancient scarab which figures so largely in the still unravelled tangles of the Egyptian mythologies and the effect which the mere sight of its cartouch for the drawing had resembled something of the kind had had on such a seasoned vessel as Paul Lessingham which might be well worth my finding out I felt convinced the man s demeanour on my recurring to the matter told its own plain tale I made up my mind if possible to probe the business to the bottom then and there Listen to me my friend I am a plain man and I use plain speech it s a kind of hobby I have You will give me the information I require and that at once or I will pit my magic against yours in which case I think it extremely probable that you will come off worst from the encounter I reached out for the lever and the exhibition of electricity recommenced Immediately his tremors were redoubled My lord I know not of what you talk None of your lies for me Tell me why at the sight of the thing on that sheet of paper Paul Lessingham went green and yellow Ask him my lord Probably later on that is what I shall do In the meantime I am asking you Answer or look out for squalls The electrical exhibition was going on He was glaring at it as if he wished that it would stop As if ashamed of his cowardice plainly on a sudden he made a desperate effort to get the better of his fears and succeeded better than I had expected or desired He drew himself up with what in him amounted to an air of dignity I am a child of Isis It struck me that he made this remark not so much to impress me as with a view of elevating his own low spirits Are you Then in that case I regret that I am unable to congratulate the lady on her offspring When I said that a ring came into his voice which I had not heard before Silence You know not of what you speak I warn you as I warned Paul Lessingham be careful not to go too far Be not like him heed my warning What is it I am being warned against the beetle Yes the beetle Were I upon oath and this statement being made in the presence of witnesses say in a solicitor s office I standing in fear of pains and penalties I think that at this point I should leave the paper blank No man likes to own himself a fool or that he ever was a fool and ever since I have been wondering whether on that occasion that child of Isis did or did not play the fool with me His performance was realistic enough at the time heaven knows But as it gets farther and farther away I ask myself more and more confidently as time effluxes whether after all it was not clever juggling superhumanly clever juggling if you will that and nothing more If it was something more then with a vengeance there is more in heaven and earth than is dreamed of in our philosophy The mere possibility opens vistas which the sane mind fears to contemplate Since then I am not on oath and should I fall short of verbal accuracy I do not need to fear the engines of the law what seemed to happen was this He was standing within about ten feet of where I leaned against the edge of the table The light was full on so that it was difficult to suppose that I could make a mistake as to what took place in front of me As he replied to my mocking allusion to the beetle by echoing my own words he vanished or rather I saw him taking a different shape before my eyes His loose draperies all fell off him and as they were in the very act of falling there issued or there seemed to issue out of them a monstrous creature of the beetle type the man himself was gone On the point of size I wish to make myself clear My impression when I saw it first was that it was as large as the man had been and that it was in some way standing up on end the legs towards me But the moment it came in view it began to dwindle and that so rapidly that in a couple of seconds at most a little heap of drapery was lying on the floor on which was a truly astonishing example of the coleoptera It appeared to be a beetle It was perhaps six or seven inches high and about a foot in length Its scales were of a vivid golden green I could distinctly see where the wings were sheathed along the back and as they seemed to be slightly agitated I looked every moment to see them opened and the thing take wing I was so astonished as who would not have been that for an appreciable space of time I was practically in a state of stupefaction I could do nothing but stare I was acquainted with the legendary transmigrations of Isis and with the story of the beetle which issues from the woman s womb through all eternity and with the other pretty tales but this of which I was an actual spectator was something new even in legends If the man with whom I had just been speaking was gone where had he gone to If this glittering creature was there in his stead whence had it come I do protest this much that after the first shock of surprise had passed I retained my presence of mind I felt as an investigator might feel who has stumbled haphazard on some astounding some epoch making discovery I was conscious that I should have to make the best use of my mental faculties if I was to take full advantage of so astonishing an accident I kept my glance riveted on the creature with the idea of photographing it on my brain I believe that if it were possible to take a retinal print which it someday will be you would have a perfect picture of what it was I saw Beyond doubt it was a lamellicorn one of the copridae With the one exception of its monstrous size there were the characteristics in plain view the convex body the large head the projecting clypeus More its smooth head and throat seemed to suggest that it was a female Equally beyond a doubt apart from its size there were unusual features present too The eyes were not only unwontedly conspicuous they gleamed as if they were lighted by internal flames in some indescribable fashion they reminded me of my vanished visitor The colouring was superb and the creature appeared to have the chameleon like faculty of lightening and darkening the shades at will Its not least curious feature was its restlessness It was in a state of continual agitation and as if it resented my inspection the more I looked at it the more its agitation grew As I have said I expected every moment to see it take wing and circle through the air All the while I was casting about in my mind as to what means I could use to effect its capture I did think of killing it and on the whole I rather wish that I had at any rate attempted slaughter there were dozens of things lying ready to my hand any one of which would have severely tried its constitution but on the spur of the moment the only method of taking it alive which occurred to me was to pop over it a big tin canister which had contained soda lime This canister was on the floor to my left I moved towards it as nonchalantly as I could keeping an eye on that shining wonder all the time Directly I moved its agitation perceptibly increased it was so to speak all one whirr of tremblement it scintillated as if its coloured scales had been so many prisms it began to unsheath its wings as if it had finally decided that it would make use of them Picking up the tin disembarrassing it of its lid I sprang towards my intended victim Its wings opened wide obviously it was about to rise but it was too late Before it had cleared the ground the tin was over it It remained over it however for an instant only I had stumbled in my haste and in my effort to save myself from falling face foremost on to the floor I was compelled to remove my hands from the tin Before I was able to replace them the tin was sent flying and while I was still partially recumbent within eighteen inches of me that beetle swelled and swelled until it had assumed its former portentous dimensions when as it seemed it was enveloped by a human shape and in less time than no time there stood in front of me naked from top to toe my truly versatile oriental friend One startling fact nudity revealed that I had been egregiously mistaken on the question of sex My visitor was not a man but a woman and judging from the brief glimpse which I had of her body by no means old or ill shaped either If that transformation was not a bewildering one then two and two make five The most level headed scientist would temporarily have lost his mental equipoise on witnessing such a quick change as that within a span or two of his own nose I was not only witless I was breathless too I could only gape And while I gaped the woman stooping down picking up her draperies began to huddle them on her anyhow and also to skeddadle towards the door which led into the yard When I observed this last manoeuvre to some extent I did rise to the requirements of the situation Leaping up I rushed to stay her flight Stop I shouted But she was too quick for me Ere I could reach her she had opened the door and was through it and what was more she had slammed it in my face In my excitement I did some fumbling with the handle When in my turn I was in the yard she was out of sight I did fancy I saw a dim form disappearing over the wall at the further side and I made for it as fast as I knew how I clambered on to the wall looking this way and that but there was nothing and no one to be seen I listened for the sound of retreating footsteps but all was still Apparently I had the entire neighbourhood to my own sweet self My visitor had vanished Time devoted to pursuit I felt would be time ill spent As I returned across the yard Woodville who still was taking his rest under the open canopy of heaven sat up Seemingly my approach had roused him out of slumber At sight of me he rubbed his eyes and yawned and blinked I say he remarked not at all unreasonably where am I You re on holy or on haunted ground hang me if I quite know which but that s where you are my boy By Jove I am feeling queer I have got a headache don t you know I shouldn t be in the least surprised at anything you have or haven t I m beyond surprise It s a drop of whisky you are wanting and what I m wanting too only for goodness sake drop me none of your drops Mine is a case for a bottle at the least I put my arm through his and went with him into the laboratory And when we were in I shut and locked and barred the door CHAPTER XIX THE LADY RAGES Dora Grayling stood in the doorway I told your servant he need not trouble to show me in and I ve come without my aunt I hope I m not intruding She was confoundedly and it was on the tip of my tongue to tell her so She came into the room with twinkling eyes looking radiantly happy that sort of look which makes even a plain young woman prepossessing Am I intruding I believe I am She held out her hand while she was still a dozen feet away and when I did not at once dash forward to make a clutch at it she shook her head and made a little mouth at me
2769_176256_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 What s the matter with you 
none	none	Aren t you well I was not well I was very far from well I was as unwell as I could be without being positively ill and any person of common discernment would have perceived it at a glance At the same time I was not going to admit anything of the kind to her Thank you I am perfectly well Then if I were you I would endeavour to become imperfectly well a little imperfection in that direction might make you appear to more advantage I am afraid that that I am not one of those persons who ever do appear to much advantage did I not tell you so last night I believe you did say something of the kind it s very good of you to remember Have you forgotten something else which you said to me last night You can hardly expect me to keep fresh in my memory all the follies of which my tongue is guilty Thank you That is quite enough Good day She turned as if to go Miss Grayling mister Atherton What s the matter What have I been saying now Last night you invited me to come and see you this morning is that one of the follies of which your tongue was guilty The engagement had escaped my recollection it is a fact and my face betrayed me You had forgotten Her cheeks flamed her eyes sparkled You must pardon my stupidity for not having understood that the imitation was of that general kind which is never meant to be acted on She was half way to the door before I stopped her I had to take her by the shoulder to do it Miss Grayling You are hard on me I suppose I am Is anything harder than to be intruded on by an undesired and unexpected guest Now you are harder still If you knew what I have gone through since our conversation of last night in your strength you would be merciful Indeed What have you gone through I hesitated What I actually had gone through I certainly did not propose to tell her Other reasons apart I did not desire to seem madder than I admittedly am and I lacked sufficient plausibility to enable me to concoct on the spur of the moment a plain tale of the doings of my midnight visitor which would have suggested that the narrator was perfectly sane So I fenced or tried to For one thing I have had no sleep I had not not one single wink When I did get between the sheets all night I lay in agony I suffered from that worst form of nightmare the nightmare of the man who is wide awake There was continually before my fevered eyes the strange figure of that Nameless Thing I had often smiled at tales of haunted folk here was I one of them My feelings were not rendered more agreeable by a strengthening conviction that if I had only retained the normal attitude of a scientific observer I should in all probability have solved the mystery of my oriental friend and that his example of the genus of copridae might have been pinned by a very large pin on a piece a monstrous piece of cork It was galling to reflect that he and I had played together a game of bluff a game at which civilisation was once more proved to be a failure She could not have seen all this in my face but she saw something because her own look softened You do look tired She seemed to be casting about in her own mind for a cause You have been worrying She glanced round the big laboratory Have you been spending the night in this wizard s cave Pretty well Oh The monosyllable as she uttered it was big with meaning Uninvited she seated herself in an arm chair a huge old thing of shagreen leather which would have held half a dozen of her Demure in it she looked like an agreeable reminiscence alive and a little up to date of the women of long ago Her dove grey eyes seemed to perceive so much more than they cared to show How is it that you have forgotten that you asked me to come didn t you mean it Of course I meant it Then how is it you ve forgotten I didn t forget Don t tell fibs Something is the matter tell me what it is Is it that I am too early Nothing of the sort you couldn t be too early Thank you When you pay a compliment even so neat an one as that sometimes you should look as if you meant it It is early I know it s early but afterwards I want you to come to lunch I told aunt that I would bring you back with me You are much better to me than I deserve Perhaps A tone came into her voice which was almost pathetic I think that to some men women are almost better than they deserve I don t know why I suppose it pleases them It is odd There was a different intonation a dryness Have you forgotten what I came for Not a bit of it I am not quite the brute I seem You came to see an illustration of that pleasant little fancy of mine for slaughtering my fellows The fact is I m hardly in a mood for that just now I ve been illustrating it too much already What do you mean Well for one thing it s been murdering Lessingham s cat mister Lessingham s cat Then it almost murdered Percy Woodville mister Atherton I wish you wouldn t talk like that It s a fact It was a question of a little matter in a wrong place and if it hadn t been for something very like a miracle he d be dead I wish you wouldn t have anything to do with such things I hate them I stared Hate them I thought you d come to see an illustration And pray what was your notion of an illustration Well another cat would have had to be killed at least And do you suppose that I would have sat still while a cat was being killed for my edification It needn t necessarily have been a cat but something would have had to be killed how are you going to illustrate the death dealing propensities of a weapon of that sort without it Is it possible that you imagine that I came here to see something killed Then for what did you come I do not know what there was about the question which was startling but as soon as it was out she went a fiery red Because I was a fool I was bewildered Either she had got out of the wrong side of bed or I had or we both had Here she was assailing me hammer and tongs so far as I could see for absolutely nothing You are pleased to be satirical at my expense I should not dare Your detection of me would be so painfully rapid I was in no mood for jangling I turned a little away from her Immediately she was at my elbow mister Atherton Miss Grayling Are you cross with me Why should I be If it pleases you to laugh at my stupidity you are completely justified But you are not stupid No Nor you satirical You are not stupid you know you are not stupid it was only stupidity on my part to pretend that you were It is very good of you to say so But I fear that I am an indifferent host Although you would not care for an illustration there may be other things which you might find amusing Why do you keep on snubbing me I keep on snubbing you You are always snubbing me you know you are Some times I feel as if I hated you Miss Grayling I do I do I do After all it is only natural That is how you talk as if I were a child and you were oh I don t know what Well mister Atherton I am sorry to be obliged to leave you I have enjoyed my visit very much I only hope I have not seemed too intrusive She flounced flounce was the only appropriate word out of the room before I could stop her I caught her in the passage Miss Grayling I entreat you Pray do not entreat me mister Atherton Standing still she turned to me I would rather show myself to the door as I showed myself in but if that is impossible might I ask you not to speak to me between this and the street The hint was broad enough even for me I escorted her through the hall without a word in perfect silence she shook the dust of my abode from off her feet I had made a pretty mess of things I felt it as I stood on the top of the steps and watched her going she was walking off at four miles an hour I had not even ventured to ask to be allowed to call a hansom It was beginning to occur to me that this was a case in which another blow upon the river might be to say the least of it advisable and I was just returning into the house with the intention of putting myself into my flannels when a cab drew up and old Lindon got out of it CHAPTER XX A HEAVY FATHER mister Lindon was excited there is no mistaking it when he is because with him excitement means perspiration and as soon as he was out of the cab he took off his hat and began to wipe the lining Atherton I want to speak to you most particularly somewhere in private I took him into my laboratory It is my rule to take no one there it is a workshop not a playroom the place is private but recently my rules had become dead letters Directly he was inside Lindon began puffing and stewing wiping his forehead throwing out his chest as if he were oppressed by a sense of his own importance Then he started off talking at the top of his voice and it is not a low one either Atherton I I ve always looked on you as a a kind of a son That s very kind of you I ve always regarded you as a a level headed fellow a man from whom sound advice can be obtained when sound advice is is most to be desired That also is very kind of you And therefore I make no apology for coming to you at at what may be regarded as a a strictly domestic crisis at a moment in the history of the Lindons when delicacy and common sense are are essentially required This time I contented myself with nodding Already I perceived what was coming somehow when I am with a man I feel so much more clear headed than I do when I am with a woman realise so much better the nature of the ground on which I am standing What do you know of this man Lessingham I knew it was coming What all the world knows And what does all the world know of him I ask you that A flashy plausible shallow pated carpet bagger that is what all the world knows of him The man s a political adventurer he snatches a precarious and criminal notoriety by trading on the follies of his fellow countrymen He is devoid of decency destitute of principle and impervious to all the feelings of a gentleman What do you know of him besides this I am not prepared to admit that I do know that Oh yes you do don t talk nonsense you choose to screen the fellow I say what I mean I always have said and I always shall say What do you know of him outside politics of his family of his private life Well not very much Of course you don t nor does anybody else The man s a mushroom or a toadstool rather sprung up in the course of a single night apparently out of some dirty ditch Why sir not only is he without ordinary intelligence he is even without a Brummagen substitute for manners He had worked himself into a state of heat in which his countenance presented a not too agreeable assortment of scarlets and purples He flung himself into a chair threw his coat wide open and his arms too and started off again The family of the Lindons is at this moment represented by a a young woman by my daughter sir She represents me and it s her duty to represent me adequately adequately sir And what s more between ourselves sir it s her duty to marry My property s my own and I wouldn t have it pass to either of my confounded brothers on any account They re next door to fools and and they don t represent me in any possible sense of the word My daughter sir can marry whom she pleases whom she pleases There s no one in England peer or commoner who would not esteem it an honour to have her for his wife I ve told her so yes sir I ve told her though you you d think that she of all people in the world wouldn t require telling Yet what do you think she does She she actually carries on what I I can t help calling a a compromising acquaintance with this man Lessingham No But I say yes and I wish to heaven I didn t I I ve warned her against the scoundrel more than once I I ve told her to cut him dead And yet as as you saw yourself last night in in the face of the assembled House of Commons after that twaddling clap trap speech of his in which there was not one sound sentiment nor an idea which which would hold water she positively went away with him in in the most ostentatious and and disgraceful fashion on on his arm and and actually snubbed her father It is monstrous that a parent a father should be subjected to such treatment by his child The poor old boy polished his brow with his pocket handkerchief When I got home I I told her what I thought of her I promise you that and I told her what I thought of him I didn t mince my words with her There are occasions when plain speaking is demanded and that was one I positively forbade her to speak to the fellow again or to recognise him if she met him in the street I pointed out to her with perfect candour that the fellow was an infernal scoundrel that and nothing else and that he would bring disgrace on whoever came into contact with him even with the end of a barge pole And what do you think she said She promised to obey you I make no doubt Did she sir By gad did she That shows how much you know her She said and by gad by her manner and and the way she went on you d you d have thought that she was the parent and I was the child she said that I I grieved her that she was disappointed in me that times have changed yes sir she said that times have changed that nowadays parents weren t Russian autocrats no sir not Russian autocrats that that she was sorry she couldn t oblige me yes sir that was how she put it she was sorry she couldn t oblige me but it was altogether out of the question to suppose that she could put a period to a friendship which she valued simply on account of of my unreasonable prejudices and and and in short she she told me to go the devil sir And did you I was on the point of asking him if he went but I checked myself in time Let us look at the matter as men of the world What do you know against Lessingham apart from his politics That s just it I know nothing In a sense isn t that in his favour I don t see how you make that out I I don t mind telling you that I I ve had inquiries made He s not been in the House six years this is his second Parliament he s jumped up like a Jack in the box His first constituency was Harwich they ve got him still and much good may he do em but how he came to stand for the place or who or what or where he was before he stood for the place no one seems to have the faintest notion Hasn t he been a great traveller I never heard of it Not in the East Has he told you so No I was only wondering Well it seems to me that to find out that nothing is known against him is something in his favour My dear Sydney don t talk nonsense What it proves is simply that he s a nothing and a nobody Had he been anything or anyone something would have been known about him either for or against I don t want my daughter to marry a man who who who s shot up through a trap simply because nothing is known against him Ha hang me if I wouldn t ten times sooner she should marry you When he said that my heart leaped in my bosom I had to turn away I am afraid that is out of the question He stopped in his tramping and looked at me askance Why I felt that if I was not careful I should be done for and probably in his present mood Marjorie too My dear Lindon I cannot tell you how grateful I am to you for your suggestion but I can only repeat that unfortunately anything of the kind is out of the question I don t see why Perhaps not You you re a pretty lot upon my word I m afraid we are I I want you to tell her that Lessingham is a damned scoundrel I see But I would suggest that if I am to use the influence with which you credit me to the best advantage or to preserve a shred of it I had hardly better state the fact quite so bluntly as that I don t care how you state it state it as you like Only only I want you to soak her mind with a loathing of the fellow I I I want you to paint him in his true colours in in in fact I I want you to choke him off While he still struggled with his words and with the perspiration on his brow Edwards entered I turned to him What is it Miss Lindon sir wishes to see you particularly and at once At that moment I found the announcement a trifle perplexing it delighted Lindon He began to stutter and to stammer T the very thing c couldn t have been better show her in here H hide me somewhere I don t care where behind that screen Y you use your influence with her g give her a good talking to t tell her what I ve told you and at at the critical moment I ll come in and then then if we can t manage her between us it ll be a wonder The proposition staggered me But my dear mister Lindon I fear that I cannot He cut me short Here she comes Ere I could stop him he was behind the screen I had not seen him move with such agility before and before I could expostulate Marjorie was in the room Something which was in her bearing in her face in her eyes quickened the beating of my pulses she looked as if something had come into her life and taken the joy clean out of it CHAPTER XXI THE TERROR IN THE NIGHT Sydney she cried I m so glad that I can see you She might be but at that moment I could scarcely assert that I was a sharer of her joy I told you that if trouble overtook me I should come to you and I m in trouble now Such strange trouble So was I and in perplexity as well An idea occurred to me I would outwit her eavesdropping father Come with me into the house tell me all about it there She refused to budge No I will tell you all about it here She looked about her as it struck me queerly This is just the sort of place in which to unfold a tale like mine It looks uncanny But But me no buts Sydney don t torture me let me stop here where I am don t you see I m haunted She had seated herself Now she stood up holding her hands out in front of her in a state of extraordinary agitation her manner as wild as her words Why are you staring at me like that Do you think I m mad I wonder if I m going mad Sydney do people suddenly go mad You re a bit of everything you re a bit of a doctor too feel my pulse there it is tell me if I m ill I felt her pulse it did not need its swift beating to inform me that fever of some sort was in her veins I gave her something in a glass She held it up to the level of her eyes What s this It s a decoction of my own You might not think it but my brain sometimes gets into a whirl I use it as a sedative It will do you good She drained the glass It s done me good already I believe it has that s being something like a doctor Well Sydney the storm has almost burst Last night papa forbade me to speak to Paul Lessingham by way of a prelude Exactly mister Lindon Yes mister Lindon that s papa I fancy we almost quarrelled I know papa said some surprising things but it s a way he has he s apt to say surprising things He s the best father in the world but it s not in his nature to like a really clever person your good high dried old Tory never can I ve always thought that that s why he s so fond of you Thank you I presume that is the reason though it had not occurred to me before Since her entry I had to the best of my ability been turning the position over in my mind I came to the conclusion that all things considered her father had probably as much right to be a sharer of his daughter s confidence as I had even from the vantage of the screen and that for him to hear a few home truths proceeding from her lips might serve to clear the air From such a clearance the lady would not be likely to come off worst I had not the faintest inkling of what was the actual purport of her visit She started off as it seemed to me at a tangent Did I tell you last night about what took place yesterday morning about the adventure of my finding the man Not a word I believe I meant to I m half disposed to think he s brought me trouble Isn t there some superstition about evil befalling whoever shelters a homeless stranger We ll hope not for humanity s sake I fancy there is I feel sure there is Anyhow listen to my story Yesterday morning before breakfast to be accurate between eight and nine I looked out of the window and I saw a crowd in the street I sent Peter out to see what was the matter He came back and said there was a man in a fit I went out to look at the man in the fit I found lying on the ground in the centre of the crowd a man who but for the tattered remnants of what had apparently once been a cloak would have been stark naked He was covered with dust and dirt and blood a dreadful sight As you know I have had my smattering of instruction in First Aid to the Injured and that kind of thing so as no one else seemed to have any sense and the man seemed as good as dead I thought I would try my hand Directly I knelt down beside him what do you think he said Thank you Nonsense He said in such a queer hollow croaking voice Paul Lessingham I was dreadfully startled To hear a perfect stranger a man in his condition utter that name in such a fashion to me of all people in the world took me aback The policeman who was holding his head remarked That s the first time he s opened his mouth I thought he was dead He opened his mouth a second time A convulsive movement went all over him and he exclaimed with the strangest earnestness and so loudly that you might have heard him at the other end of the street Be warned Paul Lessingham be warned It was very silly of me perhaps but I cannot tell you how his words and his manner the two together affected me Well the long and the short of it was that I had him taken into the house and washed and put to bed and I had the doctor sent for The doctor could make nothing of it at all He reported that the man seemed to be suffering from some sort of cataleptic seizure I could see that he thought it likely to turn out almost as interesting a case as I did Did you acquaint your father with the addition to his household She looked at me quizzically You see when one has such a father as mine one cannot tell him everything at once There are occasions on which one requires time I felt that this would be wholesome hearing for old Lindon Last night after papa and I had exchanged our little courtesies which it is to be hoped were to papa s satisfaction since they were not to be mine I went to see the patient I was told that he had neither eaten nor drunk moved nor spoken But so soon as I approached his bed he showed signs of agitation He half raised himself upon his pillow and he called out as if he had been addressing some large assembly I can t describe to you the dreadful something which was in his voice and on his face Paul Lessingham Beware The Beetle When she said that I was startled Are you sure those were the words he used Quite sure Do you think I could mistake them especially after what has happened since I hear them singing in my ears they haunt me all the time She put her hands up to her face as if to veil something from her eyes I was becoming more and more convinced that there was something about the Apostle s connection with his Oriental friend which needed probing to the bottom What sort of a man is he to look at this patient of yours I had my doubts as to the gentleman s identity which her words dissolved only however to increase my mystification in another direction He seems to be between thirty and forty He has light hair and straggling sandy whiskers He is so thin as to be nothing but skin and bone the doctor says it s a case of starvation You say he has light hair and sandy whiskers Are you sure the whiskers are real She opened her eyes Of course they re real Why shouldn t they be real Does he strike you as being a foreigner Certainly not He looks like an Englishman and he speaks like one and not I should say of the lowest class It is true that there is a very curious a weird quality in his voice what I have heard of it but it is not un English If it is catalepsy he is suffering from then it is a kind of catalepsy I never heard of Have you ever seen a clairvoyant I nodded He seems to me to be in a state of clairvoyance Of course the doctor laughed when I told him so but we know what doctors are and I still believe that he is in some condition of the kind When he said that last night he struck me as being under what those sort of people call influence and that whoever had him under influence was forcing him to speak against his will for the words came from his lips as if they had been wrung from him in agony Knowing what I did know that struck me as being rather a remarkable conclusion for her to have reached by the exercise of her own unaided powers of intuition but I did not choose to let her know I thought so My dear Marjorie you who pride yourself on having your imagination so strictly under control on suffering it to take no errant flights Is not the fact that I do so pride myself proof that I am not likely to make assertions wildly proof at any rate to you Listen to me When I left that unfortunate creature s room I had had a nurse sent for I left him in her charge and reached my own bedroom I was possessed by a profound conviction that some appalling intangible but very real danger was at that moment threatening Paul Remember you had had an exciting evening and a discussion with your father Your patient s words came as a climax That is what I told myself or rather that was what I tried to tell myself because in some extraordinary fashion I had lost the command of my powers of reflection Precisely It was not precisely or at least it was not precisely in the sense you mean You may laugh at me Sydney but I had an altogether indescribable feeling a feeling which amounted to knowledge that I was in the presence of the supernatural Nonsense It was not nonsense I wish it had been nonsense As I have said I was conscious completely conscious that some frightful peril was assailing Paul I did not know what it was but I did know that it was something altogether awful of which merely to think was to shudder I wanted to go to his assistance I tried to more than once but I couldn t and I knew that I couldn t I knew that I couldn t move as much as a finger to help him Stop let me finish I told myself that it was absurd but it wouldn t do absurd or not there was the terror with me in the room I knelt down and I prayed but the words wouldn t come I tried to ask God to remove this burden from my brain but my longings wouldn t shape themselves into words and my tongue was palsied I don t know how long I struggled but at last I came to understand that for some cause God had chosen to leave me to fight the fight alone So I got up and undressed and went to bed and that was the worst of all I had sent my maid away in the first rush of my terror afraid and I think ashamed to let her see my fear Now I would have given anything to summon her back again but I couldn t do it I couldn t even ring the bell So as I say I got into bed She paused as if to collect her thoughts To listen to her words and to think of the suffering which they meant to her was almost more than I could endure I would have thrown away the world to have been able to take her in my arms and soothe her fears I knew her to be in general the least hysterical of young women little wont to become the prey of mere delusions and incredible though it sounded I had an innate conviction that even in its wildest periods her story had some sort of basis in solid fact What that basis amounted to it would be my business at any and every cost quickly to determine You know how you have always laughed at me because of my objection to cockroaches and how in spring the neighbourhood of May bugs has always made me uneasy As soon as I got into bed I felt that something of the kind was in the room Something of what kind Some kind of beetle I could hear the whirring of its wings I could hear its droning in the air I knew that it was hovering above my head that it was coming lower and lower nearer and nearer I hid myself I covered myself all over with the clothes then I felt it bumping against the coverlet And Sydney She drew closer Her blanched cheeks and frightened eyes made my heart bleed Her voice became but an echo of itself It followed me Marjorie It got into the bed You imagined it I didn t imagine it I heard it crawl along the sheets till it found a way between them and then it crawled towards me And I felt it against my face And it s there now Where She raised the forefinger of her left hand There Can t you hear it droning She listened intently I listened too Oddly enough at that instant the droning of an insect did become audible It s only a bee child which has found its way through the open window I wish it were only a bee I wish it were Sydney don t you feel as if you were in the presence of evil Don t you want to get away from it back into the presence of God Marjorie Pray Sydney pray I can t I don t know why but I can t She flung her arms about my neck and pressed herself against me in paroxysmal agitation The violence of her emotion bade fair to unman me too It was so unlike Marjorie and I would have given my life to save her from a toothache She kept repeating her own words as if she could not help it Pray Sydney pray At last I did as she wished me At least there is no harm in praying I never heard of its bringing hurt to anyone I repeated aloud the Lord s Prayer the first time for I know not how long As the divine sentences came from my lips hesitatingly enough I make no doubt her tremors ceased She became calmer Until as I reached the last great petition Deliver us from evil she loosed her arms from about my neck and dropped upon her knees close to my feet And she joined me in the closing words as a sort of chorus For Thine is the Kingdom the Power and the Glory for ever and ever Amen When the prayer was ended we both of us were still She with her head bowed and her hands clasped and I with something tugging at my heart strings which I had not felt there for many and many a year almost as if it had been my mother s hand I daresay that sometimes she does stretch out her hand from her place among the angels to touch my heart strings and I know nothing of it all the while As the silence still continued I chanced to glance up and there was old Lindon peeping at us from his hiding place behind the screen The look of amazed perplexity which was on his big red face struck me with such a keen sense of the incongruous that it was all I could do to keep from laughter Apparently the sight of us did nothing to lighten the fog which was in his brain for he stammered out in what was possibly intended for a whisper Is is she m mad The whisper if it was meant for a whisper was more than sufficiently audible to catch his daughter s ears She started raised her head sprang to her feet turned and saw her father Papa Immediately her sire was seized with an access of stuttering W w what the d devil s the the m m meaning of this Her utterance was clear enough I fancy her parent found it almost painfully clear Rather it is for me to ask what is the meaning of this Is it possible that all the time you have actually been concealed behind that screen Unless I am mistaken the old gentleman cowered before the directness of his daughter s gaze and endeavoured to conceal the fact by an explosion of passion Do don t you s speak to me li like that you un undutiful girl I I m your father You certainly are my father though I was unaware until now that my father was capable of playing the part of eavesdropper Rage rendered him speechless or at any rate he chose to let us believe that that was the determining cause of his continuing silent So Marjorie turned to me and on the whole I had rather she had not Her manner was very different from what it had been just now it was more than civil it was freezing Am I to understand mister Atherton that this has been done with your cognisance That while you suffered me to pour out my heart to you unchecked you were aware all the time that there was a listener behind the screen I became keenly aware on a sudden that I had borne my share in playing her a very shabby trick I should have liked to throw old Lindon through the window The thing was not of my contriving Had I had the opportunity I would have compelled mister Lindon to face you when you came in But your distress caused me to lose my balance And you will do me the justice to remember that I endeavoured to induce you to come with me into another room But I do not seem to remember your hinting at there being any particular reason why I should have gone You never gave me a chance Sydney I had not thought you would have played me such a trick When she said that in such a tone the woman whom I loved I could have hammered my head against the wall The hound I was to have treated her so scurvily Perceiving I was crushed she turned again to face her father cool calm stately she was on a sudden once more the Marjorie with whom I was familiar The demeanour of parent and child was in striking contrast If appearances went for aught the odds were heavy that in any encounter which might be coming the senior would suffer I hope papa that you are going to tell me that there has been some curious mistake and that nothing was farther from your intention than to listen at a keyhole What would you have thought and said if I had attempted to play the spy on you And I have always understood that men were so particular on points of honour Old Lindon was still hardly fit to do much else than splutter certainly not qualified to chop phrases with this sharp tongued maiden D don t talk to me li like that girl I I believe you re s stark mad He turned to me W what was that tomfoolery she was talking to you about To what do you allude About a rub rubbishing b beetle and g goodness alone knows what d diseased and m morbid imagination r reared on the literature of the gutter I never thought that a child of mine could have s sunk to such a depth Now Atherton I ask you to t tell me frankly what do you think of a child who behaves as she has done who t takes a nameless vagabond into the house and con conceals his presence from her father And m mark the sequel even the vagabond warns her against the r rascal Lessingham Now Atherton tell me what you think of a girl who behaves like that I shrugged my shoulders I I know very well what you d do think of her don t be afraid to say it out because she s present No Sydney don t be afraid I saw that her eyes were dancing in a manner of speaking her looks brightened under the sunshine of her father s displeasure Let s hear what you think of her as a as a m man of the world Pray Sydney do What you feel for her in your your heart of hearts Yes Sydney what do you feel for me in your heart of hearts The baggage beamed with heartless sweetness she was making a mock of me Her father turned as if he would have rent her D don t you speak until you re spoken to Atherton I I hope I m not deceived in you I I hope you re the man I I took you for that you re willing and and ready to play the part of a a an honest friend to this mis misguided simpleton T this is not the time for mincing words it it s the time for candid speech Tell this this weak minded young woman right out whether this man Lessingham is or is not a damned scoundrel Papa Do you really think that Sydney s opinion or your opinion is likely to alter facts Do you hear Atherton tell this wretched girl the truth My dear mister Lindon I have already told you that I know nothing either for or against mister Lessingham except what is known to all the world Exactly and all the world knows him to be a miserable adventurer who is scheming to entrap my daughter I am bound to say since you press me that your language appears to me to be unnecessarily strong Atherton I I m ashamed of you You see Sydney even papa is ashamed of you now you are outside the pale My dear papa if you will allow me to speak I will tell you what I know to be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth That mister Lessingham is a man with great gifts goes without saying permit me papa He is a man of genius He is a man of honour He is a man of the loftiest ambitions of the highest aims He has dedicated his whole life to the improvement of the conditions amidst which the less fortunate of his fellow countrymen are at present compelled to exist That seems to me to be an object well worth having He has asked me to share his life work and I have told him that I will when and where and how he wants me to And I will I do not suppose his life has been free from peccadilloes I have no delusion on the point What man s life has Who among men can claim to be without sin Even the members of our highest families sometimes hide behind screens But I know that he is at least as good a man as I ever met I am persuaded that I shall never meet a better and I thank God that I have found favour in his eyes Good bye Sydney I suppose I shall see you again papa With the merest inclination of her head to both of us she straightway left the room Lindon would have stopped her S stay y y y you he stuttered But I caught him by the arm If you will be advised by me you will let her go No good purpose will be served by a multiplication of words Atherton I I m disappointed in you You you haven t behaved as I expected I I haven t received from you the assistance which I looked for My dear Lindon it seems to me that your method of diverting the young lady from the path which she has set herself to tread is calculated to send her furiously along it C confound the women c confound the women I don t mind telling you in c confidence that at at times her mother was the devil and I ll be I ll be hanged if her daughter isn t worse What was the tomfoolery she was talking to you about Is she mad No I don t think she s mad I never heard such stuff it made my blood run cold to hear her What s the matter with the girl Well you must excuse my saying that I don t fancy you quite understand women I I don t and I I I don t want to either I hesitated then resolved on a taradiddle in Marjorie s interest Marjorie is high strung extremely sensitive Her imagination is quickly aflame Perhaps last night you drove her as far as was safe You heard for yourself how in consequence she suffered You don t want people to say you have driven her into a lunatic asylum I good heavens no I I ll send for the doctor directly I get home I I ll have the best opinion in town You ll do nothing of the kind you ll only make her worse What you have to do is to be patient with her and let her have peace As for this affair of Lessingham s I have a suspicion that it may not be all such plain sailing as she supposes What do you mean I mean nothing I only wish you to understand that until you hear from me again you had better let matters slide Give the girl her head Give the girl her head H haven t I I g given the g girl her h head all her l life He looked at his watch Why the day s half gone He began scurrying towards the front door I following at his heels I ve got a committee meeting on at the club m most important For weeks they ve been giving us the worst food you ever tasted in your life p played havoc with my digestion and I I m going to tell them if things aren t changed they they ll have to pay my doctor s bills As for that man Lessingham As he spoke he himself opened the hall door and there standing on the step was that man Lessingham himself Lindon was a picture The Apostle was as cool as a cucumber He held out his hand Good morning mister Lindon What delightful weather we are having Lindon put his hand behind his back and behaved as stupidly as he very well could have done You will understand mister Lessingham that in future I don t know you and that I shall decline to recognise you anywhere and that what I say applies equally to any member of my family With his hat very much on the back of his head he went down the steps like an inflated turkeycock CHAPTER XXII THE HAUNTED MAN To have received the cut discourteous from his future father in law might have been the most commonplace of incidents Lessingham evinced not a trace of discomposure So far as I could judge he took no notice of the episode whatever behaving exactly as if nothing had happened He merely waited till mister Lindon was well off the steps then turning to me he placidly observed Interrupting you again you see May I The sight of him had set up such a turmoil in my veins that for the moment I could not trust myself to speak I felt acutely that an explanation with him was of all things the thing most to be desired and that quickly Providence could not have thrown him more opportunely in the way If before he went away we did not understand each other a good deal more clearly upon certain points the fault should not be mine Without a responsive word turning on my heels I led the way into the laboratory Whether he noticed anything peculiar in my demeanour I could not tell Within he looked about him with that purely facial smile the sight of which had always engendered in me a certain distrust of him Do you always receive visitors in here By no means What is this Stooping down he picked up something from the floor It was a lady s purse a gorgeous affair of crimson leather and gleaming gold Whether it was Marjorie s or Miss Grayling s I could not tell He watched me as I examined it Is it yours No It is not mine Placing his hat and umbrella on one chair he placed himself upon another very leisurely Crossing his legs laying his folded hands upon his knees he sat and looked at me I was quite conscious of his observation but endured it in silence being a little wishful that he should begin Presently he had as I suppose enough of looking at me and spoke Atherton what is the matter with you Have I done something to offend you too Why do you ask Your manner seems a little singular You think so I do What have you come to see me about Just now nothing I like to know where I stand His manner was courteous easy even graceful I was outmanoeuvred I understood the man sufficiently well to be aware that when once he was on the defensive the first blow would have to come from me So I struck it I also like to know where I stand Lessingham I am aware and you know that I am aware that you have made certain overtures to Miss Lindon That is a fact in which I am keenly interested As how The Lindons and the Athertons are not the acquaintances of one generation only Marjorie Lindon and I have been friends since childhood She looks upon me as a brother As a brother As a brother Yes mister Lindon regains me as a son He has given me his confidence as I believe you are aware Marjorie has given me hers and now I want you to give me yours What do you want to know I wish to explain my position before I say what I have to say because I want you to understand me clearly I believe honestly that the thing I most desire in this world is to see Marjorie Lindon happy If I thought she would be happy with you I should say God speed you both and I should congratulate you with all my heart because I think that you would have won the best girl in the whole world to be your wife I think so too But before I did that I should have to see at least some reasonable probability that she would be happy with you Why should she not Will you answer a question What is the question What is the story in your life of which you stand in such hideous terror There was a perceptible pause before he answered Explain yourself No explanation is needed you know perfectly well what I mean You credit me with miraculous acumen Don t juggle Lessingham be frank The frankness should not be all on one side There is that in your frankness although you may be unconscious of it which some men might not unreasonably resent Do you resent it That depends If you are arrogating to yourself the right to place yourself between Miss Lindon and me I do resent it strongly Answer my question I answer no question which is addressed to me in such a tone He was as calm as you please I recognised that already I was in peril of losing my temper which was not at all what I desired I eyed him intently he returning me look for look His countenance betrayed no sign of a guilty conscience I had not seen him more completely at his ease He smiled facially and also as it seemed to me a little derisively I am bound to admit that his bearing showed not the faintest shadow of resentment and that in his eyes there was a gentleness a softness which I had not observed in them before I could almost have suspected him of being sympathetic In this matter you must know I stand in the place of mister Lindon Well Surely you must understand that before anyone is allowed to think of marriage with Marjorie Lindon he will have to show that his past as the advertisements have it will bear the fullest investigation Is that so Will your past bear the fullest investigation I winced At any rate it is known to all the world Is it Forgive me if I say I doubt it I doubt if of any wise man that can be said with truth In all our lives there are episodes which we keep to ourselves I felt that that was so true that for the instant I hardly knew what to say But there are episodes and episodes and when it comes to a man being haunted one draws the line Haunted As you are He got up Atherton I think that I understand you but I fear that you do not understand me He went to where a self acting mercurial air pump was standing on a shelf What is this curious arrangement of glass tubes and bulbs I do not think that you do understand me or you would know that I am in no mood to be trifled with Is it some kind of an exhauster My dear Lessingham I am entirely at your service I intend to have an answer to my question before you leave this room but in the meanwhile your convenience is mine There are some very interesting things here which you might care to see Marvellous is it not how the human intellect progresses from conquest unto conquest Among the ancients the progression had proceeded farther than with us In what respect For instance in the affair of the Apotheosis of the Beetle I saw it take place last night Where Here within a few feet of where you are standing Are you serious Perfectly What did you see I saw the legendary Apotheosis of the Beetle performed last night before my eyes with a gaudy magnificence at which the legends never hinted That is odd I once thought that I saw something of the kind myself So I understand From whom From a friend of yours From a friend of mine Are you sure it was from a friend of mine The man s attempt at coolness did him credit but it did not deceive me That he thought I was endeavouring to bluff him out of his secret I perceived quite clearly that it was a secret which he would only render with his life I was beginning to suspect Had it not been for Marjorie I should have cared nothing his affairs were his affairs though I realised perfectly well that there was something about the man which from the scientific explorer s point of view might be well worth finding out Still as I say if it had not been for Marjorie I should have let it go but since she was so intimately concerned in it I wondered more and more what it could be My attitude towards what is called the supernatural is an open one That all things are possible I unhesitatingly believe I have even in my short time seen so many so called impossibilities proved possible That we know everything I doubt that our great great great great grandsires our forebears of thousands of years ago of the extinct civilisations knew more on some subjects than we do I think is at least probable All the legends can hardly be false Because men claimed to be able to do things in those days which we cannot do and which we do not know how they did we profess to think that their claims are finally dismissed by exclaiming lies But it is not so sure For my part what I had seen I had seen I had seen some devil s trick played before my very eyes Some trick of the same sort seemed to have been played upon my Marjorie I repeat that I write my Marjorie because to me she will always be my Marjorie It had driven her half out of her senses As I looked at Lessingham I seemed to see her at his side as I had seen her not long ago with her white drawn face and staring eyes dumb with an agony of fear Her life was bidding fair to be knit with his what Upas tree of horror was rooted in his very bones The thought that her sweet purity was likely to be engulfed in a devil s slough in which he was swallowing was not to be endured As I realised that the man was more than my match at the game which I was playing in which such vital interests were at stake my hands itched to clutch him by the throat and try another way Doubtless my face revealed my feelings because presently he said Are you aware how strangely you are looking at me Atherton Were my countenance a mirror I think you would be surprised to see in it your own I drew back from him I daresay sullenly Not so surprised as yesterday morning you would have been to have seen yours at the mere sight of a pictured scarab How easily you quarrel I do not quarrel Then perhaps it s I If that is so then at once the quarrel s ended pouf it s done mister Lindon I fear because politically we differ regards me as anathema Has he put some of his spirit into you You are a wiser man I am aware that you are an adept with words But this is a case in which words only will not serve Then what will serve I am myself beginning to wonder And I As you so courteously suggest I believe I am wiser than Lindon I do not care for your politics or for what you call your politics one fig I do not care if you are as other men are as I am not unspotted from the world But I do care if you are leprous And I believe you are Atherton Ever since I have known you I have been conscious of there being something about you which I found it difficult to diagnose in an unwholesome sense something out of the common non natural an atmosphere of your own Events so far as you are concerned have during the last few days moved quickly They have thrown an uncomfortably lurid light on that peculiarity of yours which I have noticed Unless you can explain them to my satisfaction you will withdraw your pretensions to Miss Lindon s hand or I shall place certain facts before that lady and if necessary publish them to the world He grew visibly paler but he smiled facially You have your own way of conducting a conversation mister Atherton What are the events to whose rapid transit you are alluding Who was the individual practically stark naked who came out of your house in such singular fashion at dead of night Is that one of the facts with which you propose to tickle the public ear Is that the only explanation which you have to offer Proceed for the present with your indictment I am not so unobservant as you appear to imagine There were features about the episode which struck me forcibly at the time and which have struck me more forcibly since To suggest as you did yesterday morning that it was an ordinary case of burglary or that the man was a lunatic is an absurdity Pardon me I did nothing of the kind Then what do you suggest I suggested and do suggest nothing All the suggestions come from you You went very much out of your way to beg me to keep the matter quiet There is an appearance of suggestion about that You take a jaundiced view of all my actions mister Atherton Nothing to me could seem more natural However proceed He had his hands behind his back and rested them on the edge of the table against which he was leaning He was undoubtedly ill at ease but so far I had not made the impression on him either mentally or morally which I desired Who is your Oriental friend I do not follow you Are you sure I am certain Repeat your question Who is your Oriental friend I was not aware that I had one Do you swear that He laughed a strange laugh Do you seek to catch me tripping You conduct your case with too much animus You must allow me to grasp the exact purport of your inquiry before I can undertake to reply to it on oath Are you not aware that at present there is in London an individual who claims to have had a very close and a very curious acquaintance with you in the East I am not That you swear That I do swear That is singular Why is it singular Because I fancy that that individual haunts you Haunts me Haunts you You jest You think so You remember that picture of the scarabaeus which yesterday morning frightened you into a state of semi idiocy You use strong language I know what you allude to Do you mean to say that you don t know that you were indebted for that to your Oriental friend I don t understand you Are you sure Certainly I am sure It occurs to me mister Atherton that an explanation is demanded from you rather than from me Are you aware that the purport of my presence here is to ask you how that picture found its way into your room It was projected by the Lord of the Beetle The words were chance ones but they struck a mark The Lord He faltered and stopped He showed signs of discomposure I will be frank with you since frankness is what you ask His smile that time was obviously forced Recently I have been the victim of delusions there was a pause before the word of a singular kind I have feared that they were the result of mental overstrain Is it possible that you can enlighten me as to their source I was silent He was putting a great strain upon himself but the twitching of his lips betrayed him A little more and I should reach the other side of mister Lessingham the side which he kept hidden from the world Who is this individual whom you speak of as my Oriental friend Being your friend you should know better than I do What sort of man is he to look at I did not say it was a man But I presume it is a man I did not say so He seemed for a moment to hold his breath and he looked at me with eyes which were not friendly Then with a display of self command which did him credit he drew himself upright with an air of dignity which well became him Atherton consciously or unconsciously you are doing me a serious injustice I do not know what conception it is which you have formed of me or on what the conception is founded but I protest that to the best of my knowledge and belief I am as reputable as honest and as clean a man as you are But you re haunted Haunted He held himself erect looking me straight in the face Then a shiver went all over him the muscles of his mouth twitched and in an instant he was livid He staggered against the table Yes God knows it s true I m haunted So either you re mad and therefore unfit to marry or else you ve done something which places you outside the tolerably generous boundaries of civilised society and are therefore still more unfit to marry You re on the horns of a dilemma I I m the victim of a delusion What is the nature of the delusion Does it take the shape of a beetle Atherton Without the slightest warning he collapsed was transformed I can describe the change which took place in him in no other way He sank in a heap on the floor he held up his hands above his head and he gibbered like some frenzied animal A more uncomfortable spectacle than he presented it would be difficult to find I have seen it matched in the padded rooms of lunatic asylums but nowhere else The sight of him set every nerve of my body on edge In Heaven s name what is the matter with you man Are you stark staring mad Here drink this Filling a tumbler with brandy I forced it between his quivering fingers Then it was some moments before I could get him to understand what it was I wanted him to do When he did get the glass to his lips he swallowed its contents as if they were so much water By degrees his senses returned to him He stood up He looked about him with a smile which was positively ghastly It s it s a delusion It s a very queer kind of a delusion if it is I eyed him curiously He was evidently making the most strenuous efforts to regain his self control all the while with that horrible smile about his lips Atherton you you take me at an advantage I was still Who who s your Oriental friend My Oriental friend you mean yours I supposed at first that the individual in question was a man but it appears that she s a woman A woman Oh How do you mean Well the face is a man s of an uncommonly disagreeable type of which the powers forbid that there are many and the voice is a man s also of a kind but the body as last night I chanced to discover is a woman s That sounds very odd He closed his eyes I could see that his cheeks were clammy Do you do you believe in witchcraft That depends Have you heard of Obi I have I have been told that an Obeah man can put a spell upon a person which compels a person to see whatever he the Obeah man may please Do you think that s possible It is not a question to which I should be disposed to answer either yes or no He looked at me out of his half closed eyes It struck me that he was making conversation saying anything for the sake of gaining time I remember reading a book entitled Obscure Diseases of the Brain It contained some interesting data on the subject of hallucinations Possibly Now candidly would you recommend me to place myself in the hands of a mental pathologist I don t think that you re insane if that s what you mean No That is good hearing Of all diseases insanity is the most to be dreaded Well Atherton I m keeping you The truth is that insane or not I am very far from well I think I must give myself a holiday He moved towards his hat and umbrella There is something else which you must do What is that You must resign your pretensions to Miss Lindon s hand My dear Atherton if my health is really failing me I shall resign everything everything He repeated his own word with a little movement of his hands which was pathetic Understand me Lessingham What else you do is no affair of mine I am concerned only with Miss Lindon You must give me your definite promise before you leave this room to terminate your engagement with her before to night His back was towards me There will come a time when your conscience will prick you because of your treatment of me when you will realise that I am the most unfortunate of men I realise that now It is because I realise it that I am so desirous that the shadow of your evil fortune shall not fall upon an innocent girl He turned Atherton what is your actual position with reference to Marjorie Lindon She regards me as a brother And do you regard her as a sister Are your sentiments towards her purely fraternal You know that I love her And do you suppose that my removal will clear the path for you I suppose nothing of the kind You may believe me or not but my one desire is for her happiness and surely if you love her that is your desire too That is so He paused An expression of sadness stole over his face of which I had not thought it capable That is so to an extent of which you do not dream No man likes to have his hand forced especially by one whom he regards may I say it as a possible rival But I will tell you this much If the blight which has fallen on my life is likely to continue I would not wish God forbid that I should wish to join her fate with mine not for all that the world could offer me He stopped And I was still Presently he continued When I was younger I was subject to a similar delusion But it vanished I saw no trace of it for years I thought that I had done with it for good Recently however it has returned as you have witnessed I shall institute inquiries into the cause of its reappearance if it seems likely to be irremovable or even if it bids fair to be prolonged I shall not only as you phrase it withdraw my pretensions to Miss Linden s hand but to all my other ambitions In the interim as regards Miss Lindon I shall be careful to hold myself on the footing of a mere acquaintance You promise me I do And on your side Atherton in the meantime deal with me more gently Judgment in my case has still to be given You will find that I am not the guilty wretch you apparently imagine And there are few things more disagreeable to one s self esteem than to learn too late that one has persisted in judging another man too harshly Think of all that the world has at this moment to offer me and what it will mean if I have to turn my back on it owing to a mischievous twist of fortune s wheel He turned is if to go Then stopped and looked round in an attitude of listening What s that There was a sound of droning I recalled what Marjorie had said of her experiences of the night before it was like the droning of a beetle The instant the Apostle heard it the fashion of his countenance began to change it was pitiable to witness I rushed to him Lessingham don t be a fool play the man He gripped my left arm with his right hand till it felt as if it were being compressed in a vice Then I shall have to have some more brandy Fortunately the bottle was within reach from where I stood otherwise I doubt if he would have released my arm to let me get at it I gave him the decanter and the glass He helped himself to a copious libation By the time that he had swallowed it the droning sound had gone He put down the empty tumbler When a man has to resort to alcohol to keep his nerves up to concert pitch things are in a bad way with him you may be sure of that but then you have never known what it is to stand in momentary expectation of a tete a tete with the devil Again he turned to leave the room and this time he actually went I let him go alone I heard his footsteps passing along the passage and the hall door close Then I sat in an arm chair stretched my legs out in front of me thrust my hands in my trouser pockets and I wondered I had been there perhaps four or five minutes when there was a slight noise at my side Glancing round I saw a sheet of paper come fluttering through the open window It fell almost at my feet I picked it up It was a picture of a beetle a facsimile of the one which had had such an extraordinary effect on mister Lessingham the day before If this was intended for saint Paul it s a trifle late unless I could hear that someone was approaching along the corridor I looked up expecting to see the Apostle reappear in which expectation I was agreeably disappointed The newcomer was feminine It was Miss Grayling As she stood in the open doorway I saw that her cheeks were red as roses I hope I am not interrupting you again but I left my purse here She stopped then added as if it were an afterthought And I want you to come and lunch with me I locked the picture of the beetle in the drawer and I lunched with Dora Grayling BOOK III The Terror by Night and the Terror by Day Miss Marjorie Lindon tells the Tale CHAPTER XXIII THE WAY HE TOLD HER I am the happiest woman in the world I wonder how many women have said that of themselves in their time but I am Paul has told me that he loves me How long I have made inward confession of my love for him I should be ashamed to say It sounds prosaic but I believe it is a fact that the first stirring of my pulses was caused by the report of a speech of his which I read in the Times It was on the Eight Hours Bill Papa was most unflattering He said that he was an oily spouter an ignorant agitator an irresponsible firebrand and a good deal more to the same effect I remember very well how papa fidgeted with the paper declaring that it read even worse than it had sounded and goodness knew that it had sounded bad enough He was so very emphatic that when he had gone I thought I would see what all the pother was about and read the speech for myself So I read it It affected me quite differently The speaker s words showed such knowledge charity and sympathy that they went straight to my heart After that I read everything of Paul Lessingham s which I came across And the more I read the more I was impressed But it was some time before we met Considering what papa s opinions were it was not likely that he would go out of his way to facilitate a meeting To him the mere mention of the name was like a red rag to a bull But at last we did meet And then I knew that he was stronger greater better even than his words It is so often the other way one finds that men and women too are so apt to put their best as it were into their shop windows that the discovery was as novel as it was delightful When the ice was once broken we often met I do not know how it was We did not plan our meetings at first at any rate Yet we seemed always meeting Seldom a day passed on which we did not meet sometimes twice or thrice It was odd how we were always coming across each other in the most unlikely places I believe we did not notice it at the time but looking back I can see that we must have managed our engagements so that somewhere somehow we should be certain to have an opportunity of exchanging half a dozen words Those constant encounters could not have all been chance ones But I never supposed he loved me never I am not even sure that for some time I was aware that I loved him We were great on friendship both of us I was quite aware that I was his friend that he regarded me as his friend he told me so more than once I tell you this he would say referring to this that or the other because I know that in speaking to you I am speaking to a friend With him those were not empty words All kinds of people talk to one like that especially men it is a kind of formula which they use with every woman who shows herself disposed to listen But Paul is not like that He is chary of speech not by any means a woman s man I tell him that is his weakest point If legend does not lie more even than is common few politicians have achieved prosperity without the aid of women He replies that he is not a politician that he never means to be a politician He simply wishes to work for his country if his country does not need his services well let it be Papa s political friends have always so many axes of their own to grind that at first to hear a member of Parliament talk like that was almost disquieting I had dreamed of men like that but I never encountered one till I met Paul Lessingham Our friendship was a pleasant one It became pleasanter and pleasanter Until there came a time when he told me everything the dreams he dreamed the plans which he had planned the great purposes which if health and strength were given him he intended to carry to a great fulfilment And at last he told me something else It was after a meeting at a Working Women s Club in Westminster He had spoken and I had spoken too I don t know what papa would have said if he had known but I had A formal resolution had been proposed and I had seconded it in perhaps a couple of hundred words but that would have been quite enough for papa to have regarded me as an Abandoned Wretch papa always puts those sort of words into capitals Papa regards a speechifying woman as a thing of horror I have known him look askance at a Primrose Dame The night was fine Paul proposed that I should walk with him down the Westminster Bridge Road until we reached the House and then he would see me into a cab I did as he suggested It was still early not yet ten and the streets were alive with people Our conversation as we went was entirely political The Agricultural Amendment Act was then before the Commons and Paul felt very strongly that it was one of those measures which give with one hand while taking with the other The committee stage was at hand and already several amendments were threatened the effect of which would be to strengthen the landlord at the expense of the tenant More than one of these and they not the most moderate were to be proposed by papa Paul was pointing out how it would be his duty to oppose these tooth and nail when all at once he stopped I sometimes wonder how you really feel upon this matter What matter On the difference of opinion in political matters which exists between your father and myself I am conscious that mister Lindon regards my action as a personal question and resents it so keenly that I am sometimes moved to wonder if at least a portion of his resentment is not shared by you I have explained I consider papa the politician as one person and papa the father as quite another You are his daughter Certainly I am but would you on that account wish me to share his political opinions even though I believe them to be wrong You love him Of course I do he is the best of fathers Your defection will be a grievous disappointment I looked at him out of the corner of my eye I wondered what was passing through his mind The subject of my relations with papa was one which without saying anything at all about it we had consented to taboo I am not so sure I am permeated with a suspicion that papa has no politics Miss Lindon I fancy that I can adduce proof to the contrary I believe that if papa were to marry again say a Home Ruler within three weeks his wife s politics would be his own Paul thought before he spoke then he smiled I suppose that men sometimes do change their coats to please their wives even their political ones Papa s opinions are the opinions of those with whom he mixes The reason why he consorts with Tories of the crusted school is because he fears that if he associated with anybody else with Radicals say before he knew it he would be a Radical too With him association is synonymus with logic Paul laughed outright By this time we had reached Westminster Bridge Standing we looked down upon the river A long line of lanterns was gliding mysteriously over the waters it was a tug towing a string of barges For some moments neither spoke Then Paul recurred to what I had just been saying And you do you think marriage would colour your convictions Would it yours That depends He was silent Then he said in that tone which I had learned to look for when he was most in earnest It depends on whether you would marry me I was still His words were so unexpected that they took my breath away I knew not what to make of them My head was in a whirl Then he addressed to me a monosyllabic interrogation Well I found my voice or a part of it Well to what He came a little closer Will you be my wife The part of my voice which I had found was lost again Tears came into my eyes I shivered I had not thought that I could be so absurd Just then the moon came from behind a cloud the rippling waters were tipped with silver He spoke again so gently that his words just reached my ears You know that I love you Then I knew that I loved him too That what I had fancied was a feeling of friendship was something very different It was as if somebody in tearing a veil from before my eyes had revealed a spectacle which dazzled me I was speechless He misconstrued my silence Have I offended you No I fancy that he noted the tremor which was in my voice and read it rightly For he too was still Presently his hand stole along the parapet and fastened upon mine and held it tight And that was how it came about Other things were said but they were hardly of the first importance Though I believe we took some time in saying them Of myself I can say with truth that my heart was too full for copious speech I was dumb with a great happiness And I believe I can say the same of Paul He told me as much when we were parting It seemed that we had only just come there when Paul started Turning he stared up at Big Ben Midnight The House up Impossible But it was more than possible it was fact We had actually been on the Bridge two hours and it had not seemed ten minutes Never had I supposed that the flight of time could have been so entirely unnoticed Paul was considerably taken aback His legislative conscience pricked him He excused himself in his own fashion Fortunately for once in a way my business in the House was not so important as my business out of it He had his arm through mine We were standing face to face So you call this business He laughed He not only saw me into a cab but he saw me home in it And in the cab he kissed me I fancy I was a little out of sorts that night My nervous system was perhaps demoralised Because when he kissed me I did a thing which I never do I have my own standard of behaviour and that sort of thing is quite outside of it I behaved like a sentimental chit I cried And it took him all the way to my father s door to comfort me I can only hope that perceiving the singularity of the occasion he consented to excuse me CHAPTER XXIV A WOMAN S VIEW Sydney Atherton has asked me to be his wife It is not only annoying worse it is absurd This is the result of Paul s wish that our engagement should not be announced He is afraid of papa not really but for the moment The atmosphere of the House is charged with electricity Party feeling runs high They are at each other hammer and tongs about this Agricultural Amendment Act The strain on Paul is tremendous I am beginning to feel positively concerned Little things which I have noticed about him lately convince me that he is being overwrought I suspect him of having sleepless nights The amount of work which he has been getting through lately has been too much for any single human being I care not who he is He himself admits that he shall be glad when the session is at an end So shall I In the meantime it is his desire that nothing shall be said about our engagement until the House rises It is reasonable enough Papa is sure to be violent lately the barest allusion to Paul s name has been enough to make him explode When the discovery does come he will be unmanageable I foresee it clearly From little incidents which have happened recently I predict the worst He will be capable of making a scene within the precincts of the House And as Paul says there is some truth in the saying that the last straw breaks the camel s back He will be better able to face papa s wild wrath when the House has risen So the news is to bide a wee Of course Paul is right And what he wishes I wish too Still it is not all such plain sailing for me as he perhaps thinks The domestic atmosphere is almost as electrical as that in the House Papa is like the terrier who scents a rat he is always sniffing the air He has not actually forbidden me to speak to Paul his courage is not quite at the sticking point but he is constantly making uncomfortable allusions to persons who number among their acquaintance political adventurers grasping carpet baggers Radical riff raff and that kind of thing Sometimes I venture to call my soul my own but such a tempest invariably follows that I become discreet again as soon as I possibly can So as a rule I suffer in silence Still I would with all my heart that the concealment were at an end No one need imagine that I am ashamed of being about to marry Paul papa least of all On the contrary I am as proud of it as a woman can be Sometimes when he has said or done something unusually wonderful I fear that my pride will out I do feel it so strong within me I should be delighted to have a trial of strength with papa anywhere at any time I should not be so rude to him as he would be to me At the bottom of his heart papa knows that I am the more sensible of the two after a pitched battle or so he would understand it better still I know papa I have not been his daughter for all these years in vain I feel like hot blooded soldiers must feel who burning to attack the enemy in the open field are ordered to skulk behind hedges and be shot at One result is that Sydney has actually made a proposal of marriage he of all people It is too comical The best of it was that he took himself quite seriously I do not know how many times he has confided to me the sufferings which he has endured for love of other women some of them I am sorry to say decent married women too but this is the first occasion on which the theme has been a personal one He was so frantic as he is wont to be that to calm him I told him about Paul which under the circumstances to him I felt myself at liberty to do In return he was melodramatic hinting darkly at I know not what I was almost cross with him He is a curious person Sydney Atherton I suppose it is because I have known him all my life and have always looked upon him in cases of necessity as a capital substitute for a brother that I criticise him with so much frankness In some respects he is a genius in others I will not write fool for that he never is though he has often done some extremely foolish things The fame of his inventions is in the mouths of all men though the half of them has never been told He is the most extraordinary mixture The things which most people would like to have proclaimed in the street he keeps tightly locked in his own bosom while those which the same persons would be only too glad to conceal he shouts from the roofs A very famous man once told me that if mister Atherton chose to become a specialist to take up one branch of inquiry and devote his life to it his fame before he died would bridge the spheres But sticking to one thing is not in Sydney s line at all He prefers like the bee to roam from flower to flower As for his being in love with me it is ridiculous He is as much in love with the moon I cannot think what has put the idea into his head Some girl must have been ill using him or he imagines that she has The girl whom he ought to marry and whom he ultimately will marry is Dora Grayling She is young charming immensely rich and over head and ears in love with him if she were not then he would be over head and ears in love with her I believe he is very near it as it is sometimes he is so very rude to her It is a characteristic of Sydney s that he is apt to be rude to a girl whom he really likes As for Dora I suspect she dreams of him He is tall straight very handsome with a big moustache and the most extraordinary eyes I fancy that those eyes of his have as much to do with Dora s state as anything I have heard it said that he possesses the hypnotic power to an unusual degree and that if he chose to exercise it he might become a danger to society I believe he has hypnotised Dora He makes an excellent brother I have gone to him many and many a time for help and some excellent advice I have received I daresay I shall consult him still There are matters of which one would hardly dare to talk to Paul In all things he is the great man He could hardly condescend to chiffons Now Sydney can and does When he is in the mood on the vital subject of trimmings a woman could not appeal to a sounder authority I tell him if he had been a dressmaker he would have been magnificent I am sure he would CHAPTER XXV THE MAN IN THE STREET This morning I had an adventure I was in the breakfast room Papa as usual was late for breakfast and I was wondering whether I should begin without him when chancing to look round something caught my eye in the street I went to the window to see what it was A small crowd of people was in the middle of the road and they were all staring at something which apparently was lying on the ground What it was I could not see The butler happened to be in the room I spoke to him Peter what is the matter in the street Go and see He went and saw and presently he returned Peter is an excellent servant but the fashion of his speech even when conveying the most trivial information is slightly sesquipedalian He would have made a capital cabinet minister at question time he wraps up the smallest petitions of meaning in the largest possible words An unfortunate individual appears to have been the victim of a catastrophe I am informed that he is dead The constable asserts that he is drunk Drunk dead Do you mean that he is dead drunk at this hour He is either one or the other I did not behold the individual myself I derived my information from a bystander That was not sufficiently explicit for me I gave way to a seemingly quite causeless impulse of curiosity I went out into the street just as I was to see for myself It was perhaps not the most sensible thing I could have done and papa would have been shocked but I am always shocking papa It had been raining in the night and the shoes which I had on were not so well suited as they might have been for an encounter with the mud I made my way to the point of interest What s the matter I asked A workman with a bag of tools over his shoulder answered me There s something wrong with someone Policeman says he s drunk but he looks to me as if he was something worse Will you let me pass please When they saw I was a woman they permitted me to reach the centre of the crowd A man was lying on his back in the grease and dirt of the road He was so plastered with mud that it was difficult at first to be sure that he really was a man His head and feet were bare His body was partially covered by a long ragged cloak It was obvious that that one wretched dirt stained sopping wet rag was all the clothing he had on A huge constable was holding his shoulders in his hands and was regarding him as if he could not make him out at all He seemed uncertain as to whether it was or was not a case of shamming He spoke to him as if he had been some refractory child Come my lad this won t do Wake up What s the matter But he neither woke up nor explained what was the matter I took hold of his hand It was icy cold Apparently the wrist was pulseless Clearly this was no ordinary case of drunkenness There is something seriously wrong officer Medical assistance ought to be had at once Do you think he s in a fit miss That a doctor should be able to tell you better than I can There seems to be no pulse I should not be surprised to find that he was The word dead was actually on my lips when the stranger saved me from making a glaring exposure of my ignorance by snatching his wrist away from me and sitting up in the mud He held out his hands in front of him opened his eyes and exclaimed in a loud but painfully raucous tone of voice as if he was suffering from a very bad cold Paul Lessingham I was so surprised that I all but sat down in the mud To hear Paul my Paul apostrophised by an individual of his appearance in that fashion was something which I had not expected Directly the words were uttered he closed his eyes again sank backward and seemingly relapsed into unconsciousness the constable gripping him by the shoulder just in time to prevent him banging the back of his head against the road The officer shook him scarcely gently Now my lad it s plain that you re not dead What s the meaning of this Move yourself Looking round I found that Peter was close behind Apparently he had been struck by the singularity of his mistress behaviour and had followed to see that it did not meet with the reward which it deserved I spoke to him Peter let someone go at once for doctor Cotes doctor Cotes lives just round the corner and since it was evident that the man s lapse into consciousness had made the policeman sceptical as to his case being so serious as it seemed I thought it might be advisable that a competent opinion should be obtained without delay Peter was starting when again the stranger returned to consciousness that is if it really was consciousness as to which I was more than a little in doubt He repeated his previous pantomime sat up in the mud stretched out his arms opened his eyes unnaturally wide and yet they appeared unseeing a sort of convulsion went all over him and he shrieked it really amounted to shrieking as a man might shriek who was in mortal terror Be warned Paul Lessingham be warned For my part that settled it There was a mystery here which needed to be unravelled Twice had he called upon Paul s name and in the strangest fashion It was for me to learn the why and the wherefore to ascertain what connection there was between this lifeless creature and Paul Lessingham Providence might have cast him there before my door I might be entertaining an angel unawares My mind was made up on the instant Peter hasten for doctor Cotes Peter passed the word and immediately a footman started running as fast as his legs would carry him Officer I will have this man taken into my father s house Will some of you men help to carry him There were volunteers enough and to spare I spoke to Peter in the hall Is papa down yet mister Lindon has sent down to say that you will please not wait for him for breakfast He has issued instructions to have his breakfast conveyed to him upstairs That s all right I nodded towards the poor wretch who was being carried through the hall You will say nothing to him about this unless he particularly asks You understand Peter bowed He is discretion itself He knows I have my vagaries and it is not his fault if the savour of them travels to papa The doctor was in the house almost as soon as the stranger Wants washing he remarked directly he saw him And that certainly was true I never saw a man who stood more obviously in need of the good offices of soap and water Then he went through the usual medical formula I watching all the while So far as I could see the man showed not the slightest sign of life Is he dead He will be soon if he doesn t have something to eat The fellow s starving The doctor asked the policeman what he knew of him That sagacious officer s reply was vague A boy had run up to him crying that a man was lying dead in the street He had straightway followed the boy and discovered the stranger That was all he knew What is the matter with the man I inquired of the doctor when the constable had gone Don t know It may be catalepsy and it mayn t When I do know you may ask again doctor Cotes manner was a trifle brusque particularly I believe to me I remember that once he threatened to box my ears When I was a small child I used to think nothing of boxing his Realising that no satisfaction was to be got out of a speechless man particularly as regards his mysterious references to Paul I went upstairs I found that papa was under the impression that he was suffering from a severe attack of gout But as he was eating a capital breakfast and apparently enjoying it while I was still fasting I ventured to hope that the matter was not so serious as he feared I mentioned nothing to him about the person whom I had found in the street lest it should aggravate his gout When he is like that the slightest thing does CHAPTER XXVI A FATHER S NO Paul has stormed the House of Commons with one of the greatest speeches which even he has delivered and I have quarrelled with papa And also I have very nearly quarrelled with Sydney Sydney s little affair is nothing He actually still persists in thinking himself in love with me as if since last night when he what he calls proposed to me he has not time to fall out of love and in again half a dozen times and on the strength of it he seems to consider himself entitled to make himself as disagreeable as he can That I should not mind for Sydney disagreeable is about as nice as Sydney any other way but when it comes to his shooting poisoned shafts at Paul I object If he imagines that anything he can say or hint will lessen my estimation of Paul Lessingham by one hair s breadth he has less wisdom even than I gave him credit for By the way Percy Woodville asked me to be his wife tonight which also is nothing he has been trying to do it for the last three years though under the circumstances it is a little trying but he would not spit venom merely because I preferred another man and he I believe does care for me Papa s affair is serious It is the first clashing of the foils and this time I imagine the buttons are really off This morning he said a few words not so much to as at me He informed me that Paul was expected to speak to night as if I did not know it and availed himself of the opening to load him with the abuse which in his case he thinks is not unbecoming to a gentleman I don t know or rather I do know what he would think if he heard another man use in the presence of a woman the kind of language which he habitually employs However I said nothing I had a motive for allowing the chaff to fly before the wind But to night issue was joined I of course went to hear Paul speak as I have done over and over again before Afterwards Paul came and fetched me from the cage He had to leave me for a moment while he gave somebody a message and in the lobby there was Sydney all sneers I could have pinched him Just as I was coming to the conclusion that I should have to stick a pin into his arm Paul returned and positively Sydney was rude to him I was ashamed if mister Atherton was not As if it was not enough that he should be insulted by a mere popinjay at the very moment when he had been adding another stone to the fabric of his country s glory papa came up He actually wanted to take me away from Paul I should have liked to see him do it Of course I went down with Paul to the carriage leaving papa to follow if he chose He did not choose but none the less he managed to be home within three minutes after I had myself returned Then the battle began It is impossible for me to give an idea of papa in a rage There may be men who look well when they lose their temper but if there are papa is certainly not one He is always talking about the magnificence and the high breeding of the Lindons but anything less high bred than the head of the Lindons in his moments of wrath it would be hard to conceive His language I will not attempt to portray but his observations consisted mainly of abuse of Paul glorification of the Lindons and orders to me I forbid you I forbid you when papa wishes to be impressive he repeats his own words three or four times over I don t know if he imagines that they are improved by repetition if he does he is wrong I forbid you ever again to speak to that that that Here followed language I was silent My cue was to keep cool I believe that with the exception perhaps of being a little white and exceedingly sorry that papa should so forget himself I was about the same as I generally am Do you hear me do you hear what I say do you hear me miss Yes papa I hear you Then then then promise me promise that you will do as I tell you mark my words my girl you shall promise before you leave this room My dear papa do you intend me to spend the remainder of my life in the drawing room Don t you be impertinent do do don t you speak to me like that I I I won t have it I tell you what it is papa if you don t take care you ll have another attack of gout Damn gout That was the most sensible thing he said if such a tormentor as gout can be consigned to the nether regions by the mere utterance of a word by all means let the word be uttered Off he went again The man s a ruffianly rascally and so on There s not such a villainous vagabond and all the rest of it And I order you I m a Lindon and I order you I m your father and I order you I order you never to speak to such a such a various vain repetitions again and and and I order you never to look at him Listen to me papa I will promise you never to speak to Paul Lessingham again if you will promise me never to speak to Lord Cantilever again or to recognise him if you meet him in the street You should have seen how papa glared Lord Cantilever is the head of his party Its august and I presume reverenced leader He is papa s particular fetish I am not sure that he does regard him as being any lower than the angels but if he does it is certainly something in decimals My suggestion seemed as outrageous to him as his suggestion seemed to me But it is papa s misfortune that he can only see one side of a question and that s his own You you dare to compare Lord Cantilever to to that that that I am not comparing them I am not aware of there being anything in particular against Lord Cantilever that is against his character But of course I should not dream of comparing a man of his calibre with one of real ability like Paul Lessingham It would be to treat his lordship with too much severity I could not help it but that did it The rest of papa s conversation was a jumble of explosions It was all so sad Papa poured all the vials of his wrath upon Paul to his own sore disfigurement He threatened me with all the pains and penalties of the inquisition if I did not immediately promise to hold no further communication with mister Lessingham of course I did nothing of the kind He cursed me in default by bell book and candle and by ever so many other things beside He called me the most dreadful names me his only child He warned me that I should find myself in prison before I had done I am not sure that he did not hint darkly at the gallows Finally he drove me from the room in a whirlwind of anathemas CHAPTER XXVII THE TERROR BY NIGHT When I left papa or rather when papa had driven me from him I went straight to the man whom I had found in the street It was late and I was feeling both tired and worried so that I only thought of seeing for myself how he was In some way he seemed to be a link between Paul and myself and as at that moment links of that kind were precious I could not have gone to bed without learning something of his condition The nurse received me at the door Well nurse how s the patient Nurse was a plump motherly woman who had attended more than one odd protege of mine and whom I kept pretty constantly at my beck and call She held out her hands It s hard to tell He hasn t moved since I came Not moved Is he still insensible He seems to me to be in some sort of trance He does not appear to breathe and I can detect no pulsation but the doctor says he s still alive it s the queerest case I ever saw I went farther into the room Directly I did so the man in the bed gave signs of life which were sufficiently unmistakable Nurse hastened to him Why she exclaimed he s moving he might have heard you enter He not only might have done but it seemed possible that that was what he actually had done As I approached the bed he raised himself to a sitting posture as in the morning he had done in the street and he exclaimed as if he addressed himself to someone whom he saw in front of him I cannot describe the almost more than human agony which was in his voice Paul Lessingham Beware The Beetle What he meant I had not the slightest notion Probably that was why what seemed more like a pronouncement of delirium than anything else had such an extraordinary effect upon my nerves No sooner had he spoken than a sort of blank horror seemed to settle down upon my mind I actually found myself trembling at the knees I felt all at once as if I was standing in the immediate presence of something awful yet unseen As for the speaker no sooner were the words out of his lips than as was the case in the morning he relapsed into a condition of trance Nurse bending over him announced the fact He s gone off again What an extraordinary thing I suppose it is real It was clear from the tone of her voice that she shared the doubt which had troubled the policeman There s not a trace of a pulse From the look of things he might be dead Of one thing I m sure that there s something unnatural about the man No natural illness I ever heard of takes hold of a man like this Glancing up she saw that there was something unusual in my face an appearance which startled her Why Miss Marjorie what s the matter You look quite ill I felt ill and worse than ill but at the same time I was quite incapable of describing what I felt to nurse For some inscrutable reason I had even lost the control of my tongue I stammered I I I m not feeling very well nurse I I I think I ll be better in bed As I spoke I staggered towards the door conscious all the while that nurse was staring at me with eyes wide open When I got out of the room it seemed in some incomprehensible fashion as if something had left it with me and that It and I were alone together in the corridor So overcome was I by the consciousness of its immediate propinquity that all at once I found myself cowering against the wall as if I expected something or someone to strike me How I reached my bedroom I do not know I found Fanchette awaiting me For the moment her presence was a positive comfort until I realised the amazement with which she was regarding me Mademoiselle is not well Thank you Fanchette I I am rather tired I will undress myself to night you can go to bed But if mademoiselle is so tired will she not permit me to assist her The suggestion was reasonable enough and kindly too for to say the least of it she had as much cause for fatigue as I had I hesitated I should have liked to throw my arms about her neck and beg her not to leave me but the plain truth is I was ashamed In my inner consciousness I was persuaded that the sense of terror which had suddenly come over me was so absolutely causeless that I could not bear the notion of playing the craven in my maid s eyes While I hesitated something seemed to sweep past me through the air and to brush against my cheek in passing I caught at Fanchette s arm Fanchette Is there something with us in the room Something with us in the room Mademoiselle What does mademoiselle mean She looked disturbed which was on the whole excusable Fanchette is not exactly a strong minded person and not likely to be much of a support when a support was most required If I was going to play the fool I would be my own audience So I sent her off Did you not hear me tell you that I will undress myself you are to go to bed She went to bed with quite sufficient willingness The instant that she was out of the room I wished that she was back again Such a paroxysm of fear came over me that I was incapable of stirring from the spot on which I stood and it was all I could do to prevent myself from collapsing in heap on the floor I had never till then had reason to suppose that I was a coward Nor to suspect myself of being the possessor of nerves I was as little likely as anyone to be frightened by shadows I told myself that the whole thing was sheer absurdity and that I should be thoroughly ashamed of my own conduct when the morning came If you don t want to be self branded as a contemptible idiot Marjorie Lindon you will call up your courage and these foolish fears will fly But it would not do Instead of flying they grew worse I became convinced and the process of conviction was terrible beyond words that there actually was something with me in the room some invisible horror which at any moment might become visible I seemed to understand with a sense of agony which nothing can describe that this thing which was with me was with Paul That we were linked together by the bond of a common and a dreadful terror That at that moment that same awful peril which was threatening me was threatening him and that I was powerless to move a finger in his aid As with a sort of second sight I saw out of the room in which I was into another in which Paul was crouching on the floor covering his face with his hands and shrieking The vision came again and again with a degree of vividness of which I cannot give the least conception At last the horror and the reality of it goaded me to frenzy Paul Paul I screamed As soon as I found my voice the vision faded Once more I understood that as a matter of simple fact I was standing in my own bedroom that the lights were burning brightly that I had not yet commenced to remove a particle of dress Am I going mad I wondered I had heard of insanity taking extraordinary forms but what could have caused softening of the brain in me I had not the faintest notion Surely that sort of thing does not come on one in such a wholly unmitigated form without the slightest notice and that my mental faculties were sound enough a few minutes back I was certain The first premonition of anything of the kind had come upon me with the melodramatic utterance of the man I had found in the street Paul Lessingham Beware The Beetle The words were ringing in my ears What was that There was a buzzing sound behind me I turned to see what it was It moved as I moved so that it was still at my back I swung swiftly right round on my heels It still eluded me it was still behind I stood and listened what was it that hovered so persistently at my back The buzzing was distinctly audible It was like the humming of a bee Or could it be a beetle My whole life long I have had an antipathy to beetles of any sort or kind I have objected neither to rats nor mice nor cows nor bulls nor snakes nor spiders nor toads nor lizards nor any of the thousand and one other creatures animate or otherwise to which so many people have a rooted and apparently illogical dislike My pet and only horror has been beetles The mere suspicion of a harmless and I am told necessary cockroach being within several feet has always made me seriously uneasy The thought that a great winged beetle to me a flying beetle is the horror of horrors was with me in my bedroom goodness alone knew how it had got there was unendurable Anyone who had beheld me during the next few moments would certainly have supposed I was deranged I turned and twisted sprang from side to side screwed myself into impossible positions in order to obtain a glimpse of the detested visitant but in vain I could hear it all the time but see it never The buzzing sound was continually behind The terror returned I began to think that my brain must be softening I dashed to the bed Flinging myself on my knees I tried to pray But I was speechless words would not come my thoughts would not take shape I all at once became conscious as I struggled to ask help of God that I was wrestling with something evil that if I only could ask kelp of Him evil would flee But I could not I was helpless overmastered I hid my face in the bedclothes cramming my fingers into my ears But the buzzing was behind me all the time I sprang up striking out blindly wildly right and left hitting nothing the buzzing always came from a point at which at the moment I was not aiming I tore off my clothes I had on a lovely frock which I had worn for the first time that night I had had it specially made for the occasion of the Duchess ball and more especially in honour of Paul s great speech I had said to myself when I saw my image in a mirror that it was the most exquisite gown I had ever had that it suited me to perfection and that it should continue in my wardrobe for many a day if only as a souvenir of a memorable night Now in the madness of my terror all reflections of that sort were forgotten My only desire was to away with it I tore it off anyhow letting it fall in rags on the floor at my feet All else that I had on I flung in the same way after it it was a veritable holocaust of dainty garments I acting as relentless executioner who am as a rule so tender with my things I leaped upon the bed switched off the electric light hurried into bed burying myself over head and all deep down between the sheets I had hoped that by shutting out the light I might regain my senses That in the darkness I might have opportunity for sane reflection But I had made a grievous error I had exchanged bad for worse The darkness lent added terrors The light had not been out five seconds before I would have given all that I was worth to be able to switch it on again As I cowered beneath the bedclothes I heard the buzzing sound above my head the sudden silence of the darkness had rendered it more audible than it had been before The thing whatever it was was hovering above the bed It came nearer and nearer it grew clearer and clearer I felt it alight upon the coverlet shall I ever forget the sensations with which I did feel it It weighed upon me like a ton of lead How much of the seeming weight was real and how much imaginary I cannot pretend to say but that it was much heavier than any beetle I have ever seen or heard of I am sure For a time it was still and during that time I doubt if I even drew my breath Then I felt it begin to move in wobbling fashion with awkward ungainly gait stopping every now and then as if for rest I was conscious that it was progressing slowly yet surely towards the head of the bed The emotion of horror with which I realised what this progression might mean will be I fear with me to the end of my life not only in dreams but too often also in my waking hours My heart as the Psalmist has it melted like wax within me I was incapable of movement dominated by something as hideous as and infinitely more powerful than the fascination of the serpent When it reached the head of the bed what I feared with what a fear would happen did happen It began to find its way inside to creep between the sheets the wonder is I did not die I felt it coming nearer and nearer inch by inch I knew that it was upon me that escape there was none I felt something touch my hair And then oblivion did come to my aid For the first time in my life I swooned CHAPTER XXVIII THE STRANGE STORY OF THE MAN IN THE STREET I have been anticipating for some weeks past that things would become exciting and they have But hardly in the way which I foresaw It is the old story of the unexpected happening Suddenly events of the most extraordinary nature have come crowding on me from the most unlooked for quarters Let me try to take them in something like their proper order To begin with Sydney has behaved very badly So badly that it seems likely that I shall have to re cast my whole conception of his character It was nearly nine o clock this morning when I I cannot say woke up because I do not believe that I had really been asleep but when I returned to consciousness I found myself sitting up in bed trembling like some frightened child What had actually happened to me I did not know could not guess I was conscious of an overwhelming sense of nausea and generally I was feeling very far from well I endeavoured to arrange my thoughts and to decide upon some plan of action Finally I decided to go for advice and help where I had so often gone before to Sydney Atherton I went to him I told him the whole gruesome story He saw he could not help but see what a deep impress the events of the night had made on me He heard me to the end with every appearance of sympathy and then all at once I discovered that all the time papa had been concealed behind a large screen which was in the room listening to every word I had been uttering That I was dumfoundered goes without saying It was bad enough in papa but in Sydney it seemed and it was such treachery He and I have told each other secrets all our lives it has never entered my imagination as he very well knows to play him false in one jot or tittle and I have always understood that in this sort of matter men pride themselves on their sense of honour being so much keener than women s I told them some plain truths and I fancy that I left them both feeling heartily ashamed of themselves One result the experience had on me it wound me up It had on me the revivifying effect of a cold douche I realised that mine was a situation in which I should have to help myself When I returned home I learned that the man whom I had found in the street was himself again and was as conscious as he was ever likely to be Burning with curiosity to learn the nature of the connection which existed between Paul and him and what was the meaning of his oracular apostrophes I merely paused to remove my hat before hastening into his apartment When he saw me and heard who I was the expressions of his gratitude were painful in their intensity The tears streamed down his cheeks He looked to me like a man who had very little life left in him He looked weak and white and worn to a shadow Probably he never had been robust and it was only too plain that privation had robbed him of what little strength he had ever had He was nothing else but skin and bone Physical and mental debility was written large all over him He was not bad looking in a milk and watery sort of way He had pale blue eyes and very fair hair and I daresay at one time had been a spruce enough clerk It was difficult to guess his age one ages so rapidly under the stress of misfortune but I should have set him down as being about forty His voice though faint enough at first was that of an educated man and as he went on and gathered courage and became more and more in earnest he spoke with a simple directness which was close akin to eloquence It was a curious story which he had to tell So curious so astounding indeed that by the time it was finished I was in such a state of mind that I could perceive no alternative but to forgive Sydney and in spite of his recent and scandalous misbehaviour again appeal to him for assistance It seemed if the story told by the man whom I had found in the street was true and incredible though it sounded he spoke like a truthful man that Paul was threatened by some dreadful and to me wholly incomprehensible danger that it was a case in which even moments were precious and I felt that with the best will in the world it was a position in which I could not move alone The shadow of the terror of the night was with me still and with that fresh in my recollection how could I hope single handed to act effectually against the mysterious being of whom this amazing tale was told No I believed that Sydney did care for me in his own peculiar way I knew that he was quick and cool and fertile in resource and that he showed to most advantage in a difficult situation it was possible that he had a conscience of a sort and that this time I might not appeal to it in vain So I sent a servant off to fetch him helter skelter As luck would have it the servant returned with him within five minutes It appeared that he had been lunching with Dora Grayling who lives just at the end of the street and the footman had met him coming down the steps I had him shown into my own room I want you to go to the man whom I found in the street and listen to what he has to say With pleasure Can I trust you To listen to what he has to say I believe so Can I trust you to respect my confidence He was not at all abashed I never saw Sydney Atherton when he was abashed Whatever the offence of which he has been guilty he always seems completely at his ease His eyes twinkled You can I will not breathe a syllable even to papa In that case come But you understand I am going to put to the test the affirmations which you have made during all these years and to prove if you have any of the feeling for me which you pretend Directly we were in the stranger s room Sydney marched straight up to the bed stared at the man who was lying in it crammed his hands into his trouser pockets and whistled I was amazed So he exclaimed It s you Do you know this man I asked I am hardly prepared to go so far as to say that I know him but I chance to have a memory for faces and it happens that I have met this gentleman on at least one previous occasion Perhaps he remembers me Do you The stranger seemed uneasy as if he found Sidney s tone and manner disconcerting I do You are the man in the street Precisely I am that individual And you are the man who came through the window And in a much more comfortable condition you appear to be than when first I saw you Sydney turned to me It is just possible Miss Lindon that I may have a few remarks to make to this gentleman which would be better made in private if you don t mind But I do mind I mind very much What do you suppose I sent for you here for Sydney smiled that absurd provoking smile of his as if the occasion were not sufficiently serious To show that you still repose in me a vestige of your confidence Don t talk nonsense This man has told me a most extraordinary story and I have sent for you as you may believe not too willingly Sydney bowed in order that he may repeat it in your presence and in mine Is that so Well Permit me to offer you a chair this tale may turn out to be a trifle long To humour him I accepted the chair he offered though I should have preferred to stand he seated himself on the side of the bed fixing on the stranger those keen quizzical not too merciful eyes of his Well sir we are at your service if you will be so good as to favour us with a second edition of that pleasant yarn you have been spinning But let us begin at the right end what s your name My name is Robert Holt That so Then mister Robert Holt let her go Thus encouraged mister Holt repeated the tale which he had told me only in more connected fashion than before I fancy that Sydney s glances exercised on him a sort of hypnotic effect and this kept him to the point he scarcely needed a word of prompting from the first syllable to the last He told how tired wet hungry desperate despairing he had been refused admittance to the casual ward that unfailing resource as one would have supposed of those who had abandoned even hope How he had come upon an open window in an apparently empty house and thinking of nothing but shelter from the inclement night he had clambered through it How he had found himself in the presence of an extraordinary being who in his debilitated and nervous state had seemed to him to be only half human How this dreadful creature had given utterance to wild sentiments of hatred towards Paul Lessingham my Paul How he had taken advantage of Holt s enfeebled state to gain over him the most complete horrible and indeed almost incredible ascendency How he actually had sent Holt practically naked into the storm driven streets to commit burglary at Paul s house and how he Holt had actually gone without being able to offer even a shadow of opposition How Paul suddenly returning home had come upon Holt engaged in the very act of committing burglary and how on his hearing Holt make a cabalistic reference to some mysterious beetle the manhood had gone out of him and he had suffered the intruder to make good his escape without an effort to detain him The story had seemed sufficiently astonishing the first time it seemed still more astonishing the second but as I watched Sydney listening what struck me chiefly was the conviction that he had heard it all before I charged him with it directly Holt had finished This is not the first time you have been told this tale Pardon me but it is Do you suppose I live in an atmosphere of fairy tales Something in his manner made me feel sure he was deceiving me Sydney
2769_176256_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t tell me 
none	none	a story Paul has told you I am not telling you a story at least on this occasion and mister Lessingham has not told me Suppose we postpone these details to a little later And perhaps in the interim you will permit me to put a question or two to mister Holt I let him have his way though I knew he was concealing something from me that he had a more intimate acquaintance with mister Holt s strange tale than he chose to confess And for some cause his reticence annoyed me He looked at mister Holt in silence for a second or two Then he said with the quizzical little air of bland impertinence which is peculiarly his own I presume mister Holt you have been entertaining us with a novelty in fables and that we are not expected to believe this pleasant little yarn of yours I expect nothing But I have told you the truth And you know it This seemed to take Sydney aback I protest that like Miss Lindon you credit me with a more extensive knowledge than I possess However we will let that pass I take it that you paid particular attention to this mysterious habitant of this mysterious dwelling I saw that mister Holt shuddered I am not likely ever to forget him Then in that case you will be able to describe him to us To do so adequately would be beyond my powers But I will do my best If the original was more remarkable than the description which he gave of him then he must have been remarkable indeed The impression conveyed to my mind was rather of a monster than a human being I watched Sydney attentively as he followed mister Holt s somewhat lurid language and there was something in his demeanour which made me more and more persuaded that he was more behind the scenes in this strange business than he pretended or than the speaker suspected He put a question which seemed uncalled for by anything which mister Holt had said You are sure this thing of beauty was a man No sir that is exactly what I am not sure There was a note in Sydney s voice which suggested that he had received precisely the answer which he had expected Did you think it was a woman I did think so more than once Though I can hardly explain what made me think so There was certainly nothing womanly about the face He paused as if to reflect Then added I suppose it was a question of instinct I see Just so It occurs to me mister Holt that you are rather strong on questions of instinct Sydney got off the bed He stretched himself as if fatigued which is a way he has I will not do you the injustice to hint that I do not believe a word of your charming and simple narrative On the contrary I will demonstrate my perfect credence by remarking that I have not the slightest doubt that you will be able to point out to me for my particular satisfaction the delightful residence on which the whole is founded mister Holt coloured Sydney s tone could scarcely have been more significant You must remember sir that it was a dark night that I had never been in that neighbourhood before and that I was not in a condition to pay much attention to locality All of which is granted but how far was it from Hammersmith Workhouse Possibly under half a mile Then in that case surely you can remember which turning you took on leaving Hammersmith Workhouse I suppose there are not many turnings you could have taken I think I could remember Then you shall have an opportunity to try It isn t a very far cry to Hammersmith don t you think you are well enough to drive there now just you and I together in a cab I should say so I wished to get up this morning It is by the doctor s orders I have stayed in bed Then for once in a while the doctor s orders shall be ignored I prescribe fresh air Sydney turned to me Since mister Holt s wardrobe seems rather to seek don t you think a suit of one of the men might fit him if mister Holt wouldn t mind making shift for the moment Then by the time you ve finished dressing mister Holt I shall be ready While they were ascertaining which suit of clothes would be best adapted to his figure I went with Sydney to my room So soon as we were in I let him know that this was not a matter in which I intended to be trifled with Of course you understand Sydney that I am coming with you He pretended not to know what I meant Coming with me I am delighted to hear it but where To the house of which mister Holt has been speaking Nothing could give me greater pleasure but might I point out mister Holt has to find it yet I will come to help you to help him find it Sydney laughed but I could see he did not altogether relish the suggestion Three in a hansom There is such a thing as a four wheeled cab or I could order a carriage if you d like one Sydney looked at me out of the corners of his eyes then began to walk up and down the room with his hands in his trouser pockets Presently he began to talk nonsense I need not say with what a sensation of joy I should anticipate the delights of a drive with you even in a four wheeled cab but were I in your place I fancy that I should allow Holt and your humble servant to go hunting out this house of his alone It may prove a more tedious business than you imagine I promise that after the hunt is over I will describe the proceedings to you with the most literal accuracy I daresay Do you think I don t know you ve been deceiving me all the time Deceiving you I Yes you Do you think I m quite an idiot My dear Marjorie Do you think I can t see that you know all about what mister Holt has been telling us perhaps more about it than he knows himself On my word With what an amount of knowledge you do credit me Yes I do or discredit you rather If I were to trust you you would tell me just as much as you chose which would be nothing I m coming with you so there s an end Very well Do you happen to know if there are any revolvers in the house Revolvers whatever for Because I should like to borrow one I will not conceal from you since you press me that this is a case in which a revolver is quite likely to be required You are trying to frighten me I am doing nothing of the kind only under the circumstances I am bound to point out to you what it is you may expect Oh you think that you re bound to point that out do you then now your bounden duty s done As for there being any revolvers in the house papa has a perfect arsenal would you like to take them all Thanks but I daresay I shall be able to manage with one unless you would like one too You may find yourself in need of it I am obliged to you but on this occasion I don t think I ll trouble I ll run the risk Oh Sydney what a hypocrite you are It s for your sake if I seem to be I tell you most seriously that I earnestly advise you to allow mister Holt and I to manage this affair alone I don t mind going so far as to say that this is a matter with which in days to come you will wish that you had not allowed yourself to be associated What do you mean by that Do you dare to insinuate anything against Paul I insinuate nothing What I mean I say right out and my dear Marjorie what I actually do mean is this that if in spite of my urgent solicitations you will persist in accompanying us the expedition so far as I am concerned will be postponed That is what you do mean is it Then that s settled I rang the bell The servant came Order a four wheeled cab at once And let me know the moment mister Holt is ready The servant went I turned to Sydney If you will excuse me I will go and put my hat on You are of course at liberty to please yourself as to whether you will or will not go but if you don t then I shall go with mister Holt alone I moved to the door He stopped me My dear Marjorie why will you persist in treating me with such injustice Believe me you have no idea what sort of adventure this is which you are setting out upon or you would hear reason I assure you that you are gratuitously proposing to thrust yourself into imminent peril What sort of peril Why do you beat about the bush why don t you speak right out I can t speak right out there are circumstances which render it practically impossible and that s the plain truth but the danger is none the less real on that account I am not jesting I am in earnest won t you take my word for it It is not a question of taking your word only it is a question of something else beside I have not forgotten my adventures of last night and mister Holt s story is mysterious enough in itself but there is something more mysterious still at the back of it something which you appear to suggest points unpleasantly at Paul My duty is clear and nothing you can say will turn me from it Paul as you are very well aware is already over weighted with affairs of state pretty nearly borne down by them or I would take the tale to him and he would talk to you after a fashion of his own Things being as they are I propose to show you that although I am not yet Paul s wife I can make his interests my own as completely as though I were I can therefore only repeat that it is for you to decide what you intend to do but if you prefer to stay I shall go with mister Holt alone Understand that when the time for regret comes as it will come you are not to blame me for having done what I advised you not to do My dear mister Atherton I will undertake to do my utmost to guard your spotless reputation I should be sorry that anyone should hold you responsible for anything I either said or did Very well Your blood be on your own head My blood Yes your blood I shouldn t be surprised if it comes to blood before we re through Perhaps you ll oblige me with the loan of one of that arsenal of revolvers of which you spoke I let him have his old revolver or rather I let him have one of papa s new ones He put it in the hip pocket in his trousers And the expedition started in a four wheeled car CHAPTER XXIX THE HOUSE ON THE ROAD FROM THE WORKHOUSE mister Holt looked as if he was in somebody else s garments He was so thin and worn and wasted that the suit of clothes which one of the men had lent him hung upon him as on a scarecrow I was almost ashamed of myself for having incurred a share of the responsibility of taking him out of bed He seemed so weak and bloodless that I should not have been surprised if he had fainted on the road I had taken care that he should eat as much as he could eat before we started the suggestion of starvation which he had conveyed to one s mind was dreadful and I had brought a flask of brandy in case of accidents but in spite of everything I could not conceal from myself that he would be more at home in a sick bed than in a jolting cab It was not a cheerful drive There was in Sydney s manner towards me an air of protection which I instinctively resented he appeared to be regarding me as a careful and anxious nurse might regard a wrong headed and disobedient child Conversation distinctly languished Since Sydney seemed disposed to patronise me I was bent on snubbing him The result was that the majority of the remarks which were uttered were addressed to mister Holt The cab stopped after what had appeared to me to be an interminable journey I was rejoiced at the prospect of its being at an end Sydney put his head out of the window A short parley with the driver ensued This is Ammersmith Workhouse it s a large place sir which part of it might you be wanting Sydney appealed to mister Holt He put his head out of the window in his turn he did not seem to recognise our surroundings at all We have come a different way this is not the way I went I went through Hammersmith and to the casual ward I don t see that here Sydney spoke to the cabman Driver where s the casual ward That s the other end sir Then take us there He took us there Then Sydney appealed again to mister Holt Shall I dismiss the cabman or don t you feel equal to walking Thank you I feel quite equal to walking I think the exercise will do me good So the cabman was dismissed a step which we and I in particular had subsequent cause to regret mister Holt took his bearings He pointed to a door which was just in front of us That s the entrance to the casual ward and that over it is the window through which the other man threw a stone I went to the right back the way I had come We went to the right I reached this corner We had reached a corner mister Holt looked about him endeavouring to recall the way he had gone A good many roads appeared to converge at that point so that he might have wandered in either of several directions Presently he arrived at something like a decision I think this is the way I went I am nearly sure it is He led the way with something of an air of dubitation and 
2769_176256_000024_000001	train-clean-360	we followed 
none	none	The road he had chosen seemed to lead to nothing and nowhere We had not gone many yards from the workhouse gates before we were confronted by something like chaos In front and on either side of us were large spaces of waste land At some more or less remote period attempts appeared to have been made at brick making there were untidy stacks of bilious looking bricks in evidence Here and there enormous weather stained boards announced that This Desirable Land was to be Let for Building Purposes The road itself was unfinished There was no pavement and we had the bare uneven ground for sidewalk It seemed so far as I could judge to lose itself in space and to be swallowed up by the wilderness of Desirable Land which lay beyond In the near distance there were houses enough and to spare of a kind But they were in other roads In the one in which we actually were on the right at the end there was a row of unfurnished carcases but only two buildings which were in anything like a fit state for occupation One stood on either side not facing each other there was a distance between them of perhaps fifty yards The sight of them had a more exciting effect on mister Holt than it had on me He moved rapidly forward coming to a standstill in front of the one upon our left which was the nearer of the pair This is the house he exclaimed He seemed almost exhilarated I confess that I was depressed A more dismal looking habitation one could hardly imagine It was one of those dreadful jerry built houses which while they are still new look old It had quite possibly only been built a year or two and yet owing to neglect or to poverty of construction or to a combination of the two it was already threatening to tumble down It was a small place a couple of storeys high and would have been dear I should think at thirty pounds a year The windows had surely never been washed since the house was built those on the upper floor seemed all either cracked or broken The only sign of occupancy consisted in the fact that a blind was down behind the window of the room on the ground floor Curtains there were none A low wall ran in front which had apparently at one time been surmounted by something in the shape of an iron railing a rusty piece of metal still remained on one end but since there was only about a foot between it and the building which was practically built upon the road whether the wall was intended to ensure privacy or was merely for ornament was not clear This is the house repeated mister Holt showing more signs of life than I had hitherto seen in him Sydney looked it up and down it apparently appealed to his aesthetic sense as little as it did to mine Are you sure I am certain It seems empty It seemed empty to me that night that is why I got into it in search of shelter Which is the window which served you as a door This one mister Holt pointed to the window on the ground floor the one which was screened by a blind There was no sign of a blind when I first saw it and the sash was up it was that which caught my eye Once more Sydney surveyed the place in comprehensive fashion from roof to basement then he scrutinisingly regarded mister Holt You are quite sure this is the house It might be awkward if you proved mistaken I am going to knock at the door and if it turns out that that mysterious acquaintance of yours does not and never has lived here we might find an explanation difficult I am sure it is the house certain I know it I feel it here and here mister Holt touched his breast and his forehead His manner was distinctly odd He was trembling and a fevered expression had come into his eyes Sydney glanced at him for a moment in silence Then he bestowed his attention upon me May I ask if I may rely upon your preserving your presence of mind The mere question ruffled my plumes What do you mean What I say I am going to knock at that door and I am going to get through it somehow It is quite within the range of possibility that when I am through there will be some strange happenings as you have heard from mister Holt The house is commonplace enough without you may not find it so commonplace within You may find yourself in a position in which it will be in the highest degree essential that you should keep your wits about you I am not likely to let them stray Then that s all right Do I understand that you propose to come in with me Of course I do what do you suppose I ve come for What nonsense you are talking I hope that you will still continue to consider it nonsense by the time this little adventure s done That I resented his impertinence goes without saying to be talked to in such a strain by Sydney Atherton whom I had kept in subjection ever since he was in knickerbockers was a little trying but I am forced to admit that I was more impressed by his manner or his words or by mister Holt s manner or something than I should have cared to own I had not the least notion what was going to happen or what horrors that woebegone looking dwelling contained But mister Holt s story had been of the most astonishing sort my experiences of the previous night were still fresh and altogether now that I was in such close neighbourhood with the Unknown with a capital U although it was broad daylight it loomed before me in a shape for which candidly I was not prepared A more disreputable looking front door I have not seen it was in perfect harmony with the remainder of the establishment The paint was off the woodwork was scratched and dented the knocker was red with rust When Sydney took it in his hand I was conscious of quite a little thrill As he brought it down with a sharp rat tat I half expected to see the door fly open and disclose some gruesome object glaring out at us Nothing of the kind took place the door did not budge nothing happened Sydney waited a second or two then knocked again another second or two then another knock There was still no sign of any notice being taken of our presence Sydney turned to mister Holt Seems as if the place was empty mister Holt was in the most singular condition of agitation it made me uncomfortable to look at him You do not know you cannot tell there may be someone there who hears and pays no heed I ll give them another chance Sydney brought down the knocker with thundering reverberations The din must have been audible half a mile away But from within the house there was still no sign that any heard Sydney came down the step I ll try another way I may have better fortune at the back He led the way round to the rear mister Holt and I following in single file There the place seemed in worse case even than in the front There were two empty rooms on the ground floor at the back there was no mistake about their being empty without the slightest difficulty we could see right into them One was apparently intended for a kitchen and wash house combined the other for a sitting room There was not a stick of furniture in either nor the slightest sign of human habitation Sydney commented on the fact Not only is it plain that no one lives in these charming apartments but it looks to me uncommonly as if no one ever had lived in them To my thinking mister Holt s agitation was increasing every moment For some reason of his own Sydney took no notice of it whatever possibly because he judged that to do so would only tend to make it worse An odd change had even taken place in mister Holt s voice he spoke in a sort of tremulous falsetto It was only the front room which I saw Very good then before very long you shall see that front room again Sydney rapped with his knuckles on the glass panels of the back door He tried the handle when it refused to yield he gave it a vigorous shaking He saluted the dirty windows so far as succeeding in attracting attention was concerned entirely in vain Then he turned again to mister Holt half mockingly I call you to witness that I have used every lawful means to gain the favourable notice of your mysterious friend I must therefore beg to stand excused if I try something slightly unlawful for a change It is true that you found the window already open but in my case it soon will be He took a knife out of his pocket and with the open blade forced back the catch as I am told that burglars do Then he lifted the sash Behold he exclaimed What did I tell you Now my dear Marjorie if I get in first and mister Holt gets in after me we shall be in a position to open the door for you I immediately saw through his design No mister Atherton you will get in first and I will get in after you through the window before mister Holt I don t intend to wait for you to open the door Sydney raised his hands and opened his eyes as if grieved at my want of confidence But I did not mean to be left in the lurch to wait their pleasure while on pretence of opening the door they searched the house So Sydney climbed in first and I second it was not a difficult operation since the window sill was under three feet from the ground and mister Holt last Directly we were in Sydney put his hand up to his mouth and shouted Is there anybody in this house If so will he kindly step this way as there is someone wishes to see him His words went echoing through the empty rooms in a way which was almost uncanny I suddenly realised that if after all there did happen to be somebody in the house and he was at all disagreeable our presence on his premises might prove rather difficult to explain However no one answered While I was waiting for Sydney to make the next move he diverted my attention to mister Holt Hollo Holt what s the matter with you Man don t play the fool like that Something was the matter with mister Holt He was trembling all over as if attacked by a shaking palsy Every muscle in his body seemed twitching at once A strained look had come on his face which was not nice to see He spoke as with an effort I m all right It s nothing Oh is it nothing Then perhaps you ll drop it Where s that brandy I handed Sydney the flask Here swallow this mister Holt swallowed the cupful of neat spirit which Sydney offered without an attempt at parley Beyond bringing some remnants of colour to his ashen cheeks it seemed to have no effect on him whatever Sydney eyed him with a meaning in his glance which I was at a loss to understand Listen to me my lad Don t think you can deceive me by playing any of your fool tricks and don t delude yourself into supposing that I shall treat you as anything but dangerous if you do I ve got this He showed the revolver of papa s which I had lent him Don t imagine that Miss Lindon s presence will deter me from using it Why he addressed mister Holt in such a strain surpassed my comprehension mister Holt however evinced not the faintest symptoms of resentment he had become on a sudden more like an automaton than a man Sydney continued to gaze at him as if he would have liked his glance to penetrate to his inmost soul Keep in front of me if you please mister Holt and lead the way to this mysterious apartment in which you claim to have had such a remarkable experience Of me he asked in a whisper Did you bring a revolver I was startled A revolver The idea How absurd you are Sydney said something which was so rude and so uncalled for that it was worthy of papa in his most violent moments I d sooner be absurd than a fool in petticoats I was so angry that I did not know what to say and before I could say it he went on Keep your eyes and ears well open be surprised at nothing you see or hear Stick close to me And for goodness sake remain mistress of as many of your senses as you conveniently can I had not the least idea what was the meaning of it all To me there seemed nothing to make such a pother about And yet I was conscious of a fluttering of the heart as if there soon might be something I knew Sydney sufficiently well to be aware that he was one of the last men in the world to make a fuss without reason and that he was as little likely to suppose that there was a reason when as a matter of fact there was none mister Holt led the way as Sydney desired or rather commanded to the door of the room which was in front of the house The door was closed Sydney tapped on a panel All was silence He tapped again Anyone in there he demanded As there was still no answer he tried the handle The door was locked The first sign of the presence of a human being we have had doors don t lock themselves It s just possible that there may have been someone or something about the place at some time or other after all Grasping the handle firmly he shook it with all his might as he had done with the door at the back So flimsily was the place constructed that he made even the walls to tremble Within there if anyone is in there if you don t open this door I shall There was no response So be it I m going to pursue my wild career of defiance of established law and order and gain admission in one way if I can t in another Putting his right shoulder against the door he pushed with his whole force Sydney is a big man and very strong and the door was weak Shortly the lock yielded before the continuous pressure and the door flew open Sydney whistled So It begins to occur to me mister Holt that that story of yours may not have been such pure romance as it seemed It was plain enough that at any rate this room had been occupied and that recently and if his taste in furniture could be taken as a test by an eccentric occupant to boot My own first impression was that there was someone or something living in it still an uncomfortable odour greeted our nostrils which was suggestive of some evil smelling animal Sydney seemed to share my thought A pretty perfume on my word Let s shed a little more light on the subject and see what causes it Marjorie stop where you are until I tell you I had noticed nothing from without peculiar about the appearance of the blind which screened the window but it must have been made of some unusually thick material for within the room was strangely dark Sydney entered with the intention of drawing up the blind but he had scarcely taken a couple of steps when he stopped What s that It s it said mister Holt in a voice which was so unlike his own that it was scarcely recognisable It What do you mean by it The Beetle Judging from the sound of his voice Sydney was all at once in a state of odd excitement Oh is it Then if this time I don t find out the how and the why and the wherefore of that charming conjuring trick I ll give you leave to write me down an ass with a great big A He rushed farther into the room apparently his efforts to lighten it did not meet with the immediate success which he desired What s the matter with this confounded blind There s no cord How do you pull it up What the In the middle of his sentence Sydney ceased speaking Suddenly mister Holt who was standing by my side on the threshold of the door was seized with such a fit of trembling that fearing he was going to fall I caught him by the arm A most extraordinary look was on his face His eyes were distended to their fullest width as if with horror at what they saw in front of them Great beads of perspiration were on his forehead It s coming he screamed Exactly what happened I do not know But as he spoke I heard proceeding from the room the sound of the buzzing of wings Instantly it recalled my experiences of the night before as it did so I was conscious of a most unpleasant qualm Sydney swore a great oath as if he were beside himself with rage If you won t go up you shall come down I suppose failing to find a cord he seized the blind from below and dragged it down it came roller and all clattering to the floor The room was all in light I hurried in Sydney was standing by the window with a look of perplexity upon his face which under any other circumstances would have been comical He was holding papa s revolver in his hand and was glaring round and round the room as if wholly at a loss to understand how it was he did not see what he was looking for Marjorie he exclaimed Did you hear anything Of course I did It was that which I heard last night which so frightened me Oh was it Then by in his excitement he must have been completely oblivious of my presence for he used the most terrible language when I find it there ll be a small discussion It can t have got out of the room I know the creature s here I not only heard it I felt it brush against my face Holt come inside and shut that door mister Holt raised his arms as if he were exerting himself to make a forward movement but he remained rooted to the spot on which he stood I can t he cried You can t Why It won t let me What won t let you The Beetle Sydney moved till he was close in front of him He surveyed him with eager eyes I was just at his back I heard him murmur possibly to me By George It s just as I thought The beggar s hypnotised Then he said aloud Can you see it now Yes Where Behind you As mister Holt spoke I again heard quite close to me that buzzing sound Sydney seemed to hear it too it caused him to swing round so quickly that he all but whirled me off my feet I beg your pardon Marjorie but this is of the nature of an unparalleled experience didn t you hear something then I did distinctly it was close to me within an inch or two of my face We stared about us then back at each other there was nothing else to be seen Sydney laughed doubtfully It s uncommonly queer I don t want to suggest that there are visions about or I might suspect myself of softening of the brain But it s queer There s a trick about it somewhere I am convinced and no doubt it s simple enough when you know how it s done but the difficulty is to find that out Do you think our friend over there is acting He looks to me as if he were ill He does look ill He also looks as if he were hypnotised If he is it must be by suggestion and that s what makes me doubtful because it will be the first plainly established case of hypnotism by suggestion I ve encountered Holt Yes That said Sydney in my ear is the voice and that is the manner of a hypnotised man but on the other hand a person under influence generally responds only to the hypnotist which is another feature about our peculiar friend which arouses my suspicions Then aloud Don t stand there like an idiot come inside Again mister Holt made an apparently futile effort to do as he was bid It was painful to look at him he was like a feeble frightened tottering child who would come on but cannot I can t No nonsense my man Do you think that this is a performance in a booth and that I am to be taken in by all the humbug of the professional mesmerist Do as I tell you come into the room There was a repetition on mister Holt s part of his previous pitiful struggle this time it was longer sustained than before but the result was the same I can t he wailed Then I say you can and shall If I pick you up and carry you perhaps you will not find yourself so helpless as you wish me to suppose Sydney moved forward to put his threat into execution As he did so a strange alteration took place in mister Holt s demeanour CHAPTER XXX THE SINGULAR BEHAVIOUR OF mister HOLT I was standing in the middle of the room Sydney was between the door and me mister Holt was in the hall just outside the doorway in which he so to speak was framed As Sydney advanced towards him he was seized with a kind of convulsion he had to lean against the side of the door to save himself from falling Sydney paused and watched The spasm went as suddenly as it came mister Holt became as motionless as he had just now been the other way He stood in an attitude of febrile expectancy his chin raised his head thrown back his eyes glancing upwards with the dreadful fixed glare which had come into them ever since we had entered the house He looked to me as if his every faculty was strained in the act of listening not a muscle in his body seemed to move he was as rigid as a figure carved in stone Presently the rigidity gave place to what to an onlooker seemed causeless agitation I hear he exclaimed in the most curious voice I had ever heard I come It was as though he was speaking to someone who was far away Turning he walked down the passage to the front door Hollo cried Sydney Where are you off to We both of us hastened to see He was fumbling with the latch before we could reach him the door was open and he was through it Sydney rushing after him caught him on the step and held him by the arm What s the meaning of this little caper Where do you think you re going now mister Holt did not condescend to turn and look at him He said in the same dreamy faraway unnatural tone of voice and he kept his unwavering gaze fixed on what was apparently some distant object which was visible only to himself I am going to him He calls me Who calls you The Lord of the Beetle Whether Sydney released his arm or not I cannot say As he spoke he seemed to me to slip away from Sydney s grasp Passing through the gateway turning to the right he commenced to retrace his steps in the direction we had come Sydney stared after him in unequivocal amazement Then he looked at me Well this is a pretty fix now what s to be done What s the matter with him I inquired Is he mad There s method in his madness if he is He s in the same condition in which he was that night I saw him come out of the Apostle s window Sydney has a horrible habit of calling Paul the Apostle I have spoken to him about it over and over again but my words have not made much impression He ought to be followed he may be sailing off to that mysterious friend of his this instant But on the other hand he mayn t and it may be nothing but a trick of our friend the conjurer s to get us away from this elegant abode of his He s done me twice already I don t want to be done again and I distinctly do not want him to return and find me missing He s quite capable of taking the hint and removing himself into the Ewigkeit when the clue to as pretty a mystery as ever I came across will have vanished I can stay I said You Alone He eyed me doubtingly evidently not altogether relishing the proposition Why not You might send the first person you meet policeman cabman or whoever it is to keep me company It seems a pity now that we dismissed that cab Yes it does seem a pity Sydney was biting his lip Confound that fellow how fast he moves mister Holt was already nearing the end of the road If you think it necessary by all means follow to see where he goes you are sure to meet somebody whom you will be able to send before you have gone very far I suppose I shall You won t mind being left alone Why should I I m not a child mister Holt reaching the corner turned it and vanished out of sight Sydney gave an exclamation of impatience If I don t make haste I shall lose him I ll do as you suggest dispatch the first individual I come across to hold watch and ward with you That ll be all right He started off at a run shouting to me as he went It won t be five minutes before somebody comes I waved my hand to him I watched him till he reached the end of the road Turning he waved his hand to me Then he vanished as mister Holt had done And I was alone CHAPTER XXXI THE TERROR BY DAY My first impulse after Sydney s disappearance was to laugh Why should he display anxiety on my behalf merely because I was to be the sole occupant of an otherwise empty house for a few minutes more or less and in broad daylight too To say the least the anxiety seemed unwarranted I lingered at the gate for a moment or two wondering what was at the bottom of mister Holt s singular proceedings and what Sydney really proposed to gain by acting as a spy upon his wanderings Then I turned to re enter the house As I did so another problem suggested itself to my mind what connection of the slightest importance could a man in Paul Lessingham s position have with the eccentric being who had established himself in such an unsatisfactory dwelling place mister Holt s story I had only dimly understood it struck me that it would require a deal of understanding It was more like a farrago of nonsense an outcome of delirium than a plain statement of solid facts To tell the truth Sydney had taken it more seriously than I expected He seemed to see something in it which I emphatically did not What was double Dutch to me seemed clear as print to him So far as I could judge he actually had the presumption to imagine that Paul my Paul Paul Lessingham the great Paul Lessingham was mixed up in the very mysterious adventures of poor weak minded hysterical mister Holt in a manner which was hardly to his credit Of course any idea of the kind was purely and simply balderdash Exactly what bee Sydney had got in his bonnet I could not guess But I did know Paul Only let me find myself face to face with the fantastic author of mister Holt s weird tribulations and I a woman single handed would do my best to show him that whoever played pranks with Paul Lessingham trifled with edged tools I had returned to that historical front room which according to mister Holt had been the scene of his most disastrous burglarious entry Whoever had furnished it had had original notions of the resources of modern upholstery There was not a table in the place no chair or couch nothing to sit down upon except the bed On the floor there was a marvellous carpet which was apparently of eastern manufacture It was so thick and so pliant to the tread that moving over it was like walking on thousand year old turf It was woven in gorgeous colours and covered with When I discovered what it actually was covered with I was conscious of a disagreeable sense of surprise It was covered with beetles All over it with only a few inches of space between each were representations of some peculiar kind of beetle it was the same beetle over and over and over The artist had woven his undesirable subject into the warp and woof of the material with such cunning skill that as one continued to gaze one began to wonder if by any possibility the creatures could be alive In spite of the softness of the texture and the art of a kind which had been displayed in the workmanship I rapidly arrived at the conclusion that it was the most uncomfortable carpet I had ever seen I wagged my finger at the repeated portrayals of the to me unspeakable insect If I had discovered that you were there before Sydney went I think it just possible that I should have hesitated before I let him go Then there came a revulsion of feeling I shook myself You ought to be ashamed of yourself Marjorie Lindon to even think such nonsense Are you all nerves and morbid imaginings you who have prided yourself on being so strong minded A pretty sort you are to do battle for anyone Why they re only make believes Half involuntarily I drew my foot over one of the creatures Of course it was nothing but imagination but I seemed to feel it squelch beneath my shoe It was disgusting Come I cried This won t do As Sydney would phrase it am I going to make an idiot of myself I turned to the window looking at my watch It s more than five minutes ago since Sydney went That companion of mine ought to be already on the way I ll go and see if he is coming I went to the gate There was not a soul in sight It was with such a distinct sense of disappointment that I perceived this was so that I was in two minds what to do To remain where I was looking with gaping eyes for the policeman or the cabman or whoever it was Sydney was dispatching to act as my temporary associate was tantamount to acknowledging myself a simpleton while I was conscious of a most unmistakable reluctance to return within the house Common sense or what I took for common sense however triumphed and after loitering for another five minutes I did go in again This time ignoring to the best of my ability the beetles on the floor I proceeded to expend my curiosity and occupy my thoughts in an examination of the bed It only needed a very cursory examination however to show that the seeming bed was in reality none at all or if it was a bed after the manner of the Easterns it certainly was not after the fashion of the Britons There was no framework nothing to represent the bedstead It was simply a heap of rugs piled apparently indiscriminately upon the floor A huge mass of them there seemed to be of all sorts and shapes and sizes and materials too The top one was of white silk in quality exquisite It was of huge size yet with a little compression one might almost have passed it through the proverbial wedding ring So far as space admitted I spread it out in front of me In the middle was a picture whether it was embroidered on the substance or woven in it I could not quite make out Nor at first could I gather what it was the artist had intended to depict there was a brilliancy about it which was rather dazzling By degrees I realised that the lurid hues were meant for flames and when one had got so far one perceived that they were by no means badly imitated either Then the meaning of the thing dawned on me it was a representation of a human sacrifice In its way as ghastly a piece of realism as one could see On the right was the majestic seated figure of a goddess Her hands were crossed upon her knees and she was naked from her waist upwards I fancied it was meant for Isis On her brow was perched a gaily apparelled beetle that ubiquitous beetle forming a bright spot of colour against her coppery skin it was an exact reproduction of the creatures which were imaged on the carpet In front of the idol was an enormous fiery furnace In the very heart of the flames was an altar On the altar was a naked white woman being burned alive There could be no doubt as to her being alive for she was secured by chains in such a fashion that she was permitted a certain amount of freedom of which she was availing herself to contort and twist her body into shapes which were horribly suggestive of the agony which she was enduring the artist indeed seemed to have exhausted his powers in his efforts to convey a vivid impression of the pains which were tormenting her A pretty picture on my word A pleasant taste in art the garnitures of this establishment suggest The person who likes to live with this kind of thing especially as a covering to his bed must have his own notions as to what constitute agreeable surroundings As I continued staring at the thing all at once it seemed as if the woman on the altar moved It was preposterous but she appeared to gather her limbs together and turn half over What can be the matter with me Am I going mad She can t be moving If she wasn t then certainly something was she was lifted right into the air An idea occurred to me I snatched the rug aside The mystery was explained A thin yellow wrinkled hand was protruding from amidst the heap of rugs it was its action which had caused the seeming movement of the figure on the altar I stared confounded The hand was followed by an arm the arm by a shoulder the shoulder by a head and the most awful hideous wicked looking face I had ever pictured even in my most dreadful dreams A pair of baleful eyes were glaring up at mine I understood the position in a flash of startled amazement Sydney in following mister Holt had started on a wild goose chase after all I was alone with the occupant of that mysterious house the chief actor in mister Holt s astounding tale He had been hidden in the heap of rugs all the while BOOK IV In Pursuit The Conclusion of the Matter is extracted from the Case Book of the honorable Augustus Champnell Confidential Agent CHAPTER XXXII A NEW CLIENT On the afternoon of Friday June two eighteen I was entering in my case book some memoranda having reference to the very curious matter of the Duchess of Datchet s Deed box It was about two o clock Andrews came in and laid a card upon my desk On it was inscribed mister Paul Lessingham Show mister Lessingham in Andrews showed him in I was of course familiar with mister Lessingham s appearance but it was the first time I had had with him any personal communication He held out his hand to me You are mister Champnell I am I believe that I have not had the honour of meeting you before mister Champnell but with your father the Earl of Glenlivet I have the pleasure of some acquaintance I bowed He looked at me fixedly as if he were trying to make out what sort of man I was You are very young mister Champnell I have been told that an eminent offender in that respect once asserted that youth is not of necessity a crime And you have chosen a singular profession one in which one hardly looks for juvenility You yourself mister Lessingham are not old In a statesman one expects grey hairs I trust that I am sufficiently ancient to be able to do you service He smiled I think it possible I have heard of you more than once mister Champnell always to your advantage My friend Sir John Seymour was telling me only the other day that you have recently conducted for him some business of a very delicate nature with much skill and tact and he warmly advised me if ever I found myself in a predicament to come to you I find myself in a predicament now Again I bowed A predicament I fancy of an altogether unparalleled sort I take it that anything I may say to you will be as though it were said to a father confessor You may rest assured of that Good Then to make the matter clear to you I must begin by telling you a story if I may trespass on your patience to that extent I will endeavour not to be more verbose than the occasion requires I offered him a chair placing it in such a position that the light from the window would have shone full upon his face With the calmest possible air as if unconscious of my design he carried the chair to the other side of my desk twisting it right round before he sat on it so that now the light was at his back and on my face Crossing his legs clasping his hands about his knee he sat in silence for some moments as if turning something over in his mind He glanced round the room I suppose mister Champnell that some singular tales have been told in here Some very singular tales indeed I am never appalled by singularity It is my normal atmosphere And yet I should be disposed to wager that you have never listened to so strange a story as that which I am about to tell you now So astonishing indeed is the chapter in my life which I am about to open out to you that I have more than once had to take myself to task and fit the incidents together with mathematical accuracy in order to assure myself of its perfect truth He paused There was about his demeanour that suggestion of reluctance which I not uncommonly discover in individuals who are about to take the skeletons from their cupboards and parade them before my eyes His next remark seemed to point to the fact that he perceived what was passing through my thoughts My position is not rendered easier by the circumstance that I am not of a communicative nature I am not in sympathy with the spirit of the age which craves for personal advertisement I hold that the private life even of a public man should be held inviolate I resent with peculiar bitterness the attempts of prying eyes to peer into matters which as it seems to me concern myself alone You must therefore bear with me mister Champnell if I seem awkward in disclosing to you certain incidents in my career which I had hoped would continue locked in the secret depository of my own bosom at any rate till I was carried to the grave I am sure you will suffer me to stand excused if I frankly admit that it is only an irresistible chain of incidents which has constrained me to make of you a confidant My experience tells me mister Lessingham that no one ever does come to me until they are compelled In that respect I am regarded as something worse even than a medical man A wintry smile flitted across his features it was clear that he regarded me as a good deal worse than a medical man Presently he began to tell me one of the most remarkable tales which even I had heard As he proceeded I understood how strong and how natural had been his desire for reticence On the mere score of credibility he must have greatly preferred to have kept his own counsel For my part I own unreservedly that I should have deemed the tale incredible had it been told me by Tom Dick or Harry instead of by Paul Lessingham CHAPTER XXXIII WHAT CAME OF LOOKING THROUGH A LATTICE He began in accents which halted not a little By degrees his voice grew firmer Words came from him with greater fluency I am not yet forty So when I tell you that twenty years ago I was a mere youth I am stating what is a sufficiently obvious truth It is twenty years ago since the events of which I am going to speak transpired I lost both my parents when I was quite a lad and by their death I was left in a position in which I was to an unusual extent in one so young my own master I was ever of a rambling turn of mind and when at the mature age of eighteen I left school I decided that I should learn more from travel than from sojourn at a university So since there was no one to say me nay instead of going either to Oxford or Cambridge I went abroad After a few months I found myself in Egypt I was down with fever at Shepheard s Hotel in Cairo I had caught it by drinking polluted water during an excursion with some Bedouins to Palmyra When the fever had left me I went out one night into the town in search of amusement I went unaccompanied into the native quarter not a wise thing to do especially at night but at eighteen one is not always wise and I was weary of the monotony of the sick room and eager for something which had in it a spice of adventure I found myself in a street which I have reason to believe is no longer existing It had a French name and was called the Rue de Rabagas I saw the name on the corner as I turned into it and it has left an impress on the tablets of my memory which is never likely to be obliterated It was a narrow street and of course a dirty one ill lit and apparently at the moment of my appearance deserted I had gone perhaps half way down its tortuous length blundering more than once into the kennel wondering what fantastic whim had brought me into such unsavoury quarters and what would happen to me if as seemed extremely possible I lost my way On a sudden my ears were saluted by sounds which proceeded from a house which I was passing sounds of music and of singing I paused I stood awhile to listen There was an open window on my right which was screened by latticed blinds From the room which was behind these blinds the sounds were coming Someone was singing accompanied by an instrument resembling a guitar singing uncommonly well mister Lessingham stopped A stream of recollection seemed to come flooding over him A dreamy look came into his eyes I remember it all as clearly as if it were yesterday How it all comes back the dirty street the evil smells the imperfect light the girl s voice filling all at once the air It was a girl s voice full and round and sweet an organ seldom met with especially in such a place as that She sang a little chansonnette which just then half Europe was humming it occurred in an opera which they were acting at one of the Boulevard theatres La P tite Voyageuse The effect coming so unexpectedly was startling I stood and heard her to an end Inspired by I know not what impulse of curiosity when the song was finished I moved one of the lattice blinds a little aside so as to enable me to get a glimpse of the singer I found myself looking into what seemed to be a sort of cafe one of those places which are found all over the Continent in which women sing in order to attract custom There was a low platform at one end of the room and on it were seated three women One of them had evidently just been accompanying her own song she still had an instrument of music in her hands and was striking a few idle notes The other two had been acting as audience They were attired in the fantastic apparel which the women who are found in such places generally wear An old woman was sitting knitting in a corner whom I took to be the inevitable patronne With the exception of these four the place was empty They must have heard me touch the lattice or seen it moving for no sooner did I glance within than the three pairs of eyes on the platform were raised and fixed on mine The old woman in the corner alone showed no consciousness of my neighbourhood We eyed one another in silence for a second or two Then the girl with the harp the instrument she was manipulating proved to be fashioned more like a harp than a guitar called out to me Entrez monsieur Soye le bienvenu I was a little tired Rather curious as to whereabouts I was the place struck me even at that first momentary glimpse as hardly in the ordinary line of that kind of thing And not unwilling to listen to a repetition of the former song or to another sung by the same singer On condition I replied that you sing me another song Ah monsieur with the greatest pleasure in the world I will sing you twenty She was almost if not quite as good as her word She entertained me with song after song I may safely say that I have seldom if ever heard melody more enchanting All languages seemed to be the same to her She sang in French and Italian German and English in tongues with which I was unfamiliar It was in these Eastern harmonies that she was most successful They were indescribably weird and thrilling and she delivered them with a verve and sweetness which was amazing I sat at one of the little tables with which the room was dotted listening entranced Time passed more rapidly than I supposed While she sang I sipped the liquor with which the old woman had supplied me So enthralled was I by the display of the girl s astonishing gifts that I did not notice what it was I was drinking Looking back I can only surmise that it was some poisonous concoction of the creature s own That one small glass had on me the strangest effect I was still weak from the fever which I had only just succeeded in shaking off and that no doubt had something to do with the result But as I continued to sit I was conscious that I was sinking into a lethargic condition against which I was incapable of struggling After a while the original performer ceased her efforts and her companions taking her place she came and joined me at the little table Looking at my watch I was surprised to perceive the lateness of the hour I rose to leave She caught me by the wrist Do not go she said she spoke English of a sort and with the queerest accent All is well with you Rest awhile You will smile I should smile perhaps were I the listener instead of you but it is the simple truth that her touch had on me what I can only describe as a magnetic influence As her fingers closed upon my wrist I felt as powerless in her grasp as if she held me with bands of steel What seemed an invitation was virtually a command I had to stay whether I would or wouldn t She called for more liquor and at what again was really her command I drank of it I do not think that after she touched my wrist I uttered a word She did all the talking And while she talked she kept her eyes fixed on my face Those eyes of hers They were a devil s I can positively affirm that they had on me a diabolical effect They robbed me of my consciousness of my power of volition of my capacity to think they made me as wax in her hands My last recollection of that fatal night is of her sitting in front of me bending over the table stroking my wrist with her extended fingers staring at me with her awful eyes After that a curtain seems to descend There comes a period of oblivion mister Lessingham ceased His manner was calm and self contained enough but in spite of that I could see that the mere recollection of the things which he told me moved his nature to its foundations There was eloquence in the drawn lines about his mouth and in the strained expression of his eyes So far his tale was sufficiently commonplace Places such as the one which he described abound in the Cairo of to day and many are the Englishmen who have entered them to their exceeding bitter cost With that keen intuition which has done him yeoman s service in the political arena mister Lessingham at once perceived the direction my thoughts were taking You have heard this tale before No doubt And often The traps are many and the fools and the unwary are not a few The singularity of my experience is still to come You must forgive me if I seem to stumble in the telling I am anxious to present my case as baldly and with as little appearance of exaggeration as possible I say with as little appearance for some appearance of exaggeration I fear is unavoidable My case is so unique and so out of the common run of our every day experience that the plainest possible statement must smack of the sensational As I fancy you have guessed when understanding returned to me I found myself in an apartment with which I was unfamiliar I was lying undressed on a heap of rugs in a corner of a low pitched room which was furnished in a fashion which when I grasped the details filled me with amazement By my side knelt the Woman of the Songs Leaning over she wooed my mouth with kisses I cannot describe to you the sense of horror and of loathing with which the contact of her lips oppressed me There was about her something so unnatural so inhuman that I believe even then I could have destroyed her with as little sense of moral turpitude as if she had been some noxious insect Where am I I exclaimed You are with the children of Isis she replied What she meant I did not know and do not to this hour You are in the hands of the great goddess of the mother of men How did I come here By the loving kindness of the great mother I do not of course pretend to give you the exact text of her words but they were to that effect Half raising myself on the heap of rugs I gazed about me and was astounded at what I saw The place in which I was though the reverse of lofty was of considerable size I could not conceive whereabouts it could be The walls and roof were of bare stone as though the whole had been hewed out of the solid rock It seemed to be some sort of temple and was redolent with the most extraordinary odour An altar stood about the centre fashioned out of a single block of stone On it a fire burned with a faint blue flame the fumes which rose from it were no doubt chiefly responsible for the prevailing perfumes Behind it was a huge bronze figure more than life size It was in a sitting posture and represented a woman Although it resembled no portrayal of her I have seen either before or since I came afterwards to understand that it was meant for Isis On the idol s brow was poised a beetle That the creature was alive seemed clear for as I looked at it it opened and shut its wings If the one on the forehead of the goddess was the only live beetle which the place contained it was not the only representation It was modelled in the solid stone of the roof and depicted in flaming colours on hangings which here and there were hung against the walls Wherever the eye turned it rested on a scarab The effect was bewildering It was as though one saw things through the distorted glamour of a nightmare I asked myself if I were not still dreaming if my appearance of consciousness were not after all a mere delusion if I had really regained my senses And here mister Champnell I wish to point out and to emphasise the fact that I am not prepared to positively affirm what portion of my adventures in that extraordinary and horrible place was actuality and what the product of a feverish imagination Had I been persuaded that all I thought I saw I really did see I should have opened my lips long ago let the consequences to myself have been what they might But there is the crux The happenings were of such an incredible character and my condition was such an abnormal one I was never really myself from the first moment to the last that I have hesitated and still do hesitate to assert where precisely fiction ended and fact began With some misty notion of testing my actual condition I endeavoured to get off the heap of rugs on which I reclined As I did so the woman at my side laid her hand against my chest lightly But had her gentle pressure been the equivalent of a ton of iron it could not have been more effectual I collapsed sank back upon the rugs and lay there panting for breath wondering if I had crossed the border line which divides madness from sanity Let me get up let me go I gasped Nay she murmured stay with me yet awhile O my beloved And again she kissed me Once more mister Lessingham paused An involuntary shudder went all over him In spite of the evidently great effort which he was making to retain his self control his features were contorted by an anguished spasm For some seconds he seemed at a loss to find words to enable him to continue When he did go on his voice was harsh and strained I am altogether incapable of even hinting to you the nauseous nature of that woman s kisses They filled me with an indescribable repulsion I look back at them with a feeling of physical mental and moral horror across an interval of twenty years The most dreadful part of it was that I was wholly incapable of offering even the faintest resistance to her caresses I lay there like a log She did with me as she would and in dumb agony I endured He took his handkerchief from his pocket and although the day was cool with it he wiped the perspiration from his brow To dwell in detail on what occurred during my involuntary sojourn in that fearful place is beyond my power I cannot even venture to attempt it The attempt were it made would be futile and to me painful beyond measure I seem to have seen all that happened as in a glass darkly with about it all an element of unreality As I have already remarked the things which revealed themselves dimly to my perception seemed too bizarre too hideous to be true It was only afterwards when I was in a position to compare dates that I was enabled to determine what had been the length of my imprisonment It appears that I was in that horrible den more than two months two unspeakable months And the whole time there were comings and goings a phantasmagoric array of eerie figures continually passed to and fro before my hazy eyes What I judge to have been religious services took place in which the altar the bronze image and the beetle on its brow figure largely Not only were they conducted with a bewildering confusion of mysterious rites but if my memory is in the least degree trustworthy they were orgies of nameless horrors I seem to have seen things take place at them at the mere thought of which the brain reels and trembles Indeed it is in connection with the cult of the obscene deity to whom these wretched creatures paid their scandalous vows that my most awful memories seem to have been associated It may have been I hope it was a mirage born of my half delirious state but it seemed to me that they offered human sacrifices When mister Lessingham said this I pricked up my ears For reasons of my own which will immediately transpire I had been wondering if he would make any reference to a human sacrifice He noted my display of interest but misapprehended the cause I see you start I do not wonder But I repeat that unless I was the victim of some extraordinary species of double sight in which case the whole business would resolve itself into the fabric of a dream and I should indeed thank God I saw on more than one occasion a human sacrifice offered on that stone altar presumably to the grim image which looked down on it And unless I err in each case the sacrificial object was a woman stripped to the skin as white as you or I and before they burned her they subjected her to every variety of outrage of which even the minds of demons could conceive More than once since then I have seemed to hear the shrieks of the victims ringing through the air mingled with the triumphant cries of her frenzied murderers and the music of their harps It was the cumulative horrors of such a scene which gave me the strength or the courage or the madness I know not which it was to burst the bonds which bound me and which even in the bursting made of me even to this hour a haunted man There had been a sacrifice unless as I have repeatedly observed the whole was nothing but a dream A woman a young and lovely Englishwoman if I could believe the evidence of my own eyes had been outraged and burnt alive while I lay there helpless looking on The business was concluded The ashes of the victim had been consumed by the participants The worshippers had departed I was left alone with the woman of the songs who apparently acted as the guardian of that worse than slaughterhouse She was as usual after such an orgie rather a devil than a human being drunk with an insensate frenzy delirious with inhuman longings As she approached to offer to me her loathed caresses I was on a sudden conscious of something which I had not felt before when in her company It was as though something had slipped away from me some weight which had oppressed me some bond by which I had been bound I was aroused all at once to a sense of freedom to a knowledge that the blood which coursed through my veins was after all my own that I was master of my own honour I can only suppose that through all those weeks she had kept me there in a state of mesmeric stupor That taking advantage of the weakness which the fever had left behind by the exercise of her diabolical arts she had not allowed me to pass out of a condition of hypnotic trance Now for some reason the cord was loosed Possibly her absorption in her religious duties had caused her to forget to tighten it Anyhow as she approached me she approached a man and one who for the first time for many a day was his own man She herself seemed wholly unconscious of anything of the kind As she drew nearer to me and nearer she appeared to be entirely oblivious of the fact that I was anything but the fibreless emasculated creature which up to that moment she had made of me But she knew it when she touched me when she stooped to press her lips to mine At that instant the accumulating rage which had been smouldering in my breast through all those leaden torturing hours sprang into flame Leaping off my couch of rugs I flung my hands about her throat and then she knew I was awake Then she strove to tighten the cord which she had suffered to become unduly loose Her baleful eyes were fixed on mine I knew that she was putting out her utmost force to trick me of my manhood But I fought with her like one possessed and I conquered in a fashion I compressed her throat with my two hands as with an iron vice I knew that I was struggling for more than life that the odds were all against me that I was staking my all upon the casting of a die I stuck at nothing which could make me victor Tighter and tighter my pressure grew I did not stay to think if I was killing her till on a sudden mister Lessingham stopped He stared with fixed glassy eyes as if the whole was being re enacted in front of him His voice faltered I thought he would break down But with an effort he continued On a sudden I felt her slipping from between my fingers Without the slightest warning in an instant she had vanished and where not a moment before she herself had been I found myself confronting a monstrous beetle a huge writhing creation of some wild nightmare At first the creature stood as high as I did But as I stared at it in stupefied amazement as you may easily imagine the thing dwindled while I gazed I did not stop to see how far the process of dwindling continued a stark raving madman for the nonce I fled as if all the fiends in hell were at my heels CHAPTER XXXIV AFTER TWENTY YEARS How I reached the open air I cannot tell you I do not know I have a confused recollection of rushing through vaulted passages through endless corridors of trampling over people who tried to arrest my passage and the rest is blank When I again came to myself I was lying in the house of an American missionary named Clements I had been found at early dawn stark naked in a Cairo street and picked up for dead Judging from appearances I must have wandered for miles all through the night Whence I had come or whither I was going none could tell I could not tell myself For weeks I hovered between life and death The kindness of mister and missus Clements was not to be measured by words I was brought to their house a penniless helpless battered stranger and they gave me all they had to offer without money and without price with no expectation of an earthly reward Let no one pretend that there is no Christian charity under the sun The debt I owed that man and woman I was never able to repay Before I was properly myself again and in a position to offer some adequate testimony of the gratitude I felt missus Clements was dead drowned during an excursion on the Nile and her husband had departed on a missionary expedition into Central Africa from which he never returned Although in a measure my physical health returned for months after I had left the roof of my hospitable hosts I was in a state of semi imbecility I suffered from a species of aphasia For days together I was speechless and could remember nothing not even my own name And when that stage had passed and I began to move more freely among my fellows for years I was but a wreck of my former self I was visited at all hours of the day and night by frightful I know not whether to call them visions they were real enough to me but since they were visible to no one but myself perhaps that is the word which best describes them Their presence invariably plunged me into a state of abject terror against which I was unable to even make a show of fighting To such an extent did they embitter my existence that I voluntarily placed myself under the treatment of an expert in mental pathology For a considerable period of time I was under his constant supervision but the visitations were as inexplicable to him as they were to me By degrees however they became rarer and rarer until at last I flattered myself that I had once more become as other men After an interval to make sure I devoted myself to politics Thenceforward I have lived as they phrase it in the public eye Private life in any peculiar sense of the term I have had none mister Lessingham ceased His tale was not uninteresting and to say the least of it was curious But I still was at a loss to understand what it had to do with me or what was the purport of his presence in my room Since he remained silent as if the matter so far as he was concerned was at an end I told him so I presume mister Lessingham that all this is but a prelude to the play At present I do not see where it is that I come in Still for some seconds he was silent When he spoke his voice was grave and sombre as if he were burdened by a weight of woe Unfortunately as you put it all this has been but a prelude to the play Were it not so I should not now stand in such pressing want of the services of a confidential agent that is of an experienced man of the world who has been endowed by nature with phenomenal perceptive faculties and in whose capacity and honour I can place the completest confidence I smiled the compliment was a pointed one I hope your estimate of me is not too high I hope not for my sake as well as for your own I have heard great things of you If ever man stood in need of all that human skill and acumen can do for him I certainly am he His words aroused my curiosity I was conscious of feeling more interested than heretofore I will do my best for you Man can do no more Only give my best a trial I will At once He looked at me long and earnestly Then leaning forward he said lowering his voice perhaps unconsciously The fact is mister Champnell that quite recently events have happened which threaten to bridge the chasm of twenty years and to place me face to face with that plague spot of the past At this moment I stand in imminent peril of becoming again the wretched thing I was when I fled from that den of all the devils It is to guard me against this that I have come to you I want you to unravel the tangled thread which threatens to drag me to my doom and when unravelled to sunder it for ever if God wills in twain Explain To be frank for the moment I thought him mad He went on Three weeks ago when I returned late one night from a sitting in the House of Commons I found on my study table a sheet of paper on which there was a representation marvellously like of the creature into which as it seemed to me the woman of the songs was transformed as I clutched her throat between my hands The mere sight of it brought back one of those visitations of which I have told you and which I thought I had done with for ever I was convulsed by an agony of fear thrown into a state approximating to a paralysis both of mind and body But why I cannot tell you I only know that I have never dared to allow my thoughts to recur to that last dread scene lest the mere recurrence should drive me mad What was this you found upon your study table merely a drawing It was a representation produced by what process I cannot say which was so wonderfully so diabolically like the original that for a moment I thought the thing itself was on my table Who put it there That is precisely what I wish you to find out what I wish you to make it your instant business to ascertain I have found the thing under similar circumstances on three separate occasions on my study table and each time it has had on me the same hideous effect Each time after you have returned from a late sitting in the House of Commons Exactly Where are these what shall I call them delineations That again I cannot tell you What do you mean What I say Each time when I recovered the thing had vanished Sheet of paper and all Apparently though on that point I could not be positive You will understand that my study table is apt to be littered with sheets of paper and I could not absolutely determine that the thing had not stared at me from one of those The delineation itself to use your word certainly had vanished I began to suspect that this was a case rather for a doctor than for a man of my profession And hinted as much Don t you think it is possible mister Lessingham that you have been overworking yourself that you have been driving your brain too hard and that you have been the victim of an optical delusion I thought so myself I may say that I almost hoped so But wait till I have finished You will find that there is no loophole in that direction He appeared to be recalling events in their due order His manner was studiously cold as if he were endeavouring despite the strangeness of his story to impress me with the literal accuracy of each syllable he uttered The night before last on returning home I found in my study a stranger A stranger Yes In other words a burglar A burglar I see Go on He had paused His demeanour was becoming odder and odder On my entry he was engaged in forcing an entry into my bureau I need hardly say that I advanced to seize him But I could not You could not How do you mean you could not I mean simply what I say You must understand that this was no ordinary felon Of what nationality he was I cannot tell you He only uttered two words and they were certainly in English but apart from that he was dumb He wore no covering on his head or feet Indeed his only garment was a long dark flowing cloak which as it fluttered about him revealed that his limbs were bare An unique costume for a burglar The instant I saw him I realised that he was in some way connected with that adventure in the Rue de Rabagas What he said and did proved it to the hilt What did he say and do As I approached to effect his capture he pronounced aloud two words which recalled that awful scene the recollection of which always lingers in my brain and of which I never dare to permit myself to think Their very utterance threw me into a sort of convulsion What were the words mister Lessingham opened his mouth and shut it A marked change took place in the expression of his countenance His eyes became fixed and staring resembling the glassy orbs of the somnambulist For a moment I feared that he was going to give me an object lesson in the visitations of which I had heard so much I rose with a view of offering him assistance He motioned me back Thank you It will pass away His voice was dry and husky unlike his usual silvern tones After an uncomfortable interval he managed to continue You see for yourself mister Champnell what a miserable weakling when this subject is broached I still remain I cannot utter the words the stranger uttered I cannot even write them down For some inscrutable reason they have on me an effect similar to that which spells and incantations had on people in tales of witchcraft I suppose mister Lessingham that there is no doubt that this mysterious stranger was not himself an optical delusion Scarcely There is the evidence of my servants to prove the contrary Did your servants see him Some of them yes Then there is the evidence of the bureau The fellow had smashed the top right in two When I came to examine the contents I learned that a packet of letters was missing They were letters which I had received from Miss Lindon a lady whom I hope to make my wife This also I state to you in confidence What use would he be likely to make of them If matters stand as I fear they do he might make a very serious misuse of them If the object of these wretches after all these years is a wild revenge they would be capable having discovered what she is to me of working Miss Lindon a fatal mischief or at the very least of poisoning her mind I see How did the thief escape did he like the delineation vanish into air He escaped by the much more prosaic method of dashing through the drawing room window and clambering down from the verandah into the street where he ran right into someone s arms Into whose arms a constable s No into mister Atherton s Sydney Atherton s The inventor The same Do you know him I do Sydney Atherton and I are friends of a good many years standing But Atherton must have seen where he came from and anyhow if he was in the state of undress which you have described why didn t he stop him mister Atherton s reasons were his own He did not stop him and so far as I can learn he did not attempt to stop him Instead 
2769_176256_000010_000000	train-clean-360	he knocked 
none	none	at my hall door to inform me that he had seen a man climb out of my window I happen to know that at certain seasons Atherton is a queer fish but that sounds very queer indeed The truth is mister Champnell that if it were not for mister Atherton I doubt if I should have troubled you even now The accident of his being an acquaintance of yours makes my task easier He drew his chair closer to me with an air of briskness which had been foreign to him before For some reason which I was unable to fathom the introduction of Atherton s name seemed to have enlivened him However I was not long to remain in darkness In half a dozen sentences he threw more light on the real cause of his visit to me than he had done in all that had gone before His bearing too was more businesslike and to the point For the first time I had some glimmerings of the politician alert keen eager as he is known to all the world mister Atherton like myself has been a postulant for Miss Lindon s hand Because I have succeeded where he has failed he has chosen to be angry It seems that he has had dealings either with my visitor of Tuesday night or with some other his acquaintance and he proposes to use what he has gleaned from him to the disadvantage of my character I have just come from mister Atherton From hints he dropped I conclude that probably during the last few hours he has had an interview with someone who was connected in some way with that lurid patch in my career that this person made so called revelations which were nothing but a series of monstrous lies and these so called revelations mister Atherton has threatened in so many words to place before Miss Lindon That is an eventuality which I wish to avoid My own conviction is that there is at this moment in London an emissary from that den in the whilom Rue de Rabagas for all I know it may be the Woman of the Songs herself Whether the sole purport of this individual s presence is to do me injury I am as yet in no position to say but that it is proposed to work me mischief at any rate by the way is plain I believe that mister Atherton knows more about this person s individuality and whereabouts than he has been willing so far to admit I want you therefore to ascertain these things on my behalf to find out what and where this person is to drag her or him out into the light of day In short I want you to effectually protect me from the terrorism which threatens once more to overwhelm my mental and my physical powers which bids fair to destroy my intellect my career my life my all What reason have you for suspecting that mister Atherton has seen this individual of whom you speak has he told you so Practically yes I know Atherton well In his not infrequent moments of excitement he is apt to use strong language but it goes no further I believe him to be the last person in the world to do anyone an intentional injustice under any circumstances whatever If I go to him armed with credentials from you when he understands the real gravity of the situation which it will be my business to make him do I believe that spontaneously of his own accord he will tell me as much about this mysterious individual as he knows himself Then go to him at once Good I will The result I will communicate to you I rose from my seat As I did so someone rushed into the outer office with a din and a clatter Andrews voice and another became distinctly audible Andrews apparently raised in vigorous expostulation Raised seemingly in vain for presently the door of my own particular sanctum was thrown open with a crash and mister Sydney Atherton himself came dashing in evidently conspicuously under the influence of one of those not infrequent moments of excitement of which I had just been speaking CHAPTER XXXV A BRINGER OF TIDINGS Atherton did not wait to see who might or might not be present but without even pausing to take breath he broke into full cry on the instant as is occasionally his wont Champnell Thank goodness I ve found you in I want you At once Don t stop to talk but stick your hat on and put your best foot forward I ll tell you all about it in the cab I endeavoured to call his attention to mister Lessingham s presence but without success My dear fellow When I had got as far as that he cut me short Don t dear fellow me None of your jabber And none of your excuses either I don t care if you ve got an engagement with the Queen you ll have to chuck it Where s that dashed hat of yours or are you going without it Don t I tell you that every second cut to waste may mean the difference between life and death Do you want me to drag you down to the cab by the hair of your head I will try not to constrain you to quite so drastic a resource and I was coming to you at once in any case I only want to call your attention to the fact that I am not alone Here is mister Lessingham In his harum scarum haste mister Lessingham had gone unnoticed Now that his observation was particularly directed to him Atherton started turned and glared at my latest client in a fashion which was scarcely flattering Oh It s you is it What the deuce are you doing here Before Lessingham could reply to this most unceremonious query Atherton rushing forward gripped him by the arm Have you seen her Lessingham not unnaturally nonplussed by the other s curious conduct stared at him in unmistakable amazement Have I seen whom Marjorie Lindon Marjorie Lindon Lessingham paused He was evidently asking himself what the inquiry meant I have not seen Miss Lindon since last night Why do you ask Then Heaven help us As I m a living man I believe he she or it has got her His words were incomprehensible enough to stand in copious need of explanation as mister Lessingham plainly thought What is it that you mean sir What I say I believe that that Oriental friend of yours has got her in her clutches if it is a her goodness alone knows what the infernal conjurer s real sex may be Atherton Explain yourself On a sudden Lessingham s tones rang out like a trumpet call If damage comes to her I shall be fit to cut my throat and yours mister Lessingham s next proceeding surprised me I imagine it surprised Atherton still more Springing at Sydney like a tiger he caught him by the throat You you hound Of what wretched folly have you been guilty If so much as a hair of her head is injured you shall repay it me ten thousandfold You mischief making intermeddling jealous fool He shook Sydney as if he had been a rat then flung him from him headlong on to the floor It reminded me of nothing so much as Othello s treatment of Iago Never had I seen a man so transformed by rage Lessingham seemed to have positively increased in stature As he stood glowering down at the prostrate Sydney he might have stood for a materialistic conception of human retribution Sydney I take it was rather surprised than hurt For a moment or two he lay quite still Then lifting his head he looked up his assailant Then raising himself to his feet he shook himself as if with a view of learning if all his bones were whole Putting his hands up to his neck he rubbed it gently And he grinned By God Lessingham there s more in you than I thought After all you are a man There s some holding power in those wrists of yours they ve nearly broken my neck When this business is finished I should like to put on the gloves with you and fight it out You re clean wasted upon politics Damn it man give me your hand mister Lessingham did not give him his hand Atherton took it and gave it a hearty shake with both of his If the first paroxysm of his passion had passed Lessingham was still sufficiently stern Be so good as not to trifle mister Atherton If what you say is correct and the wretch to whom you allude really has Miss Lindon at her mercy then the woman I love and whom you also pretend to love stands in imminent peril not only of a ghastly death but of what is infinitely worse than death The deuce she does Atherton wheeled round towards me Champnell haven t you got that dashed hat of yours yet Don t stand there like a tailor s dummy keeping me on tenter hooks move yourself I ll tell you all about it in the cab And Lessingham if you ll come with us I ll tell you too CHAPTER XXXVI WHAT THE TIDINGS WERE Three in a hansom cab is not under all circumstances the most comfortable method of conveyance when one of the trio happens to be Sydney Atherton in one of his moments of excitement it is distinctly the opposite as on that occasion mister Lessingham and I both quickly found Sometimes he sat on my knees sometimes on Lessingham s and frequently when he unexpectedly stood up and all but precipitated himself on to the horse s back on nobody s In the eagerness of his gesticulations first he knocked off my hat then he knocked off Lessingham s then his own then all three together once his own hat rolling into the mud he sprang into the road without previously going through the empty form of advising the driver of his intention to pick it up When he turned to speak to Lessingham he thrust his elbow into my eye and when he turned to speak to me he thrust it into Lessingham s Never for one solitary instant was he at rest or either of us at ease The wonder is that the gymnastics in which he incessantly indulged did not sufficiently attract public notice to induce a policeman to put at least a momentary period to our progress Had speed not been of primary importance I should have insisted on the transference of the expedition to the somewhat wider limits of a four wheeler His elucidation of the causes of his agitation was apparently more comprehensible to Lessingham than it was to me I had to piece this and that together under considerable difficulties By degrees I did arrive at something like a clear notion of what had actually taken place He commenced by addressing Lessingham and thrusting his elbow into my eye Did Marjorie tell you about the fellow she found in the street Up went his arm to force the trap door open overhead and off went my hat Now then William Henry let her go if you kill the horse I ll buy you another We were already going much faster than legally we ought to have done but that seemingly to him was not a matter of the slightest consequence Lessingham replied to his inquiry She did not You know the fellow I saw coming out of your drawing room window Yes Well Marjorie found him the morning after in front of her breakfast room window in the middle of the street Seems he had been wandering about all night unclothed in the rain and the mud and all the rest of it in a condition of hypnotic trance Who is the gentleman you are alluding to Says his name s Holt Robert Holt Holt Is he an Englishman Very much so City quill driver out of a shop stony broke absolutely Got the chuck from the casual ward wouldn t let him in house full and that sort of thing poor devil Pretty passes you politicians bring men to Are you sure Of what Are you sure that this man Robert Holt is the same person whom as you put it you saw coming out of my drawing room window Sure Of course I m sure Think I didn t recognise him Besides there was the man s own tale owned to it himself besides all the rest which sent one rushing Fulham way You must remember mister Atherton that I am wholly in the dark as to what has happened What has the man Holt to do with the errand on which we are bound Am I not coming to it If you would let me tell the tale in my own way I should get there in less than no time but you will keep on cutting in how the deuce do you suppose Champnell is to make head or tail of the business if you will persist in interrupting Marjorie took the beggar in he told his tale to her she sent for me that was just now caught me on the steps after I had been lunching with Dora Grayling Holt re dished his yarn I smelt a rat saw that a connection possibly existed between the thief who d been playing confounded conjuring tricks off on to me and this interesting party down Fulham way What party down Fulham way This friend of Holt s am I not telling you There you are you see won t let me finish When Holt slipped through the window which is the most sensible thing he seems to have done if I d been in his shoes I d have slipped through forty windows dusky coloured charmer caught him on the hop doctored him sent him out to commit burglary by deputy I said to Holt Show us this agreeable little crib young man Holt was game then Marjorie chipped in she wanted to go and see it too I said You ll be sorry if you do that settled it After that she d have gone if she d died I never did have a persuasive way with women So off we toddled Marjorie Holt and I in a growler spotted the crib in less than no time invited ourselves in by the kitchen window house seemed empty Presently Holt became hypnotised before my eyes the best established case of hypnotism by suggestion I ever yet encountered started off on a pilgrimage of one Like an idiot I followed leaving Marjorie to wait for me Alone Alone Am I not telling you Great Scott Lessingham in the House of Commons they must be hazy to think you smart I said I ll send the first sane soul I meet to keep you company As luck would have it I never met one only kids and a baker who wouldn t leave his cart or take it with him either I d covered pretty nearly two miles before I came across a peeler and when I did the man was cracked and he thought me mad or drunk or both By the time I d got myself within nodding distance of being run in for obstructing the police in the execution of their duty without inducing him to move a single one of his twenty four inch feet Holt was out of sight So since all my pains in his direction were clean thrown away there was nothing left for me but to scurry back to Marjorie so I scurried and I found the house empty no one there and Marjorie gone But I don t quite follow Atherton impetuously declined to allow mister Lessingham to conclude Of course you don t quite follow and you ll follow still less if you will keep getting in front I went upstairs and downstairs inside and out shouted myself hoarse as a crow nothing was to be seen of Marjorie or heard until as I was coming down the stairs for about the five and fiftieth time I stepped on something hard which was lying in the passage I picked it up it was a ring this ring Its shape is not just what it was I m not as light as gossamer especially when I come jumping downstairs six at a time but what s left of it is here Sydney held something in front of him mister Lessingham wriggled to one side to enable him to see Then he made a snatch at it It s mine Sydney dodged it out of his reach What do you mean it s yours It s the ring I gave Marjorie for an engagement ring Give it me you hound unless you wish me to do you violence in the cab With complete disregard of the limitations of space or of my comfort Lessingham thrust him vigorously aside Then gripping Sydney by the wrist he seized the gaud Sydney yielding it just in time to save himself from being precipitated into the street Ravished of his treasure Sydney turned and surveyed the ravisher with something like a glance of admiration Hang me Lessingham if I don t believe there is some warm blood in those fishlike veins of yours Please the piper I ll live to fight you after all with the bare ones sir as a gentleman should do Lessingham seemed to pay no attention to him whatever He was surveying the ring which Sydney had trampled out of shape with looks of the deepest concern Marjorie s ring The one I gave her Something serious must have happened to her before she would have dropped my ring and left it lying where it fell Atherton went on That s it What has happened to her I ll be dashed if I know When it was clear that there she wasn t I tore off to find out where she was Came across old Lindon he knew nothing I rather fancy I startled him in the middle of Pall Mall when I left he stared after me like one possessed and his hat was lying in the gutter Went home she wasn t there Asked Dora Grayling she d seen nothing of her No one had seen anything of her she had vanished into air Then I said to myself You re a first class idiot on my honour While you re looking for her like a lost sheep the betting is that the girl s in Holt s friend s house the whole jolly time When you were there the chances are that she d just stepped out for a stroll and that now she s back again and wondering where on earth you ve gone So I made up my mind that I d fly back and see because the idea of her standing on the front doorstep looking for me while I was going off my nut looking for her commended itself to what I call my sense of humour and on my way it struck me that it would be the part of wisdom to pick up Champnell because if there is a man who can be backed to find a needle in any amount of hay stacks it is the great Augustus That horse has moved itself after all because here we are Now cabman don t go driving further on you ll have to put a girdle round the earth if you do because you ll have to reach this point again before you get your fare This is the magician s house CHAPTER XXXVII WHAT WAS HIDDEN UNDER THE FLOOR 
2769_176256_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The cab pulled up in front of a tumbledown cheap villa in an unfinished cheap neighbourhood the whole place a living monument of the defeat of the speculative builder 
2769_176256_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Atherton leaped out on to the grass grown rubble which was meant for a footpath 
none	none	I don t see Marjorie looking for me on the doorstep 
2769_176256_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Nor did I I saw nothing but what appeared to be an unoccupied ramshackle brick abomination 
none	none	Suddenly Sydney gave an exclamation Hullo The front door s closed I was hard at his heels What do you mean Why when I went I left the front door open It looks as if I ve made an idiot of myself after all and Marjorie s returned let s hope to goodness that I have He knocked 
2769_176256_000010_000001	train-clean-360	While we waited for a response I questioned him 
2769_176256_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Why did you leave the door open when you went 
2769_176256_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I hardly know I imagine that it was with some dim idea of Marjorie s being able to get in if she returned while I was absent but the truth is I was in such a condition of helter skelter that I am not prepared to swear that I had any reasonable reason 
2769_176256_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose there is no doubt that you did leave it open 
none	none	Absolutely none on that I ll stake my life
2769_176256_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Was it open when you returned from your pursuit of Holt 
2769_176256_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Wide open I walked straight in expecting to find her waiting for me in the front room I was struck all of a heap when I found she wasn t there 
none	none	Were there any signs of a struggle
2769_176256_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 None there were no signs of anything 
2769_176256_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Everything was just as I had left it with the exception of the ring which I trod on in the passage and which Lessingham has 
2769_176256_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 If Miss Lindon has returned it does not look as if she were in the house at present 
2769_176256_000020_000000	train-clean-360	It did not unless silence had such meaning 
none	none	Atherton had knocked loudly three times without succeeding in attracting the slightest notice from within
2769_176256_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 It strikes me that this is another case of seeking admission through that hospitable window at the back 
2769_176256_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Atherton led the way to the rear 
none	none	Lessingham and I followed 
2769_176256_000022_000002	train-clean-360	There was not even an apology for a yard still less a garden there was not even a fence of any sort to serve as an enclosure and to shut off the house from the wilderness of waste land 
2769_176256_000022_000003	train-clean-360	The kitchen window was open 
none	none	I asked Sydney if he had left it so I don t know I dare say we did I don t fancy that either of us stood on the order of his coming 
2769_176256_000024_000000	train-clean-360	While he spoke he scrambled over the sill 
none	none	We followed 
2769_176256_000024_000002	train-clean-360	When he was in he shouted at the top of his voice 
none	none	Marjorie Marjorie Speak to me Marjorie it is I Sydney 
2769_176256_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The words echoed through the house 
2769_176256_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Only silence answered 
2769_176256_000026_000002	train-clean-360	He led the way to the front room 
2769_176256_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Suddenly he stopped 
2769_176256_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Hollo he cried 
2769_176256_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 The blind s down I had noticed when we were outside that the blind was down at the front room window 
2769_176256_000027_000002	train-clean-360	 It was up when I went that I ll swear 
2769_176256_000027_000003	train-clean-360	That someone has been here is pretty plain let s hope it s Marjorie 
none	none	He had only taken a step forward into the room when he again stopped short to exclaim
2769_176256_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 My stars here s a sudden clearance Why the place is empty everything s clean gone 
2769_176256_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you mean was it furnished when you left 
2769_176256_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The room was empty enough then 
none	none	Furnished I don t know that it was exactly what you d call furnished the party who ran this establishment had a taste in upholstery which was all his own but there was a carpet and a bed and and lots of things for the most part I should have said distinctly Eastern curiosities 
2769_176256_000032_000001	train-clean-360	They seem to have evaporated into smoke which may be a way which is common enough among Eastern curiosities though it s queer to me 
2769_176256_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Atherton was staring about him as if he found it difficult to credit the evidence of his own eyes 
2769_176256_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 How long ago is it since you left 
2769_176256_000035_000000	train-clean-360	He referred to his watch 
2769_176256_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Something over an hour possibly an hour and a half I couldn t swear to the exact moment but it certainly isn t more 
2769_176256_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you notice any signs of packing up 
2769_176256_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Not a sign Going to the window he drew up the blind speaking as he did so 
none	none	The queer thing about this business is that when we first got in this blind wouldn t draw up a little bit so since it wouldn t go up I pulled it down roller and all now it draws up as easily and smoothly as if it had always been the best blind that ever lived Standing at Sydney s back I saw that the cabman on his box was signalling to us with his outstretched hand 
2769_176256_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Sydney perceived him too 
2769_176256_000039_000002	train-clean-360	He threw up the sash 
none	none	What s the matter with you
2769_176256_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Excuse me sir but who s the old gent 
none	none	What old gent
2769_176256_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Why the old gent peeping through the window of the room upstairs 
none	none	The words were hardly out of the driver s mouth when Sydney was through the door and flying up the staircase 
2769_176256_000044_000001	train-clean-360	I followed rather more soberly his methods were a little too flighty for me 
2769_176256_000044_000002	train-clean-360	When I reached the landing dashing out of the front room he rushed into the one at the back then through a door at the side 
2769_176256_000044_000003	train-clean-360	He came out shouting 
2769_176256_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 What s the idiot mean with his old gent 
2769_176256_000045_000001	train-clean-360	I d old gent him if I got him There s not a creature about the place 
2769_176256_000046_000000	train-clean-360	He returned into the front room I at his heels 
2769_176256_000046_000001	train-clean-360	That certainly was empty and not only empty but it showed no traces of recent occupation 
2769_176256_000046_000002	train-clean-360	The dust lay thick upon the floor there was that mouldy earthy smell which is so frequently found in apartments which have been long untenanted 
2769_176256_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you sure Atherton that there is no one at the back 
none	none	Of course I m sure you can go and see for yourself if you like do you think I m blind 
2769_176256_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Jehu s drunk Throwing up the sash he addressed the driver 
2769_176256_000048_000002	train-clean-360	 What do you mean with your old gent at the window what window 
2769_176256_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 That window sir 
2769_176256_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Go to you re dreaming man there s no one here 
2769_176256_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Begging your pardon sir but there was someone there not a minute ago 
none	none	Imagination cabman the slant of the light on the glass or your eyesight s defective Excuse me sir but it s not my imagination and my eyesight s as good as any man s in England and as for the slant of the light on the glass there ain t much glass for the light to slant on 
2769_176256_000053_000001	train-clean-360	I saw him peeping through that bottom broken pane on your left hand as plainly as I see you 
2769_176256_000053_000002	train-clean-360	He must be somewhere about he can t have got away he s at the back 
2769_176256_000053_000003	train-clean-360	Ain t there a cupboard nor nothing where he could hide 
2769_176256_000054_000000	train-clean-360	The cabman s manner was so extremely earnest that I went myself to see 
none	none	There was a cupboard on the landing but the door of that stood wide open and that obviously was bare 
2769_176256_000054_000002	train-clean-360	The room behind was small and despite the splintered glass in the window frame stuffy 
2769_176256_000054_000003	train-clean-360	Fragments of glass kept company with the dust on the floor together with a choice collection of stones brickbats and other missiles which not improbably were the cause of their being there 
2769_176256_000054_000004	train-clean-360	In the corner stood a cupboard but a momentary examination showed that that was as bare as the other 
2769_176256_000054_000005	train-clean-360	The door at the side which Sydney had left wide open opened on to a closet and that was empty 
2769_176256_000054_000006	train-clean-360	I glanced up there was no trap door which led to the roof 
2769_176256_000054_000007	train-clean-360	No practicable nook or cranny in which a living being could lie concealed was anywhere at hand 
2769_176256_000055_000000	train-clean-360	I returned to Sydney s shoulder to tell the cabman so 
2769_176256_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 There is no place in which anyone could hide and there is no one in either of the rooms you must have been mistaken driver 
2769_176256_000057_000000	train-clean-360	The man waxed wroth 
none	none	Don t tell me 
2769_176256_000058_000001	train-clean-360	How could I come to think I saw something when I didn t 
2769_176256_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 One s eyes are apt to play us tricks how could you see what wasn t there 
2769_176256_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what I want to know 
none	none	As I drove up before you told me to stop I saw him looking through the window the one at which you are He d got his nose glued to the broken pane and was staring as hard as he could stare When I pulled up off he started I saw him get up off his knees and go to the back of the room 
2769_176256_000060_000004	train-clean-360	When the gentleman took to knocking back he came to the same old spot and flopped down on his knees 
none	none	I didn t know what caper you was up to you might be bum bailiffs for all I knew and I supposed that he wasn t so anxious to let you in as you might be to get inside and that was why he didn t take no notice of your knocking while all the while he kept a eye on what was going on When you goes round to the back up he gets again and I reckoned that he was going to meet yer and perhaps give yer a bit of his mind and that presently I should hear a shindy or that something would happen 
2769_176256_000060_000007	train-clean-360	But when you pulls up the blind downstairs to my surprise back he come once more 
2769_176256_000060_000008	train-clean-360	He shoves his old nose right through the smash in the pane and wags his old head at me like a chattering magpie 
none	none	That didn t seem to me quite the civil thing to do I hadn t done no harm to him so I gives you the office and lets you know that he was there 
2769_176256_000060_000010	train-clean-360	But for you to say that he wasn t there and never had been blimey that cops the biscuit 
none	none	If he wasn t there all I can say is I ain t here and my orse ain t here and my cab ain t neither damn it the house ain t here and nothing ain t He settled himself on his perch with an air of the most extreme ill usage he had been standing up to tell his tale 
2769_176256_000061_000001	train-clean-360	That the man was serious was unmistakable 
2769_176256_000061_000002	train-clean-360	As he himself suggested what inducement could he have had to tell a lie like that 
2769_176256_000061_000003	train-clean-360	That he believed himself to have seen what he declared he saw was plain 
2769_176256_000061_000004	train-clean-360	But on the other hand what could have become in the space of fifty seconds of his old gent 
2769_176256_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Atherton put a question 
2769_176256_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 What did he look like this old gent of yours 
2769_176256_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Well that I shouldn t hardly like to say 
2769_176256_000064_000001	train-clean-360	It wasn t much of his face I could see only his face and his eyes and they wasn t pretty 
2769_176256_000064_000002	train-clean-360	He kept a thing over his head all the time as if he didn t want too much to be seen 
none	none	What sort of a thing
2769_176256_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Why one of them cloak sort of things like them Arab blokes used to wear what used to be at Earl s Court Exhibition you know 
2769_176256_000067_000000	train-clean-360	This piece of information seemed to interest my companions more than anything he had said before 
2769_176256_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 A burnoose do you mean 
2769_176256_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 How am I to know what the thing s called 
none	none	I ain t up in foreign languages tain t likely All I know that them Arab blokes what was at Earl s Court used to walk about in them all over the place sometimes they wore them over their heads and sometimes they didn t In fact if you d asked me instead of trying to make out as I sees double or things what was only inside my own noddle or something or other I should have said this here old gent what I ve been telling you about was a Arab bloke when he gets off his knees to sneak away from the window I could see that he had his cloak thing what was over his head wrapped all round him 
2769_176256_000070_000000	train-clean-360	mister Lessingham turned to me all quivering with excitement 
none	none	I believe that what he says is true Then where can this mysterious old gentleman have got to can you suggest an explanation 
2769_176256_000072_000001	train-clean-360	It is strange to say the least of it that the cabman should be the only person to see or hear anything of him 
2769_176256_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Some devil s trick has been played I know it I feel it my instinct tells me so 
none	none	I stared In such a matter one hardly expects a man of Paul Lessingham s stamp to talk of instinct Atherton stared too Then on a sudden he burst out
2769_176256_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 By the Lord I believe the Apostle s right the whole place reeks to me of hankey pankey it did as soon as I put my nose inside 
2769_176256_000075_000001	train-clean-360	In matters of prestidigitation Champnell we Westerns are among the rudiments we ve everything to learn Orientals leave us at the post 
none	none	If their civilisation s what we re pleased to call extinct their conjuring when you get to know it is all alive oh 
2769_176256_000076_000000	train-clean-360	He moved towards the door 
none	none	As he went he slipped or seemed to all but stumbling on to his knees
2769_176256_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Something tripped me up what s this He was stamping on the floor with his foot 
2769_176256_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 Here s a board loose 
none	none	Come and lend me a hand one of you fellows to get it up 
2769_176256_000077_000003	train-clean-360	Who knows what mystery s beneath 
2769_176256_000078_000000	train-clean-360	I went to his aid 
none	none	As he said a board in the floor was loose 
2769_176256_000078_000002	train-clean-360	His stepping on it unawares had caused his stumble 
2769_176256_000078_000003	train-clean-360	Together we prised it out of its place Lessingham standing by and watching us the while 
2769_176256_000078_000004	train-clean-360	Having removed it we peered into the cavity it disclosed 
none	none	There was something there Why cried Atherton it s a woman s clothing CHAPTER XXXVIII THE REST OF THE FIND It was a woman s clothing beyond a doubt all thrown in anyhow as if the person who had placed it there had been in a desperate hurry An entire outfit was there shoes stockings body linen corsets and all even to hat gloves and hairpins these latter were mixed up with the rest of the garments in strange confusion It seemed plain that whoever had worn those clothes had been stripped to the skin Lessingham and Sydney stared at me in silence as I dragged them out and laid them on the floor The dress was at the bottom it was an alpaca of a pretty shade in blue bedecked with lace and ribbons as is the fashion of the hour and lined with sea green silk It had perhaps been a charming confection once and that a very recent one but now it was all soiled and creased and torn and tumbled The two spectators made a simultaneous pounce at it as I brought it to the light 
2769_176263_000075_000001	train-clean-360	My God 
none	none	cried Sydney it s Marjorie s she was wearing it when I saw her last It s Marjorie s gasped Lessingham he was clutching at the ruined costume staring at it like a man who has just received sentence of death She wore it when she was with me yesterday I told her how it suited her and how pretty it was There was silence it was an eloquent find it spoke for itself The two men gazed at the heap of feminine glories it might have been the most wonderful sight they ever had seen Lessingham was the first to speak his face had all at once grown grey and haggard What has happened to her I replied to his question with another Are you sure this is Miss Linden s dress I am sure and were proof needed here it is He had found the pocket and was turning out the contents There was a purse which contained money and some visiting cards on which were her name and address a small bunch of keys with her nameplate attached a handkerchief with her initials in a corner The question of ownership was placed beyond a doubt You see said Lessingham exhibiting the money which was in the purse it is not robbery which has been attempted Here are two ten pound notes and one for five besides gold and silver over thirty pounds in all Atherton who had been turning over the accumulation of rubbish between the joists proclaimed another find Here are her rings and watch and a bracelet no it certainly does not look as if theft had been an object Lessingham was glowering at him with knitted brows I have to thank you for this Sydney was unwontedly meek You are hard on me Lessingham harder than I deserve I had rather have thrown away my own life than have suffered misadventure to have come to her Yours are idle words Had you not meddled this would not have happened A fool works more mischief with his folly than of malice prepense If hurt has befallen Marjorie Lindon you shall account for it to me with your life s blood Let it be so said Sydney I am content If hurt has come to Marjorie God knows that I am willing enough that death should come to me While they wrangled I continued to search A little to one side under the flooring which was still intact I saw something gleam By stretching out my hand I could just manage to reach it it was a long plait of woman s hair It had been cut off at the roots so close to the head in one place that the scalp itself had been cut so that the hair was clotted with blood They were so occupied with each other that they took no notice of me I had to call their attention to my discovery Gentlemen I fear that I have here something which will distress you is not this Miss Lindon s hair They recognised it on the instant Lessingham snatching it from my hands pressed it to his lips This is mine I shall at least have something He spoke with a grimness which was a little startling He held the silken tresses at arm s length This points to murder foul cruel causeless murder As I live I will devote my all money time reputation to gaining vengeance on the wretch who did this deed Atherton chimed in To that I say Amen He lifted his hand God is my witness It seems to me gentlemen that we move too fast to my mind it does not by any means of necessity point to murder On the contrary I doubt if murder has been done Indeed I don t mind owning that I have a theory of my own which points all the other way Lessingham caught me by the sleeve mister Champnell tell me your theory I will a little later Of course it may be altogether wrong though I fancy it is not I will explain my reasons when we come to talk of it But at present there are things which must be done I vote for tearing up every board in the house cried Sydney And for pulling the whole infernal place to pieces It s a conjurer s den I shouldn t be surprised if cabby s old gent is staring at us all the while from some peephole of his own We examined the entire house methodically so far as we were able inch by inch Not another board proved loose to lift those which were nailed down required tools and those we were without We sounded all the walls with the exception of the party walls they were the usual lath and plaster constructions and showed no signs of having been tampered with The ceilings were intact if anything was concealed in them it must have been there some time the cement was old and dirty We took the closet to pieces examined the chimneys peered into the kitchen oven and the copper in short we pried into everything which with the limited means at our disposal could be pried into without result At the end we found ourselves dusty dirty and discomfited The cabman s old gent remained as much a mystery as ever and no further trace had been discovered of Miss Lindon Atherton made no effort to disguise his chagrin Now what s to be done There seems to be just nothing in the place at all and yet that there is and that it s the key to the whole confounded business I should be disposed to swear In that case I would suggest that you should stay and look for it The cabman can go and look for the requisite tools or a workman to assist you if you like For my part it appears to me that evidence of another sort is for the moment of paramount importance and I propose to commence my search for it by making a call at the house which is over the way I had observed on our arrival that the road only contained two houses which were in anything like a finished state that which we were in and another some fifty or sixty yards further down on the opposite side It was to this I referred The twain immediately proffered their companionship I will come with you said mister Lessingham And I echoed Sydney We ll leave this sweet homestead in charge of the cabman I ll pull it to pieces afterwards He went out and spoke to the driver Cabby we re going to pay a visit to the little crib over there you keep an eye on this one And if you see a sign of anyone being about the place living or dead or anyhow you give me a yell I shall be on the lookout and I ll be with you before you can say Jack Robinson You bet I ll yell I ll raise the hair right off you The fellow grinned But I don t know if you gents are hiring me by the day I want to change my horse he ought to have been in his stable a couple of hours ago Never mind your horse let him rest a couple of hours extra to morrow to make up for those he has lost to day I ll take care you don t lose anything by this little job or your horse either By the way look here this will be better than yelling Taking a revolver out of his trousers pocket he handed it up to the grinning driver If that old gent of yours does appear you have a pop at him I shall hear that easier than a yell You can put a bullet through him if you like I give you my word it won t be murder I don t care if it is declared the cabman handling the weapon like one who was familiar with arms of precision I used to fancy my revolver shooting when I was with the colours and if I do get a chance I ll put a shot through the old hunks if only to prove to you that I m no liar Whether the man was in earnest or not I could not tell nor whether Atherton meant what he said in answer If you shoot him I ll give you fifty pounds All right The driver laughed I ll do my best to earn that fifty CHAPTER XXXIX MISS LOUISA COLEMAN That the house over the way was tenanted was plain to all the world at least one occupant sat gazing through the window of the first floor front room An old woman in a cap one of those large old fashioned caps which our grandmothers used to wear tied with strings under the chin It was a bow window and as she was seated in the bay looking right in our direction she could hardly have failed to see us as we advanced indeed she continued to stare at us all the while with placid calmness Yet I knocked once twice and yet again without the slightest notice being taken of my summons Sydney gave expression to his impatience in his own peculiar vein Knockers in this part of the world seem intended for ornament only nobody seems to pay any attention to them when they re used The old lady upstairs must be either deaf or dotty He went out into the road to see if she still was there She s looking at me as calmly as you please what does she think we re doing here I wonder playing a tune on her front door by way of a little amusement Madam He took off his hat and waved it to her Madam might I observe that if you won t condescend to notice that we re here your front door will run the risk of being severely injured She don t care for me any more than if I was nothing at all sound another tattoo upon that knocker Perhaps she s so deaf that nothing short of a cataclysmal uproar will reach her auditory nerves She immediately proved however that she was nothing of the sort Hardly had the sounds of my further knocking died away than throwing up the window she thrust out her head and addressed me in a fashion which under the circumstances was as unexpected as it was uncalled for Now young man you needn t be in such a hurry Sydney explained Pardon me madam it s not so much a hurry we re in as pressed for time this is a matter of life and death She turned her attention to Sydney speaking with a frankness for which I imagine he was unprepared I don t want none of your imperence young man I ve seen you before you ve been hanging about here the whole day long and I don t like the looks of you and so I ll let you know That s my front door and that s my knocker I ll come down and open when I like but I m not going to be hurried and if the knocker s so much as touched again I won t come down at all She closed the window with a bang Sydney seemed divided between mirth and indignation That s a nice old lady on my honour one of the good old crusty sort Agreeable characters this neighbourhood seems to grow a sojourn hereabouts should do one good Unfortunately I don t feel disposed just now to stand and kick my heels in the road Again saluting the old dame by raising his hat he shouted to her at the top of his voice Madam I beg ten thousand pardons for troubling you but this is a matter in which every second is of vital importance would you allow me to ask you one or two questions Up went the window out came the old lady s head Now young man you needn t put yourself out to holler at me I won t be hollered at I ll come down and open that door in five minutes by the clock on my mantelpiece and not a moment before The fiat delivered down came the window Sydney looked rueful he consulted his watch I don t know what you think Champnell but I really doubt if this comfortable creature can tell us anything worth waiting another five minutes to hear We mustn t let the grass grow under our feet and time is getting on I was of a different opinion and said so I m afraid Atherton that I can t agree with you She seems to have noticed you hanging about all day and it is at least possible that she has noticed a good deal which would be well worth our hearing What more promising witness are we likely to find her house is the only one which overlooks the one we have just quitted I am of opinion that it may not only prove well worth our while to wait five minutes but also that it would be as well if possible not to offend her by the way She s not likely to afford us the information we require if you do Good If that s what you think I m sure I m willing to wait only it s to be hoped that that clock upon her mantelpiece moves quicker than its mistress Presently when about a minute had gone he called to the cabman Seen a sign of anything The cabman shouted back Ne er a sign you ll hear a sound of popguns when I do Those five minutes did seem long ones But at last Sydney from his post of vantage in the road informed us that the old lady was moving She s getting up she s leaving the window let s hope to goodness she s coming down to open the door That s been the longest five minutes I ve known I could hear uncertain footsteps descending the stairs They came along the passage The door was opened on the chain The old lady peered at us through an aperture of about six inches I don t know what you young men think you re after but have all three of you in my house I won t I ll have him and you a skinny finger was pointed to Lessingham and me then it was directed towards Atherton but have him I won t So if it s anything particular you want to say to me you ll just tell him to go away On hearing this Sydney s humility was abject His hat was in his hand he bent himself double Suffer me to make you a million apologies madam if I have in any way offended you nothing I assure you could have been farther from my intention or from my thoughts I don t want none of your apologies and I don t want none of you neither I don t like the looks of you and so I tell you Before I let anybody into my house you ll have to sling your hook The door was banged in our faces I turned to Sydney The sooner you go the better it will be for us You can wait for us over the way He shrugged his shoulders and groaned half in jest half in earnest If I must I suppose I must it s the first time I ve been refused admittance to a lady s house in all my life What have I done to deserve this thing If you keep me waiting long I ll tear that infernal den to pieces He sauntered across the road viciously kicking the stones as he went The door reopened Has that other young man gone He has Then now I ll let you in Have him inside my house I won t The chain was removed Lessingham and I entered Then the door was refastened and the chain replaced Our hostess showed us into the front room on the ground floor it was sparsely furnished and not too clean but there were chairs enough for us to sit upon which she insisted on our occupying Sit down do I can t abide to see folks standing it gives me the fidgets So soon as we were seated without any overture on our parts she plunged in medias res I know what it is you ve come about I know You want me to tell you who it is as lives in the house over the road Well I can tell you and I dare bet a shilling that I m about the only one who can I inclined my head Indeed Is that so madam She was huffed at once Don t madam me I can t bear none of your lip service I m a plain spoken woman that s what I am and I like other people s tongues to be as plain as mine My name s Miss Louisa Coleman but I m generally called Miss Coleman I m only called Louisa by my relatives Since she was apparently between seventy and eighty and looked every year of her apparent age I deemed that possible Miss Coleman was evidently a character If one was desirous of getting information out of her it would be necessary to allow her to impart it in her own manner to endeavour to induce her to impart it in anybody else s would be time clean wasted We had Sydney s fate before our eyes She started with a sort of roundabout preamble This property is mine it was left me by my uncle the late George Henry Jobson he s buried in Hammersmith Cemetery just over the way he left me the whole of it It s one of the finest building sites near London and it increases in value every year and I m not going to let it for another twenty by which time the value will have more than trebled so if that is what you ve come about as heaps of people do you might have saved yourselves the trouble I keep the boards standing just to let people know that the ground is to let though as I say it won t be for another twenty years when it ll be for the erection of high class mansions only same as there is in Grosvenor Square no shops or public houses and none of your shanties I live in this place just to keep an eye upon the property and as for the house over the way I ve never tried to let it and it never has been let not until a month ago when one morning I had this letter You can see it if you like She handed me a greasy envelope which she ferreted out of a capacious pocket which was suspended from her waist and which she had to lift up her skirt to reach The envelope was addressed in unformed characters Miss Louisa Coleman The Rhododendrons Convolvulus Avenue High Oaks Park West Kensington I felt if the writer had not been of a humorous turn of mind and drawn on his imagination and this really was the lady s correct address then there must be something in a name The letter within was written in the same straggling characterless caligraphy I should have said had I been asked offhand that the whole thing was the composition of a servant girl The composition was about on a par with the writing The undersigned would be oblidged if Miss Coleman would let her emptey house I do not know the rent but send fifty pounds If more will send Please address Mohamed el Kheir Post Office Sligo Street London It struck me as being as singular an application for a tenancy as I remembered to have encountered When I passed it on to Lessingham he seemed to think so too This is a curious letter Miss Coleman So I thought and still more so when I found the fifty pounds inside There were five ten pound notes all loose and the letter not even registered If I had been asked what was the rent of the house I should have said at the most not more than twenty pounds because between you and me it wants a good bit of doing up and is hardly fit to live in as it stands I had had sufficient evidence of the truth of this altogether apart from the landlady s frank admission Why for all he could have done to help himself I might have kept the money and only sent him a receipt for a quarter And some folks would have done but I m not one of that sort myself and shouldn t care to be So I sent this here party I never could pronounce his name and never shall a receipt for a year Miss Coleman paused to smooth her apron and consider Well the receipt should have reached this here party on the Thursday morning as it were I posted it on the Wednesday night and on the Thursday after breakfast I thought I d go over the way to see if there was any little thing I could do because there wasn t hardly a whole pane of glass in the place when I all but went all of a heap When I looked across the road blessed it the party wasn t in already at least as much as he ever was in which so far as I can make out never has been anything particular though how he had got in unless it was through a window in the middle of the night is more than I should care to say there was nobody in the house when I went to bed that I could pretty nearly take my Bible oath yet there was the blind up at the parlour and what s more it was down and it s been down pretty nearly ever since Well I says to myself for right down imperence this beats anything why he s in the place before he knows if I ll let him have it Perhaps he thinks I haven t got a word to say in the matter fifty pounds or no fifty pounds I ll soon show him So I slips on my bonnet and I walks over the road and I hammers at the door Well I have seen people hammering since then many a one and how they ve kept it up has puzzled me for an hour some of them but I was the first one as begun it I hammers and I hammers and I kept on hammering but it wasn t no more use than if I d been hammering at a tombstone So I starts rapping at the window but that wasn t no use neither So I goes round behind and I hammers at the back door but there I couldn t make anyone hear nohow So I says to myself Perhaps the party as is in ain t in in a manner of speaking but I ll keep an eye on the house and when he is in I ll take care that he ain t out again before I ve had a word to say So I come back home and as I said I would I kept an eye on the house the whole of that livelong day but never a soul went either out or in But the next day which it was a Friday I got out of bed about five o clock to see if it was raining through my having an idea of taking a little excursion if the weather was fine when I see a party coming down the road He had on one of them dirty coloured bed cover sort of things and it was wrapped all over his head and round his body like as I have been told them there Arabs wear and indeed I ve seen them in them myself at West Brompton when they was in the exhibition there It was quite fine and broad day and I see him as plainly as I see you he comes skimming along at a tear of a pace pulls up at the house over the way opens the front door and lets himself in So I says to myself there you are Well mister Arab or whatever or whoever you may be I ll take good care that you don t go out again before you ve had a word from me I ll show you that landladies have their rights like other Christians in this country however it may be in yours So I kept an eye on the house to see that he didn t go out again and nobody never didn t and between seven and eight I goes and I knocks at the door because I thought to myself that the earlier I was the better it might be If you ll believe me no more notice was taken of me than if I was one of the dead I hammers and I hammers till my wrist was aching I daresay I hammered twenty times and then I went round to the back door and I hammers at that but it wasn t the least good in the world I was that provoked to think I should be treated as if I was nothing and nobody by a dirty foreigner who went about in a bed gown through the public streets that it was all I could do to hold myself I comes round to the front again and I starts hammering at the window with every knuckle on my hands and I calls out I m Miss Louisa Coleman and I m the owner of this house and you can t deceive me I saw you come in and you re in now and if you don t come and speak to me this moment I ll have the police All of a sudden when I was least expecting it and was hammering my very hardest at the pane up goes the blind and up goes the window too and the most awful looking creature ever I heard of not to mention seeing puts his head right into my face he was more like a hideous baboon than anything else let alone a man I was struck all of a heap and plumps down on the little wall and all but tumbles head over heels backwards And he starts shrieking in a sort of a kind of English and in such a voice as I d never heard the like it was like a rusty steam engine Go away go away I don t want you I will not have you never You have your fifty pounds you have your money that is the whole of you that is all you want You come to me no more never never no more or you be sorry Go away I did go away and that as fast as ever my legs would carry me what with his looks and what with his voice and what with the way that he went on I was nothing but a mass of trembling As for answering him back or giving him a piece of my mind as I had meant to I wouldn t have done it not for a thousand pounds I don t mind confessing between you and me that I had to swallow four cups of tea right straight away before my nerves was steady Well I says to myself when I did feel as it might be a little more easy you never have let that house before and now you ve let it with a vengeance so you have If that there new tenant of yours isn t the greatest villain that ever went unhung it must be because he s got near relations what s as bad as himself because two families like his I m sure there can t be A nice sort of Arab party to have sleeping over the road he is But after a time I cools down as it were because I m one of them sort as likes to see on both sides of a question After all I says to myself he has paid his rent and fifty pounds is fifty pounds I doubt if the whole house is worth much more and he can t do much damage to it whatever he does I shouldn t have minded so far as that went if he d set fire to the place for between ourselves it s insured for a good bit over its value So I decided that I d let things be as they were and see how they went on But from that hour to this I ve never spoken to the man and never wanted to and wouldn t not of my own free will not for a shilling a time that face of his will haunt me if I live till Noah as the saying is I ve seen him going in and out at all hours of the day and night that Arab party s a mystery if ever there was one he always goes tearing along as if he s flying for his life Lots of people have come to the house all sorts and kinds men and women they ve been mostly women and even little children I ve seen them hammer and hammer at that front door but never a one have I seen let in or yet seen taken any notice of and I think I may say and yet tell no lie that I ve scarcely took my eye off the house since he s been inside it over and over again in the middle of the night have I got up to have a look so that I ve not missed much that has took place What s puzzled me is the noises that s come from the house Sometimes for days together there s not been a sound it might have been a house of the dead and then all through the night there ve been yells and screeches squawks and screams I never heard nothing like it I have thought and more than once that the devil himself must be in that front room let alone all the rest of his demons And as for cats where they ve come from I can t think I didn t use to notice hardly a cat in the neighbourhood till that there Arab party came there isn t much to attract them but since he came there s been regiments Sometimes at night there s been troops about the place screeching like mad I ve wished them farther I can tell you That Arab party must be fond of em I ve seen them inside the house at the windows upstairs and downstairs as it seemed to me a dozen at a time CHAPTER XL WHAT MISS COLEMAN SAW THROUGH THE WINDOW As Miss Coleman had paused as if her narrative was approaching a conclusion I judged it expedient to make an attempt to bring the record as quickly as possible up to date I take it Miss Coleman that you have observed what has occurred in the house to day She tightened her nut cracker jaws and glared at me disdainfully her dignity was ruffled I m coming to it aren t I if you ll let me If you ve got no manners I ll learn you some One doesn t like to be hurried at my time of life young man I was meekly silent plainly if she was to talk every one else must listen During the last few days there have been some queer goings on over the road out of the common queer I mean for goodness knows that they always have been queer enough That Arab party has been flitting about like a creature possessed I ve seen him going in and out twenty times a day This morning She paused to fix her eyes on Lessingham She apparently observed his growing interest as she approached the subject which had brought us there and resented it Don t look at me like that young man because I won t have it And as for questions I may answer questions when I m done but don t you dare to ask me one before because I won t be interrupted Up to then Lessingham had not spoken a word but it seemed as if she was endowed with the faculty of perceiving the huge volume of the words which he had left unuttered This morning as I ve said already she glanced at Lessingham as if she defied his contradiction when that Arab party came home it was just on the stroke of seven I know what was the exact time because when I went to the door to the milkman my clock was striking the half hour and I always keep it thirty minutes fast As I was taking the milk the man said to me Hollo Miss Coleman here s your friend coming along What friend I says for I ain t got no friends as I know round here nor yet I hope no enemies neither And I looks round and there was the Arab party coming tearing down the road his bedcover thing all flying in the wind and his arms straight out in front of him I never did see anyone go at such a pace My goodness I says I wonder he don t do himself an injury I wonder someone else don t do him an injury says the milkman The very sight of him is enough to make my milk go sour And he picked up his pail and went away quite grumpy though what that Arab party s done to him is more than I can say I have always noticed that milkman s temper s short like his measure I wasn t best pleased with him for speaking of that Arab party as my friend which he never has been and never won t be and never could be neither Five persons went to the house after the milkman was gone and that there Arab party was safe inside three of them was commercials that I know because afterwards they came to me But of course they none of them got no chance with that there Arab party except of hammering at his front door which ain t what you might call a paying game nor nice for the temper but for that I don t blame him for if once those commercials do begin talking they ll talk for ever Now I m coming to this afternoon I thought it was about time though for the life of me I did not dare to hint as much Well it might have been three or it might have been half past anyhow it was thereabouts when up there comes two men and a woman which one of the men was that young man what s a friend of yours Oh I says to myself here s something new in callers I wonder what it is they re wanting That young man what was a friend of yours he starts hammering and hammering as the custom was with every one who came and as usual no more notice was taken of him than nothing though I knew that all the time the Arab party was indoors At this point I felt that at all hazards I must interpose a question You are sure he was indoors She took it better than I feared she might Of course I m sure hadn t I seen him come in at seven and he never hadn t gone out since for I don t believe that I d taken my eyes off the place not for two minutes together and I d never had a sight of him If he wasn t indoors where was he then For the moment so far as I was concerned the query was unanswerable She triumphantly continued Instead of doing what most did when they d had enough of hammering and going away these three they went round to the back and I m blessed if they mustn t have got through the kitchen window woman and all for all of a sudden the blind in the front room was pulled not up but down dragged down it was and there was that young man what s a friend of yours standing with it in his hand Well I says to myself if that ain t cool I should like to know what is If when you ain t let in you can let yourself in and that without so much as saying by your leave or with your leave things is coming to a pretty pass Wherever can that Arab party be and whatever can he be thinking of to let them go on like that because that he s the sort to allow a liberty to be took with him and say nothing I don t believe Every moment I expects to hear a noise and see a row begin but so far as I could make out all was quiet and there wasn t nothing of the kind So I says to myself There s more in this than meets the eye and them three parties must have right upon their side or they wouldn t be doing what they are doing in the way they are there d be a shindy Presently in about five minutes the front door opens and a young man not the one what s your friend but the other comes sailing out and through the gate and down the road as stiff and upright as a grenadier I never see anyone walk more upright and few as fast At his heels comes the young man what is your friend and it seems to me that he couldn t make out what this other was a doing of I says to myself There s been a quarrel between them two and him as has gone has hooked it This young man what is your friend he stood at the gate all of a fidget staring after the other with all his eyes as if he couldn t think what to make of him and the young woman she stood on the doorstep staring after him too As the young man what had hooked it turned the corner and was out of sight all at once your friend he seemed to make up his mind and he started off running as hard as he could pelt and the young woman was left alone I expected every minute to see him come back with the other young man and the young woman by the way she hung about the gate she seemed to expect it too But no nothing of the kind So when as I expect she d had enough of waiting she went into the house again and I see her pass the front room window After a while back she comes to the gate and stands looking and looking but nothing was to be seen of either of them young men When she d been at the gate I daresay five minutes back she goes into the house and I never saw nothing of her again You never saw anything of her again Are you sure she went back into the house As sure as I am that I see you I suppose that you didn t keep a constant watch upon the premises But that s just what I did do I felt something queer was going on and I made up my mind to see it through And when I make up my mind to a thing like that I m not easy to turn aside I never moved off the chair at my bedroom window and I never took my eyes off the house not till you come knocking at my front door But since the young lady is certainly not in the house at present she must have eluded your observation and in some manner have left it without your seeing her I don t believe she did I don t see how she could have done there s something queer about that house since that Arab party s been inside it But though I didn t see her I did see someone else Who was that A young man A young man Yes a young man and that s what puzzled me and what s been puzzling me ever since for see him go in I never did do Can you describe him Not as to the face for he wore a dirty cloth cap pulled down right over it and he walked so quickly that I never had a proper look But I should know him anywhere if I saw him if only because of his clothes and his walk What was there peculiar about his clothes and his walk Why his clothes were that old and torn and dirty that a ragman wouldn t have given a thank you for them and as for fit there wasn t none they hung upon him like a scarecrow he was a regular figure of fun I should think the boys would call after him if they saw him in the street As for his walk he walked off just like the first young man had done he strutted along with his shoulders back and his head in the air and that stiff and straight that my kitchen poker would have looked crooked beside of him Did nothing happen to attract your attention between the young lady s going back into the house and the coming out of this young man Miss Coleman cogitated Now you mention it there did though I should have forgotten all about it if you hadn t asked me that comes of your not letting me tell the tale in my own way About twenty minutes after the young woman had gone in someone put up the blind in the front room which that young man had dragged right down I couldn t see who it was for the blind was between us and it was about ten minutes after that that young man came marching out And then what followed Why in about another ten minutes that Arab party himself comes scooting through the door The Arab party Yes the Arab party The sight of him took me clean aback Where he d been and what he d been doing with himself while them there people played hi spy hi about his premises I d have given a shilling out of my pocket to have known but there he was as large as life and carrying a bundle A bundle A bundle on his head like a muffin man carries his tray It was a great thing you never would have thought he could have carried it and it was easy to see that it was as much as he could manage it bent him nearly double and he went crawling along like a snail it took him quite a time to get to the end of the road mister Lessingham leaped up from his seat crying Marjorie was in that bundle I doubt it I said He moved about the room distractedly wringing his hands She was she must have been God help us all I repeat that I doubt it If you will be advised by me you will wait awhile before you arrive at any such conclusion All at once there was a tapping at the window pane Atherton was staring at us from without He shouted through the glass Come out of that you fossils I ve news for you CHAPTER XLI THE CONSTABLE HIS CLUE AND THE CAB Miss Coleman getting up in a fluster went hurrying to the door I won t have that young man in my house I won t have him Don t let him dare to put his nose across my doorstep I endeavoured to appease her perturbation I promise you that he shall not come in Miss Coleman My friend here and I will go and speak to him outside She held the front door open just wide enough to enable Lessingham and me to slip through then she shut it after us with a bang She evidently had a strong objection to any intrusion on Sydney s part Standing just without the gate he saluted us with a characteristic vigour which was scarcely flattering to our late hostess Behind him was a constable I hope you two have been mewed in with that old pussy long enough While you ve been tittle tattling I ve been doing listen to what this bobby s got to say The constable his thumbs thrust inside his belt wore an indulgent smile upon his countenance He seemed to find Sydney amusing He spoke in a deep bass voice as if it issued from his boots I don t know that I ve got anything to say It was plain that Sydney thought otherwise You wait till I ve given this pretty pair of gossips a lead officer then I ll trot you out He turned to us After I d poked my nose into every dashed hole in that infernal den and been rewarded with nothing but a pain in the back for my trouble I stood cooling my heels on the doorstep wondering if I should fight the cabman or get him to fight me just to pass the time away for he says he can box and he looks it when who should come strolling along but this magnificent example of the metropolitan constabulary He waved his hand towards the policeman whose grin grew wider I looked at him and he looked at me and then when we d had enough of admiring each other s fine features and striking proportions he said to me Has he gone I said Who Baxter or Bob Brown He said No the Arab I said What do you know about any Arab He said Well I saw him in the Broadway about three quarters of an hour ago and then seeing you here and the house all open I wondered if he had gone for good With that I almost jumped out of my skin though you can bet your life I never showed it I said How do you know it was he He said It was him right enough there s no doubt about that If you ve seen him once you re not likely to forget him Where was he going He was talking to a cabman four wheeler He d got a great bundle on his head wanted to take it inside with him Cabman didn t seem to see it That was enough for me I picked this most deserving officer up in my arms and carried him across the road to you two fellows like a flash of lightning Since the policeman was six feet three or four and more than sufficiently broad in proportion his scarcely seemed the kind of figure to be picked up in anybody s arms and carried like a flash of lightning which as his smile grew more indulgent he himself appeared to think Still even allowing for Atherton s exaggeration the news which he had brought was sufficiently important I questioned the constable upon my own account There is my card officer probably before the day is over a charge of a very serious character will be preferred against the person who has been residing in the house over the way In the meantime it is of the utmost importance that a watch should be kept upon his movements I suppose you have no sort of doubt that the person you saw in the Broadway was the one in question Not a morsel I know him as well as I do my own brother we all do upon this beat He s known amongst us as the Arab I ve had my eye on him ever since he came to the place A queer fish he is I always have said that he s up to some game or other I never came across one like him for flying about in all sorts of weather at all hours of the night always tearing along as if for his life As I was telling this gentleman I saw him in the Broadway well now it s about an hour since perhaps a little more I was coming on duty when I saw a crowd in front of the District Railway Station and there was the Arab having a sort of argument with the cabman He had a great bundle on his head five or six feet long perhaps longer He wanted to take this great bundle with him into the cab and the cabman he didn t see it You didn t wait to see him drive off No I hadn t time I was due at the station I was cutting it pretty fine as it was You didn t speak to him or to the cabman No it wasn t any business of mine you understand The whole thing just caught my eye as I was passing And you didn t take the cabman s number No well as far as that goes it wasn t needful I know the cabman his name and all about him his stable s in Bradmore I whipped out my note book Give me his address I don t know what his Christian name is Tom I believe but I m not sure Anyhow his surname s Ellis and his address is Church Mews saint John s Road Bradmore I don t know his number but any one will tell you which is his place if you ask for Four Wheel Ellis that s the name he s known by among his pals because of his driving a four wheeler Thank you officer I am obliged to you Two half crowns changed hands If you will keep an eye on the house and advise me at the address which you will find on my card of any thing which takes place there during the next few days you will do me a service We had clambered back into the hansom the driver was just about to start when the constable was struck by a sudden thought One moment sir blessed if I wasn t going to forget the most important bit of all I did hear him tell Ellis where to drive him to he kept saying it over and over again in that queer lingo of his Waterloo Railway Station Waterloo Railway Station All right said Ellis I ll drive you to Waterloo Railway Station right enough only I m not going to have that bundle of yours inside my cab There isn t room for it so you put it on the roof To Waterloo Railway Station said the Arab I take my bundle with me to Waterloo Railway Station I take it with me Who says you don t take it with you said Ellis You can take it and twenty more besides for all I care only you don t take it inside my cab put it on the roof I take it with me to Waterloo Railway Station said the Arab and there they were wrangling and jangling and neither seeming to be able to make out what the other was after and the people all laughing Waterloo Railway Station you are sure that was what he said I ll take my oath to it because I said to myself when I heard it I wonder what you ll have to pay for that little lot for the District Railway Station s outside the four mile radius As we drove off I was inclined to ask myself a little bitterly and perhaps unjustly if it were not characteristic of the average London policeman to almost forget the most important part of his information at any rate to leave it to the last and only to bring it to the front on having his palm crossed with silver As the hansom bowled along we three had what occasionally approached a warm discussion Marjorie was in that bundle began Lessingham in the most lugubrious of tones and with the most woe begone of faces I doubt it I observed She was I feel it I know it She was either dead and mutilated or gagged and drugged and helpless All that remains is vengeance I repeat that I doubt it Atherton struck in I am bound to say with the best will in the world to think otherwise that I agree with Lessingham You are wrong It s all very well for you to talk in that cock sure way but it s easier for you to say I m wrong than to prove it If I am wrong and if Lessingham s wrong how do you explain his extraordinary insistance on taking it inside the cab with him which the bobby describes If there wasn t something horrible awful in that bundle of his of which he feared the discovery why was he so reluctant to have it placed upon the roof There probably was something in it which he was particularly anxious should not be discovered but I doubt if it was anything of the kind which you suggest Here is Marjorie in a house alone nothing has been seen of her since her clothing her hair is found hidden away under the floor This scoundrel sallies forth with a huge bundle on his head the bobby speaks of it being five or six feet long or longer a bundle which he regards with so much solicitude that he insists on never allowing it to go for a single instant out of his sight and reach What is in the thing don t all the facts most unfortunately point in one direction mister Lessingham covered his face with his hands and groaned I fear that mister Atherton is right I differ from you both Sydney at once became heated Then perhaps you can tell us what was in the bundle I fancy I could make a guess at the contents Oh you could could you then perhaps for our sakes you ll make it and not play the oracular owl Lessingham and I are interested in this business after all It contained the bearer s personal property that and nothing more Stay before you jeer at me suffer me to finish If I am not mistaken as to the identity of the person whom the constable describes as the Arab I apprehend that the contents of that bundle were of much more importance to him than if they had consisted of Miss Lindon either dead or living More I am inclined to suspect that if the bundle was placed on the roof of the cab and if the driver did meddle with it and did find out the contents and understand them he would have been driven out of hand stark staring mad Sydney was silent as if he reflected I imagine he perceived there was something in what I said But what has become of Miss Lindon I fancy that Miss Lindon at this moment is somewhere I don t just now know exactly where but I hope very shortly to be able to give you a clearer notion attired in a rotten dirty pair of boots a filthy tattered pair of trousers a ragged unwashed apology for a shirt a greasy ancient shapeless coat and a frowsy peaked cloth cap They stared at me opened eyed Atherton was the first to speak What on earth do you mean I mean that it seems to me that the facts point in the direction of my conclusions rather than yours and that very strongly too Miss Coleman asserts that she saw Miss London return into the house that within a few minutes the blind was replaced at the front window and that shortly after a young man attired in the costume I have described came walking out of the front door I believe that young man was Miss Marjorie Lindon Lessingham and Atherton both broke out into interrogations with Sydney as usual loudest But man alive what on earth should make her do a thing like that Marjorie the most retiring modest girl on all God s earth walk about in broad daylight in such a costume and for no reason at all my dear Champnell you are suggesting that she first of all went mad She was in a state of trance Good God Champnell Well Then you think that juggling villain did get hold of her Undoubtedly Here is my view of the case mind it is only a hypothesis and you must take it for what it is worth It seems to me quite clear that the Arab as we will call the person for the sake of identification was somewhere about the premises when you thought he wasn t But where We looked upstairs and downstairs and everywhere where could he have been That as at present advised I am not prepared to say but I think you may take it for granted that he was there He hypnotised the man Holt and sent him away intending you to go after him and so being rid of you both The deuce he did Champnell You write me down an ass As soon as the coast was clear he discovered himself to Miss Lindon who I expect was disagreeably surprised and hypnotised her The hound The devil The first exclamation was Lessingham s the second Sydney s He then constrained her to strip herself to the skin The wretch The fiend He cut off her hair he hid it and her clothes under the floor where we found them where I think it probable that he had already some ancient masculine garments concealed By Jove I shouldn t be surprised if they were Holt s I remember the man saying that that nice joker stripped him of his duds and certainly when I saw him and when Marjorie found him he had absolutely nothing on but a queer sort of cloak Can it be possible that that humorous professor of hankey pankey may all the maledictions of the accursed alight upon his head can have sent Marjorie Lindon the daintiest damsel in the land into the streets of London rigged out in Holt s old togs As to that I am not able to give an authoritative opinion but if I understand you aright it at least is possible Anyhow I am disposed to think that he sent Miss Lindon after the man Holt taking it for granted that he had eluded you That s it Write me down an ass again That he did elude you you have yourself admitted That s because I stopped talking with that mutton headed bobby I d have followed the man to the ends of the earth if it hadn t been for that Precisely the reason is immaterial it is the fact with which we are immediately concerned He did elude you And I think you will find that Miss Lindon and mister Holt are together at this moment In men s clothing Both in men s clothing or rather Miss Lindon is in a man s rags Great Potiphar To think of Marjorie like that And where they are the Arab is not very far off either Lessingham caught me by the arm And what diabolical mischief do you imagine that he proposes to do to her I shirked the question Whatever it is it is our business to prevent his doing it And where do you think they have been taken That it will be our immediate business to endeavour to discover and here at any rate we are at Waterloo CHAPTER XLII THE QUARRY DOUBLES I turned towards the booking office on the main departure platform As I went the chief platform inspector George Bellingham with whom I had some acquaintance came out of his office I stopped him mister Bellingham will you be so good as to step with me to the booking office and instruct the clerk in charge to answer one or two questions which I wish to put to him I will explain to you afterwards what is their exact import but you know me sufficiently to be able to believe me when I say that they refer to a matter in which every moment is of the first importance He turned and accompanied us into the interior of the booking case To which of the clerks mister Champnell do you wish to put your questions To the one who issues third class tickets to Southampton Bellingham beckoned to a man who was counting a heap of money and apparently seeking to make it tally with the entries in a huge ledger which lay open before him he was a short slightly built young fellow with a pleasant face and smiling eyes mister Stone this gentleman wishes to ask you one or two questions I am at his service I put my questions I want to know mister Stone if in the course of the day you have issued any tickets to a person dressed in Arab costume His reply was prompt I have by the last train the seven point twenty five three singles Three singles Then my instinct had told me rightly Can you describe the person mister Stone s eyes twinkled I don t know that I can except in a general way he was uncommonly old and uncommonly ugly and he had a pair of the most extraordinary eyes I ever saw they gave me a sort of all overish feeling when I saw them glaring at me through the pigeon hole But I can tell you one thing about him he had a great bundle on his head which he steadied with one hand and as it bulged out in all directions it s presence didn t make him popular with other people who wanted tickets too Undoubtedly this was our man You are sure he asked for three tickets Certain He said three tickets to Southampton laid down the exact fare nineteen and six and held up three fingers like that Three nasty looking fingers they were with nails as long as talons You didn t see who were his companions I didn t I didn t try to look I gave him his tickets and off he went with the people grumbling at him because that bundle of his kept getting in their way Bellingham touched me on the arm I can tell you about the Arab of whom mister Stone speaks My attention was called to him by his insisting on taking his bundle with him into the carriage it was an enormous thing he could hardly squeeze it through the door it occupied the entire seat But as there weren t as many passengers as usual and he wouldn t or couldn t be made to understand that his precious bundle would be safe in the luggage van along with the rest of the luggage and as he wasn t the sort of person you could argue with to any advantage I had him put into an empty compartment bundle and all Was he alone then I thought so at the time he said nothing about having more than one ticket or any companions but just before the train started two other men English men got into his compartment and as I came down the platform the ticket inspector at the barrier informed me that these two men were with him because he held tickets for the three which as he was a foreigner and they seemed English struck the inspector as odd Could you describe the two men I couldn t not particularly but the man who had charge of the barrier might I was at the other end of the train when they got in All I noticed was that one seemed to be a commonplace looking individual and that the other was dressed like a tramp all rags and tatters a disreputable looking object he appeared to be That I said to myself was Miss Marjorie Lindon the lovely daughter of a famous house the wife elect of a coming statesman To Bellingham I remarked aloud I want you to strain a point mister Bellingham and to do me a service which I assure you you shall never have any cause to regret I want you to wire instructions down the line to detain this Arab and his companions and to keep them in custody until the receipt of further instructions They are not wanted by the police as yet but they will be as soon as I am able to give certain information to the authorities at Scotland Yard and wanted very badly But as you will perceive for yourself until I am able to give that information every moment is important Where s the Station Superintendent He s gone At present I m in charge Then will you do this for me I repeat that you shall never have any reason to regret it I will if you ll accept all responsibility I ll do that with the greatest pleasure Bellingham looked at his watch It s about twenty minutes to nine The train s scheduled for Basingstoke at nine point six If we wire to Basingstoke at once they ought to be ready for them when they come Good The wire was sent We were shown into Bellingham s office to await results Lessingham paced agitatedly to and fro he seemed to have reached the limits of his self control and to be in a condition in which movement of some sort was an absolute necessity The mercurial Sydney on the contrary leaned back in a chair his legs stretched out in front of him his hands thrust deep into his trouser pockets and stared at Lessingham as if he found relief to his feelings in watching his companion s restlessness I for my part drew up as full a precis of the case as I deemed advisable and as time permitted which I despatched by one of the company s police to Scotland Yard Then I turned to my associates Now gentlemen it s past dinner time We may have a journey in front of us If you take my advice you ll have something to eat Lessingham shook his head I want nothing Nor I echoed Sydney I started up You must pardon my saying nonsense but surely you of all men mister Lessingham should be aware that you will not improve the situation by rendering yourself incapable of seeing it through Come and dine I haled them off with me willy nilly to the refreshment room I dined after a fashion mister Lessingham swallowed with difficulty a plate of soup Sydney nibbled at a plate of the most unpromising looking chicken and ham he proved indeed more intractable than Lessingham and was not to be persuaded to tackle anything easier of digestion I was just about to take cheese after chop when Bellingham came hastening in in his hand an open telegram The birds have flown he cried Flown How In reply he gave me the telegram I glanced at it It ran Persons described not in the train Guard says they got out at Vauxhall Have wired Vauxhall to advise you That s a level headed chap said Bellingham The man who sent that telegram His wiring to Vauxhall should save us a lot of time we ought to hear from there directly Hollo what s this I shouldn t be surprised if this is it As he spoke a porter entered he handed an envelope to Bellingham We all three kept our eyes fixed on the inspector s face as he opened it When he perceived the contents he gave an exclamation of surprise This Arab of yours and his two friends seem rather a curious lot mister Champnell He passed the paper on to me It took the form of a report Lessingham and Sydney regardless of forms and ceremonies leaned over my shoulder as I read it Passengers by seven point thirty Southampton on arrival of train complained of noises coming from a compartment in coach eight thousand nine hundred sixty four Stated that there had been shrieks and yells ever since the train left Waterloo as if someone was being murdered An Arab and two Englishmen got out of the compartment in question apparently the party referred to in wire just to hand from Basingstoke All three declared that there was nothing the matter That they had been shouting for fun Arab gave up three third singles for Southampton saying in reply to questions that they had changed their minds and did not want to go any farther As there were no signs of a struggle or of violence nor apparently any definite cause for detention they were allowed to pass They took a four wheeler No nine thousand four hundred thirty five The Arab and one man went inside and the other man on the box They asked to be driven to Commercial Road Limehouse The cab has since returned Driver says he put the three men down at their request in Commercial Road at the corner of Sutcliffe Street near the East India Docks They walked up Sutcliffe Street the Englishmen in front and the Arab behind took the first turning to the right and after that he saw nothing of them The driver further states that all the way the Englishman inside who was so ragged and dirty that he was reluctant to carry him kept up a sort of wailing noise which so attracted his attention that he twice got off his box to see what was the matter and each time he said it was nothing The cabman is of opinion that both the Englishmen were of weak intellect We were of the same impression here They said nothing except at the seeming instigation of the Arab but when spoken to stared and gaped like lunatics It may be mentioned that the Arab had with him an enormous bundle which he persisted in spite of all remonstrances on taking with him inside the cab As soon as I had mastered the contents of the report and perceived what I believed to be unknown to the writer himself its hideous inner meaning I turned to Bellingham With your permission mister Bellingham I will keep this communication it will be safe in my hands you will be able to get a copy and it may be necessary that I should have the original to show to the police If any inquiries are made for me from Scotland Yard tell them that I have gone to the Commercial Road and that I will report my movements from Limehouse Police Station In another minute we were once more traversing the streets of London three in a hansom cab CHAPTER XLIII THE MURDER AT missus ENDERSON S It is something of a drive from Waterloo to Limehouse it seems longer when all your nerves are tingling with anxiety to reach your journey s end and the cab I had hit upon proved to be not the fastest I might have chosen For some time after our start we were silent Each was occupied with his own thoughts Then Lessingham who was sitting at my side said to me mister Champnell you have that report I have Will you let me see it once more I gave it to him He read it once twice and I fancy yet again I purposely avoided looking at him as he did so Yet all the while I was conscious of his pallid cheeks the twitched muscles of his mouth the feverish glitter of his eyes this Leader of Men whose predominate characteristic in the House of Commons was immobility was rapidly approximating to the condition of a hysterical woman The mental strain which he had been recently undergoing was proving too much for his physical strength This disappearance of the woman he loved bade fair to be the final straw I felt convinced that unless something was done quickly to relieve the strain upon his mind he was nearer to a state of complete mental and moral collapse than he himself imagined Had he been under my orders I should have commanded him to at once return home and not to think but conscious that as things were such a direction would be simply futile I decided to do something else instead Feeling that suspense was for him the worst possible form of suffering I resolved to explain so far as I was able precisely what it was I feared and how I proposed to prevent it Presently there came the question for which I had been waiting in a harsh broken voice which no one who had heard him speak on a public platform or in the House of Commons would have recognised as his mister Champnell who do you think this person is of whom the report from Vauxhall Station speaks as being all in rags and tatters He knew perfectly well but I understood the mental attitude which induced him to prefer that the information should seem to come from me I hope that it will prove to be Miss Lindon Hope He gave a sort of gasp Yes hope because if it is I think it possible nay probable that within a few hours you will have her again enfolded in your arms Pray God that it may be so pray God pray the good God I did not dare to look round for from the tremor which was in his tone I was persuaded that in the speaker s eyes were tears Atherton continued silent He was leaning half out of the cab staring straight ahead as if he saw in front a young girl s face from which he could not remove his glance and which beckoned him on After a while Lessingham spoke again as if half to himself and half to me This mention of the shrieks on the railway and of the wailing noise in the cab what must this wretch have done to her How my darling must have suffered That was a theme on which I myself scarcely ventured to allow my thoughts to rest The notion of a gently nurtured girl being at the mercy of that fiend incarnate possessed as I believed that so called Arab to be possessed of all the paraphernalia of horror and of dread was one which caused me tangible shrinkings of the body Whence had come those shrieks and yells of which the writer of the report spoke which had caused the Arab s fellow passengers to think that murder was being done What unimaginable agony had caused them what speechless torture And the wailing noise which had induced the prosaic indurated London cabman to get twice off his box to see what was the matter what anguish had been provocative of that The helpless girl who had already endured so much endured perhaps that to which death would have been preferred shut up in that rattling jolting box on wheels alone with that diabolical Asiatic with the enormous bundle which was but the lurking place of nameless terrors what might she not while being borne through the heart of civilised London have been made to suffer What had she not been made to suffer to have kept up that continued wailing noise It was not a theme on which it was wise to permit one s thoughts to linger and particularly was it clear that it was one from which Lessingham s thoughts should have been kept as far as possible away Come mister Lessingham neither you nor I will do himself any good by permitting his reflections to flow in a morbid channel Let us talk of something else By the way weren t you due to speak in the House to night Due Yes I was due but what does it matter But have you acquainted no one with the cause of your non attendance Acquaint whom should I acquaint My good sir Listen to me mister Lessingham Let me entreat you very earnestly to follow my advice Call another cab or take this and go at once to the House It is not too late Play the man deliver the speech you have undertaken to deliver perform your political duties By coming with me you will be a hindrance rather than a help and you may do your reputation an injury from which it never may recover Do as I counsel you and I will undertake to do my very utmost to let you have good news by the time your speech is finished He turned on me with a bitterness for which I was unprepared If I were to go down to the House and try to speak in the state in which I am now they would laugh at me I should be ruined Do you not run an equally great risk of being ruined by staying away He gripped me by the arm mister Champnell do you know that I am on the verge of madness Do you know that as I am sitting here by your side I am living in a dual world I am going on and on to catch that that fiend and I am back again in that Egyptian den upon that couch of rugs with the Woman of the Songs beside me and Marjorie is being torn and tortured and burnt before my eyes God help me Her shrieks are ringing in my ears He did not speak loudly but his voice was none the less impressive on that account I endeavoured my hardest to be stern I confess that you disappoint me mister Lessingham I have always understood that you were a man of unusual strength you appear instead to be a man of extraordinary weakness with an imagination so ill governed that its ebullitions remind me of nothing so much as feminine hysterics Your wild language is not warranted by circumstances I repeat that I think it quite possible that by to morrow morning she will be returned to you Yes but how as the Marjorie I have known as I saw her last or how That was the question which I had already asked myself in what condition would she be when we had succeeded in snatching her from her captor s grip It was a question to which I had refused to supply an answer To him I lied by implication Let us hope that with the exception of being a trifle scared she will be as sound and hale and hearty as even in her life Do you yourself believe that she ll be like that untouched unchanged unstained Then I lied right out it seemed to me necessary to calm his growing excitement I do You don t mister Lessingham Do you think that I can t see your face and read in it the same thoughts which trouble me As a man of honour do you care to deny that when Marjorie Lindon is restored to me if she ever is you fear she will be but the mere soiled husk of the Marjorie whom I knew and loved Even supposing that there may be a modicum of truth in what you say which I am far from being disposed to admit what good purpose do you propose to serve by talking in such a strain None no good purpose unless it be the desire of looking the truth in the face For mister Champnell you must not seek to play with me the hypocrite nor try to hide things from me as if I were a child If my life is ruined it is ruined let me know it and look the knowledge in the face That to me is to play the man I was silent The wild tale he had told me of that Cairene inferno oddly enough yet why oddly for the world is all coincidence had thrown a flood of light on certain events which had happened some three years previously and which ever since had remained shrouded in mystery The conduct of the business afterwards came into my hands and briefly what had occurred was this Three persons two sisters and their brother who was younger than themselves members of a decent English family were going on a trip round the world They were young adventurous and not to put too fine a point on it foolhardy The evening after their arrival in Cairo by way of what is called a lark in spite of the protestations of people who were better informed than themselves they insisted on going alone for a ramble through the native quarter They went but they never returned Or rather the two girls never returned After an interval the young man was found again what was left of him A fuss was made when there were no signs of their re appearance but as there were no relations nor even friends of theirs but only casual acquaintances on board the ship by which they had travelled perhaps not so great a fuss as might have been was made Anyhow nothing was discovered Their widowed mother alone in England wondering bow it was that beyond the receipt of a brief wire acquainting her with their arrival at Cairo she had heard nothing further of their wanderings placed herself in communication with the diplomatic people over there to learn that to all appearances her three children had vanished from off the face of the earth Then a fuss was made with a vengeance So far as one can judge the whole town and neighbourhood was turned pretty well upside down But nothing came of it so far as any results were concerned the authorities might just as well have left the mystery of their vanishment alone It continued where it was in spite of them However some three months afterwards a youth was brought to the British Embassy by a party of friendly Arabs who asserted that they had found him naked and nearly dying in some remote spot in the Wady Haifa desert It was the brother of the two lost girls He was as nearly dying as he very well could be without being actually dead when they brought him to the Embassy and in a state of indescribable mutilation He seemed to rally for a time under careful treatment but he never again uttered a coherent word It was only from his delirious ravings that any idea was formed of what had really occurred Shorthand notes were taken of some of the utterances of his delirium Afterwards they were submitted to me I remembered the substance of them quite well and when mister Lessingham began to tell me of his own hideous experiences they came back to me more clearly still Had I laid those notes before him I have little doubt but that he would have immediately perceived that seventeen years after the adventure which had left such an indelible scar upon his own life this youth he was little more than a boy had seen the things which he had seen and suffered the nameless agonies and degradations which he had suffered The young man was perpetually raving about some indescribable den of horror which was own brother to Lessingham s temple and about some female monster whom he regarded with such fear and horror that every allusion he made to her was followed by a convulsive paroxysm which taxed all the ingenuity of his medical attendants to bring him out of He frequently called upon his sisters by name speaking of them in a manner which inevitably suggested that he had been an unwilling and helpless witness of hideous tortures which they had undergone and then he would rise in bed screaming They re burning them they re burning them Devils devils And at those times it required all the strength of those who were in attendance to restrain his maddened frenzy The youth died in one of these fits of great preternatural excitement without as I have previously written having given utterance to one single coherent word and by some of those who were best able to judge it was held to have been a mercy that he did die without having been restored to consciousness And presently tales began to be whispered about some idolatrous sect which was stated to have its headquarters somewhere in the interior of the country some located it in this neighbourhood and some in that which was stated to still practise and to always have practised in unbroken historical continuity the debased unclean mystic and bloody rites of a form of idolatry which had had its birth in a period of the world s story which was so remote that to all intents and purposes it might be described as pre historic While the ferment was still at its height a man came to the British Embassy who said that he was a member of a tribe which had its habitat on the banks of the White Nile He asserted that he was in association with this very idolatrous sect though he denied that he was one of the actual sectaries He did admit however that he had assisted more than once at their orgies and declared that it was their constant practice to offer young women as sacrifices preferably white Christian women with a special preference if they could get them to young English women He vowed that he himself had seen with his own eyes English girls burnt alive The description which he gave of what preceded and followed these foul murders appalled those who listened He finally wound up by offering on payment of a stipulated sum of money to guide a troop of soldiers to this den of demons so that they should arrive there at a moment when it was filled with worshippers who were preparing to participate in an orgie which was to take place during the next few days His offer was conditionally accepted He was confined in an apartment with one man on guard inside and another on guard outside the room That night the sentinel without was startled by hearing a great noise and frightful screams issuing from the chamber in which the native was interned He summoned assistance The door was opened The soldier on guard within was stark staring mad he died within a few months a gibbering maniac to the end The native was dead The window which was a very small one was securely fastened inside and strongly barred without There was nothing to show by what means entry had been gained Yet it was the general opinion of those who saw the corpse that the man had been destroyed by some wild beast A photograph was taken of the body after death a copy of which is still in my possession In it are distinctly shown lacerations about the neck and the lower portion of the abdomen as if they had been produced by the claws of some huge and ferocious animal The skull is splintered in half a dozen places and the face is torn to rags That was more than three years ago The whole business has remained as great a mystery as ever But my attention has once or twice been caught by trifling incidents which have caused me to more than suspect that the wild tale told by that murdered native had in it at least the elements of truth and which have even led me to wonder if the trade in kidnapping was not being carried on to this very hour and if women of my own flesh and blood were not still being offered up on that infernal altar And now here was Paul Lessingham a man of world wide reputation of great intellect of undoubted honour who had come to me with a wholly unconscious verification of all my worst suspicions That the creature spoken of as an Arab and who was probably no more an Arab than I was and whose name was certainly not Mohamed el Kheir was an emissary from that den of demons I had no doubt What was the exact purport of the creature s presence in England was another question Possibly part of the intention was the destruction of Paul Lessingham body soul and spirit possibly another part was the procuration of fresh victims for that long drawn out holocaust That this latter object explained the disappearance of Miss Lindon I felt persuaded That she was designed by the personification of evil who was her captor to suffer all the horrors at which the stories pointed and then to be burned alive amidst the triumphant yells of the attendant demons I was certain That the wretch aware that the pursuit was in full cry was tearing twisting doubling and would stick at nothing which would facilitate the smuggling of the victim out of England was clear My interest in the quest was already far other than a merely professional one The blood in my veins tingled at the thought of such a woman as Miss Lindon being in the power of such a monster I may assuredly claim that throughout the whole business I was urged forward by no thought of fee or of reward To have had a share in rescuing that unfortunate girl and in the destruction of her noxious persecutor would have been reward enough for me One is not always even in strictly professional matters influenced by strictly professional instincts The cab slowed A voice descended through the trap door This is Commercial Road sir what part of it do you want Drive me to Limehouse Police Station We were driven there I made my way to the usual inspector behind the usual pigeon hole My name is Champnell Have you received any communication from Scotland Yard to night having reference to a matter in which I am interested Do you mean about the Arab We received a telephonic message about half an hour ago Since communicating with Scotland Yard this has come to hand from the authorities at Vauxhall Station Can you tell me if anything has been seen of the person in question by the men of your division I handed the Inspector the report His reply was laconic I will inquire He passed through a door into an inner room and the report went with him Beg pardon sir but was that a Harab you was a talking about to the Hinspector The speaker was a gentleman unmistakably of the gutter snipe class He was seated on a form Close at hand hovered a policeman whose special duty it seemed to be to keep an eye upon his movements Why do you ask I beg your pardon sir but I saw a Harab myself about a hour ago leastways he looked like as if he was a Harab What sort of a looking person was he I can t ardly tell you that sir because I didn t never have a proper look at him but I know he had a bloomin great bundle on is ead It was like this ere I was comin round the corner as he was passin I never see im till I was right atop of im so that I haccidentally run agin im my heye didn t e give me a downer I was down on the back of my ead in the middle of the road before I knew where I was and e was at the other end of the street If e adn t knocked me more n arf silly I d been after im sharp I tell you and hasked im what e thought e was a doin of but afore my senses was back agin e was out o sight clean You are sure he had a bundle on his head I noticed it most particular How long ago do you say this was and where About a hour ago perhaps more perhaps less Was he alone It seemed to me as if a cove was a follerin im leastways there was a bloke as was a keepin close at is eels though I don t know what is little game was I m sure Ask the pleesman he knows he knows everything the pleesman do I turned to the pleesman Who is this man The pleesman put his hands behind his back and threw out his chest His manner was distinctly affable Well he s being detained upon suspicion He s given us an address at which to make inquiries and inquiries are being made I shouldn t pay too much attention to what he says if I were you I don t suppose he d be particular about a lie or two This frank expression of opinion re aroused the indignation of the gentleman on the form There you hare at it again That s just like you peelers you re all the same What do you know about me Nuffink This general leman ain t got no call to believe me not as I knows on it s all the same to me if e do or don t but it s trewth what I m sayin all the same At this point the Inspector re appeared at the pigeon hole He cut short the flow of eloquence Now then not so much noise outside there He addressed me None of our men have seen anything of the person you re inquiring for so far as we re aware But if you like I will place a man at your disposal and he will go round with you and you will be able to make your own inquiries A capless wildly excited young ragamuffin came dashing in at the street door He gasped out as clearly as he could for the speed which he had made There s been murder done mister Pleesman a Harab s killed a bloke mister Pleesman gripped him by the shoulder What s that The youngster put up his arm and ducked his head instinctively as if to ward off a blow Leave me alone I don t want none of your andling I ain t done nuffink to you I tell you e as The Inspector spoke through the pigeon hole He has what my lad What do you say has happened There s been murder done it s right enough there as up at missus Enderson s in Paradise Place a Harab s been and killed a bloke CHAPTER XLIV THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED

2769_176263_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Atherton collared the youth by the shoulder which mister Pleesman had left disengaged 
2769_176263_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 What sort of looking bloke is it who s been murdered 
none	none	I dunno I aven t seen im missus Enderson she says to me
2769_176263_000006_000003	train-clean-360	 Gustus Barley she says a bloke s been murdered 
none	none	That there Harab what I chucked out alf a hour ago been and murdered im and left im behind up in my back room You run as ard as you can tear and tell them there dratted pleese what s so fond of shovin their dirty noses into respectable people s ouses So I comes and tells yer 
2769_176263_000006_000006	train-clean-360	That s all I knows about it 
2769_176263_000007_000000	train-clean-360	We went four in the hansom which had been waiting in the street to missus Henderson s in Paradise Place the Inspector and we three 
2769_176263_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 mister Pleesman and Gustus Barley followed on foot 
2769_176263_000007_000002	train-clean-360	The Inspector was explanatory 
2769_176263_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Henderson keeps a sort of lodging house a Sailors Home she calls it but no one could call it sweet 
2769_176263_000008_000001	train-clean-360	It doesn t bear the best of characters and if you asked me what I thought of it I should say in plain English that it was a disorderly house 
none	none	Paradise Place proved to be within three or four hundred yards of the Station House 
2769_176263_000009_000001	train-clean-360	So far as could be seen in the dark it consisted of a row of houses of considerable dimensions and also of considerable antiquity 
2769_176263_000009_000002	train-clean-360	They opened on to two or three stone steps which led directly into the street 
2769_176263_000009_000003	train-clean-360	At one of the doors stood an old lady with a shawl drawn over her head 
2769_176263_000009_000004	train-clean-360	This was missus Henderson 
2769_176263_000009_000005	train-clean-360	She greeted us with garrulous volubility 
none	none	So you ave come ave you I thought you never was a comin that I did She recognised the Inspector It s you mister Phillips is it Perceiving us she drew a little back Who s them ere parties They ain t coppers 
2769_176263_000011_000000	train-clean-360	mister Phillips dismissed her inquiry curtly 
2769_176263_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Never you mind who they are 
none	none	What s this about someone being murdered Ssh The old lady glanced round
2769_176263_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t you speak so loud mister Phillips 
2769_176263_000013_000002	train-clean-360	No one don t know nothing about it as yet 
2769_176263_000013_000003	train-clean-360	The parties what s in my ouse is most respectable most and they couldn t abide the notion of there being police about the place 
2769_176263_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 We quite believe that missus Henderson 
2769_176263_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The Inspector s tone was grim 
2769_176263_000016_000000	train-clean-360	missus Henderson led the way up a staircase which would have been distinctly the better for repairs 
none	none	It was necessary to pick one s way as one went and as the light was defective stumbles were not infrequent Our guide paused outside a door on the topmost landing From some mysterious recess in her apparel she produced a key It s in ere 
2769_176263_000018_000001	train-clean-360	I locked the door so that nothing mightn t be disturbed 
2769_176263_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I knows ow particular you pleesmen is 
2769_176263_000019_000000	train-clean-360	She turned the key 
2769_176263_000019_000001	train-clean-360	We all went in we this time in front and she behind 
2769_176263_000020_000000	train-clean-360	A candle was guttering on a broken and dilapidated single washhand stand 
2769_176263_000020_000001	train-clean-360	A small iron bedstead stood by its side the clothes on which were all tumbled and tossed 
none	none	There was a rush seated chair with a hole in the seat and that with the exception of one or two chipped pieces of stoneware and a small round mirror which was hung on a nail against the wall seemed to be all that the room contained 
2769_176263_000020_000003	train-clean-360	I could see nothing in the shape of a murdered man 
2769_176263_000020_000004	train-clean-360	Nor it appeared could the Inspector either 
none	none	What s the meaning of this missus Henderson 
2769_176263_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I don t see anything here 
none	none	It s be ind the bed mister Phillips I left im just where I found im I wouldn t ave touched im not for nothing nor yet ave let nobody else ave touched im neither because as I say I know ow particular you pleesmen is 
2769_176263_000023_000000	train-clean-360	We all four went hastily forward 
2769_176263_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Atherton and I went to the head of the bed Lessingham and the Inspector leaning right across the bed peeped over the side 
2769_176263_000023_000002	train-clean-360	There on the floor in the space which was between the bed and the wall lay the murdered man 
2769_176263_000024_000000	train-clean-360	At sight of him an exclamation burst from Sydney s lips 
2769_176263_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 It s Holt 
none	none	Thank God cried Lessingham It isn t Marjorie 
2769_176263_000027_000000	train-clean-360	The relief in his tone was unmistakable 
2769_176263_000027_000001	train-clean-360	That the one was gone was plainly nothing to him in comparison with the fact that the other was left 
2769_176263_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Thrusting the bed more into the centre of the room I knelt down beside the man on the floor 
2769_176263_000028_000001	train-clean-360	A more deplorable spectacle than he presented I have seldom witnessed 
none	none	He was decently clad in a grey tweed suit white hat collar and necktie and it was perhaps that fact which made his extreme attenuation the more conspicuous 
2769_176263_000028_000003	train-clean-360	I doubt if there was an ounce of flesh on the whole of his body 
2769_176263_000028_000004	train-clean-360	His cheeks and the sockets of his eyes were hollow 
2769_176263_000028_000005	train-clean-360	The skin was drawn tightly over his cheek bones the bones themselves were staring through 
2769_176263_000028_000006	train-clean-360	Even his nose was wasted so that nothing but a ridge of cartilage remained 
2769_176263_000028_000007	train-clean-360	I put my arm beneath his shoulder and raised him from the floor no resistance was offered by the body s gravity he was as light as a little child 
2769_176263_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I doubt I said if this man has been murdered 
2769_176263_000029_000001	train-clean-360	It looks to me like a case of starvation or exhaustion possibly a combination of both 
2769_176263_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that on his neck asked the Inspector he was kneeling at my side 
2769_176263_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He referred to two abrasions of the skin one on either side of the man s neck 
2769_176263_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 They look to me like scratches 
2769_176263_000032_000001	train-clean-360	They seem pretty deep but I don t think they re sufficient in themselves to cause death 
2769_176263_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 They might be joined to an already weakened constitution 
2769_176263_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Is there anything in his pockets let s lift him on to the bed 
2769_176263_000034_000000	train-clean-360	We lifted him on to the bed a featherweight he was to lift 
2769_176263_000034_000001	train-clean-360	While the Inspector was examining his pockets to find them empty a tall man with a big black beard came bustling in 
2769_176263_000034_000002	train-clean-360	He proved to be doctor Glossop the local police surgeon who had been sent for before our quitting the Station House 
2769_176263_000035_000000	train-clean-360	His first pronouncement made as soon as he commenced his examination was under the circumstances sufficiently startling 
2769_176263_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe the man s dead 
2769_176263_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Why didn t you send for me directly you found him 
2769_176263_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The question was put to missus Henderson 
none	none	Well doctor Glossop I wouldn t touch im myself and I wouldn t ave im touched by no one else because as I ve said afore I know ow particular them pleesmen is Then in that case if he does die you ll have had a hand in murdering him that s all The lady sniggered Of course doctor Glossop we all knows that you ll always ave your joke
2769_176263_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll find it a joke if you have to hang as you ought to you The doctor said what he did say to himself under his breath 
2769_176263_000041_000001	train-clean-360	I doubt if it was flattering to missus Henderson Have you got any brandy in the house 
none	none	We ve got everythink in the ouse for them as likes to pay for it everythink Then suddenly remembering that the police were present and that hers were not exactly licensed premises Leastways we can send out for it for them parties as gives us the money being as is well known always willing to oblige
2769_176263_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Then send for some to the tap downstairs if that s the nearest 
2769_176263_000043_000001	train-clean-360	If this man dies before you ve brought it I ll have you locked up as sure as you re a living woman 
2769_176263_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The arrival of the brandy was not long delayed but the man on the bed had regained consciousness before it came 
2769_176263_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Opening his eyes he looked up at the doctor bending over him 
none	none	Hollo my man 
2769_176263_000045_000001	train-clean-360	that s more like the time of day 
2769_176263_000045_000002	train-clean-360	How are you feeling 
none	none	The patient stared hazily up at the doctor as if his sense of perception was not yet completely restored as if this big bearded man was something altogether strange 
2769_176263_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Atherton bent down beside the doctor 
2769_176263_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I m glad to see you looking better mister Holt 
2769_176263_000047_000001	train-clean-360	You know me don t you 
2769_176263_000047_000002	train-clean-360	I ve been running about after you all day long 
2769_176263_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 You are you are The man s eyes closed as if the effort at recollection exhausted him 
2769_176263_000048_000001	train-clean-360	He kept them closed as he continued to speak 
2769_176263_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I know who you are 
none	none	You are the gentleman Yes that s it I m the gentleman name of Atherton Miss Lindon s friend 
2769_176263_000050_000001	train-clean-360	And I daresay you re feeling pretty well done up and in want of something to eat and drink here s some brandy for you 
2769_176263_000051_000000	train-clean-360	The doctor had some in a tumbler 
2769_176263_000051_000001	train-clean-360	He raised the patient s head allowing it to trickle down his throat 
2769_176263_000051_000002	train-clean-360	The man swallowed it mechanically motionless as if unconscious what it was that he was doing 
none	none	His cheeks flushed the passing glow of colour caused their condition of extraordinary and indeed extravagant attentuation to be more prominent than ever 
2769_176263_000051_000004	train-clean-360	The doctor laid him back upon the bed feeling his pulse with one hand while he stood and regarded him in silence 
2769_176263_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Then turning to the Inspector he said to him in an undertone 
2769_176263_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 If you want him to make a statement he ll have to make it now he s going fast 
2769_176263_000053_000001	train-clean-360	You won t be able to get much out of him he s too far gone and I shouldn t bustle him but get what you can 
2769_176263_000054_000000	train-clean-360	The Inspector came to the front a notebook in his hand 
2769_176263_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I understand from this gentleman signifying Atherton that your name s Robert Holt 
2769_176263_000055_000001	train-clean-360	I m an Inspector of police and I want you to tell me what has brought you into this condition 
none	none	Has anyone been assaulting you Holt opening his eyes glanced up at the speaker mistily as if he could not see him clearly still less understand what it was that he was saying 
2769_176263_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Sydney stooping over him endeavoured to explain 
2769_176263_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 The Inspector wants to know how you got here has anyone been doing anything to you 
2769_176263_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Has anyone been hurting you 
2769_176263_000058_000000	train-clean-360	The man s eyelids were partially closed 
2769_176263_000058_000001	train-clean-360	Then they opened wider and wider 
2769_176263_000058_000002	train-clean-360	His mouth opened too 
2769_176263_000058_000003	train-clean-360	On his skeleton features there came a look of panic fear 
2769_176263_000058_000004	train-clean-360	He was evidently struggling to speak 
2769_176263_000058_000005	train-clean-360	At last words came 
2769_176263_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 The beetle He stopped 
2769_176263_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Then after an effort spoke again 
none	none	The beetle
2769_176263_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 What s he mean asked the Inspector 
none	none	I think I understand Sydney answered then turning again to the man in the bed Yes I hear what you say the beetle 
2769_176263_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Well has the beetle done anything to you 
2769_176263_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 It took me by the throat 
2769_176263_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that the meaning of the marks upon your neck 
2769_176263_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 The beetle killed me 
2769_176263_000065_000000	train-clean-360	The lids closed 
2769_176263_000065_000001	train-clean-360	The man relapsed into a state of lethargy 
2769_176263_000065_000002	train-clean-360	The Inspector was puzzled and said so 
2769_176263_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 What s he mean about a beetle 
2769_176263_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Atherton replied 
2769_176263_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 I think I understand what he means and my friends do too 
2769_176263_000068_000001	train-clean-360	We ll explain afterwards 
none	none	In the meantime I think I d better get as much out of him as I can while there s time Yes said the doctor his hand upon the patient s pulse while there s time 
2769_176263_000069_000001	train-clean-360	There isn t much only seconds 
2769_176263_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Sydney endeavoured to rouse the man from his stupor 
2769_176263_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve been with Miss Lindon all the afternoon and evening haven t you mister Holt 
2769_176263_000072_000000	train-clean-360	Atherton had reached a chord in the man s consciousness 
2769_176263_000072_000001	train-clean-360	His lips moved in painful articulation 
2769_176263_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes all the afternoon and evening God help me 
2769_176263_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope God will help you my poor fellow you ve been in need of His help if ever man was 
2769_176263_000074_000001	train-clean-360	Miss Lindon is disguised in your old clothes isn t she 
2769_176263_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes in my old clothes 
none	none	My God
2769_176263_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 And where is Miss Lindon now 
none	none	The man had been speaking with his eyes closed 
2769_176263_000077_000001	train-clean-360	Now he opened them wide there came into them the former staring horror 
2769_176263_000077_000002	train-clean-360	He became possessed by uncontrollable agitation half raising himself in bed 
2769_176263_000077_000003	train-clean-360	Words came from his quivering lips as if they were only drawn from him by the force of his anguish 
2769_176263_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 The beetle s going to kill Miss Lindon 
2769_176263_000079_000000	train-clean-360	A momentary paroxysm seemed to shake the very foundations of his being 
2769_176263_000079_000001	train-clean-360	His whole frame quivered 
none	none	He fell back on to the bed ominously 
2769_176263_000079_000003	train-clean-360	The doctor examined him in silence while we too were still 
2769_176263_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 This time he s gone for good there ll be no conjuring him back again 
2769_176263_000081_000000	train-clean-360	I felt a sudden pressure on my arm and found that Lessingham was clutching me with probably unconscious violence 
none	none	The muscles of his face were twitching 
2769_176263_000081_000002	train-clean-360	He trembled 
2769_176263_000081_000003	train-clean-360	I turned to the doctor 
2769_176263_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Doctor if there is any of that brandy left will you let me have it for my friend 
none	none	Lessingham disposed of the remainder of the shillings worth I rather fancy it saved us from a scene 
2769_176263_000084_000000	train-clean-360	The Inspector was speaking to the woman of the house 
2769_176263_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Now missus Henderson perhaps you ll tell us what all this means 
2769_176263_000085_000001	train-clean-360	Who is this man and how did he come in here and who came in with him and what do you know about it altogether 
none	none	If you ve got anything to say say it only you d better be careful because it s my duty to warn you that anything you do say may be used against you CHAPTER XLV ALL THAT missus ENDERSON KNEW missus Henderson put her hands under her apron and smirked Well mister Phillips it do sound strange to ear you talkin to me like that Anybody d think I d done something as I didn t ought to a done to ear you going on As for what s appened I ll tell you all I know with the greatest willingness on earth And as for bein careful there ain t no call for you to tell me to be that for that I always am as by now you ought to know Yes I do know Is that all you have to say Rilly mister Phillips what a man you are for catching people up you rilly are O course that ain t all I ve got to say ain t I just a comin to it Then come If you presses me so you ll muddle of me up and then if I do appen to make a herror you ll say I m a liar when goodness knows there ain t no more truthful woman not in Limehouse Words plainly trembled on the Inspector s lips which he refrained from uttering missus Henderson cast her eyes upwards as if she sought for inspiration from the filthy ceiling So far as I can swear it might ave been a hour ago or it might ave been a hour and a quarter or it might ave been a hour and twenty minutes We re not particular as to the seconds When I ears a knockin at my front door and when I comes to open it there was a Harab party with a great bundle on is ead bigger nor isself and two other parties along with him This Harab party says in that queer foreign way them Harab parties as of talkin A room for the night a room Now I don t much care for foreigners and never did especially them Harabs which their abits ain t my own so I as much ints the same But this ere Harab party he didn t seem to quite foller of my meaning for all he done was to say as he said afore A room for the night a room And he shoves a couple of arf crowns into my and Now it s always been a motter o mine that money is money and one man s money is as good as another man s So not wishing to be disagreeable which other people would have taken em if I adn t I shows em up ere I d been downstairs it might ave been arf a hour when I ears a shindy a coming from this room What sort of a shindy Yelling and shrieking oh my gracious it was enough to set your blood all curdled for ear piercingness I never did ear nothing like it We do ave troublesome parties in ere like they do elsewhere but I never did ear nothing like that before I stood it for about a minute but it kep on and kep on and every moment I expected as the other parties as was in the ouse would be complainin so up I comes and I thumps at the door and it seemed that thump I might for all the notice that was took of me Did the noise keep on Keep on I should think it did keep on Lord love you shriek after shriek I expected to see the roof took off Were there any other noises For instance were there any sounds of struggling or of blows There weren t no sounds except of the party hollering One party only One party only As I says afore shriek after shriek when you put your ear to the panel there was a noise like some other party blubbering but that weren t nothing as for the hollering you wouldn t have thought that nothing what you might call umin could ave kep up such a screechin I thumps and thumps and at last when I did think that I should ave to ave the door broke down the Harab says to me from inside Go away I pay for the room go away I did think that pretty good I tell you that So I says Pay for the room or not pay for the room you didn t pay to make that shindy And what s more I says If I ear it again I says out you goes And if you don t go quiet I ll ave somebody in as ll pretty quickly make you Then was there silence So to speak there was only there was this sound as if some party was a blubbering and another sound as if a party was a panting for his breath Then what happened Seeing that so to speak all was quiet down I went again And in another quarter of a hour or it might ave been twenty minutes I went to the front door to get a mouthful of hair And missus Barker what lives over the road at No twenty four she comes to me and says That there Arab party of yours didn t stop long I looks at er I don t quite foller you I says which I didn t I saw him come in she says and then a few minutes back I see im go again with a great bundle on is ead he couldn t ardly stagger under Oh I says that s news to me I didn t know e d gone nor see him neither which I didn t So up I comes again and sure enough the door was open and it seems to me that the room was empty till I come upon this pore young man what was lying be ind the bed There was a growl from the doctor If you d had any sense and sent for me at once he might have been alive at this moment Ow was I to know that doctor Glossop I couldn t tell My finding im there murdered was quite enough for me So I runs downstairs and I nips old of Gustus Barley what was leaning against the wall and I says to him Gustus Barley run to the station as fast as you can and tell em that a man s been murdered that Harab s been and killed a bloke And that s all I know about it and I couldn t tell you no more mister Phillips not if you was to keep on asking me questions not for hours and hours Then you think it was this man with a motion towards the bed who was shrieking To tell you the truth mister Phillips about that I don t ardly know what to think If you ad asked me I should ave said it was a woman I ought to know a woman s holler when I ear it if any one does I ve eard enough of em in my time goodness knows And I should ave said that only a woman could ave hollered like that and only er when she was raving mad But there weren t no woman with him There was only this man what s murdered and the other man and as for the other man I will say this that e adn t got twopennyworth of clothes to cover im But mister Phillips howsomever that may be that s the last Harab I ll ave under my roof no matter what they pays and you may mark my words I ll ave no more missus Henderson once more glancing upward as if she imagined herself to have made some declaration of a religious nature shook her head with much solemnity CHAPTER XLVI THE SUDDEN STOPPING As we were leaving the house a constable gave the Inspector a note Having read it he passed it to me It was from the local office Message received that an Arab with a big bundle on his head has been noticed loitering about the neighbourhood of saint Pancras Station He seemed to be accompanied by a young man who had the appearance of a tramp Young man seemed ill They appeared to be waiting for a train probably to the North Shall I advise detention I scribbled on the flyleaf of the note Have them detained If they have gone by train have a special in readiness In a minute we were again in the cab I endeavoured to persuade Lessingham and Atherton to allow me to conduct the pursuit alone in vain I had no fear of Atherton s succumbing but I was afraid for Lessingham What was more almost than the expectation of his collapse was the fact that his looks and manner his whole bearing so eloquent of the agony and agitation of his mind was beginning to tell upon my nerves A catastrophe of some sort I foresaw Of the curtain s fall upon one tragedy we had just been witnesses That there was worse much worse to follow I did not doubt Optimistic anticipations were out of the question that the creature we were chasing would relinquish the prey uninjured no one after what we had seen and heard could by any possibility suppose Should a necessity suddenly arise for prompt and immediate action that Lessingham would prove a hindrance rather than a help I felt persuaded But since moments were precious and Lessingham was not to be persuaded to allow the matter to proceed without him all that remained was to make the best of his presence The great arch of saint Pancras was in darkness An occasional light seemed to make the darkness still more visible The station seemed deserted I thought at first that there was not a soul about the place that our errand was in vain that the only thing for us to do was to drive to the police station and to pursue our inquiries there But as we turned towards the booking office our footsteps ringing out clearly through the silence and the night a door opened a light shone out from the room within and a voice inquired Who s that My name s Champnell Has a message been received from me from the Limehouse Police Station Step this way We stepped that way into a snug enough office of which one of the railway inspectors was apparently in charge He was a big man with a fair beard He looked me up and down as if doubtfully Lessingham he recognised at once He took off his cap to him mister Lessingham I believe I am mister Lessingham Have you any news for me I fancy by his looks that the official was struck by the pallor of the speaker s face and by his tremulous voice I am instructed to give certain information to a mister Augustus Champnell I am mister Champnell What s your information With reference to the Arab about whom you have been making inquiries A foreigner dressed like an Arab with a great bundle on his head took two single thirds for Hull by the midnight express Was he alone It is believed that he was accompanied by a young man of very disreputable appearance They were not together at the booking office but they had been seen together previously A minute or so after the Arab had entered the train this young man got into the same compartment they were in the front waggon Why were they not detained We had no authority to detain them nor any reason until your message was received a few minutes ago we at this station were not aware that inquiries were being made for them You say he booked to Hull does the train run through to Hull No it doesn t go to Hull at all Part of it s the Liverpool and Manchester Express and part of it s for Carlisle It divides at Derby The man you re looking for will change either at Sheffield or at Cudworth Junction and go on to Hull by the first train in the morning There s a local service I looked at my watch You say the train left at midnight It s now nearly five and twenty past Where s it now Nearing saint Albans it s due there twelve point thirty five Would there be time for a wire to reach saint Albans Hardly and anyhow there ll only be enough railway officials about the place to receive and despatch the train They ll be fully occupied with their ordinary duties There won t be time to get the police there You could wire to saint Albans to inquire if they were still in the train That could be done certainly I ll have it done at once if you like Then where s the next stoppage Well they re at Luton at twelve point fifty one But that s another case of saint Albans You see there won t be much more than twenty minutes by the time you ve got your wire off and I don t expect there ll be many people awake at Luton At these country places sometimes there s a policeman hanging about the station to see the express go through but on the other hand very often there isn t and if there isn t probably at this time of night it ll take a good bit of time to get the police on the premises I tell you what I should advise What s that The train is due at Bedford at one point twenty nine send your wire there There ought to be plenty of people about at Bedford and anyhow there ll be time to get the police to the station Very good I instructed them to tell you to have a special ready have you got one There s an engine with steam up in the shed we ll have all ready for you in less than ten minutes And I tell you what you ll have about fifty minutes before the train is due at Bedford It s a fifty mile run With luck you ought to get there pretty nearly as soon as the express does Shall I tell them to get ready At once While he issued directions through a telephone to what I presume was the engine shed I drew up a couple of telegrams Having completed his orders he turned to me They re coming out of the siding now they ll be ready in less than ten minutes I ll see that the line s kept clear Have you got those wires Here is one this is for Bedford It ran Arrest the Arab who is in train due at one point twenty nine When leaving saint Pancras he was in a third class compartment in front waggon He has a large bundle which detain He took two third singles for Hull Also detain his companion who is dressed like a tramp This is a young lady whom the Arab has disguised and kidnapped while in a condition of hypnotic trance Let her have medical assistance and be taken to a hotel All expenses will be paid on the arrival of the undersigned who is following by special train As the Arab will probably be very violent a sufficient force of police should be in waiting AUGUSTUS CHAMPNELL And this is the other It is probably too late to be of any use at saint Albans but send it there and also to Luton Is Arab with companion in train which left saint Pancras at thirteen point zero If so do not let them get out till train reaches Bedford where instructions are being wired for arrest The Inspector rapidly scanned them both They ought to do your business I should think Come along with me I ll have them sent at once and we ll see if your train s ready The train was not ready nor was it ready within the prescribed ten minutes There was some hitch I fancy about a saloon Finally we had to be content with an ordinary old fashioned first class carriage The delay however was not altogether time lost Just as the engine with its solitary coach was approaching the platform someone came running up with an envelope in his hand Telegram from saint Albans I tore it open It was brief and to the point Arab with companion was in train when it left here Am wiring Luton That s all right Now unless something wholly unforeseen takes place we ought to have them That unforeseen I went forward with the Inspector and the guard of our train to exchange a few final words with the driver The Inspector explained what instructions he had given I ve told the driver not to spare his coal but to take you into Bedford within five minutes after the arrival of the express He says he thinks that he can do it The driver leaned over his engine rubbing his hands with the usual oily rag He was a short wiry man with grey hair and a grizzled moustache with about him that bearing of semi humorous frank faced resolution which one notes about engine drivers as a class We ought to do it the gradients are against us but it s a clear night and there s no wind The only thing that will stop us will be if there s any shunting on the road or any luggage trains of course if we are blocked we are blocked but the Inspector says he ll clear the way for us Yes said the Inspector I ll clear the way I ve wired down the road already Atherton broke in Driver if you get us into Bedford within five minutes of the arrival of the mail there ll be a five pound note to divide between your mate and you The driver grinned We ll get you there in time sir if we have to go clear through the shunters It isn t often we get a chance of a five pound note for a run to Bedford and we ll do our best to earn it The fireman waved his hand in the rear That s right sir he cried We ll have to trouble you for that five pound note So soon as we were clear of the station it began to seem probable that as the fireman put it Atherton would be troubled Journeying in a train which consists of a single carriage attached to an engine which is flying at topmost speed is a very different business from being an occupant of an ordinary train which is travelling at ordinary express rates I had discovered that for myself before That night it was impressed on me more than ever A tyro or even a nervous season might have been excused for expecting at every moment we were going to be derailed It was hard to believe that the carriage had any springs it rocked and swung and jogged and jolted Of smooth travelling had we none Talking was out of the question and for that I personally was grateful Quite apart from the difficulty we experienced in keeping our seats and when every moment our position was being altered and we were jerked backwards and forwards up and down this way and that that was a business which required care the noise was deafening It was as though we were being pursued by a legion of shrieking bellowing raging demons George shrieked Atherton he does mean to earn that fiver I hope I ll be alive to pay it him He was only at the other end of the carriage but though I could see by the distortion of his visage that he was shouting at the top of his voice and he has a voice I only caught here and there a word or two of what he was saying I had to make sense of the whole Lessingham s contortions were a study Few of that large multitude of persons who are acquainted with him only by means of the portraits which have appeared in the illustrated papers would then have recognised the rising statesman Yet I believe that few things could have better fallen in with his mood than that wild travelling He might have been almost shaken to pieces but the very severity of the shaking served to divert his thoughts from the one dread topic which threatened to absorb them to the exclusion of all else beside Then there was the tonic influence of the element of risk The pick me up effect of a spice of peril Actual danger there quite probably was none but there very really seemed to be And one thing was absolutely certain that if we did come to smash while going at that speed we should come to as everlasting smash as the heart of man could by any possibility desire It is probable that the knowledge that this was so warmed the blood in Lessingham s veins At any rate as to use what in this case was simply a form of speech I sat and watched him it seemed to me that he was getting a firmer hold of the strength which had all but escaped him and that with every jog and jolt he was becoming more and more of a man On and on we went dashing clashing smashing roaring rumbling Atherton who had been endeavouring to peer through the window strained his lungs again in the effort to make himself audible Where the devil are we Looking at my watch I screamed back at him It s nearly one so I suppose we re somewhere in the neighbourhood of Luton Hollo What s the matter That something was the matter seemed certain There was a shrill whistle from the engine In a second we were conscious almost too conscious of the application of the Westinghouse brake Of all the jolting that was ever jolted the mere reverberation of the carriage threatened to resolve our bodies into their component parts Feeling what we felt then helped us to realise the retardatory force which that vacuum brake must be exerting it did not seem at all surprising that the train should have been brought to an almost instant stand still Simultaneously all three of us were on our feet I let down my window and Atherton let down his he shouting out I should think that Inspector s wire hasn t had it s proper effect looks as if we re blocked or else we ve stopped at Luton It can t be Bedford It wasn t Bedford so much seemed clear Though at first from my window I could make out nothing I was feeling more than a trifle dazed there was a singing in my ears the sudden darkness was impenetrable Then I became conscious that the guard was opening the door of his compartment He stood on the step for a moment seeming to hesitate Then with a lamp in his hand he descended on to the line What s the matter I asked Don t know sir Seems as if there was something on the road What s up there This was to the man on the engine The fireman replied Someone in front there s waving a red light like mad lucky I caught sight of him we should have been clean on top of him in another moment Looks as if there was something wrong Here he comes As my eyes grew more accustomed to the darkness I became aware that someone was making what haste he could along the six foot way swinging a red light as he came Our guard advanced to meet him shouting as he went What s the matter Who s that A voice replied My God Is that George Hewett I thought you were coming right on top of us Our guard again What Jim Branson What the devil are you doing here what s wrong I thought you were on the twelve out we re chasing you Are you Then you ve caught us Thank God for it We re a wreck I had already opened the carriage door With that we all three clambered out on to the line CHAPTER XLVII THE CONTENTS OF THE THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE I moved to the stranger who was holding the lamp He was in official uniform Are you the guard of the twelve point zero out from saint Pancras I am Where s your train What s happened As for where it is there it is right in front of you what s left of it As to what s happened why we re wrecked What do you mean by you re wrecked Some heavy loaded trucks broke loose from a goods in front and came running down the hill on top of us How long ago was it Not ten minutes I was just starting off down the road to the signal box it s a good two miles away when I saw you coming My God I thought there was going to be another smash Much damage done Seems to me as if we re all smashed up As far as I can make out they re matchboxed up in front I feel as if I was all broken up inside of me I ve been in the service going on for thirty years and this is the first accident I ve been in It was too dark to see the man s face but judging from his tone he was either crying or very near to it Our guard turned and shouted back to our engine You d better go back to the box and let em know All right came echoing back The special immediately commenced retreating whistling continually as it went All the country side must have heard the engine shrieking and all who did hear must have understood that on the line something was seriously wrong The smashed train was all in darkness the force of the collision had put out all the carriage lamps Here was a flickering candle there the glimmer of a match these were all the lights which shone upon the scene People were piling up debris by the side of the line for the purpose of making a fire more for illumination than for warmth Many of the passengers had succeeded in freeing themselves and were moving hither and thither about the line But the majority appeared to be still imprisoned The carriage doors were jammed Without the necessary tools it was impossible to open them Every step we took our ears were saluted by piteous cries Men women children appealed to us for help Open the door sir In the name of God sir open the door Over and over again in all sorts of tones with all degrees of violence the supplication was repeated The guards vainly endeavoured to appease the in many cases half frenzied creatures All right sir If you ll only wait a minute or two madam We can t get the doors open without tools a special train s just started off to get them If you ll only have patience there ll be plenty of help for everyone of you directly You ll be quite safe in there if you ll only keep still But that was just what they found it most difficult to do keep still In the front of the train all was chaos The trucks which had done the mischief there were afterwards shown to be six of them together with two guards vans appeared to have been laden with bags of Portland cement The bags had burst and everything was covered with what seemed gritty dust The air was full of the stuff it got into our eyes half blinding us The engine of the express had turned a complete somersault It vomited forth smoke and steam and flames every moment it seemed as if the woodwork of the carriages immediately behind and beneath would catch fire The front coaches were as the guard had put it match boxed They were nothing but a heap of debris telescoped into one another in a state of apparently inextricable confusion It was broad daylight before access was gained to what had once been the interiors The condition of the first third class compartment revealed an extraordinary state of things Scattered all over it were pieces of what looked like partially burnt rags and fragments of silk and linen I have those fragments now Experts have assured me that they are actually neither of silk nor linen but of some material animal rather than vegetable with which they are wholly unacquainted On the cushions and woodwork especially on the woodwork of the floor were huge blotches stains of some sort When first noticed they were damp and gave out a most unpleasant smell One of the pieces of woodwork is yet in my possession with the stain still on it Experts have pronounced upon it too with the result that opinions are divided Some maintain that the stain was produced by human blood which had been subjected to a great heat and so to speak parboiled Others declare that it is the blood of some wild animal possibly of some creature of the cat species Yet others affirm that it is not blood at all but merely paint While a fourth describes it as I quote the written opinion which lies in front of me caused apparently by a deposit of some sort of viscid matter probably the excretion of some variety of lizard In a corner of the carriage was the body of what seemed a young man costumed like a tramp It was Marjorie Lindon So far as a most careful search revealed that was all the compartment contained CHAPTER XLVIII THE CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER It is several years since I bore my part in the events which I have rapidly sketched or I should not have felt justified in giving them publicity Exactly how many years for reasons which should be sufficiently obvious I must decline to say Marjorie Lindon still lives The spark of life which was left in her when she was extricated from among the debris of the wrecked express was fanned again into flame Her restoration was however not merely an affair of weeks or months it was a matter of years I believe that even after her physical powers were completely restored in itself a tedious task she was for something like three years under medical supervision as a lunatic But all that skill and money could do was done and in course of time the great healer the results were entirely satisfactory Her father is dead and has left her in possession of the family estates She is married to the individual who in these pages has been known as Paul Lessingham Were his real name divulged she would be recognised as the popular and universally reverenced wife of one of the greatest statesmen the age has seen Nothing has been said to her about the fateful day on which she was consciously or unconsciously paraded through London in the tattered masculine habiliments of a vagabond She herself has never once alluded to it With the return of reason the affair seems to have passed from her memory as wholly as if it had never been which although she may not know it is not the least cause she has for thankfulness Therefore what actually transpired will never in all human probability be certainly known and particularly what precisely occurred in the railway carriage during that dreadful moment of sudden passing from life unto death What became of the creature who all but did her to death who he was if it was a he which is extremely doubtful whence he came whither he went what was the purport of his presence here to this hour these things are puzzles Paul Lessingham has not since been troubled by his old tormentor He has ceased to be a haunted man None the less he continues to have what seems to be a constitutional disrelish for the subject of beetles nor can he himself be induced to speak of them Should they be mentioned in a general conversation should he be unable to immediately bring about a change of theme he will if possible get up and leave the room More on this point he and his wife are one The fact may not be generally known but it is so Also I have reason to believe that there still are moments in which he harks back with something like physical shrinking to that awful nightmare of the past and in which he prays God that as it is distant from him now so may it be kept far off from him for ever Before closing one matter may be casually mentioned The tale has never been told but I have unimpeachable authority for its authenticity During the recent expeditionary advance towards Dongola a body of native troops which was encamped at a remote spot in the desert was aroused one night by what seemed to be the sound of a loud explosion The next morning at a distance of about a couple of miles from the camp a huge hole was discovered in the ground as if blasting operations on an enormous scale had recently been carried on In the hole itself and round about it were found fragments of what seemed bodies credible witnesses have assured me that they were bodies neither of men nor women but of creatures of some monstrous growth I prefer to believe since no scientific examination of the remains took place that these witnesses ignorantly though innocently erred One thing is sure Numerous pieces both of stone and of metal were seen which went far to suggest that some curious subterranean building had been blown up by the force of the explosion Especially were there portions of moulded metal which seemed to belong to what must have been an immense bronze statue There were picked up also more than a dozen replicas in bronze of the whilom sacred scarabaeus That the den of demons described by Paul Lessingham had that night at last come to an end and that these things which lay scattered here and there on that treeless plain were the evidences of its final destruction is not a hypothesis which I should care to advance with any degree of certainty But putting this and that together the facts seem to point that way and it is a consummation devoutly to be desired By the bye Sydney Atherton has married Miss Dora Grayling Her wealth has made him one of the richest men in England She began the story goes by loving him immensely I can answer for the fact that he has ended by loving her as much Their devotion to each other contradicts the pessimistic nonsense which supposes that every marriage must be of necessity a failure He continues his career of an inventor His investigations into the subject of aerial flight which have brought the flying machine within the range of practical politics are on everybody s tongue The best man at Atherton s wedding was Percy Woodville now the Earl of Barnes Within six months afterwards he married one of missus Atherton s bridesmaids It was never certainly shown how Robert Holt came to his end At the inquest the coroner s jury was content to return a verdict of Died of exhaustion He lies buried in Kensal Green Cemetery under a handsome tombstone the cost of which had he had it in his pockets might have indefinitely prolonged his days It should be mentioned that that portion of this strange history which purports to be The Surprising Narration of Robert Holt was compiled from the statements which Holt made to Atherton and to Miss Lindon as she then was when a mud stained shattered derelict he lay at the lady s father s house Miss Linden s contribution towards the elucidation of the mystery was written with her own hand After her physical strength had come back to her and while mentally she still hovered between the darkness and the light her one relaxation was writing Although she would never speak of what she had written it was found that her theme was always the same She confided to pen and paper what she would not speak of with her lips She told and re told and re told again the story of her love and of her tribulation so far as it is contained in the present volume Her MSS invariably began and ended at the same point They have all of them been destroyed with one exception That exception is herein placed before the reader On the subject of the Mystery of the Beetle I do not propose to pronounce a confident opinion Atherton and I have talked it over many and many a time and at the end we have got no forrarder So far as I am personally concerned experience has taught me that there are indeed more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy and I am quite prepared to believe that the so called Beetle which others saw but I never was or is for it cannot be certainly shown that the thing is not still existing a creature born neither of God nor man End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Beetle by Richard Marsh
