none	none	said Polly I don t see wherever she can be Jasper I ve searched just everywhere for her And she gave a little sigh and pushed up the brown rings of hair under her sailor cap Don t worry Polly said Jasper with a reassuring smile She s with Matilda of course Come Polly let s you and I have a try at the shuffle board by ourselves down on the lower deck No we can t said Polly with a dreadful longing at her heart for the charms of a game that is until we ve found Phronsie And she ran down the deck Perhaps she is in one of the library corners though I thought I looked over them all How do you know she isn t with Matilda Polly cried Jasper racing after to see Polly s little blue jacket whisking ahead of him up the companion way Because Polly stopped at the top and looked over her shoulder at him Matilda s in her berth She s awfully seasick I was to stay with Phronsie and now I ve lost her And the brown head drooped and Polly clasped her hands tightly together Oh no she can t be lost Polly said Jasper cheerfully as he bounded up the stairs and gained her side why she couldn t be Well anyway we can t find her Jasper said Polly running on And it s all my fault for I forgot and left her in the library and went with Fanny Vanderburgh down to her state room O dear me as she sped on Well she s in the library now most likely said Jasper cheerfully hurrying after curled up asleep in a corner And they both ran in expecting to see Phronsie s yellow head snuggled into one of the pillows But there was no one there except a little old gentleman on one of the sofas back of a table who held his paper upside down his big spectacles on the end of his nose almost tumbling off as he nodded drowsily with the motion of the steamer O dear me exclaimed Polly now we shall wake him up as they tiptoed around peering in every cosey corner and behind all the tables for a glimpse of Phronsie s little brown gown No danger said Jasper with a glance over at the old gentleman he s just as fast asleep as can be Here Polly I think she s probably tucked up in here And he hurried over to the farther side where the sofa made a generous angle Just then in stalked a tall boy who rushed up to the little old gentleman Here Granddad wake up And he shook his arm smartly You re losing your glasses and then there ll be a beastly row to pay O dear me cried Polly aghast as she and Jasper whirled around Hey what what exclaimed the old gentleman clutching his paper as he started forward Oh why I haven t been asleep Tom Ha Ha tell that to the marines cried Tom loudly dancing in derision You ve been sleeping like a log You d much better go down and get into your state room But give me a sovereign first He held out his hand as he spoke Hurry up Granddad he added impatiently The old gentleman put his hand to his head and then rubbed his eyes Bustle up cried the boy with a laugh or else I ll run my fist in your pocket and help myself Indeed you won t declared the old gentleman now thoroughly awake Ha Ha laughed the boy You see if I won t Granddad Yet he dropped his imperious tone and waited though impatiently while the big pocket book was drawn out What do you want with money on board the boat demanded the old gentleman Give me a sovereign Granddad cried Tom controlling his impatience as best he might with many a cross look at the wrinkled old face under the white hair His Grandfather slowly drew out the coin and Tom twitched it eagerly from the long thin fingers I don t see how you can need money on board the boat repeated the old gentleman Never you mind what I want it for Grand daddy said Tom laughing loudly and shaking the sovereign at him as he ran off that s my business and not yours Polly had not taken her eyes off their faces Now she turned toward Jasper Oh how very dreadful she gasped then would have given everything if she had kept still for the old gentleman whirled around and saw them for the first time Hey who are you and what are you listening there for hey he demanded sharply He had little black eyes and they now snapped in a truly dreadful way at them We came to find her little sister said Jasper politely for Polly was quite beyond speaking Sister I don t know anything about your sister said the old gentleman irascibly And this room isn t a place for children I can tell you he added as if he owned the library and the whole ship Jasper made no reply Phronsie isn t here Polly clasped her hands again tighter than ever And oh Jasper and she looked at the angry old face before them with pitying eyes What I say to my grandson Tom and what he says to me is our own business exclaimed the old gentleman in a passion thumping the table with his clenched hand And no one else has a right to hear it I am so very sorry we heard it said Polly the colour which had quite gone from her cheek now rushing back And we are going right away sir You would much better said the old man nodding angrily And you boy too I suppose you think yourself better than my Tom But you are not not a bit of it And suddenly he tried to start to his feet but lurched heavily against the table instead Polly and Jasper rushed over to him Lean on me sir said Jasper putting both arms around him while Polly ran to his other side he was shaking so dreadfully The old gentleman essayed to wave them off Let me alone he said feebly I m going after my grandson Tom His voice sank to a whisper and his head dropped to his breast He s got money he s always getting it and I m going to see what he s doing with it Polly said Jasper you help me put him back on the sofa there that s it as the old man sank feebly down against the cushions and then I ll run and find his grandson It was just the time when everybody seemed to be in the state rooms or out on deck in steamer chairs so Polly sat there at the old man s head feeling as if every minute were an hour and he kept gurgling Tom s a bad boy he gets money all the time and I m going to see what he s doing with it with feeble waves of his legs that put Polly in a fright lest he should roll off the sofa at every lurch of the steamer Tom is coming at last she said putting her hand on the hot forehead Please stay still sir you will be sick But I don t want Tom to come cried the old gentleman irritably Who said I wanted him to come Hey He turned up his head and looked at her and Polly s hand shook worse than ever when the little snapping eyes were full on her face and she had all she could do to keep from running out of the room and up on deck where she could breathe freely I am so sorry she managed to gasp feeling if she didn t say something she should surely run Does your head feel better And she smoothed his hot forehead gently just as Phronsie always did Grandpapa s when it ached And when she thought of Phronsie then it was all she could do to keep the tears back Where could she be And would Jasper never come back And just then in ran Tom with a great clatter complaining noisily every step of the way I told you you d much better get off to your stateroom Granddad he exclaimed Here I ll help you down there And he laid a hasty hand on the feeble old arm I think he is sick said Polly gently Jasper came hurrying in Phronsie is all right he had time to whisper to Polly Oh Jasper the colour rushed into her cheek that had turned quite white I am so glad Nonsense exclaimed Tom abruptly It s only one of his crotchets You don t know he gets up plenty of em on occasion What did you want a sovereign for asked the old gentleman querulously taking his sharp little eyes off Polly to fasten them on his grandson s face Say I will know And I say no matter retorted Tom roughly And you ought to come down to your state room where you belong Come Granddad And he tried again to lay hold of his arm But the little old gentleman sank back and looked up at Polly again I think I ll stay here he said I say began the boy in an embarrassed way this is dreadfully rough on you and then he looked away from Polly to Jasper And if you knew him as well as I do nodding his head at his Grandfather you wouldn t get in such a funk Polly was busy smoothing the hot forehead under the white hair and appeared not to notice a word he said Your Grandfather really appears ill said Jasper And the doctor might give him something to help him Tom burst into a short laugh and kicked his heel against the table Hoh hoh I say you don t know him oh what muffs you are He s well enough only he s determined not to go to his state room where he belongs but to kick up a row here Very well said Jasper coolly since you are determined to do nothing for his relief I shall take it upon myself to summon the doctor He stepped to a table a bit further off and touched the electric button back of it Here don t do that remonstrated Tom springing forward But it was too late and the steward who attended to calls on the library stepped in It isn t the hour for giving out books he began Tom was stamping his foot impatiently and scowling at Jasper alternately casting longing glances out the nearest port hole It isn t books we want said Jasper quickly but this old gentleman whose head was now heavily sunken on his breast and whose cheek was quite white appears to be very ill and to need the doctor Is that so The steward leaned over and peered into the old face Well he doesn t look just right and that s a fact Is he your father Oh no said Jasper quickly I don t know who he is But do hurry for he s sick and needs the doctor at once I ll get doctor Jones Off ran the steward toward the surgeon s cabin See what you ve done cried Tom in a towering passion Kicked up a pretty mess when I tell you I ve seen my Grandfather just as bad a hundred times Jasper made no reply and Polly continued to stroke gently the poor head Well well well exclaimed mister King coming in to be sure it s very stupid in me not to think of looking in the library for both of you before O dear me bless me And he came to a dead stop of astonishment Father cried Jasper this poor man seems very ill Oh yes breathed Polly pitifully he really is Grandpapa And she put out her hand to seize one of mister King s And Jasper has sent for the doctor And none too soon I should say remarked mister King grimly with a keen glance into the old man s face Raise his feet a little higher Jasper put a pillow under them there that s it Well the doctor should be hurried up He glanced quickly around Here you boy seeing Tom run as you never have run before and tell the doctor to come quickly There isn t any need began Tom Do you go commanded mister King pointing to the door And Tom went Father that boy is his grandson said Jasper pointing to the sick man mister King stared into Jasper s face unable to make a reply He is declared Polly Oh Grandpapa he really is Then she buried her flushed face up against mister King s arm There is no need to waste words said mister King finding his tongue There there Polly child fondling her brown head don t feel badly I m sure you ve done all you could Twas Jasper he did it all I couldn t do anything said Polly Oh Polly you did everything protested Jasper Yes yes I know you both did said mister King Well here s the doctor thank the Lord And then when nobody wanted them the library seemed to be full of people and the news spreading out to the decks many of the passengers got out of their steamer chairs and tried to swarm into the two doorways Tom who never knew how he summoned doctor Jones being chiefly occupied in astonishment at finding that he obeyed a command from a perfect stranger did not come back to the library but kept himself with the same amazed expression on his face idly kicking his heels in a quiet corner of the deck near by He never thought of such a thing as being worried over his Grandfather for he couldn t remember when the old gentleman hadn t been subject to nervous attacks but somehow since a row as he expressed it had been kicked up it was just as well to stay in the vicinity and see the end of it But he wasn t going inside no not he After awhile Tom was just beginning to yawn and to feel that no one could expect him to waste time like that and probably his Grandfather was going to sleep it out on the sofa and the stupid doctor would find that there was nothing the matter only the old man was nervous And I m going back to the fellows decided Tom shaking his long legs Oh here you are cried Jasper running up to him Come quickly seizing his arm Hey here what are you about roared Tom at him shaking off the hand You must excuse me for wasting no ceremony said Jasper sternly It struck Tom that he looked very much like the old gentleman who had told him to go Your Grandfather is very ill something is the matter with his heart and the doctor has sent me for you He says he may not live an hour It was necessary to tell the whole of the dreadful truth for Tom was still staring at him in defiance II TWO ENGLISH FRIENDS I don t want you muttered the old gentleman feebly turning his head away from Tom and then he set his lips tightly together But he held to Polly s hand You would better go out doctor Jones nodded to Tom It excites him The second time Tom was told to go He stood quite still He s my Grandfather he blurted out Can t help it said doctor Jones curtly he s my patient So I tell you again it is imperative that you leave this room Then he turned back to his work of making the sick man comfortable without taking any more notice of the boy Tom gave a good long look at as much of his Grandfather s face as he could see then slunk out in a dazed condition trying to make himself as small as possible Jasper found him a half hour afterward hanging over the rail away from curious eyes his head buried on his arms I thought you d like to know that your Grandfather is better said Jasper touching the bent shoulder Get away will you growled Tom kicking out his leg unmindful where it struck And the doctor has gotten him into his state room and he is as comfortable as he could be made Jasper didn t add that doctor Jones had asked him to come back and that the old man was still insisting that Polly should hold his hand In that case declared Tom suddenly twitching up his head I will go down there His face was so drawn that Jasper started and then looked away over the sea and did not appear to notice the clenched hand down by the boy s side I I didn t know he was sick Tom brought it out in gusts and his face worked worse than ever in his efforts not to show his distress The only thing he could do was to double up his hand tighter than ever as he tried to keep it back of him I understand nodded Jasper still looking off over the blue water And now I ll go down said Tom drawing a long breath and starting off Oh and doctor Jones had said the last thing to Jasper as he rushed off with the good news to Tom On no account let that boy see his Grandfather I won t answer for the consequences if you do See here Jasper tore his gaze off from the shimmering water The doctor doesn t doesn t think you ought to see your Grandfather now Hey cried Tom his drawn lips flying open and his big blue eyes distending in anger He s my Grandfather I rather think I shall do as I ve a mind to and he plunged off Tom Jasper took long steps after him Beg your pardon this is no time for thinking of anything but your Grandfather s life doctor Jones said you were not to see him at present The truth must be told for in another moment the boy would have been off on the wings of the wind And do you think that I will mind in the least what that beastly doctor says cried Tom getting redder and redder in the face his rage was so great Hoh no sir Then your Grandfather s life will be paid as a sacrifice said Jasper calmly And he stood quite still and surveyed the boy before him Neither spoke It seemed to Jasper an age that they stood there in silence At last Tom wavered put out his hand unsteadily leaned against a steamer chair and turned his face away Let us do a bit of a turn on the deck said Jasper suddenly overcoming by a mighty effort his repugnance to the idea Tom shook his head and swallowed hard Oh yes said Jasper summoning all the cheerfulness he could muster to his aid Come it s the very thing to do if you really want to help your Grandfather Tom raised his head and looked at him I never supposed the old man was sick he said brokenly and down went his head again this time upon his hands which were grasping the top of the chair I don t believe you did answered Jasper But come Tom let s walk around the deck we can talk just as well meanwhile Two or three young men with cigarettes in their mouths came sauntering up Tom Selwyn you re a pretty fellow Tom raised his head and looked at them defiantly To give us the slip like this cried one with a sneer in which the others joined with a curious look at Jasper Well come on now said one Yes yes come along said another we ve waited long enough for you to get back I m not coming declared Tom shortly Not coming back Well One of the young men said something under his breath and the first speaker turned on his heel tossing his cigarette over the railing No said Tom I m not coming Did you hear me I believe I had that pleasure said the last named as I am not deaf Come on fellows our little boy has got to wait on his Grandpappy Good by kid He snapped his fingers the other two laughed derisively and sauntered off down the deck as they came Tom shook with passion I d like to walk he said drawing a long breath and setting off unsteadily All right said Jasper falling into step beside him Meantime the old gentleman in his large handsome state room showed no sign of returning to the consciousness that had come back for a brief moment And he held to Polly s hand so tightly as she sat at the head of the berth that there was no chance of withdrawing her fingers had she so desired And Father Fisher with whom doctor Jones had of course made acquaintance before the steamer fairly sailed sat there keeping watch too in a professional way the ship s doctor having called him in consultation over the case And Phronsie who had been in deep penitence because she had wandered off from the library with another little girl to gaze over the railing upon the steerage children below thereby missing Polly was in such woe over it all that she was allowed to cuddle up against Polly s side and hold her other hand And there she sat as still as a mouse hardly daring to breathe And mister King feeling as if after all the case was pretty much under his supervision came softly in at intervals to see that all was well and that the dreadful boy was kept out And the passengers all drifted back to their steamer chairs glad of some new topic to discuss for the gossip they had brought on board was threadbare now as they were two days at sea And the steamer sailed over the blue water that softly lapped the stout vessel s side careless of the battle that had been waged for a life even then holding by slender threads And Fanny Vanderburgh whose grandfather was a contemporary in the old business days in New York with mister King and who sat with her mother at the next table to the King party spent most of her time running to missus Pepper s state room or interviewing any one who would be able to give her the slightest encouragement as to when she could claim Polly Pepper O dear me Fanny cried on one such occasion when she happened to run across Jasper I ve been down to No forty five four times this morning and there s nobody there but that stupid Matilda and she doesn t know or won t tell when Polly will get through reading to that tiresome old man And they won t let me go to his state room missus Fisher and your father are there too or I d get them to make Polly come out on deck We all want her for a game of shuffle board Jasper sighed So did he long for a game of shuffle board Then he brought himself up and said as brightly as he could mister Selwyn begs Polly to stay and won t have any one else read to him Miss Vanderburgh so I don t see as it can be helped He s been very sick you know Fanny Vanderburgh beat the toe of her boot on the deck floor It s a perfect shame And that horrible old man he s so seedy and common just think of it and spoiling all our fun Jasper looked off over the sea and said nothing As for that dreadful boy his grandson I think he s a boor Goodness me I hope nobody will introduce him I m sure I never ll recognise him afterward Jasper turned uneasily Please mister King do make Polly listen to reason begged Fanny There isn t another girl on board I care to go with at least not in the way I would with her The Griswolds are well enough to play games with and all that but you know what I mean Do make her come out with us this morning and listen to reason she repeated winding up helplessly But I think she is just right said Jasper stoutly Right cried Fanny explosively oh how can you say so mister Jasper Why she is losing just every bit of the fun I know it said Jasper with a twinge at the thought Well there is nothing more to be said or done Miss Vanderburgh since Polly has decided the matter Only I want you to remember that I think she is just right about it Fanny Vanderburgh pouted her pretty lips in vexation At least don t try to get that dreadful boy into our own set to play games she cried venomously for I won t speak to him He s a perfect boor Twas only yesterday he brushed by me like a clumsy elephant and knocked my book out of my hand and never even picked it up Think of that mister King I know that was dreadful assented Jasper in dismay at the obstacle to the plan he had formed in his own mind to do that very thing he was now being warned against But you see Miss Vanderburgh he s all upset by his Grandfather s sickness And I should think he would be cried Fanny Vanderburgh with spirit missus Griswold says she s heard him domineering over the old man and then his Grandfather would snarl and scold like everything She has the next state room you know I don t see how those Selwyns can afford such a nice cabin continued Fanny her aristocratic nose in the air they look so poor Anyway that boy is a perfect beast mister King He s very different now said Jasper quickly He had no idea his Grandfather was so poorly Now I ll tell you Miss Vanderburgh Jasper turned sharply around on his heel so that he faced her It was necessary with a girl like her to state plainly what he had to say and to keep to it I am going to ask Tom Selwyn to play games with all us young people If it distresses you or any one else so that you cannot join of course I will withdraw and I know Polly will and we will get up another circle that will play with him It was almost impossible to keep from laughing at Fanny s face but Jasper was very grave as he waited for an answer O dear me mister Jasper she cried haven t I told you I don t really care for any one on board but Polly Pepper and Mamma doesn t want me to mix up much with those Griswolds She lowered her voice and glanced over her shoulder It would make it so awkward if they should be much in New York and we should meet So of course I ve got to do as Polly and you do Don t you see it s awfully hard on me though and she clasped her hands in vexation Very well then said Jasper now that s decided And seeing it is why the next thing to do is to bring Tom down and we ll get up a game of shuffle board at once He s not needed by his Grandfather now He didn t think it necessary to add for the old gentleman won t see him and Tom is forbidden the room by the doctor Fanny s aristocratic nose went up in alarm and her whole face was overspread with dismay It was one thing to anticipate evil and quite another to find it precipitated upon one I I don t believe I can play this morning mister Jasper she began hurriedly for the first time in her young life finding herself actually embarrassed She was even twisting her fingers Very well said Jasper coolly then I understand that you will not play with us at any time for as we begin to day we shall keep on I will set about getting up another party at once He touched his yacht cap lightly and turned off I ll go right down on the lower deck with you now Fanny ran after him her little boot heels clicking excitedly on the hard floor The steward has marked it all for us I got him to while I ran to find Polly so as to engage the place she added breathlessly That s fine said Jasper a smile breaking over the gloom on his face now we ll have a prime game Miss Vanderburgh Fanny swallowed hard the lump in her throat and tried to look pleasant Do you go and collect the Griswolds cried Jasper radiantly and I ll be back with Tom and he plunged off It was all done in a minute And the thing that had been worrying him how to get Tom into good shape and to keep him there seemed fixed in the best way possible But Tom wouldn t go Nothing that Jasper could do or say would move him out of the gloom into which he was cast and at last Jasper ran down for a hurried game with the party awaiting him to whom he explained matters in the best way he could At last old mister Selwyn was able to emerge from his state room mister King and he were the best of friends by this time the former always when Polly read aloud being one of the listeners At all such hours indeed and whenever Polly went to sit by the invalid Phronsie would curl up at Polly s side and fondle the doll that Grandpapa gave her last which had the honour to take the European trip with the family Phronsie would smooth the little dress down carefully and then with her hand in Polly s she would sit motionless till the reading was over Mamsie whose fingers could not be idle although the big mending basket was left at home would be over on the sofa sewing busily and little doctor Fisher would run in and out and beaming at them all through his spectacles would cry cheerily Well I declare you have the most comfortable place on the whole boat mister Selwyn Or doctor Jones whom Polly thought next to Papa Fisher was the very nicest doctor in all the world would appear suddenly around the curtain and smile approval through his white teeth At last on the fifth day out the old man was helped up to sun himself in his steamer chair on deck And then he had a perfect coterie around him oh ing and ah ing over his illness and expressing sympathy in every shape for since mister King and his party took him up it was quite the thing for all the other passengers to follow suit When a few hours of this sort of thing had been going on the old man called abruptly to Polly Pepper who had left him seeing he had such good company about him and had now skipped up with Jasper to toss him a merry word or to see if his steamer rug was all tucked in snugly around him See here Polly Pepper do you play chess What sir Polly thought she had not heard correctly Do you play chess I say demanded old mister Selwyn bringing his sharp little eyes to bear on her No sir that is only a little stammered Polly Well that will do for a start the old gentleman nodded in satisfaction And I ll give you some points later on about the game Well and you play backgammon of course He didn t wait for her to answer but finished These people here drive me almost crazy asking me how I feel and what was the matter with me and all that rubbish Now I m going into the library and you shall go too and we ll have a game of backgammon He flung back his steamer rug with a determined hand Jasper began Oh Polly in dismay but she broke in Yes indeed I do play backgammon mister Selwyn and it will be fine to have a game And together they helped him up and into a cosey corner of the library There now said Polly with a final little pat on the sofa pillows tucked up at his back I believe you are as comfortable as you can be mister Selwyn Indeed I am he declared And now Jasper do get the backgammon board cried Polly There it is over there spying it on a further table Old mister Selwyn cast a hungry glance on it as it was brought forward and his sharp little eyes sparkled as Polly threw it open He even chuckled in delight as he set the men Tom Selwyn came up to the door and standing in its shadow looked in Jasper flung himself down on the sofa by the old gentleman s side to watch the game Suddenly he glanced up caught sight of Tom although the latter s head was quickly withdrawn and jumping up he dashed after him Here see here Tom he called to the big figure before him making good time down the stairs I can t go chasing you all over the boat in this fashion Stop will you What do you want demanded Tom crossly feeling it impossible to elude such a pursuer and backing up against a convenient angle I want you to come up into the library and watch the game Do it ll be the best time he didn t say to make it all up Can t said Tom he won t see me Oh yes he will I almost know he will declared Jasper eagerly feeling this minute as if the most unheard of things were possible And beside your sister I mean the Pepper girl Miss Pepper Tom corrected himself clumsily She can t bear me I won t come Oh yes she can now said Jasper just as eagerly especially since I ve told her all you ve told me Well I hate girls anyway declared Tom in his most savage fashion always have hated em and always shall I won t come III PHRONSIE GOES VISITING Grandpapa said Phronsie softly as she clung to his hand after they had made the descent to the lower deck I think the littlest one can eat some of the fruit don t you she asked anxiously Never you fear assented old mister King that child that I saw yesterday can compass anything in the shape of food Why it had its mouth full of teeth Phronsie it was impossible not to see them when it roared I am so glad its teeth are there said Phronsie with a sigh of satisfaction as she regarded her basket of fruit because if it hadn t any we couldn t give it these nice pears Grandpapa Well here we are said mister King holding her hand tightly Bless me are those your toes young man this to a big chubby faced boy whose fat legs lay across the space as he sprawled on the deck just draw them in a bit will you there Well now Phronsie this way Here s the party I believe and he led her over to the other side where a knot of steerage passengers were huddled together In the midst sat a woman chubby faced and big and square holding a baby She had a big red shawl wrapped around her in the folds of which snuggled the baby who was contentedly chewing one end of it while his mother had her eyes on the rest of her offspring of which there seemed a good many When the baby saw Phronsie he stopped chewing the old shawl and grinned showing all the teeth of which mister King had spoken The other children tow headed and also chubby looked at the basket hanging on Phronsie s arm and also grinned There is the baby exclaimed Phronsie in delight pulling Grandpapa s hand gently Oh Grandpapa there he is That s very evident said the old gentleman Bless me addressing the woman how many children have you pray tell Nine she said Then she twitched the jacket of one of them and the pinafore of another to have them mind their manners while the baby kicked and crowed and gurgled seeming to be all teeth I have brought you some fruit said Phronsie holding out her basket whereat all the tow headed group except the baby crowded each other dreadfully to see all there was in it I m sorry the flowers are gone so I couldn t bring any to day May the baby have this holding out a pear by the stem The baby settled that question by lunging forward and seizing the pear with two fat hands when he immediately sank into the depths of the old shawl again all his teeth quite busy at work Phronsie set down her basket on the deck and the rest of the brood emptied it to their own satisfaction Their mother s stolid face lighted up with a broad smile that showed all her teeth and very white and even they were Grandpapa said Phronsie turning to him and clasping her hands if I only might hold that baby just one little bit of a minute she begged keenly excited Oh Phronsie he s too big expostulated mister King in dismay I can hold him just as easy Grandpapa dear said Phronsie her lips drooping mournfully See And she sat down on a big coil of rope near by and smoothed out her brown gown Please Grandpapa dear He ll cry said mister King quickly Oh no Phronsie it wouldn t do to take him away from his mother You see it would be dreadful to set that child to roaring very dreadful indeed Yet he hung over her in distress at the drooping little face He won t cry The mother s stolid face lighted up a moment And if the little lady wants to hold him he ll sit there May I Grandpapa cried Phronsie her red lips curling into a happy smile Oh please say I may Grandpapa dear clasping her hands The family seems unusually clean observed mister King to himself And the doctor says there s no sickness on board and it s a very different lot of steerage folks going this way from coming out all of which I ve settled before coming down here he reflected Well Phronsie yes I see no reason why you may not hold the baby if you want to And before the words were hardly out of his mouth the chubby faced woman had set the fat baby in the middle of the brown gown smoothed out to receive him He clung to his pear with both hands and ate away with great satisfaction regardless of his new resting place Just come here missus Griswold in immaculately fitting garments evidently made up freshly for steamer use beckoned with a hasty hand to her husband It s worth getting up to see He flung down his novel and tumbled out of his steamer chair Look down there Whew whistled mister Griswold that is a sight And that is the great Horatio King exclaimed missus Griswold under her breath down there in that dirty steerage and look at that child Reginald did you ever see such a sight in your life On my honour I never have declared mister Griswold solemnly and wanting to whistle again Sh don t speak so loud warned missus Griswold who was doing most of the talking herself And plucking his sleeve she emphasised every word with fearful distinctness close to his ear She s got a dirty steerage baby in her lap and mister King is laughing Well I never O dear me here come the young people Polly and Jasper came on a brisk trot up the deck length Fifteen times around make a mile don t they Jasper she cried I believe they do said Jasper but it isn t like home miles is it Polly laughing gaily or dear old Badgertown I should think not replied Polly with a little pang at her heart whenever Badgertown was mentioned We used to run around the little brown house and see how many times we could do it without stopping And how many did you Polly asked Jasper the largest number I mean Oh I don t know said Polly with a little laugh Joel beat us always I remember that Yes Joe would get over the ground you may be sure said Jasper if anybody could Polly s laugh suddenly died away and her face fell Jasper you don t know she said how I do want to see those boys I know said Jasper sympathisingly but you ll get a letter you know most as soon as we reach port for they were going to mail it before we left And I have one every day in my mail bag said Polly but I want to see them so Jasper I don t know what to do She went up to the rail at a remove from the Griswolds and leaned over it Polly said Jasper taking her hand you know your mother will feel dreadfully if she knows you are worrying about it I know it said Polly bravely raising her head and I won t why Jasper Elyot King for then she saw Grandpapa and Phronsie and the steerage baby Jasper gave a halloo and waved his hand and Polly danced up and down and called and waved her hands too And Phronsie gave a little crow of delight See Grandpapa there they are I want Polly and Jasper too And old mister King whirled around O dear me Come down both of you which command it did not take them long to obey Well I never did in all my life ejaculated missus Griswold see anything like that Now if some people she didn t say we should do anything like that twould be dreadfully erratic and queer But those Kings can do anything she added with venom It s pretty much so assented mister Griswold giving a lazy shake Well I m going back to my chair if you ve got through with me Louisa And he sauntered off Don t go Reginald begged his wife I haven t got a soul to talk to Oh well you can talk to yourself said her husband any woman can But he paused a moment Haven t those Pepper children got a good berth exclaimed missus Griswold unable to keep her eyes off from the small group below And their Mother Pepper or Fisher or whatever her name is I declare it s just like a novel the way I heard the story from missus Vanderburgh about it all And I wish you d let me get back to my book Louisa exclaimed mister Griswold tartly at the mention of the word novel beginning to look longingly at his deserted steamer chair for it s precious little time I get to read on shore Seems as if I might have a little peace at sea Do go back and read then said his wife impatiently that s just like a man he can t talk of anything but business or he must have his nose in a book We men want to talk sense growled her husband turning off But missus Griswold was engrossed in her survey of mister King and the doings of his party and either didn t hear or didn t care what was remarked outside of that interest Tom Selwyn just then ran up against some one as clumsily as ever It proved to be the ship s doctor who surveyed him coldly and passed on Tom gave a start and swallowed hard then plunged after him Oh I say

none	none	asked doctor Jones pausing Can I I d like to see my Grandfather don t you know doctor Jones scanned him coolly from top to toe Tom took it without wincing but inwardly he felt as if he must shake to pieces If you can so conduct yourself that your Grandfather will not be excited at last said the doctor what an age it seemed to Tom I see no reason why you shouldn t see your Grandfather and go back to your state room But let me tell you young man it was a pretty close shave for him the other day Had he slipped away you d have had that on your conscience that would have lasted you for many a day With this and a parting keen glance he turned on his heel and strode off Tom gave a great gasp clenched his big hands tightly together took a long look at the wide expanse of water then disappeared within In about half an hour the steerage baby having gone to sleep in Phronsie s arms the brothers and sisters finding after the closest inspection nothing more to eat in the basket gathered around the centre of attraction in a small bunch I hope they won t wake up the baby said Phronsie in gentle alarm Never you fear said old mister King quite comfortable now in the camp chair one of the sailors had brought in response to a request from Jasper that child knows very well by this time I should imagine what noise is But after a little the edge of their curiosity having been worn off the small group began to get restive and to clamour and pull at their mother for want of something better to do O dear me said Phronsie in distress Dear dear echoed Polly vainly trying to induce the child next to the baby to get into her lap something must be done Oh don t you want to hear about a funny cat children I m going to tell them about Grandma Bascom s Jasper she said seeing the piteous look in Phronsie s eyes Yes we do said one of the boys as spokesman and he solemnly bobbed his tow head whereat all the children then bobbed theirs Sit down then said Polly socially making way for them all of you in a circle and I ll tell you of that very funny cat So the whole bunch of tow headed children sat down in a ring and solemnly folded their hands in their laps Jasper threw himself down where he could edge himself in Old mister King leaned back and surveyed them with great satisfaction So Polly launched out in her gayest mood and the big blue eyes in the round faces before her widened and the mouths flew open showing the white teeth and the stolid mother leaned forward and her eyes and mouth looked just like those of her children only they were bigger and at last Polly drew a long breath and wound up with a flourish And that s all Tell another said one of the round eyed open mouthed children without moving a muscle All the rest sat perfectly still O dear me said Polly with a little laugh that was such a good long one you can t want another I think you ve gotten yourself into business Polly said Jasper with a laugh Hadn t we better go Polly gave a quick glance at Phronsie Phronsie dear she said let us go up to our deck now dear Shall we Oh no Polly please don t go yet begged Phronsie in alarm and patting the baby softly with a gentle little hand Polly looked off at Grandpapa He was placidly surveying the water his eyes occasionally roving over the novel and interesting sights around On the other side of the deck a returning immigrant was bringing out a jew s harp and two or three of his fellow passengers were preparing to pitch quoits Old mister King was actually smiling at it all Polly hadn t seen him so contented since they sailed I guess I ll tell another one Jasper she said Oh about a dog you wanted did you nodding at the biggest boy Yes said the boy bobbing his tow head I did and he unfolded and folded his hands back again then waited patiently So Polly flew off on a gay little story about a dog that bade fair to rival Grandma Bascom s cat for cleverness He belonged to mister Atkins who kept store in Badgertown and the Pepper children used to see a good deal of him when they took home the sacks and coats that Mamsie sewed for the storekeeper And in the midst of the story when the stolid steerage children were actually laughing over the antics of that remarkable dog Jasper glanced up toward the promenade deck took a long look and started to his feet Why Polly Pepper see He pointed upward There on the curve were old mister Selwyn and Tom walking arm in arm IV STEAMER LIFE And after that it was My grandson Thomas on all occasions the old gentleman introducing the boy to the right and to the left as he paraded the deck his old arm within the younger one And the little sharp black eyes snapped proudly and the white head was held up as he laughed and chattered away sociably to the passengers and the ship s crew at every good opportunity Yes my grandson Thomas is going back to school We ve been running about in your country a bit and the boy s mother went home first with the other children Polly heard him say as the two paused in front of her steamer chair Indeed ejaculated missus Vanderburgh as he addressed her and raising her eyebrows with a supercilious glance for his plain unprepossessing appearance Yes Madam and glad shall I be to set my foot on Old England again Hey Tom my boy don t you say so Tom looked off over the sea but did not speak Neither did missus Vanderburgh answer but turned her face away in disdain that was very plainly marked Home is the best place Madam declared old mister Selwyn emphatically Well Old England is our home and nothing will induce me to leave it again I can assure you Again missus Vanderburgh did not reply but looked him up and down in cold silence Old mister Selwyn not appearing to notice chattered on At last she deliberately turned her back on him Isn t he common and horrid whispered Fanny Vanderburgh in the steamer chair next to Polly thrusting her face in between her and her book And she gave a little giggle Hush said Polly warningly he will hear you Nonsense it s impossible he is rattling on so and do look at Mamma s face He didn t hear but Tom did and he flashed a glance dark and wrathful over at the two girls and started forward abruptly pulling his Grandfather along O dear me exclaimed Polly in distress dropping her book in her lap now he has heard Oh that dreadful boy said Fanny carelessly stretching out in her steamer chair comfortably well who cares he s worse than his Grandfather Yes he has heard repeated Polly sorrowfully looking after the two Tom still propelling the old gentleman along the deck at a lively rate now what shall we do It isn t of the least consequence if he has heard reiterated Fanny and Mamma has been frightfully bored I know Do tell us Mamma she called missus Vanderburgh turned away from the rail where she had paused in her constitutional when addressed by the old gentleman and came up to the girls Do sit down Mamma in your steamer chair begged Fanny I ll tuck you up in your rug And she jumped lightly out of her own chair There that s nice as missus Vanderburgh sank gracefully down and Fanny patted and pulled the rug into shape Now tell us wasn t he the most horrible old bore As she cuddled back into her own nest missus Vanderburgh laughed in a very high bred manner He was very amusing she said Amusing I should say so cried Fanny I suppose he would have told you all his family history if he had stayed O dear me he is such a common odious old person Polly twisted uneasily under her rug missus Vanderburgh glanced into the steamer chair on the other side It had several books on top of the rug I don t believe he can take that seat she said still Fanny I think it would be well for you to change into it for that old man may take it into his head when he makes the turn of the deck to drop into it and give us the whole of his family history Horrors ejaculated Fanny hopping out of her chair again I ll make sure that he doesn t And yet I did so want to sit next to Polly Pepper she mourned ensconcing herself under the neighbouring rug and putting the books on the floor by her side Don t do that give them to me said her mother I ll put them in your chair unless Miss Polly will take that place only I don t like to disturb you dear she said with a sweet smile at Polly Why that would make matters worse Mamma said Fanny Don t you see then that old bore would put himself into Polly s chair for he likes her anyway Do leave it as it is So missus Vanderburgh smiled again I don t know but that you are right she said and leaned back her head restfully Dear me yes he is amusing They are terribly common people said Fanny her aristocratic nose well in the air aren t they Mamma And did you ever see such a clumsy thing as that dreadful boy and such big hands and feet She held up her own hands as she spoke and played with her rings and let the jingling bracelets run up and down her wrists Fanny how often must I tell you to wear gloves on shipboard said her mother in a tone of reproof Nothing spoils the hands so much as a trip at sea They won t get over it all summer they re coarsened already and she cast an alarmed glance at the long slender fingers I m so tired of gloves Mamma Fanny gave a restful yawn Polly Pepper doesn t wear them she cried triumphantly peering past her mother to point to Polly s hands missus Vanderburgh hesitated It wouldn t do to say anything that would reflect against the Peppers manners or customs or bringing up generally So she leaned over and touched Polly s fingers with her own gloved ones You don t wear gloves do you my dear she said in gentle surprise quite as if the idea had just struck her for the first time No missus Vanderburgh I don t said Polly at least not on shipboard unless it is cold There now Mamma laughed Fanny in a pleased way you ll stop teasing me about wearing them I m sure missus Vanderburgh turned and surveyed her daughter but she didn t smile and Fanny thought it as well to begin again on the old topic They re awfully common people aren t they Mamma those Selwyns They are indeed replied missus Vanderburgh quite commonplace and exceedingly tiresome be sure and not speak to them Fanny Trust me for that said Fanny with a wise little nod The old man stopped me and asked me something this morning as I was coming out of the dining room after breakfast but I pretended I didn t hear and I skipped upstairs and almost fell on my nose You were fortunate to escape said her mother with a little laugh Well let us drop the subject and talk of something else much more important Polly my dear She turned again and surveyed the young girl at her side You are coming home this autumn aren t you Oh no said Polly Grandpapa expects to stay over in Europe a year Is that so said missus Vanderburgh and her face fell I regret it exceedingly for I should be glad if you would visit Fanny this winter in New York Thank you but I couldn t anyway said Polly Then the colour flew up to her cheek I mean I am in school you know missus Vanderburgh but I thank you and it is so good of you to want me she added hurriedly feeling that she hadn t said the right thing at all I do want you very much my dear child said missus Vanderburgh and I am very sorry you are to remain abroad over the winter for your Grandfather would be persuaded I feel quite sure to have you leave school for a while and come to us for a visit Oh no he wouldn t cried Polly quickly I beg pardon missus Vanderburgh but I never leave school for anything unless I am sick and I am almost never sick Well then you could come for the Christmas holidays said missus Vanderburgh with ladylike obstinacy like one accustomed to carrying her point The Christmas holidays exclaimed Polly starting forward in her chair Oh I wouldn t leave home for anything then missus Vanderburgh Why we have the most beautiful times and we are all together the boys come home from school and it s just too lovely for anything She clasped her hands and sighed oh if she could but see Ben and Joel and David but once missus Vanderburgh was a very tall woman and she gazed down into the radiant face without speaking Polly was looking off over the sea and the colour came and went on her cheek We would soon get her out of all such notions if we once had her with us wouldn t we Mamma said Fanny in a low tone close to her mother s ear missus Vanderburgh gave her a warning pinch but Polly s brown eyes were fastened on the distant horizon and she hadn t heard a word Well we ll arrange it sometime said Fanny s mother breaking the silence so you must remember Polly dear that you are engaged to us for a good long visit when you do come home I will tell Grandpapa that you asked me said Polly bringing her eyes back with a sigh to look into missus Vanderburgh s face Oh he will fall into the plan quite readily I think said missus Vanderburgh lightly You know we are all very old friends that is the families are mister Vanderburgh s father and mister King were very intimate Perhaps you don t know Polly and Fanny s mamma drew herself up to her extreme height it was impossible for her to loll back in her chair when talking of her family that we are related to the Earl of Cavendish who owns the old estate in England and we go back to William the Conqueror that is Fanny does on her father s side Fanny thereupon came up out of her chair depths to sit quite straight and gaze with importance at Polly s face But Polly was still thinking of the boys and she said nothing And my family is just as important said missus Vanderburgh and she smiled in great satisfaction Really we could make things very pleasant for you my child our set is so exclusive you could not possibly meet any one but the very best people Oh here is your mother She smiled enchantingly up at missus Fisher and held out her hand Do come and sit here with us my dear missus Fisher she begged then we shall be a delightful group we two mothers and our daughters Thank you missus Vanderburgh missus Fisher smiled but she didn t offer to take the steamer chair I have come after Polly Mamsie what is it I ll come said Polly tumbling out of her steamer chair in a twinkling O dear me exclaimed missus Vanderburgh in regret don t take Polly away I do implore you my dear missus Fisher I am so fond of her I must said Mother Fisher smiling again her hand now in Polly s and before any more remonstrances were made they were off Oh Mamsie breathed Polly hanging to the dear hand I am so glad you came and took me away Polly said Mother Fisher suddenly Grandpapa asked me to find you he thinks you could cheer old mister Selwyn up a bit perhaps with backgammon I m afraid Tom has been behaving badly again Oh Mamsie exclaimed Polly in dismay And then the story came out Grandpapa said Phronsie pulling at his hand gently as they walked slowly up and down the deck does your head ache And she peered anxiously up into his face No child that is not much said old mister King trying to smooth his brows out He was thinking for it kept obtruding at all times and seasons of that dreadful scrap of paper that Cousin Eunice had imposed upon him at the last minute before they sailed announcing that she had had her way and would at last compel acceptance of such a gift as she chose to make to Phronsie Pepper If it aches at all said Phronsie decidedly I wish you would let me rub it for you Grandpapa I do truly Well it doesn t said Grandpapa that is it won t now that I have you with me I was thinking of something unpleasant Phronsie and then to tell you the truth that old mister Selwyn tires me to death I can t talk to him and his grandson is a cad What is a cad asked Phronsie wonderingly Oh well a boy who isn t nice said mister King carelessly Grandpapa why isn t that boy nice to that poor old man asked Phronsie a grieved look coming into her blue eyes Goodness me child you ask me too much said mister King quickly oh a variety of reasons Well we must take things as we find them and do what we can to help matters along but it seems a hopeless case things were in better shape and now they seem all tangled up again thanks to that boy Grandpapa said Phronsie earnestly I don t believe that boy means to be bad to that poor old man I don t really and truly Grandpapa she added shaking her head Well he takes a queer way to show it if he means to be good said old mister King grimly Oh is that you Master Tom as they turned a corner to find themselves face to face with Tom Selwyn mister King Tom began very rapidly so that the words ran all over each other I m no end sorry don t think hard things of me it s not my fault this time Grandfather heard it as well as I at least I caught a little and he asked me what it was and I had to tell him and it upset him Old mister King stood gazing into the big boy s face in utter bewilderment As I don t know in the least what you are trying to tell me my boy at last he said I shall have to ask you to repeat it and go slowly So Tom tried again to tell his story and by the time that it was all out mister King was fuming in righteous indignation Well well it s not worth thinking of at last he said at sight of the flashing eyes before him and the angry light on the young face You take my arm or I ll take yours Master Tom there that s better and we ll do a bit of a turn on the deck Your grandfather ll come out of it for he s busy over the backgammon board But it was an ugly thing to do just the same Just then missus Vanderburgh and Fanny passed them all sweet smiles for him and for Phronsie but with no eyes for the boy V A FISH STORY AND OTHER THINGS Oh Polly Polly Phronsie came running along the deck and up to the little group playing shuffle board there s such a very big whale And she clasped her hands in great excitement There truly is Do come and see him Is there Pet cried Polly throwing down her shovel then we must all go and see him Come Jasper and all of you and she seized Phronsie s hand He is very dreadful big said Phronsie as they sped on Jasper and the other players close behind And he puffed Polly and the water went up oh so high That s because he came up to breathe said Polly as they raced along Dear me I hope he won t be gone when we get there Can t he breathe under the water asked Phronsie finding it rather hard work to perform that exercise herself in such a race What does he stay down there for then say Polly Oh because he likes it answered Polly carelessly Take care Phronsie you re running into all those steamer chairs I m sorry he can t breathe said Phronsie anxiously trying to steer clear of the bunch of steamer chairs whose occupants had suddenly left them too to see the whale Poor whale I m sorry for him Polly Oh he s happy said Polly he likes it just as it is He comes up for a little while to blow and I thought you said he came up to breathe Polly said Phronsie tugging at Polly s hand and guilty of interrupting Well and so he does and to blow too it s just the same thing said Polly quickly Is it just exactly the same asked Phronsie Yes indeed that is in the whale s case answered Polly as they ran up to Grandpapa and the rest of their party and the knots of other passengers all staring hard at a certain point on the sparkling waste of water I thought you were never coming said old mister King moving away from the rail to tuck Polly and Phronsie in where they could get a good view Oh there he is there he is Jasper look cried Polly There he is crowed Phronsie now much excited Oh isn t he big Grandpapa I should say he was declared mister King I think I never saw a finer whale in my life Phronsie He comes up to blow said Phronsie softly to herself her face pressed close to the rail and her yellow hair floating off in the breeze and Polly says it doesn t hurt him and he likes it What is it Phronsie child asked old mister King hearing her voice Grandpapa has he got any little whales asked Phronsie suddenly raising her face Oh yes I imagine so said old mister King that is he ought to have I m sure Porpoises go in schools why shouldn t whales pray tell What s a porpoise asked Phronsie with wide eyes Oh he s a dolphin or a grampus Oh said Phronsie much mystified and does he go to school Well they go ever so many of them together and they call it a school Goodness me that is a blow as the whale spouted valiantly and looked as if he were making directly for the steamer Oh Grandpapa he s coming right here screamed Phronsie clapping her hands in delight and hopping up and down Polly and Jasper were almost as much excited while the passengers ran hither and thither to get a good view and levelled their big glasses and oh ed and ah ed And some of them ran to get their cameras And mister Whale seemed to like it for he spouted and flirted his long tail and dashed into the water and out again to blow till they were all quite worn out looking at him At last with a final plunge he bade them all good by and disappeared Phronsie after her first scream of delight had pressed her face close to the rail and held her breath She did not say a word but gazed in speechless enjoyment at the antics of the big fish And Grandpapa had to speak two or three times when the show was all over before she heard him Did you like it Phronsie he asked gathering her hand up closely in his as he leaned over to see her face Phronsie turned away with a sigh Oh Grandpapa he was so beautiful She drew a long breath then turned back longingly Won t he ever come back she asked Maybe not this one said old mister King but we ll see plenty more I imagine Phronsie At least if not on this voyage why some other time Oh wasn t it splendid exclaimed Polly tossing back the little rings of brown hair from her brow Well he s gone now we must run back Jasper and finish our game And they were off the other players following I d like to see this very whale again said Phronsie with a small sigh Grandpapa I would really he was a nice whale Yes he was a fine one said old mister King I don t know as I ever put eyes on a better specimen and I ve seen a great many in my life Tell me about them do Grandpapa begged Phronsie drawing nearer to him Well I ll get into my steamer chair and you shall sit in my lap and then I ll tell you about some of them said mister King much gratified As they moved off Phronsie clinging to his hand she looked back and saw two children gazing wistfully after them Grandpapa she whispered pulling his hand gently to attract attention may that little boy and girl come too and hear about your whales Yes to be sure cried mister King So Phronsie called them and in a few minutes there was quite a big group around Grandpapa s steamer chair for when the other children saw what was going on they stopped too and before he knew there he was perfectly surrounded I should very much like to hear what it is all about missus Vanderburgh s soft voice broke into a pause when old mister King stopped to rest a bit You must be very fascinating dear mister King you have no idea how pretty your group is She pulled Fanny forward gently into the outer fringe of the circle Pray what is the subject Nothing in the world but a fish story Madam said the old gentleman Oh may we stay and hear it cried missus Vanderburgh enthusiastically clasping her gloved hands Fanny adores such things don t you dear turning to her Yes indeed Mamma answered Fanny trying to look very much pleased Take my word for it you will find little to interest either of you said mister King Oh I should be charmed cried missus Vanderburgh Fanny dear draw up that steamer chair to the other side But a stout comfortable looking woman coming down the deck stopped directly in front of that same chair and before Fanny could move it sat down saying This is my chair young lady That vulgar old woman has got it said Fanny coming back quite crestfallen Ugh missus Vanderburgh shrugged her shoulders as she looked at the occupant of the chair who surveyed her calmly then fell to reading her book Well you must just bear it dear it s one of the annoyances to be endured on shipboard I suppose the lady wanted her own chair observed mister King dryly Lady Oh my dear mister King missus Vanderburgh gave a soft little laugh It s very good of you to put it that way I m sure Well now do let us hear that delightful story Fanny dear you can sit on part of my chair she added regardless of the black looks of a gentleman hovering near who had a sharp glance on the green card hanging to the back of the chair she had appropriated and that bore his name So Fanny perched on the end of the steamer chair and mister King not seeing any way out of it went on in his recital of the whale story winding up with an account of some wonderful porpoises he had seen and a variety of other things until suddenly he turned his head and keenly regarded Fanny s mother How intensely interesting she exclaimed opening her eyes and trying not to yawn Do go on and finish about that whale feeling that she must say something Mamma exclaimed Fanny trying to stop her I ended up that whale some five minutes ago Madam said mister King I think you must have been asleep Oh no indeed I have been charmed every moment protested missus Vanderburgh sitting quite erect You surely have the gift of a raconteur mister King she said gracefully recovering herself O dear me here is that odious boy and that tiresome old man as Tom Selwyn came up slowly his Grandfather on his arm mister King put Phronsie gently off from his lap still keeping her hand in his Now children the story telling is all done the whales and porpoises are all finished up so run away He touched his sea cap to missus Vanderburgh and her daughter then marched up to the old man and Tom I am tired of sitting still he said May my little granddaughter and I join you in a walk Tom shot him a grateful look Old mister Selwyn who cared most of all for Polly mumbled out something but did not seem especially happy But mister King did not appear to notice anything awry but fell into step still keeping Phronsie s hand and they paced off If you know which side your bread is buttered Mamma said Fanny Vanderburgh shrewdly looking after them as they disappeared you ll make up to those dreadful Selwyn people Never declared her mother firmly Fanny are you wild Why you are a Vanderburgh and are related to the English nobility and I am an Ashleigh What would your father say to such a notion Well Papa isn t here said Fanny and if he were he d do something to keep in with mister King I hate and detest those dreadful Selwyns as much as you do Mamma but I m going to cultivate them See if I don t And I forbid it said her mother forgetting herself and raising her voice They are low bred and common And beside that they are eccentric and queer Don t you speak to them or notice them in the slightest Madam said the gentleman of the black looks advancing and touching his cap politely I regret to disturb you but I believe you have my chair missus Vanderburgh begged pardon and vacated the chair when the gentleman touched his cap again and immediately drew the chair up to the one where the stout comfortable looking woman sat It seems to me there are more ill bred low lived people on board this boat than it has been my lot to meet on any voyage said missus Vanderburgh drawing her sea coat around her slight figure and sailing off her daughter in her wake VI A LITTLE SURPRISE Sir said little mister Selwyn bringing his sharp black eyes to bear upon old mister King you ve been very good to me and I ve not been always pleasant But it s my way sir it s my way mister King nodded pleasantly although deep in his heart he agreed with the choleric old gentleman But as for Polly why she s good good as gold sir There was no mistaking mister Selwyn s sentiments there and his old cheek glowed while giving what to him meant the most wonderful praise to be paid to a person Old mister King straightened up You ve said the right thing now he declared And I wish I could see that girl when she s grown up added the little old gentleman I want really to know what sort of a woman she ll make I do indeed sir It isn t necessary to speculate much on it answered mister King confidently when you look at her mother and remember the bringing up that Polly Pepper has had The little old gentleman squinted hard at the clouds scudding across the blue sky That s so he said at last Well I m sorry we are to part he added And sir I really wish you would come down to my place with your party and give me a fortnight during your stay in England I really do sir upon me word There was no mistaking his earnestness as he thrust out one thin long fingered hand With the other he set a card within mister King s fingers Arthur Selwyn The Earl of Cavendish met mister King s eyes I had a fancy to do this thing said the little old gentleman to run across from America in simple fashion and it pleased the boy who hates a fuss And we ve gotten rid of all sorts of nuisances by it interviews and tiresome people And I ve enjoyed it mightily He chuckled away till it seemed as if he were never going to stop Old mister King burst out laughing too and the pair were so very jolly that the passengers grouped together waiting for the Liverpool landing turned to stare at them Just see how intimate mister King is with that tiresome common old mister Selwyn exclaimed missus Vanderburgh to her daughter I never was so surprised at anything in all my life to see that he keeps it up now for I thought that aristocratic Horatio King was the most fastidious being alive The Kings have awfully nice times grumbled Fanny picking her gloves discontentedly And you keep me mewed up and won t let me speak to anybody whose grandfather wasn t born in our set and I hate and loathe it all You ll be glad when you are a few years older and I bring you out in society that I always have been so particular observed missus Vanderburgh complacently lifting her head in its dainty bonnet higher than ever I want some nice times and a little fun now whined Fanny with an envious glance over at Polly and Jasper with the dreadful Selwyn boy between them and Phronsie running up to join them and everybody in their party just bubbling over with happiness I wish mister King and his party would go to Paris now said her mother suddenly Oh don t I just wish it cried Fanny in a burst Did you ask him Mamma Yes indeed I talked for fully half an hour yesterday but it was no use And he doesn t seem to know how long he is going to stay in England only a few days he said vaguely then they go to Holland Oh why couldn t we go to Holland exclaimed Fanny impulsively and her eyes brightened splendid Holland that would be something like Mamma You forget the Van Dykes are to be in Paris awaiting us Oh those stupid Van Dykes exploded Fanny Mamma don t go there now Do change and let us go to Holland with the Kings Do Mamma she implored Why Fanny Vanderburgh exclaimed her mother sharply what is the matter with you You know it was settled long ago that we should meet missus Van Dyke and Eleanor in Paris at just this very time It would never do to offend them particularly when Eleanor is going to marry into the Howard set And I ll have the most stupid time imaginable cried Fanny passionately dragging around while you and the Van Dykes are buying that trousseau Yes that s one thing that I wanted the Kings to go to Paris for said missus Vanderburgh you could be with them And really they are much more important than any one to get in with And I d keep up the friendship with the Van Dykes But that mister King is so obstinate you can t do anything with him A frown settled all across her pretty face and she beat her foot impatiently on the deck You spoil everything Mamma with your sets and your stupid people declared Fanny her passion by no means cooled When I come out in society I m going to choose my own friends she muttered to herself and set her lips tightly together mister King was saying Thank you so much mister Selwyn for I really think I d prefer to call you so as I knew you so first So you shall cried the little Earl glancing around on the groups and it s better just here at all events and he chuckled again Then you really will come and he actually seized mister King s hand and wrung it heartily No I was about to say it is quite impossible The Earl of Cavendish stared blankly up out of his sharp little black eyes in utter amazement into the other s face My stay in London is short only a few days mister King was saying and then we go directly to Holland I thank you all the same believe me I appreciate it It is good of you to ask us he cordially added The little Earl of Cavendish broke away from him and took a few hasty steps down the deck to get this new idea fairly into his brain that his invitation had not been accepted Then he hurried back My dear sir he said laying his hand on mister King s arm will you do me the favour to try to come at some future time to consider your plans before you return to America and see if you can t manage to give me this great pleasure of welcoming you to my home Think of it I beg and drop me a line if at home I shall always be most glad to have you with me I should esteem it a privilege The Earl of Cavendish was astonished to find himself beseeching the American gentleman without a title And then they awaked to the fact that the groups of passengers were merging into a solid mass and a slow procession was beginning to form for the stairway and the landing episode was well under way missus Vanderburgh determined not to bid good by on the steamer but to be with the Kings till the last moment rushed up to them on the wharf followed by Fanny Oh we are so sorry you are not going to Paris with us cried missus Vanderburgh while Fanny flew at Polly Pepper and engrossed her hungrily Can t you reconsider it now she asked with a pretty earnestness No it is impossible answered mister King for about the fiftieth time Our plans will not allow it I hope you and your daughter will have the best of times he remarked politely Yes we shall we meet old friends there and Paris is always delightful missus Vanderburgh bit her lip in her vexation I was going to see you and beg you even now to change your plans while we were on the steamer waiting to land she went on hurriedly but you were bored I quite pitied you by that tiresome common old mister Selwyn Yes I was talking with him said mister King but excuse me I was not bored He is peculiar but not at all common and he has many good qualities as a man and I like the boy immensely How can you missus Vanderburgh gave a little high bred laugh They are so insufferably common mister King those Selwyns are Excuse me said mister King that was the Earl of Cavendish it will do no harm to mention it now as they have gone Who who demanded missus Vanderburgh in a bewildered way I did not know it till this morning mister King was explaining but our fellow passenger mister Selwyn chose to cross over keeping his real identity unknown and I must say I admire his taste in the matter and anyway it was his affair and not mine It was a long speech and at its conclusion missus Vanderburgh was still demanding Who who in as much of a puzzle as ever The Earl of Cavendish repeated mister King mister Selwyn is the Earl of Cavendish As I say he did not wish it known and Fanny Fanny called her mother sitting helplessly on the first thing that presented itself a box of merchandise by no means clean Fan ny the the Earl of Cavendish She could get no further Little doctor Fisher who administered restoratives and waited on missus Vanderburgh and her daughter to their London train came skipping back to the Liverpool hotel I hope wife I sha n t grow uncharitable he actually glared through his big spectacles but Heaven defend us on our travels from any further specimens like that woman We shall meet all sorts probably Adoniram said his wife calmly it really doesn t matter with our party of eight we can take solid comfort together The little doctor came out of his ill temper but he said ruefully That s all very well wife for you and the Hendersons for you steered pretty clear I noticed of that woman Well she s gone And he smiled cheerfully Now for dinner for I suppose mister King has ordered it Yes he has said his wife And you have a quarter of an hour I ve put your clothes out all ready All right The little doctor was already plunging here and there tearing off his coat and necktie and boots and exactly at the time set he joined the party with a bright and shining face as if no missus Vanderburgh or any one in the least resembling her had ever crossed his path Jasper cried Polly as they hurried along out of the Harwich train to the steamer that was to take them to the Hook of Holland can you really believe we are almost there No I can t said Jasper for I ve wanted to see Holland for such a time Wasn t it good of Grandpapa cried Polly to take us here the first thing after London Father always does seem to plan things rightly answered Jasper with a good degree of pride And then it s prime as Joel used to say he was going to add but thought better of it as any reference to the boys always set Polly to longing for them Indeed he does exclaimed Polly in her most earnest fashion he s ever and always the most splendid Grandpapa Oh I wish I could do things for him Jasper she mourned he s so good to us You do things for him all the while Polly Jasper made haste to say as they ran along to keep up with the Parson and missus Henderson s comfortable figures just before them you are all the while doing something for him Oh no I don t said Polly there isn t anything I can do for him Don t you suppose there ever will be Jasper she asked imploringly Yes indeed said Jasper there always are things that hop up to be done when people keep their eyes open But don t you worry about your not doing anything for him Polly Promise me that Jasper took her hand and stopped just a minute to look into her face I ll try not to promised Polly but oh Jasper I do so very much wish there might be something that I could do I do indeed Jasper It was only yesterday said Jasper as they began to hurry on once more that father said you can t begin to think Jasper what a comfort Polly Pepper is to me Did he Jasper cried Polly well pleased the colour flying over her cheek that was nice of him because there isn t anything much I can really do for him O dear there is Grandpapa beckoning to us to hurry So on they sped having no breath for words And presently they were on the boat and little doctor Fisher and mister Henderson went forward into the saloon where the rooms reserved beforehand were to be given out and the rest of the party waited and watched the stream of people of all ages and sizes and nationalities who desired to reach Holland the next morning To Polly it was a world of delight and to Jasper who watched her keenly it was a revelation to see how nothing escaped her no matter how noisy and dirty or turbulent the crowd or how annoying the detention it was all a marvel of happiness from beginning to end And Jasper looking back over the two times he had been before to Europe with his father although he had never seen Holland remembered only a sort of dreary drifting about with many pleasant episodes and experiences it is true still with the feeling on the whole of the most distinct gladness when their faces were turned homeward and the journeying was over Mamsie cried Polly poking her head out from the upper berth of the stuffy little state room assigned to missus Fisher missus Henderson Phronsie and herself was anything ever so delicious as this boat and to think Mamsie here Polly paused to add as impressively as if the idea had never been voiced before that we are really to see Holland to morrow You d better go to sleep now then said missus Fisher wisely if you want to be bright and ready really to see much of Holland in the morning Polly That s so answered Polly ducking back her head to its pillow and wriggling her toes in satisfaction Phronsie is asleep already isn t she Mamsie Yes said missus Fisher she dropped off as soon as her head touched the pillow Good night Polly you would better do the same Good night Mamsie said Polly with a sleepy little yawn and good night dear missus Henderson she added already almost in dreamland VII OFF FOR HOLLAND It seemed to Polly as if she had only breathed twice and had not turned over once when there was Mamsie s voice calling her and there was Mamsie s face looking into hers over the edge of the berth Wake up Polly child you have only about ten minutes to dress in O dear me what where exclaimed Polly springing to a sitting position thereby giving her brown head a smart thump on the ceiling of the berth where are we Mamsie why it is the middle of the night isn t it she cried not stopping to pity her poor head We are almost at the Hook of Holland said missus Fisher busily buttoning Phronsie s shoes Phronsie sat on the lower berth her sleepy little legs dangling over the edge and her sleepy little head going nid nodding despite all her efforts to keep herself awake O dear me cried Polly remorsefully when she saw that I ought to have dressed Phronsie Why didn t you wake me up earlier Mamsie Because I wanted you to sleep all you could said missus Fisher and now if you ll only dress Polly Pepper as quickly as possible that s all I ask I will dress Polly Pepper in a twinkling Mamsie declared Polly laughing merrily O dear me where is my other stocking She stuck out one black foot ready for its boot Is it down there Mamsie All the while she was shaking the bedclothes violently for any chance glimpse of it in the berth Where did you put it last night when you took it off Polly asked missus Fisher buttoning away for dear life on Phronsie s shoes There now Pet those are done hop out now and fly into your clothes I thought I put em both in the corner here cried poor Polly twitching everything loose Thereupon her big hat hung carefully upon a high hook slipped off and fell to the floor Take care Polly warned her mother haste only makes matters worse But I can t go with only one stocking on said Polly quite gone in despair now Oh dear missus Henderson don t you see it on the floor For that good woman had dropped to her knees and was busily prowling around among the accumulation of bags and clothing That s what I m hoping to do she answered but I don t see it as yet Polly I ll help Polly to find it cried Phronsie now thoroughly awake and dropping her small skirts to get down on the floor by missus Henderson s side Don t feel badly Polly I ll find your stocking for you No Phronsie said her mother you must get into your own clothes And then missus Henderson is nearly all ready and you can go out with her and that will leave more room so that Polly and I can search more carefully And the stocking has got to come for it couldn t walk off of itself she added cheerily as she saw Polly s face Why what as she happened to look upward And then Polly looked too and there was her stocking dangling from the very high hook where the big hat had been You tossed it up there I suppose when you shook up the bedclothes so quickly said missus Fisher Well now as Polly pounced on the stocking see how fast you can hop into your clothes daughter Then she began to put the things for the bags into their places and Matilda coming in finished the work and Polly flew around buttoning and tying and patting herself into shape and by the time that little doctor Fisher s voice called at the door Well wife are you ready there they all were trim and tidy as ever for a start Where is it Grandpapa asked Phronsie peering around on either side doctor Fisher and Jasper had gone off to attend to the examination of the luggage by the customs inspectors and then coming up gently to pull his arm I don t see it anywhere What child answered Grandpapa looking down at her See here wait a minute to the others who were ahead Phronsie has lost something Oh no Grandpapa I haven t began Phronsie in gentle protestation all my things are in here She patted her little bag that hung on her arm a gift of old mister King s for her to carry her very own things in that yielded her immense satisfaction every time she looked at it which was very often Didn t you say you wanted to find something dear he asked quite puzzled while the others surrounded them wonderingly No said Phronsie only where is the hook Grandpapa I don t see it She lifted her little face and gazed up at him confident that he knew everything She has lost her button hook exclaimed Polly the cunning little silver one Auntie Whitney gave her Christmas I ll run back and get it it must be in the state room Stay Polly commanded mister King And Oh no I haven t piped Phronsie as Polly was flying off It s here in my bag patting Grandpapa s gift hanging on her arm I couldn t lose that Polly she cried in horror at the thought as Polly hurried back Well what is it then you ve lost demanded Polly breathlessly I haven t lost anything reiterated Phronsie pushing back the yellow hair from her face Grandpapa tell them please I haven t lost anything she kept repeating appealing to him She says she hasn t lost anything so we won t say that again echoed old mister King Now Phronsie child tell me what it is you mean what hook you want The hook said Phronsie here Grandpapa and she looked all around in a troubled way they said it was here I don t see it Grandpapa She means the Hook of Holland burst out Polly don t you Phronsie pet And she threw her arms around her while mister Henderson exclaimed Of course why didn t we think of it to be sure Yes Polly Phronsie gave a glad little cry and wriggled in great satisfaction in her arms Grandpapa where is it the Hook of Holland Oh bless me child exclaimed mister King that is the name of the place at least to be accurate it is Hoek van Holland Now just as soon as we get fairly started on our way to Rotterdam I ll tell you all about it or Polly shall since she was clever enough to find out what you meant Oh no Grandpapa cried Polly I d so much rather you told her please do dear Grandfather And so I will he promised very much pleased for mister King dearly loved to be the one to relate the history and anecdotes about the places along which they travelled And so when they were steaming off toward Rotterdam as he sat in the centre of the compartment he had reserved for their use Phronsie next to him and Polly and Jasper opposite he told the whole story The others tucked themselves in the remaining four seats and did not lose a word Matilda and mister King s valet in a second class compartment took charge of the luggage I like it very much declared Phronsie when the story was all finished and smoothing down her little brown gown in satisfaction I like it very much Grandpapa s telling it said Polly but the Hook of Holland isn t anything to what we shall see at Rotterdam while as for The Hague and Amsterdam oh Grandpapa That oh Grandpapa just won his heart and mister King beamed at her as her glowing face was turned first to one window and then to the other that she might not lose anything as the train rumbled on Just wait till we get to Marken broke in Jasper gaily then if you want to see the Dutch beat the Dutch well you may he ended with a laugh Oh Jasper do they really beat each other cried Phronsie quite horrified and slipping away from Grandpapa to regard him closely Oh no I mean they go ahead of everything that is most Dutch Jasper hastened to say I haven t explained it very well No I should think not laughed his father in high good humour Well Phronsie I think you will like the folks on the Island of Marken for they dress in funny quaint costumes just as their ancestors did years upon years ago Are there any little children there asked Phronsie slipping back into her place again and nestling close to his side Hundreds of them I suppose replied mister King with his arm around her and drawing her up to him and they wear wooden shoes or sabots or klompen as they call them and Wooden shoes cried Phronsie oh Grandpapa clasping her hands how do they stay on Well that s what I ve always wondered myself when I ve been in Holland A good many have left off the sabots I believe and wear leather shoes made just like other people s Oh Grandpapa cried Phronsie leaning forward to peer into his face don t let them leave off the wooden shoes please I can t make them wear anything but what they want to said old mister King with a laugh but don t be troubled child you ll see all the wooden shoes you desire in Rotterdam and The Hague too for that matter Shall I cried Phronsie nestling back again quite pleased Grandpapa I wish I could wear wooden shoes she whispered presently in a burst of confidence sticking out her toes to look at them Bless me you couldn t keep them on said mister King Don t the little Dutch children keep them on asked Phronsie Oh Grandpapa I think I could I really think I could she added earnestly Yes they do because they are born and brought up to it although for the life of me I don t see how they do it but you couldn t child you d fall the first minute and break your nose most likely Phronsie gave a sigh Should I Grandpapa Yes quite likely but I ll tell you what I will do I will buy you a pair and we will take them home That will be fine won t it dear Yes said Phronsie wriggling in delight Then she sat quite still Grandpapa she said reaching up to whisper again I m afraid it will make Araminta feel badly to see me with my beautiful wooden shoes on when she can t have any Do you suppose there are little teenty ones Grandpapa dear and I might get her a pair Yes indeed cried Grandpapa nodding his white head in delight there are shoals of them Phronsie of all sizes What are shoals queried Phronsie Oh numbers and numbers so many we can t count them answered mister King recklessly Phronsie slid down into her place again and sat quite still lost in thought So many wooden shoes she couldn t count them was quite beyond her But Grandpapa s voice roused her And I ll buy a bushel of them Phronsie and send them home so that all your dolls at home can each have a pair Would that suit you Pet Phronsie screamed with delight and clapped her hands Polly and Jasper who had changed places as doctor Fisher and mister Henderson had made them take theirs by one window now whirled around What is it cried Polly of Phronsie What is it I m going to have wooden shoes announced Phronsie in a burst of confidence that included everybody in the compartment for my very own self and Araminta is going to have a pair and every single one of my children at home too Grandpapa said so Whew whistled Jasper Oh what fun sighed Polly And you shall have a pair too if you want them Polly Grandpapa telegraphed over to her in the corner And Jasper can too can t he Grandpapa And oh thank you so much cried Polly all in one breath I guess it s as well I shall be on hand to set the broken bones said little doctor Fisher with all you children capering around in those wooden abominations Oh doctor Fisher we are not going to fall exclaimed Jasper in disdain at the very thought And No indeed came merrily from Polly And then they all fell to work admiring the numberless windmills past which their train was speeding toward Rotterdam To think it is only six o clock exclaimed Polly looking at her little travelling watch that Grandpapa had given her Now what a fine long day we are going to have Jasper for sightseeing in Rotterdam As the train came to a standstill the guards threw open compartment doors and all the people poured out calling for porters to see to their luggage and everything was in confusion at once on the platforms Indeed you won t Miss Polly declared mister King overhearing it as they waited till all was ready for them to get into the hotel coach we are all going to spend this day at the hotel first in getting a good breakfast and then dear me I shall sleep pretty much all of the morning and I d advise the rest of you to jump into your beds and get good naps after the experience on that atrocious steamboat last night Oh Grandpapa must we really go to bed cried Polly in horror at the mere thought Well not exactly into your beds laughed mister King as Jasper announcing that all was ready piloted them into the coach but you ve got to rest like sensible beings Make up your mind to that As for Phronsie and he gallantly lifted her up to the step she s half asleep already She s got to have a splendid nap and no mistake I m not sleepy declared Phronsie stumbling into the high coach to sit down next to Mother Fisher No Grandpapa dear not a bit And before anybody knew it and as soon as the coach wheels spun round she rolled over into Mamsie s lap There she was as fast asleep as could be VIII WE WILL COME AGAIN AND STAY A WEEK They had been several days at The Hague running about in a restful way in the morning and driving all the long golden afternoons 
5199-18509-0000	train-other-500	Don t you dare to go into a picture gallery or a museum until I give the word Grandpapa had laid down the law I m not going to begin by being all tired out So Polly and Jasper had gone sometimes with mister King and Phronsie
5199-18509-0001	train-other-500	who had a habit of wandering off by themselves or as the case might be mister Henderson would pilot them about till they learnt the ways of the old town And missus Fisher and missus Henderson would confess now and then that they would
none	none	 much rather take a few stitches and overlook the travelling clothes 
5199-18509-0002	train-other-500	than do any more sight seeing And then again they would all come together and go about in a big party All but doctor Fisher he was for hospitals every time That s what I ve come for wife
5199-18509-0003	train-other-500	he would reply to all remonstrance and don t ask me to put my head into a cathedral or a museum To mister King Land alive man I ve got to find out how to take care of living bodies before I stare at bones and relics
5199-18509-0004	train-other-500	and mister King would laugh and let him alone He s incorrigible that husband of yours missus Fisher he would add and we must just let him have his way And Mamsie would smile and every night the little doctor would tome from his tramps and medical study
5199-18509-0005	train-other-500	tired but radiant At last one morning Grandpapa said
none	none	 Now for Scheveningen to day Oh goody cried Polly clapping her hands then blushed as red as a rose 
5199-18509-0006	train-other-500	They were at breakfast and everybody in the vicinity turned and stared at their table Don t mind it Polly said Jasper her next neighbour I want to do the same thing And it will do some of those starched and prim people good to hear a little enthusiasm
none	none	 Polly knew whom he meant some young Englishmen One of them immediately put up his monocle and regarded her as if she had been a new kind of creature displayed for his benefit Jasper glared back at him Yes we ll go to Scheveningen this morning repeated mister King smiling approvingly at poor Polly 
5199-18509-0007	train-other-500	which caused her to lift her head the carriages are ordered so as soon as we are through breakfast we will be off Oh father exclaimed Jasper in dismay must we go in carriages How else would you go Jasper asked his father
5199-18509-0008	train-other-500	Oh by the tramway oh by all means cried Jasper perfectly delighted that he could get his father even to listen to any other plan The dirty tram cars ejaculated mister King in disgust How can you ask it Jasper
5199-18509-0009	train-other-500	No indeed we must go in carriages or not at all But father and Jasper s face fell don t you see the upper deck of the tram car is so high and there are fine seats there
5199-18509-0010	train-other-500	and we can see so much better than driving in a stupid carriage Polly s face had drooped too mister King in looking from one to the other was dismayed and a good bit annoyed
5199-18509-0011	train-other-500	to find that his plan wasn t productive of much happiness after all He had just opened his mouth to say authoritatively
none	none	 No use Jasper either you will go in the way I have provided or stay at home 
5199-18509-0012	train-other-500	when Phronsie slipped out of her chair where she happened this morning to be sitting next to Mother Fisher and running around to his chair piped out
none	none	 Oh Grandpapa if you please 
5199-18509-0013	train-other-500	do let us sit up top We ll do it now Polly whispered Jasper in a transport when Phronsie looks like that See her face Do you really want to go in a dirty old tram car Phronsie instead of in a carriage
5199-18509-0014	train-other-500	Old mister King pushed back his chair and looked steadily at her Oh yes yes Grandpapa please Phronsie beat her hands softly together to ride on top may we dear Grandpapa That dear Grandpapa settled it
5199-18509-0015	train-other-500	Jasper never heard such a welcome command as that mister King was just issuing Go to the office and countermand the order for the carriages my son tell them to put the amount on my bill the same as if I d used them
5199-18509-0016	train-other-500	unless they get a chance to let them to some one else They needn t be the losers Now then as Jasper bounded off to execute the command get on your bonnets and hats all of you and we ll try this wonderful tram car
none	none	 I suppose you won t come with us but will stay behind for the pleasures of some hospital here he added to doctor Fisher On the contrary said the little doctor throwing down his napkin and getting out of his chair 
5199-18509-0017	train-other-500	I am going for there is a marine hospital for children there that I wouldn t miss for the world
none	none	 I warrant you would find one on a desert island retorted old mister King 
5199-18509-0018	train-other-500	Well hurry now all of you and we will be off Now then all scramble up here Phronsie you go with me cried old mister King as they stood in plein and the tram car halted before them He was surprised to find that he liked this sort of thing
none	none	 mixing with a crowd and hurrying for seats just like common ordinary individuals And as he toiled up the winding stairs Phronsie in front of him 
5199-18509-0019	train-other-500	he had an exhilaration already that made him feel almost as young as Polly and Jasper scampering up the circular stairway at the other end Well bless me we are up aren t we he exclaimed sitting down and casting a glance around
5199-18509-0020	train-other-500	Did you ever see anything so fascinating cried Polly Pepper clasping her hands in delight and not stopping to sit down but looking all around You had better sit down advised Mother Fisher
5199-18509-0021	train-other-500	else when the car starts you may go over the railing Oh I can t fall Mamsie said Polly carelessly yet she sat down while Jasper got out of his seat and ran up to old mister King
none	none	 Now father don t you like it he cried And isn t it better than a stuffy old carriage Yes I do my boy answered his father frankly 
5199-18509-0022	train-other-500	Now run off with you you ve planned it well So Jasper made happy for the day rushed back to his seat A hand not over clean was laid on it and a tall individual
5199-18509-0023	train-other-500	who was pouring out very bad provincial French at a fearful rate was just about to worm himself into it Polly who sat next had turned around to view the scenery from the other side and hadn t seen his advance
none	none	 Excuse me said Jasper in another torrent of the same language only of a better quality 
5199-18509-0024	train-other-500	this is my seat I only left it to speak to my father But the Frenchman being there thought that he could get still further into the seat So he twisted and edged but Jasper slipped neatly in and looked calmly up at him
5199-18509-0025	train-other-500	The Frenchman unable to get his balance sat down in Jasper s lap But he bounded up again blue with rage What s all this demanded mister King who never could speak French in a hurry
5199-18509-0026	train-other-500	being very elegant at it and exceedingly careful as to his accent Phronsie turned pale and clung to his hand Nothing said Jasper in English only this person chose to try to take my seat and I chose to have it myself
5199-18509-0027	train-other-500	You take yourself off commanded mister King in an irate voice to the French individual or I ll see that some one attends to your case Not understanding the language all might have gone well
5199-18509-0028	train-other-500	but the French person could interpret the expression of the face under the white hair and he accordingly left a position in front of Jasper to sidle up toward mister King s seat in a threatening attitude
5199-18509-0029	train-other-500	At that Jasper got out of his seat again and went to his father s side
none	none	 Little doctor Fisher also skipped up See here you Frenchy stop your parley vousing and march down those stairs double quick 
5199-18509-0030	train-other-500	cried the little doctor standing on his tiptoes and bristling with indignation His big spectacles had slipped to the end of his nose his sharp little eyes blazing above them Frenchy stared at him in amazement unable to find his tongue
5199-18509-0031	train-other-500	And then he saw another gentleman in the person of the parson who was just as big as the doctor was small With one look he glanced around to see if there were any more such specimens At any rate it was time to be going
5199-18509-0032	train-other-500	so he took a bee line for the nearest stairway and plunged down But he gave the little doctor the compliment of his parting regard Well ejaculated mister King when his party had regained their seats and the car started off
none	none	 if this is to be the style of our companions I think my plan of carriages might be best after all Eh my boy 
5199-18509-0033	train-other-500	with a sly look at Jasper But anything like this might not happen again in a hundred times father said Jasper I suppose I must say yes I know it to that said his father
5199-18509-0034	train-other-500	And as everybody had regained composure he was beginning to feel very happy himself as the car rumbled off This is fine he kept saying to himself the boy knew what was best
none	none	 and he smiled more than once over at Jasper 
5199-18509-0035	train-other-500	who was pointing out this and that to Polly Jasper nodded back again Don t let him bother you to see everything Polly called Grandpapa Take my advice it s a nuisance to try to compass the whole place on the first visit
5199-18509-0036	train-other-500	But Polly laughed back and the advice went over her head as he very well knew it would Was anything ever more beautiful exclaimed Mother Fisher drawing in long breaths of delight
5199-18509-0037	train-other-500	The little doctor leaned back in his seat and beamed at her over his big glasses She began to look rested and young already This journey is the very thing he declared to himself and his hard worked hand slipped itself over her toil worn one
5199-18509-0038	train-other-500	as it lay on her lap She turned to him with a smile Adoniram I never imagined anything like this she said simply No more did I he answered That s the good of our coming wife

5199-18509-0039	train-other-500	she exclaimed as enthusiastically as Polly herself And what a perfect arch
none	none	 And she bent forward to glance down the shaded avenue Oh Adoniram What makes the trunks look so green Polly was crying as they rumbled along See Jasper there isn t a brown branch even Everything is green That s what makes it so pretty said Jasper I don t wonder these oaks in the Scheveningsche Boschjes O dear me I don t know how to pronounce it in the least are so celebrated Don t try said Polly to pronounce it Jasper I just mark things in my Baedeker and let it go Our Baedekers will be a sight when we get home won t they Polly remarked Jasper in a pause when eyes had been busy to their utmost capacity I rather think they will laughed Polly Mine is a sight now Jasper for I mark all round the edges and just everywhere But you are always copying off the things into your journal said Jasper afterward So do I mark my Baedeker it s the only way to jot things down in any sort of order One can t be whipping out a note book every minute Halloo here we are at the chateau of the Grand Duke of Saxe Weimar Look Polly look As they looked back in the distance to the receding ducal estate Polly said It isn t one half as beautiful as this delicious old wood is Jasper Just see that perfectly beautiful walk down there and that cunning little trail Oh I do so wish we could stay here Some day let us ask doctor Fisher to come out with us and we will tramp it Oh I forgot he won t leave the hospitals mister Henderson might like to said Polly in a glow let s ask him sometime anyway Jasper And then just think we can go all in and out this lovely wood How fine Father will come over to Scheveningen again and stay a few days maybe said Jasper if he takes a fancy to the idea How would you like that Polly I don t know said Polly because I haven t seen it yet Jasper I know I forgot twas silly in me to ask such a question said Jasper with a laugh Well anyway I think it more than likely that he will I just love The Hague declared Polly with a backward glance down the green avenue I hope we are going to stay there ever so long Jasper Then we sha n t get on to all the other places said Jasper We shall feel just as badly to leave every other one I suppose Polly I suppose so said Polly with a sigh When they left the tram car at the beginning of the village of Scheveningen they set off on a walk down to the Curhaus and the beach Old mister King as young as any one started out on the promenade on the undulating terrace at the top of the Dunes followed by the rest of his party Down below ran a level road There is the Boulevard said Grandpapa See child pointing to it but Phronsie had no eyes for anything but the hundreds and hundreds of Bath chairs dotting the sands Oh Grandpapa what are they she cried pulling his hand and pointing to them Those are chairs answered mister King and by and by we will go down and get into some of them They look just like the big sunbonnets that Grandma Bascom always wore when she went out to feed her hens don t they Jasper Precisely he said bursting into a laugh How you always do see funny things Polly And see what queer patches there are all up and down the sides of some of them cried Polly Whatever can they be Jasper Oh those are the advertisements said Jasper You ll find that everything is plastered up in that way abroad Just as the omnibuses in London are all covered over with posters said Polly weren t they funny Jasper Yes indeed Lipton Teas I got so tired of that And these cocoa or chocolate You know Holland is full of manufactories of it And isn t it good cried Polly smacking her lips as she had feasted on it since their arrival in Holland Grandpapa considering it especially good and pure I should say so echoed Jasper smacking his lips too doctor Fisher The parson turned to address his neighbour but there was no little doctor Oh he is off long ago said his wife to his beloved hospital What is it Samuel I was only going to remark that I don t believe I ever saw so many people together before Just look he pointed down to the Boulevard and off to the sands along the beach It is a swarm isn t it said his wife Well we must go for mister King is going down to the Boulevard Polly and Jasper running in and out of the fascinating shops by the Concert terrace had minds divided by the desire to stay on the sands and to explore further the tempting interiors We must get something for the boys she declared jingling her little silver purse just let us go in this one now then we ll run after Grandpapa he s going down on the sands He s going to sit with Phronsie in some of those big sunbonnets of yours Polly said Jasper There they are pointing to them Well we ll go in this shop I want to get a pair of those wooden shoes for Joel And they hurried in Oh how fine exclaimed Polly Well I saw a carved bear I think Davie would like and the rest was lost in the confusing array of tempting things spread out for their choice by deft shopkeepers When they emerged 
5199-18509-0040	train-other-500	Polly had a china windmill and an inkstand of Delft ware and several other things and Jasper carried all the big bundles O dear me said Polly now we must run or we sha n t have much time to stay on the beach
5199-18509-0041	train-other-500	and besides Grandpapa will worry over us if we re not there We can t run much loaded down with this said Jasper looking at his armful and laughing
none	none	 or we d likely drop half of them and smash them to pieces Wait a bit Polly I m going to buy you some fruit 
5199-18509-0042	train-other-500	They stopped at the top of the stone stairway leading down to the sands where some comely peasant women fishermen s wives
none	none	 held great baskets of fruit and in one hand was a pair of scales Now then what will you have Polly 
5199-18509-0043	train-other-500	Oh some grapes please Jasper said Polly

5199-18509-0044	train-other-500	I should say they were they are black Hamburgs declared Jasper Now then my good woman give us a couple of pounds He put down the coin she asked for and she weighed them out in her scales
none	none	 and did them up in a piece of a Dutch newspaper We are much worse off now Jasper laughed Polly as they got over the stairs somehow with their burdens since we ve all these grapes to carry O dear me there goes one 
5199-18509-0045	train-other-500	Never mind said Jasper looking over his armful of presents to investigate his paper of grapes if we don t lose but one we re lucky
none	none	 And there goes another announced Polly as they picked their way over and through the thick sand 
5199-18509-0046	train-other-500	Well I declare exclaimed old mister King peering out of his Bath chair if you children aren t loaded down He was eating black Hamburg grapes Phronsie sat opposite him almost lost in the depth of another Bath chair
5199-18509-0047	train-other-500	similarly occupied And at a little remove was the remainder of the party
none	none	 and they all were in Bath chairs and eating black Hamburg grapes 
5199-18509-0048	train-other-500	We ve had such fun sighed Polly and she and Jasper cast their bundles on the soft sand then she threw herself down next to them and pushed up the little brown rings from her damp brow Jasper set his paper of grapes in her lap then rushed off
none	none	 I ll get you a Bath chair he said beckoning to the attendant Oh Jasper I d so much rather sit on the sand called Polly 
5199-18509-0049	train-other-500	So had I he confessed running back and throwing himself down beside her Now then do begin on your grapes Polly We ll begin together she said poking open the paper Oh aren t they good though
5199-18509-0050	train-other-500	I should rather say they were declared Jasper dear me what a bunch It s not as big as mine said Polly holding up hers to the light You made me take that one Jasper
5199-18509-0051	train-other-500	It s no better than mine said Jasper eating away I m going to hop into one of the chairs just a minute before we go said Polly nodding at the array along the beach and eating her grapes busily to see how they feel
none	none	 Oh Polly let me get you a chair now begged Jasper 
5199-18509-0052	train-other-500	setting down the remainder of his bunch of grapes and springing up Oh I don t want to I really and truly don t Jasper
none	none	 Polly made haste to cry I like the sand ever and ever so much better I only want to see for a minute what it s like to be in one of those funny old things 
5199-18509-0053	train-other-500	Then I should want to hop out with all my might I just know I should I m of your mind said Jasper coming back to his seat on the sand again They must be very stuffy Polly Well now you are here
none	none	 would you like to come back to Scheveningen for a few days Polly 
5199-18509-0054	train-other-500	I think I should said Polly slowly bringing her gaze around over the sea to the Dunes the beach with the crowds of people of all nationalities and the peasant folk
none	none	 if we could stay just as long for all that at the dear old Hague And just then old mister King was saying to Phronsie 
5199-18509-0055	train-other-500	We will come out here again child and stay a week
none	none	 Yes he said to himself 
5199-18509-0056	train-other-500	I will engage the rooms before we go back this afternoon
none	none	 Grandpapa asked Phronsie laying her hand on his knee can I have this very same little house next time we come Well I don t know said mister King peering up and down Phronsie s Bath chair adorned with the most lively descriptions of the merits of cocoa as a food they re all alike as two peas except for the matter of the chocolate and cocoa trimmings But perhaps I can fix it Phronsie so that you can have this identical one mentally resolving to do that very thing Well come Phronsie we must go now and get our luncheon I am so glad if I can have the same little house said Phronsie with a sigh of contentment as she slowly got out of her Bath chair It is a nice little house Grandpapa and I love it very much IX A BOX FOR THE PEPPER BOYS Mamsie have we been here a whole week in Amsterdam cried Polly leaning out of the window to look up and down the canal where the many coloured boats lay beside all those days at Scheveningen I can t believe it It doesn t seem possible Mother Fisher answered musingly and her hands dropped to her lap where they lay quietly folded Mamsie Polly suddenly drew in her gaze from the charming old canal and its boats and sprang to missus Fisher s side do you know I think it was just the loveliest thing in all the world for Grandpapa to bring dear mister and missus Henderson abroad with us I do Mamsie mister King is always doing good kind things said missus Fisher coming out of her revery as Polly threw herself down on the floor and laid her head in her mother s lap just as she used to do at home I haven t done this for so long she said and it is so good That is the only drawback about travel observed Mother Fisher her hand passing soothingly over Polly s head that there never seems to be time for the little home ways that are so good Now we must make the time and keep it Polly Indeed we will cried Polly seizing Mamsie s other hand to cuddle it under her chin and I m going to begin right now It makes me think of the little brown house Mamsie whenever you smooth my hair What good times we used to have there missus Fisher s hand trembled a bit but the black eyes were as serene as ever You used to work pretty hard Polly she said Oh but it was fun said Polly merrily only I didn t like the old stove when it acted badly But then came my new stove Mamsie wasn t Papa Fisher splendid And then he saved my eyes Just think Mamsie I never can love him half enough I wish I could do something for him she mourned just as she did in the old days You do Polly you are doing something every day of your life said her mother reassuringly Never think that you don t do anything Why it was only this very morning that your father told me that you were his little helper and that he depended on you to cheer him up Did he say that asked Polly much gratified poking up her head to look at her mother Oh I want to be but I don t know how to help him Papa Fisher always seems to be doing something for other people and not to need anybody to do things for him Ah Polly when you have lived longer said missus Fisher you will know that those who are doing things always for other people are the very ones who need cheering up for they never complain Your father in going about as he does day after day to the hospitals and everywhere where he can learn anything that will make him a better doctor is working very hard indeed and yet think how cheerful he is when he comes home And he says you help to keep him so Polly She bent over and set a kiss on Polly s red cheek Mamsie cried Polly with a glow where the kiss had dropped I m going to try harder than ever to see wherever I can find a time to help Papa Doctor And I hope that one will come soon And you ll find just such a time will come it never fails to when you watch for it said Mother Fisher wisely Just then the door opened and Phronsie fresh from the hands of Matilda who had been changing her gown came in with Araminta in her arms When she saw Polly on the floor with her head in Mamsie s lap she got down by her side and curled up there too Smooth my hair do Mamsie she begged Mamsie s got her two bothers said Polly with a little laugh Mamsie doesn t mind her bothers said missus Fisher her other hand going softly over Phronsie s yellow hair at which Phronsie gave a small sigh of content and wriggled her toes as they were stretched out straight before her on the carpet if only they grow up a little better every day than they were the day before We ll try to Mamsie said Polly won t we Pet leaning over and kissing her I ll try to promised Phronsie with another wriggle of her small toes That s right said Mother Fisher smiling approval missus Fisher called Grandpapa s voice at the door Thereupon Polly and Phronsie sprang to their feet and a lively race ensued to see which should be there the first to open it The consequence was that both faces met him at once Bless me cried old mister King laughing gaily as the door flew open and they both rushed into his arms so you did like to have your old Grandfather come to see you he exclaimed mightily pleased I should think we did cried Polly as they escorted him in and led him to the seat of honour a big carved arm chair with a faded tapestry covering I should very much like to get into your lap Grandpapa dear said Phronsie surveying him gravely as he sat down and leaned his head against the chair back So you shall cried mister King lifting her up to his knee Araminta and all She perched there in quiet content while he set forth his business which he had come to talk over with Mother Fisher Now you know those three boys of yours are the most splendid boys that ever were in all this world and they are working away at home studying and all that Joel and David are and Ben is pegging away at business Old mister King thought best to go to the heart of the matter at once without any dallying missus Fisher s cheek grew a shade paler but she said not a word as she fastened her black eyes on his face Hem well we don t talk much about those boys observed the old gentleman because it makes us all homesick after them and it s best that they should be there and that we should be here so that was settled once for all by our coming Still missus Fisher said not a word Well now the fact of it is continued old mister King still keeping to the main point with wonderful directness I think the time has come for us to act which is much better than talking in my opinion and I want to do something for those boys A pin could have been heard to drop Polly leaned over his chair and hung on his words while missus Fisher never took her eyes from his face In short continued old mister King well pleased with the attention of his audience I propose that we send a box of good things of various descriptions to Ben and Joel and David A small howl of delight from Polly broke the silence When she heard that Phronsie gave a little crow Oh Grandpapa exclaimed Polly do you really mean it and she threw her arms around his neck Phronsie immediately clambered up and did the same thing That s just as your mother shall decide said mister King immensely pleased with the way his news was received She hasn t said a word yet whether she likes the idea or not It s just because I couldn t speak at first said missus Fisher wiping her eyes and her voice trembled But it s the very thing and oh thank you sir for thinking of it The boys won t be so homesick for us when they get the box And it will be the best thing in the world for us to keep busy so we can t worry about them Mamsie has said yes exclaimed Polly flying off to dance around and around in the middle of the room Oh I wish Jasper was here she cried regretfully breaking short off Go and call him then he s down in the reading room writing to the boys and bring him up here said old mister King No no Phronsie you want to stay and take care of me as Phronsie showed signs of slipping down from his lap to go too I ll stay and take care of you said Phronsie obediently just let me lay Araminta down Grandpapa on the sofa and then I ll come back and rub your head So she got down and set Araminta up straight against the sofa back and then came and clambered up again into his lap By this time Polly and Jasper racing along the hall had reached Mother Fisher s room That s regularly splendid father Jasper tossed his dark hair back from his forehead and his eyes sparkled Oh can t we go out right away and begin to buy the presents I shouldn t think that idea was a half bad one said old mister King What do you say missus Fisher If we are going to send the box why isn t it best to begin the work at once There s never so good a time as now in my opinion I m sure you agree with me On Mother Fisher saying yes all three of the young people took hold of hands and danced around the room in glee For old mister King set Phronsie down with There go child and spin with the others then all hurry and get your hats on and we ll be off And in less time than it takes to write it old mister King and Mother Fisher and Jasper and Polly and Phronsie all hurried out of the hotel and began a round of the shops to get the things together for the wonderful box to go home to the boys And though Polly didn t know it several other things that boys wouldn t be supposed to care for in the least were slyly added to the purchases when she wasn t looking to be sent home to the hotel in separate parcels to mister King For Polly was going to have a birthday before very long though she had quite forgotten it in the excitement over this box for Ben and Joel and David It s just like buying things for Christmas isn t it Jasper said Polly as they hung over the show cases and peered into windows only everything is so funny here Oh no Phronsie that won t do it s too big as Phronsie protested that nothing was so nice as a huge Delft plate hanging on the wall There was a big windmill and several little windmills in the distance along a Dutch canal and two or three cows in the foreground and a peasant girl with a basket in her hand Phronsie stood and gazed at it all the time they were in this particular shop I like that little girl she said and those cows and they are like Deacon Blodgett s cows at home in Badgertown And Ben would like it and Joel and David And all Polly could do she would still say I like it Polly and I want Grandpapa to send it At last Polly turned in despair to Jasper Oh what can we do she cried she is just as determined as she was when she would send the gingerbread boy to Grandpapa Well I think we would better not try to get her away from the idea said Jasper with a look at the rapt little face Phronsie was now kneeling on a Flemish oak chair and studying the Delft plate with absorbed attention No said Polly with a sigh I suppose it isn t any use to try when she looks like that Just then old mister King who had been busy in a farther corner with the proprietor of the shop picking out some small articles that struck his fancy turned and called Phronsie She didn t hear him being too absorbed And so he laid down the little silver paper cutter he was looking at and came over to see what was the matter Well child he said looking over her shoulder And so you like that hey Phronsie drew a long breath I do Grandpapa like it very much indeed she said Well then I don t see but what you must have it And it shall hang in your own little room at home Phronsie But I don t want it for my very own Grandpapa said Phronsie it must go in the box for Ben and Joel and David Dear me You think they would like it Phronsie he asked doubtfully and just on the point of saying like Polly it s too big child when he stopped himself and finished up and so it pleases you Phronsie Yes it does said Phronsie with an emphatic little nod I love that nice cow and that little girl Grandpapa I think I should like to live in a windmill Bless me I think you wouldn t want to live there very long child Well the plate shall go to the boys and I only hope they will like it he said to himself dubiously He is going to send it Jasper and Polly said to each other peering round an angle in the shop at the two Well it s a mercy it s got a cow on it instead of a cat said Jasper How Joel would howl if Phronsie sent him the picture of a cat She would if there were a cat to be found said Polly don t you believe Jasper but what she would X DANGER Well the box that went home across the seas to the Pepper boys was a marvel stuffed in every nook and cranny where there was a possibility that the tiniest parcel could be tucked until Phronsie who kept bringing up more bundles had to be told by Polly and Jasper who did the packing that no more could go in They are very small sighed Phronsie curling up on the floor by the side of the big box almost overflowing with billows of the soft white paper on top and holding up two pudgy little bundles So you ve said for the last hour Phronsie exclaimed Polly in despair and sitting quite straight her hands in her lap Jasper what shall we do He was over by the window laying out the long nails that were to fasten the cover on for no one must touch this precious box but the loving hands that got it ready Oh we can t began Jasper Then he turned and saw Phronsie s face Perhaps one might be crowded in he added with a look at Polly Which one would you rather have Polly make a try at Phronsie This one she said holding up the pudgiest bundle because this is the china cat and I want Joel to have that Down went Polly s head on the edge of the box Jasper dropped the long nails and hurried over to her I can t help it Polly s shoulders were shaking and she added gustily O dear me and Joel does so hate cats Phronsie I think I can tuck in that parcel Jasper made haste to say There give it to me child and he took it out of her hand For Joel was written across it in unsteady letters Is Polly sick asked Phronsie wonderingly as she resigned her cat into his hands No only a bit tired I think answered Jasper Well now Phronsie I think there is just room enough to tuck that parcel in this corner said Jasper crowding his fingers down in between the various bundles to make a space There in it pops suiting the action to the word I am so very glad said Phronsie smoothing her brown gown in great satisfaction for then Joel will know that I sent it all by myself He ll know that nobody else sent it said Polly to herself And I know it s a perfectly awful cat for Phronsie always picks out the very ugliest she can find Well the box was off at last the Pepper children and Jasper seeing it till the very last minute And old mister King was nearly as excited as the young folks and the Parson and missus Henderson said it reminded them of Christmas times over again and Mother Fisher and the little doctor were in a great state of happiness And that night when Polly was in bed and Mother Fisher came into her room and Phronsie s which opened into her own to say Good night Polly turned on her pillow Mamsie she said I do so very much wish that we could send a box to the Henderson boys They must be so homesick for their mother and father missus Fisher stopped and thought a bit A very good idea Polly she said and I m glad you thought of it I ll speak to your father and see if he approves before we say anything to mister King You see said Polly rolling over to get hold of one of Mother Fisher s hands and speaking very fast of course the Henderson boys are having a good time at dear Deacon Blodgett s but then their mother and father are away off Oh Mamsie She reached over and threw both arms around her mother and hugged her tightly Yes I know Polly said Mother Fisher holding her big girl to her heart and we must look out for other people s boys that s what you mean to say isn t it Yes said Polly happy that Mamsie always understood and now that Ben s and Joel s and David s box is off why I wish we could Mamsie send the other one I really think it can be done said missus Fisher but I must ask your father first And now daughter go to sleep like Phronsie She glanced over at the other little bed where Phronsie s yellow head was lost in dreams You know we are going to Marken tomorrow I know said Polly with a happy little wriggle under the bedclothes And it never would do for you to be all tired out in the morning That would be very unkind to dear mister King who is trying so hard to make us all happy continued missus Fisher I know said Polly again Well good night Mamsie She set three or four kisses on Mother Fisher s cheek then turned over with her face to the wall I ll shut the door until you get to sleep Polly said missus Fisher then I will open it again as she went out As Mother Fisher had said they were going to the Island of Marken to morrow and Polly tumbled asleep with her head full of all the strange things they were to see there and that Jasper and she had been reading about how the people wore the same kind of funny costume that their great great ever so many times great grandfathers and grandmothers had worn and how the houses were of different colours and built in different layers or mounds of land with cunning little windows and scarcely any stairs and how they were going in the haying season when everybody would be out raking up and gleaning and and Polly was completely lost in her happy dreams Somebody seemed to be pulling her arm What Oh she remembered they were going to Marken and she must hurry and get her bath and fly into her clothes Yes Mamsie she cried flying up to sit straight in the bed I ll get right up and dress oh won t we have fun Polly said Mother Fisher She had on a dressing gown and her black hair was hanging down her back She looked pale and worried Polly could see that although she blinked at the sudden light It isn t morning but the middle of the night You must get up this minute Pull on your shoes don t stop for stockings and slip into your wrapper Don t ask questions as Polly s lips moved Polly obeyed with an awful feeling at her heart She glanced at Phronsie s little bed she was not there missus Fisher threw the pink wrapper over her head Polly thrust her arms into the sleeves feeling as if she were sinking way down Now come And Mamsie seized her hand and hurried her through her own room without another word It was empty Father Fisher and Phronsie were nowhere to be seen And now for the first time Polly was conscious of a great noise out in the corridor It seemed to spread and fasten itself to a number of other noises and something made Polly feel queerly in her throat as if she should choke She looked up in her mother s eyes as they sped through the room Yes Polly said Mother Fisher it is fire The hotel is on fire you will be brave my child I know Phronsie gasped Polly They were now in the corridor and hurrying along She is safe her father took her Oh Mamsie Jasper and Grandpapa They know it your father ran and told them Obey me Polly come missus Fisher s firm hand on her arm really hurt Polly as they hurried on through the dense waves of smoke that now engulfed them Oh Mamsie not this way we must find the stairs But missus Fisher held her with firmer fingers than ever and they turned into a narrower hall up toward a blinking red light that sent a small bright spark out through the thick smoke and in a minute or very much less they were out on the fire escape and looking down to hear for they couldn t see Jasper s voice calling from below We are all here Polly and Be careful wife how you come down from doctor Fisher Oh cried Polly as the little group drew her and Mamsie into their arms are we all here Yes Polly yes yes answered Jasper And Oh yes cried old mister King his arm around Phronsie but we shouldn t have been but for this doctor of ours And mister and missus Henderson cried Polly shivering at Grandpapa s words We are here dear child said the parson s wife pressing forward and then the crowd surged up against them this way and that and more people came down the fire escape and some were screaming and saying they had lost everything and they must go back for their jewels and one woman brought down a big feather pillow and set it carefully on the grass she was so crazed with fright O dear dear can t we help them cried Polly wringing her hands Look at that girl She was about as old as Polly and she rushed by them plunging into the thickest of the crowd surging up against the fire escape I m going up she kept screaming Polly remembered her face as she flashed by She sat at the next table to theirs in the dining room with a slender gentle little old lady whom she called Grandmamma O dear groaned Polly we must help her Jasper dashed after the girl and Polly ran too He laid his hand on the arm of the flying figure as she broke through the crowd but she shook him off like a feather She s up there pointing above and I must get her One of the firemen seized her and held her fast Jasper sprang for the fire escape Jasper called Polly hoarsely it will kill Grandpapa if you go oh She turned at a cry from the girl whose arms were around a bent shaking little figure and they had both sunk to the ground I brought her down long ago said another fireman who could speak English pointing to the white haired old lady who on hearing her granddaughter s voice had pushed her way through the crowd as doctor Fisher hurried up And then mister King and his party gathered his group and they hurried to another hotel close by Jasper and mister Henderson and Mother Fisher waiting to see to the belongings of the party for the fire was now subdued although the guests had to go elsewhere for shelter and the little doctor was in his element taking care of the old lady and then he rushed off to look after a score or more of other fainting women But nobody was really hurt the smoke and the panic had been the worst only the poor thing who had dragged down the feather pillow sat by it till the little doctor discovering her called two stout men who took her up in their arms she screaming all the while for her treasure and bore her to a neighbouring house that kindly opened its doors to some of the people so suddenly thrown out of shelter And it wasn t till near breakfast time that the little doctor came to the hotel that was now their home Brain fever patient he said briefly Wife I must get a cold plunge or I ll be having it next And when breakfast was really set before their party he appeared with the others fresh from his bath and as cheery as if nothing had happened to break his good night s rest O dear me How did you ever get so many things over here in all this world and why didn t you let me stay with you Polly had exclaimed in one breath looking at the array of dresses sacks and hats disposed around the room And Mamsie was kneeling before an open trunk to take out more It wasn t best Polly said her mother who had longed for Polly as no one knew better than did Mother Fisher herself You were really needed here with Grandpapa and Phronsie You truly were my dear I know said Polly Well do let me take those out Mamsie you re tired to death already Oh and you ve brought my dear little American flag She seized it and hugged it with delight Did you suppose I could come back without that flag exclaimed Mother Fisher in a reproving tone when you ve put it up in your room every place where we ve stopped why Polly No Mamsie I really didn t think you could answered Polly quickly and running to her little silk flag and all to throw her arms around her neck only it s so good to see the dear thing again You may take the things from me and hang them up somewhere said her mother that will help me the most giving her an armful I don t see how you ever thought of so many things Mamsie exclaimed Polly going off with her armful I brought all I thought we needed just at first said Mother Fisher diving into the trunk depths again How did you ever do it cried Polly for the fiftieth time as she sorted and hung the various garments in their proper places Oh Jasper helped me pack them and then he got the hotel porter to bring over the trunks answered Mother Fisher her head in the trunk I ve locked up our rooms and got the keys so I can get the rest by and by But how did you first hear of the fire asked Polly when they were all finally seated around the breakfast table little missus Gray for so the white haired old lady was called and her granddaughter Adela being invited to join do tell me Mamsie I don t understand she added in a puzzled way No you were talking about Marken in your sleep said Mother Fisher when I went to call you and how you would be ready in the morning Marken repeated old mister King looking up from the egg he was carefully breaking for Phronsie so that she might eat it from the shell So we were going there this morning Well we won t see that island now for a good many days at least till we get over this fright Beside we have things to settle here and to get comfortably fixed But we ll have that excursion all in good time never fear Well how did you Mamsie Polly begged again first hear of the fire Do tell me Somebody made a good deal of noise down in the corridor said Mother Fisher and your father went out to see what was the matter and then he came back and told me what to do and he took Phronsie and went for old mister King But he had sent a porter to warn them in one hundred sixty five and they would tell the Hendersons in the next room before he ran upstairs to me It was a long speech for Mother Fisher Mamsie asked Polly suddenly after she had leaned across her mother and beamed at the little doctor which so delighted him that his big spectacles nearly fell off in his plate how did you know where the fire escape was Oh that was your father s doings too said Mother Fisher She couldn t help but show her pride He told me all about it the first day we got to the hotel He always does he says it s better to know these things Wife wife begged the little doctor imploringly I m going to tell Adoniram said Mother Fisher proudly the whole story they ought to know Indeed we had and so you shall commanded mister King from the head of the table I can t help it I really must exclaimed Polly hopping out of her chair there were no other people in the breakfast room beside their party so really it wasn t so very dreadful after all and she ran back of her mother s chair and threw her arms around the little doctor s neck Oh Papa Fisher she cried setting ever so many kisses on his cheeks under the big spectacles you ve saved all our lives There there Polly cried the little doctor quite overcome And ours too said little missus Gray in a shaking voice XI THE TWO BIRTHDAYS IN OLD HOLLAND And Polly never knew about a certain shelf in Grandpapa s closet nor how full it was getting when Jasper ran every now and then to add the gifts as fast as the different members of the party picked up pretty things in the shops for the coming birthday now very near And she actually forgot all about the birthday itself all her mind being set on the Henderson box so soon to sail off over the sea And Mother Fisher would look over at her absorbed face and smile to watch her in the shops picking out things for the Henderson boys and old mister King would send many a keen glance at her and Jasper had hard work not to exclaim Oh Polly father has got you a And then he d pull himself up and rush off into some great plan to buy Peletiah Henderson something that a Badgertown boy ought to have And Phronsie was carefully guarded on all sides these days lest she should let out the great secret for of course she ought to be in the very centre of all these preparations to celebrate Polly s birthday in Old Amsterdam so she knew everything just as soon as it was planned But sometimes with all this care the whole thing nearly popped out mister King It was Mother Fisher who called after him and her voice didn t sound like hers for it had an excited little ring Oh are you going out for she didn t see that he held his hat in his hand till he turned in the corridor I can wait just as well if it s anything you want missus Fisher he said gladly controlling his surprise at her unusual manner I was only about to run down to the Kalver straat for a little matter I just thought of for the birthday Can I do anything for you he begged Yes it s just that said missus Fisher hurriedly it s about the birthday I must speak quickly I ve just found out she glanced up and down the corridor as if fully expecting to see Polly dash around a corner that Adela Gray s birthday is to morrow The dickens You don t say so exploded mister King Well now I call that very clever on your part to have found it out Very clever indeed missus Fisher he repeated beaming at her And just in time for it would have been a dreadful thing indeed to have had that poor little girl left out and her birthday too Dear me It would indeed said missus Fisher heartily with a shiver at the mere thought And we might as well have had no celebration in such a case for Polly wouldn t have enjoyed a single bit of it not an atom declared old mister King bringing his walking stick heavily down on the floor What is it oh Grandpapa what is it and Polly came hurrying along the corridor and Jasper after her Here she comes exclaimed Grandpapa in a fright Glad you told me Hush O dear me I ll take care of the gifts And I m to do the rest just the same Doctor Fisher and I Remember It was all missus Fisher had time to utter Even then Polly caught the last words in the flurry Oh what is it Mamsie Is anything the matter with Papa Doctor And her brown eyes filled with alarm at her mother s unusual manner Polly missus Fisher looked into the brown eyes with a steady glance and all the hurry was gone out of her voice your father is all right And now run away you and Jasper She looked over Polly s shoulder at him as she spoke No not another word child And away missus Fisher hurried while old mister King slipped off in the opposite direction How funnily they act said Polly looking first after one and then another with a puzzled face What can it be Jasper Oh well I suppose they are in a hurry said Jasper as carelessly as he could Never mind Polly everything is all right Oh I say let s fix our stamp books But I was going to ask Grandpapa to go out with us and now he s gone by himself and Polly s face grew more puzzled than ever Polly said Jasper desperately I really think we ought to fix our stamp books I really do and he took her hand My stamps are all in heaps in the envelopes and in a mess generally Come let s begin now do And he led her back down the corridor I suppose so said Polly with a reluctant little sigh as they went off And that afternoon there was another narrow escape when it seemed as if the secret really must pop out Polly rushing along to the reading room opposite the big dining room saw Mother Fisher in consultation with the head waiter and he was saying cake and then he stopped suddenly and missus Fisher turned and saw her And Mamsie came across the hall and into the reading room and sat there a bit while Polly tossed off a letter to Alexia Rhys that had been worrying her for days And there was a funny little smile tucked away in the corners of Mother Fisher s mouth and Polly thought that things were getting queerer than ever I am glad you are writing that letter said missus Fisher with an approving smile that chased the funny little one all around the strongly curved mouth for Alexia will feel badly not to hear often from you Polly I know it said Polly wrinkling her brows and I didn t mean to let this wait so long scribbling away as fast as she could Take care Polly warned her mother a carelessly written letter is no compliment and it gets you in a bad way Don t hurry so child as Polly s pen went scratching across the paper at a fearful rate But there are so many letters to write to all the girls said Polly stopping a minute to look at her mother and I ve only just got all the letters in my steamer mail bag answered I must write to Cathie and Philena and Amy Garrett too to day Mamsie she added in distress Polly said Mother Fisher looking into the flushed face I tell you what would be the best way for you to do All the letters in your mail bag are answered you said Yes indeed declared Polly Oh Mamsie you didn t think I could put those off she asked reproachfully No Polly I really didn t missus Fisher made haste to assure her Well now mother will tell you what will be the best way for you to do Write as good a letter as you can to Alexia and tell her to send it around to all the girls for a kind of a bulletin and Oh Mamsie Fisher cried Polly not stopping to hear the rest but deserting the writing table to run and throw her arms around her mother s neck you re the bestest dearest mother in all this world oh oh Now I sha n t have but one letter to write How fine And you must write that one letter very nicely Polly and take ever so much pains with it said Mother Fisher her black eyes shining at the happy solution and that is much better than to hurry off a good many slovenly ones Besides it is not well to take your time and strength for too much letter writing for there are the boys and missus Whitney and Grandma Bascom and dear missus Beebe finished Polly Oh I couldn t ever forget them Mamsie in all this world She stopped cuddling Mother Fisher s neck to peer into the black eyes No you mustn t ever forget them repeated missus Fisher emphatically in all this world Polly Well get to work now over your one letter that s to be a bulletin I shall tear this one up declared Polly running back to get into her chair again O dear me what a horrible old scrawl she cried with a very red face I didn t know it did look so bad And she tore it clear across the page and then snipped it into very little bits That s the result of hurry observed Mother Fisher wisely and I would begin all over again Polly So Polly took a fresh sheet and set to work and missus Fisher seeing her so busily occupied soon stole out And there was the head waiter waiting for her in the dining room and Polly never heard a word they said although cake was mentioned a great many times and several other things too But the next morning Polly Pepper woke up to the fact that it was her birthday For there was Mamsie leaning over her pillow the first thing she saw the minute her eyes were opened And Phronsie was sitting on the end of the bed with her hands folded in her lap When she saw Polly s eyes open she gave a little crow and darted forward Oh I thought you never would wake up Polly she said throwing her arms around Polly s neck Yes this child has been sitting there a whole hour Polly Mother Fisher gave a merry little laugh and then she began to drop kisses on Polly s rosy cheek ever so many of them Polly s dewy eyes opened wide It s your birthday don t you know exclaimed Phronsie trying to drop as many kisses and as fast on Polly s other cheek and to talk at the same time Mamsie Fisher cried Polly springing up straight in the middle of the bed nearly knocking Phronsie over Why so it is Oh how could I forget and sleep over And I m fifteen You re fifteen repeated Mother Fisher setting the last little kiss on Polly s cheek and it s the best thing you could possibly do to sleep over child Now then Phronsie let us help her to get dressed Wasn t there a merry time though for the next half hour till Polly had had her bath and was arrayed Mother Fisher and Phronsie here there and everywhere helping to tie and to hook Polly s clothes Phronsie bringing her little silver button hook that Auntie Whitney gave her declaring that she should button Polly s boots Oh no child protested Polly I ll button them myself flying off for the boots But Phronsie piped out hurrying after her I have them Polly and sure enough there they were one under each arm do let me Polly do please she begged I would Polly advised missus Fisher for Phronsie really has set her heart on doing it So Polly sat down in the low chair and put out her foot feeling very queer indeed and as if she ought to be doing up Phronsie s boots instead And Phronsie curled up on the floor and patiently drew every one of the buttons into place and buttoned them fast And then on with the other boot There now I did do them all by myself she announced getting up from the floor and smoothing down her gown with much importance I did truly Polly So you did Pet cried Polly sticking out both feet to look at them You buttoned every single one of those buttons up splendidly Phronsie Pepper Now my toes will be just as happy all day oh you can t think how happy they ll be And she seized her half smothering her with kisses Will they cried Phronsie coming out of the embrace to peer up into Polly s face in a transport Will your toes really and truly be happy Polly They ll be so happy declared Polly with a little wriggle of each foot that they ll want to sing only they can t and she burst out into a little laugh Put on your blue dress Polly said Mother Fisher coming out of the closet to hurry operations a bit Oh Mamsie begged Phronsie mayn t Polly wear her white one Do Mamsie please She ran up to her mother pleadingly Polly will wear a white gown to night said Mother Fisher her eyes shining and the same funny little smile hiding in the corners of her mouth but this morning she would better put on her blue gingham Yes that s best said Polly reassuringly running off to get it out of the big bureau drawer It s all done up spick and span drawing it out Mamsie don t these Dutch women do up things well though They do indeed assented missus Fisher with a critical eye for the blue gingham but I really suppose the Swiss beat them Polly Well they must be just perfect then said Polly putting the blue gown carefully over her head Mamsie I just love this dress Yes it is pretty said Mother Fisher with an approving eye for the dainty ruffles and you keep your clothes cleaner than you used to Polly you re improving I used to get them all mussed up just as soon as could be mourned Polly her cheeks rosy at the remembrance Mamsie how much trouble I ve made you She stopped dressing and sprang over to missus Fisher Phronsie trying to button on the waistband and clinging to it went stumbling after Take care warned missus Fisher don t muss it it looks so nice now There there Phronsie I ll do that said Polly a trifle impatiently looking over her shoulder Oh I want to Polly said Phronsie fumbling for the button Do let me I want to No I can do it myself said Polly trying to whirl off from the busy little fingers Polly began Mother Fisher who saw what Polly couldn t Phronsie s little face very red with her exertion and the brown eyes filling with tears Well I declare cried Polly at sound of her mother s tone so you shall Phronsie Now I ll stand just as still as a mouse and you shall make that old button fly into its hole So he shall old button fly into his hole laughed Phronsie through her tears And presently she declared it was done And with a final pat this time from Mother Fisher s fingers Polly was released and the rest of the dressing was soon done And there waiting at the end of their corridor was Jasper in every conceivable way trying to get the better of his impatience When he did finally see Polly he dashed up to her Well are you really here Yes cried Polly scampering on with Phronsie clinging to her hand I really believe I am Jasper But don t let s go faster than Mamsie looking back for her You all run on said Mother Fisher laughing I shall get there soon and really mister King has waited long enough she added to herself And indeed mister King thought so too and he couldn t control his delight when the three danced into the little private parlour opening out from his bedroom and came up to his side I slept over said Polly in a shamefaced little way I m sorry Grandpapa dear You needn t be not a bit of it declared Grandpapa holding her off at arm s length to scan her rosy face the best thing you could possibly do Mamsie s very words So Polly felt relieved at once And now we will wait for missus Fisher he added with a glance at the door Here she is piped Phronsie who had been regarding the door anxiously Yes here she is repeated old mister King in great satisfaction holding Polly fast Well now missus Fisher that you have come we ll begin our festivities Our Polly here is fifteen years old to day only think of that Still he held her fast and bent his courtly white head to kiss her brown hair Polly clung to his other hand It can t be a house celebration Polly my dear with a party and all that but we ll do the best we can And to add to our pleasure and to be company for you not a suggestion of the pleasure he was to give why we ve another little girl with us who has chosen this very day for her birthday too Adela come here Adela Gray who had been standing silently looking on with a sad heart at finding herself with a birthday on her hands and no one to celebrate it with her though for that matter all her birthdays had been rather dismal affairs at the best in the Paris school now shrank back at mister King s sudden summons and hid behind her grandmother s black gown Come Adela commanded mister King in a tone that brooked no further delay So she crept out and stood in front of him Oh Adela exclaimed Polly in a transport drawing her up by her other hand for still Grandpapa held her fast Is it your birthday too How perfectly elegant oh oh And everybody said How fine And they all were smiling at her And Adela found herself before she knew it coming up out of her old despair into brightness and warmth and joy And she never knew when old mister King proclaimed her fourteen years old and dropped a kiss yes he actually did on her head And then she found herself on his other side by the big centre table that was covered with a large cloth And Polly made her put her hand under it first saying Oh no Grandpapa please let Adela pull out the first parcel And lo and behold she held a neat little white papered bundle tied with a blue ribbon Open it cried Jasper as she stood stupidly staring at it in her hand Don t you see it s got your name on it But Adela didn t see anything she was so dazed So Jasper had to open it for her We may thank our stars the first parcel happened to be for her he was thinking busily all the time he was untying the ribbon And there was just what she had wanted for oh so long missus Jameson s little books on Art her very own she saw as soon as her trembling fingers opened the cover After that the skies might rain down anything in the shape of gifts as it seemed to be doing for Polly and for her it didn t matter to Adela and she found herself finally looking over a heap of white papers and tangled ribbons at Polly Pepper who was dancing about and thanking everybody to right and to left Why don t why don t you thank him old missus Gray mumbled in her ear while the tears were running down her wrinkled cheeks Let her alone said old mister King hearing her She s thanked me enough Now then to breakfast all of us Come Polly come Adela Jasper you take missus Gray and the others falling in away they all went down to the big dining room to their own special table in the centre I do so love what Joey sent me and Ben and Davie breathed Polly for about the fiftieth time patting her little money bag which she had hung on her belt Then she looked at the new ring on her finger very lovingly and the other hand stole up to pinch the pin on her trim necktie and see if it were really there Oh Jasper if the boys were only here she whispered under cover of the chatter and bustle around the table Don t let us think of that Polly Jasper made haste to say it will make father feel so badly if he thinks you are worrying I know it said Polly pulling herself out of her gloom in an instant to be as gay as ever till the big sombre dining room seemed instinct with life and the cheeriest place imaginable What good times Americans do have exclaimed a lady passing the door and sending an envious glance within Yes if they re the right kind of Americans said her companion wisely All that wonderful day the sun seemed to shine more brightly than on any other day in the whole long year And the two girls who had the birthday together went here and there arm in arm to gladden all the tired and often discontented eyes of the fellow travellers they chanced to meet And when finally it came to the dusk and Polly and Adela were obliged to say Our birthday is almost all over why then that was just the very time when Mother Fisher and the little doctor for he was in the plan you may be very sure only he wanted her to make all the arrangements It s more in a woman s way my dear he had said well then that was their turn to celebrate the double birthday Where are those girls cried the little doctor fidgeting about and knocking down a little table in his prancing across the room Jasper ran and picked it up No harm done he declared setting the books straight again O dear did I knock that over asked doctor Fisher whirling around to look at the result of his progress Bless me did I really do that It s all right now said Jasper with a laugh at the doctor s face Lucky there wasn t anything that could break on the table I should say so declared the little doctor still I m sorry I floored these with a rueful hand on the books I d rather smash some other things that I know of than to hurt the feelings of a book Dear me So had I agreed Jasper to tell you the truth but these aren t hurt not a bit He took up each volume and carefully examined the binding When he saw that this was so the little doctor began to fidget again and to wonder where the girls were and in his impatience he was on the point of prancing off once more across the room when Jasper said Let us go and find them you and I An excellent plan said doctor Fisher hooking his arm into Jasper s and skipping off Jasper having hard work to keep up with him Here where are you two going called mister King after them And this hindered them so that Polly and Adela ran in unnoticed And there they were on time after all for it turned out that the little doctor s watch was five minutes ahead Well and then they all filed into the big dining room and there to be sure was their special table in the centre and in the middle of it was a tall Dutch cake ornamented with all sorts of nuts and fruits and candies and gay with layers of frosting edged and trimmed with coloured devices and on the very tip top of all was an elaborate figure in sugar of a little Dutch shepherdess And around this wonderful cake were plates of mottoes all trimmed in the Dutch fashion in pink and green and yellow while two big bunches of posies lay one at each plate of the two girls who had a birthday together in Old Amsterdam Oh oh cried Polly seizing her bunch before she looked at the huge Dutch cake and burying her nose deep among the big fragrant roses how perfectly lovely Who did do this But no one said a word And the little doctor was as sober as a judge He only glared at them over his spectacles Grandpapa gasped Polly you did Guess again advised Grandpapa Mamsie Polly gave one radiant look at Mother Fisher s face Then doctor Fisher broke out into a hearty laugh You ve guessed it this time Polly my girl he said your mother is the one Your father really did it corrected Mother Fisher Yes Adoniram you did only I saw to things a little that s all Which means that pretty much the whole business was hers added the little doctor possessing himself of her hand under cover of the table Well girls if you like your birthday party fixings that s all your mother and I ask It s Dutch anyway and what you won t be likely to get at home there s so much to be said for it XII THE HENDERSON BOX And as Mother Fisher observed they would all enjoy Marken better for the delay for there would be more time to anticipate the pleasure and then there was the Henderson box to get ready for Grandpapa King had not only approved the plan he had welcomed the idea most heartily It will be a good diversion from our scare he said when Polly and Jasper laid it before him And give us all something to do he added so go ahead children and set to work on it And Polly and Jasper had flown off with the good news and every one did set to work as Grandpapa said diving into the shops again Phronsie tried to find the mate to her china cat that was by this time sailing over the sea to Joel and it worried her dreadfully for try as she would she never could see another one And she looked so pale and tired one night that mister King asked her in consternation as they were all assembled in one corner of the drawing room what was the matter I wish I could find a cat sighed Phronsie trying not to be so tired and wishing the prickles wouldn t run up and down her legs so We ve walked and walked Grandpapa and the shop wouldn t come where it must be What kind of a cat is it you want asked Adela Gray It was just like Joey s said Phronsie turning her troubled blue eyes on Adela s face Well what colour continued Adela It was yellow said Phronsie a sweet little yellow cat With green eyes No I don t think it s eyes were green said Phronsie slowly trying to think but they were so pretty and she had a pink ribbon around her neck and Oh that settles it declared Adela quite joyful that she could help the little Pepper girl in any way at least the pink ribbon round its neck does for I know where there is a cat exactly like that that is the one I saw had green eyes but everything else is like it it s sitting upon a shelf in a shop where I was just this very day Phronsie Pepper Oh Phronsie gave a little gurgle of delight and slipping out of her chair she ran over to Adela Will you show me that shop to morrow she begged in great excitement To be sure I will promised Adela just as happy as Phronsie we will go in the morning right after breakfast May we missus Fisher looking over to her where she sat knitting as cosily as if she were in the library at home For I think people who travel get out of their everyday habits she had said to her husband before they started and I m going to pack my knitting basket to keep my hands out of mischief And old mister King had smiled more than once in satisfaction to glance over at Mother Fisher in her cosey corner of an evening and it made him feel at home immediately even in the dreariest of hotel parlours just the very sight of those knitting needles And so in between the picture galleries and museums to which some part of every day was devoted the Peppers and Jasper and Adela and old mister King who always went and Mother Fisher who sometimes was of the party the ransacking of the lovely shops took place And it really seemed as if everything that the Henderson boys could possibly want was in some of those places no matter how out of the way and waiting to be bought to fly over the sea to Badgertown At last off that box went Then Polly was quite happy and could enjoy things all the more with a mind at rest Now we are all ready for Marken she cried that night after dinner when the box was on its way to the steamer and I do hope we are going to morrow Jasper and she had a little table between them and they were having a game of chess Yes we are I think said Jasper slowly considering whether he would better bring down one of his knights into the thick of the battle or leave it to protect his queen Oh how fine exclaimed Polly unguardedly moving the pawn that held at bay a big white bishop who immediately swooped down on her queen and away it went off the board and oh how perfectly dreadful all in one and the same breath You may have it back said Jasper putting the black queen in place again No indeed it s perfectly fair that I lost it said Polly oh I wouldn t take it back for anything I was talking it was all my own fault Jasper Well you were talking about Marken and I don t wonder for we have been so long trying to go there Do take it back Polly he begged holding it out No indeed declared Polly again shaking her brown head decidedly not for the world Jasper What is going over in that corner called Grandpapa s voice by the big reading table He had finished his newspaper and was now ready to talk So Jasper and Polly explained and that brought out the subject of Marken and old mister King said yes it was perfectly true that he had made all the arrangements to go the following day if the weather were fine So Polly and Jasper swept off the remaining pieces on the chessboard and packed them away in their box and ran over to hear all the rest of it that he was now telling to the family So you see it didn t make any difference about that old queen anyway said Polly as they hurried over to him for nobody has beaten I m glad I didn t beat declared Jasper I ve that satisfaction anyway because you wouldn t have moved that pawn Polly if you hadn t been talking of Marken The next day was fine enough to warrant the trip though not absolutely sunshiny Old mister King wisely deciding that the fun of the expedition would lose its edge if postponed again said Start So after breakfast they all went down to the Wester dock and embarked on the little steamer bound for the island of Marken in the Zuyder Zee Oh Polly look said Jasper doesn t Amsterdam look fine as the little steamer slowly put forth Polly leaned over the rail and drew in long breaths of delight Come Adela she called here is a good place for the little old lady was still too much shaken up to make much attempt at travelling so Polly had begged Mother Fisher and Grandpapa to ask Adela to come with them on their sightseeing trips And this was done and the young girl was happy as a bird So here she was going down to Marken too Adela ran and kneeled down on the seat by Polly s side and hung over the rail too Don t the houses lean over queerly she said pointing to the long narrow buildings they were leaving behind They look worse from the water than when we are in the midst of them It s just as if they were holding each other up said Polly Dear me I should think they d tumble over some fine day What makes them sag so asked Adela intently regarding them That s because the city is built on piles I suppose said Jasper It s mostly sand in Holland you know particularly around Amsterdam and so they had to drive down piles to get something strong enough to put their houses on That s what who was it oh I know Erasmus meant when he said I know a city whose inhabitants dwell on the tops of the trees like rooks O dear me said Adela quite impressed well what makes them not sag any more she asked at length Because they ve sagged all they want to I suppose said Jasper laughing Anyway they ve stood so for years on years probably so it s fair to believe they re all right And I think they re ever so much prettier leaning every which way declared Polly We can see plenty of straight houses at home so it s nice to see crooked ones over here Oh Jasper there s the King s palace Yes and there is the dome of the Lutheran Church said Jasper Look at that woman with the boy said Adela on the wharf She s got a little black bonnet tied on top of her white cap That s nothing to what we shall see at Marken I suppose said Polly I m going to take ever so many photographs She tapped her kodak lovingly as it hung from the strap on her shoulder I wish I d brought mine said Adela Why didn t you cried Polly whirling around to scan Adela I forgot it said Adela I put it on the table last night close to my hat and gloves and then walked off this morning without it Now that s too bad exclaimed Polly in sympathy Then she turned back uncomfortably and began to talk of something else I m not going to she said to herself it isn t my fault she forgot her kodak and I want every one of my films myself And I care a great deal more for Marken than for almost any other place The next moment Mamsie seemed to say Is that my Polly and although she was at the other end of the boat Polly s head drooped as if she had heard the words O dear me and Adela hasn t any one but a sick grandmother and I have just everybody she thought You shall use my kodak cried Polly aloud one half the time Adela Oh no protested Adela but she looked hungrily at Polly s kodak swinging over her shoulder Yes you shall too declared Polly cheerily I can take all the pictures I want in that time and I have lots of films I ll divide with you Polly said Jasper I brought ever so many and will go shares with my kodak too But Polly made up her mind that Jasper s kodak was to be used for his own special pictures for she knew he had set his heart on taking certain ones and a good many of them too Isn t that water just perfectly lovely she exclaimed such a bluish grey I think it s a greyish blue said Adela squinting along its surface critically Well what s the difference asked Polly laughing Not much said Jasper I should think Well anyway it s lovely declared Polly I just wish I could paint it Do you paint asked Adela suddenly No said Polly not a bit Polly is all for music said Jasper quickly You ought to hear her play Oh I can t play much now said Polly but I mean tot some time Jasper how long it is since we have had a duet Her face dropped its cheery curves and a sad little look crept into her eyes That s the bother of travelling about one can t play in a hotel said Jasper But wait till we get to Dresden Polly Oh I can t bear to wait said Polly I don t want to hurry on Jasper but oh I do wish we could play on a piano Her fingers drummed on the rail in her eagerness Why you are playing now said Adela bursting into a laugh or pretending to Polly Pepper I know it said Polly laughing too well that s what I always used to do in the little brown house drum on the table In the little brown where demanded Adela in astonishment The little brown house answered Polly and her eyes lightened as she seemed to see it before her That s where we used to live Adela oh the sweetest place you can t think Polly s fingers stopped drumming now and the colour flew up to her cheek she forgot all about Adela Oh I suppose it had everything beautiful about it said Adela delighted to make Polly talk big gardens and terraces and Oh no said Polly it didn t have gardens at all Adela only a little bit of a green grass plot in front But there was an apple tree at the back Apple tree at the back echoed Adela faintly Yes and we had beautiful plays under it cried Polly rushing on in remembrance and sometimes when all the work was finished Mamsie would let us spend the whole afternoon out there You can t think what perfectly splendid times we had there Adela Gray Adela by this time was beyond words but stared up at Polly s face speechlessly And what fun it was on baking days Polly cried Jasper unable to keep quiet any longer do you remember when I burnt all my cakes around the edges Well that was because the old stove acted so said Polly one minute it wouldn t bake at all and the next it burnt things black And the washing the dishes and things up afterward said Jasper reflecting I think I liked that just as well as the baking Polly It was good fun said Polly and how funny you looked with one of Mamsie s aprons tied round under your chin Jasper I know it said Jasper bursting into a laugh I must have looked like I don t know what But it was good fun Polly And then Phronsie came running up and after her came Grandpapa to see that she got there all right Oh Polly do you see the windmills she cried clapping her small hands Yes Pet said Polly looking all along the soft curves of the shore there are hundreds of them aren t there There was a girl coming out of the door of one of them announced Phronsie climbing up on the seat and putting her arm around Polly s neck Polly I d like to live in a windmill I would she whispered close to her ear Would you Pet Yes I would truly she said Why couldn t I Polly just like that girl I saw coming out of the door she asked looking back wistfully Well that girl never had a little brown house to live in said Polly think of that Phronsie XIII THE CLEANEST PLACE IN ALL HOLLAND Oh Polly see the cunning little doll houses exclaimed Phronsie in a little scream flying about from Grandpapa at the head of his party on their way up from the boat landing and then back to the rear of the procession which happened to be Polly and Jasper Hush Phronsie don t talk so loud they are not doll houses said Polly People live in them People live in them echoed Phronsie standing quite still on the paved road that shone as if just freshly scoured Yes yes come along child the people will hear you said Polly seizing her hand Phronsie suffered herself to be piloted along but she stumbled more than once over the cobbles her eyes were so busy Take care Phronsie warned Polly you came near falling on your nose that time I ll go on the other side said Jasper there now Phronsie give us your hand Well I don t wonder you are surprised I never saw such a place as this Broek is They ve just washed it all up haven t they Jasper asked Polly her brown eyes scanning the little walks along each tiny garden they passed Everything shone alike They re always washing up I believe answered Jasper with a laugh I suppose they live in a pail of water so to speak Oh Jasper in a pail of water exclaimed Phronsie between them poking her head out to look for such a strange and unwarrantable sight provided by the inhabitants of Broek I mean they re always scrubbing so they can never be separated from their pails of water said Jasper It seems almost too bad to step on such clean roads said Polly getting up on her tiptoes and stepping gingerly off When Phronsie saw Polly do that she got up on her tiptoes too and tried to get over the ground with her You can t do that long said Jasper with a laugh for both and it wouldn t do any good Polly if you could for these Broek women will have to come out and scrub up after us all the same I suppose they will said Polly with a sigh of relief coming down on to the rest of her feet which proceeding Phronsie was very glad to copy And it isn t as nice as it looks to walk on the tips of your toes Jasper do see those cunning little windows and those china images inside It seems as if they were all windows said Jasper scanning the tiny panes shining at them from all the cottages Dear me the Broek women have something to do don t they to keep everything so shiny and clean Haven t they cried Polly Well I don t wonder it is the cleanest place in all Holland They must have to sit up all night and wash and scrub It s the cleanest place on the whole earth I imagine laughed Jasper But I should love to see some boys playing with mud pies sighed Polly running her glance up and down the immaculate road and compassing all the tiny gardens possible to her range of vision Mud pies exclaimed Jasper in mock surprise Polly how can you mention such a thing as dirt or mud here Jasper do you suppose the children can have a good time here pursued Polly anxiously willing to give up the mud pies if only reassured on the latter point which seemed to her a very doubtful one We ll hope so answered Jasper See the klompen outside that door Polly Well here we are at the dairy Polly And can I see the cows cried Phronsie Oh Grandpapa is calling me and off she ran And so he was calling her as he and the parson had now reached the dairy door under cover with the dwelling which seemed much less an object of painstaking care than the house where the cows resided and the cheeses were made But everything was as neat as a pin in the house though and Polly and Jasper concluded they would explore the two rooms as everybody seemed to be expected to do after the main object of the visit was accomplished and the dairy inspected Dear me do they have to take their shoes off before they go in the house cried Polly I suppose so said Jasper Well it isn t much trouble to get out of those sabots that s one comfort for them Dear me missus Fisher was saying if they haven t a carpet on the floor for the cows to walk on And there surely were strips of carpeting all down the walks between the rows of stalls and something that looked like braided hemp in the bottom of the stalls themselves And everything was tiled where it could be with little tiles and all these and every bit of the woodwork itself shone beautifully it was so clean and polished missus Fisher s black eyes shone too It s beautiful she said to her husband to see everything so clean for once in the world What are those hooks for asked Jasper of the stolid Dutchman who showed them about and who spoke English fairly well We hook the cows tails up so they won t shake any dirt on their sides said the Dutchman O dear me exclaimed Polly Pepper and everybody laughed but she didn t I think that is cruel she said What do the poor things do to beat off the flies pray tell Flies said Mother Fisher I don t suppose they ever see a fly here Polly They d chase one worse than the dirt I guess said the little doctor Oh said Polly with a sigh of relief Come Polly let us go into the cheese room suggested Jasper peering in for everything was connected and under one roof There s a man in there and he is telling something so they skipped in while Phronsie was bewailing that there were no cows there and where were they Why Phronsie they are all out in the fields You wouldn t have them shut up this hot day said Grandpapa No said Phronsie swallowing the lump in her throat I wouldn t Grandpapa I d much rather know they are having a nice time I don t want them in here I truly don t That s a nice child said old mister King approvingly Well now we ll see how they make these wonderful Edam cheeses Phronsie I shall call this place the Cheesery announced Polly running about between the vats and the big press Oh Polly that s a capital name said Jasper So shall I call it the Cheesery in my journal Look at the rows and rows of them Polly And how round and yellow they are said Polly just like pumpkins aren t they Wouldn t it be fine if we could take some home to send to Badgertown Dear missus Beebe is so fond of cheese Jasper It is a pity but we couldn t take cheeses very well Fancy our trunks Polly He wrinkled up his face at sight of it Polly laughed merrily No of course not she said but oh how fine they look Grandpapa I d like to buy one said Phronsie overhearing a bit of this and opening her little bag that hung on her arm to get her purse What in the world can you do with a Dutch cheese child exclaimed old mister King But I would like to buy one persisted Phronsie And after much diving Phronsie produced the little silk purse Polly wants one Grandpapa she got up on her tiptoes to whisper confidentially Oh is that it said mister King Well now Phronsie I don t really believe Polly wants one You would better ask her If she wants one you shall buy it for her So Phronsie ran off Do you Polly Do you then she gently pulled Polly s sleeve to make her hear for Polly and Jasper were hanging on the description that the man in attendance was pouring forth Do I what cried Polly only half understanding and lost in the thought of how much fun it must be to make little yellow cheeses and set them up in rows to be taken to market want one of those dear sweet little cheeses finished Phronsie Yes indeed answered Polly bobbing her head and listening to the man with all her might Yes she does Grandpapa declared Phronsie flying back she told me so her very own self The goodness she does exclaimed old mister King Well then she shall have one But pick out a small one Phronsie the very smallest you can find This was so much a work of time Phronsie laying aside one selection after another each yellow cheese looking so much better on comparison that at last old mister King was almost in despair and counselled the purchase of the last one that Phronsie set her eyes on But meantime she had spied one on the upper shelf of all There it is Grandpapa she cried clapping her hands in delight the very littlest of all and isn t it beautiful Grandpapa dear Indeed it is assented Grandpapa and he had the man lift it down and do it up a piece of a Dutch newspaper again doing duty when Phronsie held out her arms to receive it You can t carry it child give it to me What in the world shall we do with the thing all this Grandpapa was uttering in one breath Oh Grandpapa dear I do so want to carry Polly s little yellow cheese said Phronsie the tears beginning to come in her eyes Grandpapa who had taken the round parcel from her arms looked from it to her with increasing perplexity Have the goodness to put a string around it will you he said to the man who was regarding him stolidly after satisfying himself that the coin Phronsie had drawn out of her purse and put in his hand was a good one Yah yah said the man and he brought out of one of his pockets a long piece of thick twine This with much hard breathing accompanying the work he proceeded to twist and interlace around the paper containing the little yellow cheese in such a way that when it was completed Phronsie was carrying what looked like a little net basket for there was a good strong twine handle sticking up into which she put her small hand in great satisfaction When they all gathered in the living room of the house that had open doors into the cow house and dairy all being under one roof they found a huge pile of photographs displayed of various views of the premises indoors and out But they aren t half as nice as ours will be whispered Jasper how many did you take Polly Three said Polly Oh Polly didn t you get more than that said Jasper quite disappointed for her for Polly dearly loved to take photographs Oh you ve let Adela Gray take your kodak he added it s a shame I didn t give you mine Take it now Polly he begged slinging off the leather strap from his shoulder No no said Polly I don t want to Jasper and I wanted Adela to take it and don t let her hear us she may come back from the other room for Adela had disappeared with the kodak and it s all right Jasper she finished up incoherently Aren t these queer beds missus Fisher the parson s wife was saying peering into the shelves against the side of the wall boarded up with doors swung open inviting inspection The idea of sleeping in one of them exclaimed missus Fisher inspecting the interior with a sharp eye They re clean enough and as neat as a pink with a critical glance along the white lace spread and the immaculate pillow but to be shut up in a box like that I should as soon go to bed in a bureau drawer So should I laughed the parson s wife and look at the artificial flowers hanging up over the head and that picture pinned above the foot Well well well and so that is a Dutch bed There are a good many kinds and sorts of Dutch beds I suppose observed missus Fisher turning away just as there are a good many American ones but I hope there aren t many of this particular kind Jasper exclaimed Polly as they all filed decorously out of the Model Farm how I do wish you and I could race down to the boat landing Jasper looked longingly down the washed and shining road So do I Polly he said but I suppose it wouldn t do we should shock these natives I suppose so assented Polly ruefully Just then Phronsie came up holding with both hands her paper covered twine netted little round yellow cheese What in the world has Phronsie got exclaimed Polly catching sight of her Come here Pet she called Phronsie hesitated On Polly s calling her again she drew near but more slowly than was her wont What have you got Phronsie asked Polly wondering and not a little hurt by her manner A little basket of string isn t it funny and where did you get it It isn t a basket corrected Phronsie and I cannot tell you now Polly said Phronsie shaking her head Why Phronsie began Polly in surprise and she couldn t help it her voice quavered in spite of her When Phronsie heard that she was equally distressed and at once decided to present the gift then instead of carrying it back to the hotel for Polly as she had at first intended So she cast her burden into Polly s hands and piped out It s for you Polly a sweet little yellow cheese you said you wanted it and stood smiling and triumphant Oh my goodness me exclaimed Polly Pepper standing quite still Then she did shock the natives for she sat right down in the road with the cheese in her hands XIV THE ISLAND OF MARKEN 
5163_18515_000003_000000	train-clean-100	When the boat was nearing the island of Marken the little yellow cheese had been presented with all due formality to one of the sailors who had been specially kind in the matter of securing good seats for mister King s party Polly and Phronsie having held a whispered conference in a retired nook to come out of it bright and smiling 
none	none	And now it has made two people happy Phronsie Polly had said when the presentation was well over and she ended up with a kiss
5163_18515_000004_000001	train-clean-100	 It made me happy in the first place because you thought of me and then just think Pet that poor sailor how glad he will be to take it home 
5163_18515_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 Will he Polly asked Phronsie in a rapture and do you think he has got any little girls 
none	none	Perhaps so said Polly and at any rate he can eat it himself 
5163_18515_000006_000001	train-clean-100	And he looks hungry enough 
none	none	I d rather he had some little girls Polly said Phronsie thoughtfully and have him give them each a piece
5163_18515_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Well maybe he has some we ll think so anyway Polly answered 
5163_18515_000008_000001	train-clean-100	 Oh see Jasper is calling us 
none	none	To be sure there he was on the other side of the boat nearest Marken with a big group of passengers intently watching the Marken children running along in their clacking sabots on the high bank and holding out their arms singing something all the while in a shrill high key
5163_18515_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 They want some stuivers cried Jasper 
none	none	Come Polly and Phronsie let us toss them some 
5163_18515_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Whiz spin went the coins to fall into the thick stubby grass on the bank 
none	none	The children stopping their song in mid air scrambled and sprawled all over each other in their efforts to secure the coveted money 
5163_18515_000011_000002	train-clean-100	So Jasper and Polly threw the bits next time in the other direction 
none	none	Then there was a shout and a rush and the same thing was repeated till only a tangle of arms and legs could be seen 
5163_18515_000011_000004	train-clean-100	But some one of them always got the money 
none	none	Dear me 
5163_18515_000012_000001	train-clean-100	they ve eyes just like birds exclaimed Parson Henderson to think of finding anything in that thick grass 
5163_18515_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Let them alone for that laughed old mister King their wits are sharpened by practice 
5163_18515_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Look out Phronsie exclaimed Jasper 
5163_18515_000014_000001	train-clean-100	 Your stuivers went into the water 
5163_18515_000014_000002	train-clean-100	Here I ll hold you up then you can throw it farther 
5163_18515_000014_000003	train-clean-100	There you go swinging her to his shoulder 
none	none	Now then he guided her hand and away spun the coin
5163_18515_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 It did it did crowed Phronsie from her high perch 
5163_18515_000015_000001	train-clean-100	 It did Jasper go right straight down in the grass just like yours and Polly s 
5163_18515_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 So it did Pet 
5163_18515_000016_000001	train-clean-100	Well now here is another 
5163_18515_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 There s a little girl back there and she hasn t any mourned Phronsie 
none	none	Oh dear I want to give her some
5163_18515_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 To be sure said Jasper 
5163_18515_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 Well we must give her some and that s a fact The small girl kept on at a dog trot along the bank her eyes fixed on the wonderful people who tossed out such magic wealth and holding out her arms and singing her shrill song 
5163_18515_000018_000002	train-clean-100	But when the money was thrown she was always a bit too late and the other children scrambling and scuffling had pounced upon it and had made off with it 
5163_18515_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Here you boys keep away you ve had enough we re going to give this to the little girl Jasper shouted to them as they threw coin after coin 
5163_18515_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 They don t know what you are saying my boy said old mister King laughing heartily at the performance and they wouldn t mind you in the least if they did 
5163_18515_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 I suppose not said Jasper in chagrin 
5163_18515_000021_000001	train-clean-100	 Oh the mean little beggars 
5163_18515_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Hold up your apron screamed Polly to the little girl 
5163_18515_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 That s a good idea said Jasper 
5163_18515_000023_000001	train-clean-100	 Why didn t we think of it before 
5163_18515_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 She won t understand any better than the boys said old mister King You forget children that these youngsters don t know our language 
5163_18515_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 What a bother exclaimed Jasper it is to have so many different languages anyway 
none	none	And she hasn t any apron Polly corrected her mother that is her brown gown Polly was already going through the motions of holding up an imaginary apron 
5163_18515_000027_000001	train-clean-100	And at last the little girl understood by gestures what she could not possibly get into her head by words so she picked up the skirt of her gown in her sturdy little fists and one two three clinking coins fell safely into it 
5163_18515_000027_000002	train-clean-100	But the boys racing along in advance soon discovered this successful trick and completely swarmed around her howling dreadfully so she hastened off happy in her prize which she huddled up in her gown as she ran 
5163_18515_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Isn t this just richness exclaimed Polly gazing all about her in an ecstasy 
5163_18515_000028_000001	train-clean-100	 Oh Jasper what pictures we ll take and do see that woman s cap and those pot hooks of hair over her eyes and that funny long dangling curl 
5163_18515_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Take care Polly you almost stepped off backward down the bank warned Adela pulling her back as they got off the steamboat and stopped a bit to look around 
5163_18515_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Dear me did I said Polly 
5163_18515_000030_000001	train-clean-100	 Well it s enough to make any one step backward to see such funny clothes and they are hay making Adela Gray as sure as you live 
5163_18515_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Didn t you suppose they would be answered Adela composedly 
5163_18515_000031_000001	train-clean-100	 Why that s one of the things I specially wanted to see 
5163_18515_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes so did I said Polly 
5163_18515_000032_000001	train-clean-100	 Well it s too too splendid for anything 
5163_18515_000032_000002	train-clean-100	I m going to begin to take pictures right straight off Then she stopped and looked at Adela 
none	none	You may first she said No I m not going to declared Adela
5163_18515_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes yes said Polly I d rather you did first I truly had Adela She ran after her for Adela had retreated down the bank and made as if she were going to follow the party 
5163_18515_000034_000001	train-clean-100	 Now Adela be good and listen to reason 
none	none	But Adela ran off
5163_18515_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Now that s too bad mourned Polly for I m afraid she ll keep away from me all the while we re on this island and then I can t get a chance to give her my kodak at all 
5163_18515_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 She had it at the Model Farm said Jasper by way of comfort for Polly s face fell 
5163_18515_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh that was nothing said Polly such a little bit of a while doesn t count 
5163_18515_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 Well let us take pictures as fast as we can suggested Jasper and then when we do come up with Adela why you ll have yours done 
none	none	So Polly roused out of her dejection and set to work and presently the hay makers and the Marken boys and girls the funny little houses that looked as if they dropped down pellmell from the clouds and settled where they had dropped the high ridges along which the men and boys walking in their full baggy trousers looked as if they were blown up and formed a Dutch perspective perfectly awful all these queer delightful things were presently imprisoned in the two kodaks 
5163_18515_000041_000000	train-clean-100	Jasper looked up 
5163_18515_000041_000001	train-clean-100	 There that s my last picture he declared 
5163_18515_000041_000002	train-clean-100	 At any rate for now 
5163_18515_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh one more 
5163_18515_000042_000001	train-clean-100	I must get a good picture of those girls raking hay Polly ran off a few steps and sat down on a log to focus 
5163_18515_000042_000002	train-clean-100	The Marken girls happened to look up and immediately whirled around and presented their backs to her 
none	none	Oh dear how hateful she exclaimed that would have been a splendid picture Never mind said Jasper you can catch them unawares and have another try at them
5163_18515_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 Not so good as that said Polly sorrowfully 
5163_18515_000045_000001	train-clean-100	 Well it can t be helped So she was just going to get up from her log when the girls thinking from her attitude that she had given up the idea of taking a picture of them turned back to their work 
5163_18515_000045_000002	train-clean-100	As quick as a flash Polly focussed again and was just touching the button when a hand came in front of her kodak and she saw the grinning face of a Marken girl under its pot hook of hair and with the long dangling curl on one side close to her own 
none	none	Too late exclaimed Polly
5163_18515_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 And don t you ever do that again And the hand was withdrawn and the girl clattered off as fast as she could run in her wooden shoes 
5163_18515_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 I got them said Polly running back in triumph to Jasper 
5163_18515_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes and I took a picture of the saucy girl while she was trying to stop yours said Jasper 
5163_18515_000048_000001	train-clean-100	 So she didn t do much harm after all 
5163_18515_000048_000002	train-clean-100	Oh here is a splendid group 
5163_18515_000048_000003	train-clean-100	See them standing by that old tumble down house Polly he added excitedly 
5163_18515_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 I thought you had taken your last picture Jasper said Polly bursting into a laugh 
5163_18515_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I had then but I ve begun again said Jasper recklessly 
5163_18515_000050_000001	train-clean-100	He walked up to the group and held out his hand then pointed to his kodak 
5163_18515_000050_000002	train-clean-100	They smiled and nodded showing all their teeth and the mother took the littlest baby for there seemed to be a very generous number of the smaller members of the family and sat down with it in her lap on the rickety step 
5163_18515_000050_000003	train-clean-100	Then they all drew up stiff as sticks and didn t even wink 
5163_18515_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 That s capital said Jasper in huge satisfaction pouring the coins into the mother s lap where they rolled underneath the fat baby 
none	none	Polly and he hurried on Oh Polly I m so very glad you ve come said Phronsie as Polly and Jasper ran up to a doorway through which they could see their party Phronsie stood just inside and appeared to be watching for them There s a woman here who s been showing us things There was missus Fisher up by the tiny window bending over an old woman who had spread out in her lap some white embroidered garments while a young woman hovered near smiling and blushing and very happy at all this notice And the rest of the party crowded up as close as they could
5163_18515_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 They are her daughter s wedding clothes said missus Fisher I do believe For the old woman was working fearfully hard to make them understand and pointing first to the white garments and then to the young woman 
5163_18515_000053_000001	train-clean-100	 Wedding clothes asked missus Fisher speaking very slowly 
none	none	The old woman seemed to understand the one word wedding for she nodded furiously and smiled well pleased and then devoted her whole time and energy to the display of the garments And she even laughed aloud when old mister King put some coins in her hard hand 
5163_18515_000055_000000	train-clean-100	Polly took the time to study her headgear 
5163_18515_000055_000001	train-clean-100	 I think there is a round board under the cap she confided to Jasper when once out of doors how else could they be pulled so tight 
5163_18515_000055_000002	train-clean-100	And they look as hard as a drum 
5163_18515_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 I didn t investigate he said laughing 
5163_18515_000056_000001	train-clean-100	 I ll leave that to you Polly 
5163_18515_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 Well it s funny anyway she said that all the women and girls dress alike in those queer gowns in two parts and those embroidered jackets over their waists and those caps and horrible pot hooks and long curls 
5163_18515_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 It s well that we ve got so many pictures for the people at home would never believe our stories without them 
5163_18515_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 And these houses continued Polly squinting up at a crooked row all colours green stripes and black stripes and O dear me 
5163_18515_000059_000001	train-clean-100	Jasper King just look at Phronsie 
5163_18515_000060_000000	train-clean-100	Jasper followed the direction of Polly s finger 
5163_18515_000060_000001	train-clean-100	There sat Phronsie on a grassy bank a little above them with one of the fattest Marken babies in her lap 
5163_18515_000060_000002	train-clean-100	A variegated group of natives was near by watching her intently 
none	none	But Phronsie didn t appear to notice them
5163_18515_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 Polly I wish we had a baby just like this sighed Phronsie giving motherly pats to the stout little legs dangling down from her lap 
5163_18515_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 Come children Grandpapa emerged from the little old house we must hurry on else we sha n t get through this island 
5163_18515_000062_000001	train-clean-100	Come Phronsie goodness me as he saw how she was occupied 
5163_18515_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 May I carry her begged Phronsie staggering to her feet she s mine and dragging the Marken baby up with her 
none	none	Goodness me no child exclaimed Grandpapa in horror
5163_18515_000064_000002	train-clean-100	 Put her down Phronsie she s ever so much too heavy for you dear He put forth a protesting hand but the tears ran down Phronsie s cheeks and fell on the baby s stiff white cap 
none	none	At that old mister King was quite gone in despair Phronsie Polly bent over and whispered close to the wet little cheek don t you see Grandpapa is feeling badly 
5163_18515_000065_000001	train-clean-100	I m afraid he will be sick Phronsie if he is unhappy 
5163_18515_000066_000000	train-clean-100	Phronsie dropped the pudgy little hand and threw herself into old mister King s arms 
5163_18515_000066_000001	train-clean-100	 Don t be sick Grandpapa she wailed struggling with her tears 
none	none	I d rather not have my baby please I don t want her Please be all well Grandpapa dear XV mister KING DOES HIS DUTY Polly s face appeared over Adela s shoulder Don t said Adela shrinking away into the corner of the big sofa and putting her hands over something she held in her lap Excuse me exclaimed Polly tumbling back in amazement I wasn t looking I don t want to see I only meant to surprise you She kept backing off toward the door the colour all over her round cheek You mustn t get mad Polly cried Adela flying up straight to look at her but still keeping her lap well covered Jasper running in heard the words Polly never gets mad he said slowly standing quite still Well she is now just as mad as can be said Adela in a fretful little voice look at her Oh I m not mad Adela began Polly only sorry And it s my fault Jasper seeing his face darken for I looked over her shoulder I only wanted to surprise her and Adela of course thought I wanted to see what she was doing Yes said Adela I did think so Polly Pepper and I don t want anybody to see it With that she huddled the thing whatever it was down by her side and ran out of the room as fast as she could go A disagreeable creature began Jasper hotly and she s been a perfect nuisance all along to take her everywhere Now we drop her Polly He looked more like his father at this moment than Polly had ever seen him before Oh no Jasper she remonstrated in dismay Yes we drop her like a hot cake said Jasper decidedly that would be my opinion Polly But we can t she s so alone went on Polly and besides she s troubled about something That s what makes her feel so It s a queer way to bear trouble I should think to abuse you said Jasper when you ve been bothering yourself about her all this time Oh I don t mind said Polly brightening up if only you won t talk of our dropping her Jasper Jasper turned on his heel and walked to the window When he looked back the annoyance had dropped out of his face and he was just saying All right Polly it ought to be as you say I m sure when Adela Gray rushed into the room and up to Polly and flung her arms around her neck There and there and there and something tumbled into Polly s hands I didn t want anybody to see it mumbled Adela for I ve spoiled it and I was trying to rub out the spots when you came in and I made it worse than ever But I ll give it to you now Polly and please tear it up and I ll make you another When this long speech was all mumbled out Polly was looking at a little sketch of Phronsie holding the fat Marken baby and the Marken people looking on Oh Jasper screamed Polly do come here Oh Adela did you draw this And oh how perfectly beautiful all in one breath It is a good thing said Jasper taking the drawing from Polly s hand and examining it critically while Polly threw her arms around Adela and oh ed and ah ed her delight at finding that she could draw and sketch so beautifully and now to think of having this lovely picture of Phronsie But you must tear it up said Adela in alarm else I m sorry I gave it to you Polly Tear it up repeated Polly in astonishment tear up this lovely picture of Phronsie What do you mean Adela Gray Oh I ve a copy of course said Adela carelessly and I m going to do you another better one Where did you learn to draw so well asked Jasper in admiration of the bold accurate lines and the graceful curves In school at Paris said Adela quietly Polly looked over Jasper s arm and scanned the sketch I never saw anything so lovely she exclaimed And it s just alive Isn t it Jasper Yes it is splendid he said enthusiastically and that s the best part of it it s alive Polly as you say I d give anything in all this world Adela if I could draw like that mourned Polly I d rather play on the piano said Adela than do all the drawing in the world But I can t learn the music master said there was something the matter with my ear and I never could tell one note from another by the sound I do so wish I could play on the piano Polly Pepper she added discontentedly Well Jasper can do both play on the piano and draw too said Polly I can t draw like this said Jasper holding the sketch off at arm s length to view it again I couldn t if I were to try a thousand years Oh Jasper exclaimed Polly who couldn t bear to think there was anything that he could not do Well I can t said Jasper Let me see some of your sketches begged Adela It s so nice to find some one else who can draw Do show me some Oh no protested Jasper in dismay not after this pointing to Adela s drawing Do Jasper begged Polly imploringly get your portfolio Oh I couldn t bring them all in said Jasper I wouldn t show those old things for the world Polly Well bring some of them do she begged while Adela said I showed mine and I didn t want to I m sure So Jasper ran up to his room and pretty soon he came back with his portfolio You did bring it after all exclaimed Polly in satisfaction patting the brown leather cover Oh how nice of you Jasper as they ran over and ensconced themselves in a cosey corner I took out the worst ones said Jasper with a laugh And I m awfully sorry I didn t leave behind more of the others I hope you brought that woman with a basket of vegetables we saw at the market the other day said Polly as he opened the portfolio Do tell me Jasper you did bring that didn t you beginning to fumble through the pile Yes I did Polly said Jasper she s in there all safe and sound So for the next hour there was great turning over and comparing of sketches and much talk about vertical lines and graceful curves and shading and perspective and expression and dear knows what all as the three heads bent over the portfolio So intent were they all that no one heard Grandpapa come in and he sat there in a farther corner for a good quarter of an hour At last Polly looked up and saw him Oh Grandpapa she cried flying off from the group and carrying Adela s sketch in her hand Just see what a perfectly beautiful picture of Phronsie Adela Gray made it She draws splendidly Grandpapa Old mister King took the little sketch and fairly beamed at it It s very like it is excellent he declared caring nothing for its merits as a drawing but only seeing Phronsie as she sat with the big Marken baby in her lap on the stubbly bank Isn t it Grandpapa cried Polly overflowing with happiness and she has given it to me Grandpapa Oh isn t she good She is indeed assented old mister King just as well pleased as Polly A very good girl indeed Come here Adela Adela whose sharp ears had caught most of this dialogue at the other end of the room although Jasper was keeping a steady fire of talk to drown it if possible was looking in dismay at him O dear me I wish they d stop she breathed in distress I thought you said you had no ear said Jasper laughing at her face I can t tell music notes she said but I can hear things Yes I should think you could he said And then came old mister King s Come here Adela so she had to go across the room shaking every step of the way and stand in front of him I didn t know we had such a good little artist among us said Grandpapa wonderfully well pleased and smiling kindly at her That is nothing said Adela in despair at ever stopping the flow of praise I spoiled it and I m going to do Polly a better one Nothing could be better my dear said Grandpapa blandly it is a fine likeness of Phronsie And then he questioned her as to her training in the art and what she meant to do in the future and where she intended to study and all that getting an immense amount of information so artfully that Adela never for an instant suspected his reason All the time he was holding the sketch of Phronsie in his hand and intently gazing on it most of the time Well he said at last I won t keep you young people any longer for Jasper had thrown down the portfolio and joined the group so run back to your own corner Dear me pulling out his watch it s only twenty minutes to luncheon How time does fly to be sure To morrow morning remember we are off for Antwerp O dear dear exclaimed Polly as they ran back and bent over the portfolio again we haven t half seen Amsterdam Jasper No and you wouldn t if you stayed a year observed Jasper wisely We must go over to the Ryks Museum once more said Polly Yes let us go there directly after luncheon proposed Jasper I know what you want to do Polly sit in front of The Night Watch again Yes I do said Polly I couldn t go away without seeing that picture once more Jasper I don t like that Night Watch said Adela it s too dark and too smutty I don t see why people like it so much Well I do like it very much reiterated Polly I know it s dreadfully dark but the people in front seem to be stepping right out of the shadows and to be alive It seems to me they are just going to come right up toward me as I sit there And that after all I suppose is the best thing one can say of a picture said Jasper And it is always the finest time to look at that picture in the afternoon you know so we will go there Polly after luncheon And then Phronsie will want to see that picture of a woman with a cat I suppose said Polly Dear me who was it that painted that Jasper I never can remember the artists names Metsu was it Jan no Gabriel Metsu answered Jasper wrinkling his brows Neither can I remember all those fellows names Yes indeed you ll find Phronsie won t let us go there without paying respects to her special picture And then I suppose Grandpapa will take us for a last drive in Vondel Park Oh what nice times we have had Jasper King exclaimed Polly leaning back against the sofa and clasping her hands restfully I just love Amsterdam And I hate to leave it So you said about The Hague Polly observed Jasper turning to her with a little laugh Well wasn t it perfectly beautiful asked Polly flying up straight again Just think of that dear House in the Wood Jasper I know it you wanted to go there day after day laughed Jasper Why we only went there three times said Polly I m sure Jasper And the picture gallery That is in the Maurit rit whatever is the rest of it Oh I know said Jasper guilty of interrupting Mauritshuis that is where the picture gallery is Polly Yes that s it echoed Polly it s fine Paul Potter s Bull is there Oh I want to see that picture very much exclaimed Adela I ve never been to The Hague Well you ll go perhaps sometime said Polly with an uncomfortable feeling that she ought not to enjoy the things that Adela hadn t seen And you are going to Antwerp with us to morrow anyway she added brightening up Yes said Adela Grandmamma is really going there But that s all for we go straight over to England then and I sha n t see you ever again Polly Pepper she finished gloomily And that evening Grandpapa sat down by little old missus Gray in the parlour after dinner and though he began about something as far distant as possible before long he was talking about Adela and her wonderful talent And the most surprising thing about it all was that the little old lady not intending to do it in the least nor really comprehending how much she was telling soon had him informed on all that he had set his heart on learning how Adela had just been taken from the Paris school because the little fortune her father had left had somehow shrunk up and there was no more money to keep her there I can t tell how it is sir she mourned raising her faded eyes under the widow s cap to the kind old face above her I thought there was enough to educate my grandchild it wasn t a big sum but I supposed it was quite sufficient but now it appears to be almost gone and I have only just enough to keep me She didn t add that the curate her husband when he crept into his grave in the English churchyard had left her nothing but the memory of his good name her small means coming as a legacy from some of his grateful friends they too long since dead Old mister King made no comment only passed on with a few little leading remarks when the information seemed to be on the wane And then he said he thought he would like a game of backgammon and he challenged the parson to come on and be beaten And at an early hour the party broke up For remember said Grandpapa for about the fiftieth time that day it s Antwerp to morrow So it was at Antwerp that the whole splendid business was concluded And when the story of it came out there was a regular jubilee all around For were not Adela and Adela s grandmother going with the King party around a bit more on the continent and then off to Paris again and back to the beloved school Grandpapa s gift to the girl with the talent to keep it alive And the little widow stunned at first by the magnitude of the gift could do nothing but feebly protest Oh no sir and put up both shaking hands to ward off the benefaction It s your duty Madam said mister King sternly at which she shrank down farther in her chair Who knows what such talent will do in the world and it s my duty to see that it is kept alive nothing more nor less than a question of duty He stamped up and down the room vehemently and the little old lady protesting that she wanted to do her duty she was sure she always did the hardest part was over and old mister King chuckled to himself triumphantly And now cried Polly in a transport when the first surprise was over and everybody had settled down to the quiet enjoyment of it all we ve really and truly got a celebrated artist all to ourselves and she drew herself up in pride I m not celebrated yet said Adela with two little red spots on her cheeks and with happy eyes on her grandmother You had better wait till I am Oh well you will be said Polly confidently sometime and then we can say yes we knew her when she was a girl and we ll go to picture galleries the same as we do here and see your name stuck up in the corners of the very best ones Adela XVI LET US FLY AT THOSE BOOKS Now Polly in Antwerp said Jasper we can see Rubens to perfection Won t we just revel in his paintings though Won t we ejaculated Polly I m so glad Grandpapa came here to this hotel She leaned out of the window as she spoke Under the very eaves of the Cathedral almost isn t it said Jasper in satisfaction The chimes just then pealed out Indeed it seemed as if they did nothing but ring so short were the intervals But to Polly and Jasper they brought only echoes of delight There are forty of those bells aren t there asked Polly resting her elbows on the window sill I believe so answered Jasper absently Polly looked at him curiously Polly he said abruptly do you know what I mean to do No said Polly tell me do Jasper Well I mean to sit right down and finish my book I m ashamed to confess that it s not up to date Neither is mine confessed Polly Well now that won t do said Jasper decidedly You see if we once let those books get behindhand we re lost We never can catch up in all this world We ve had so much to do and to see began Polly That won t be any excuse that will amount to anything said Jasper shaking his head Let s fly at them and tackle them now Polly I say so too she cried and deserting the window they surrounded the centre table and soon had the big journals photographs and pictures of every sort and size the ink bottle and library paste scissors and all the rest of the paraphernalia spread out on it It s good that Grandpapa is lying down and doesn t wish to go out remarked Polly snipping away at a fearful rate and pausing only to write down the dates and other bits of information around each picture as she pasted it in Now we ll have all this morning to finish these books up to to day And none too much for the job said Jasper sagely I declare I shall feel like enjoying myself twice as well when once they re up to date They ve been hanging round my conscience every day since I slackened work on them And I am so glad you made me come away from that window and set to work said Polly or I never would have commenced on mine to day Oh yes you would I think Polly said Jasper Well we are at it now and that s enough Now says I I m on book No two And he flapped down the cover of the completed one That s done thank fortune Oh Jasper have you the green one done asked Polly Why I have three more pages of mine to do Well you ll catch up on the red one I dare say said Jasper opening No two We are getting on famously aren t we Polly glancing over at her work Yes and I m so glad you proposed this way to keep a journal said Polly to have them labelled My Notes on My European Journey and to have No one green and No two red and so on all through the rest of the colours That will help us to find them in a hurry said Jasper and keep them distinct but I didn t propose it Polly about the books It was your plan as much as mine No Polly was guilty of contradicting I never should have thought of having the books of different colours and labelling them in that way Jasper Well you first thought of cutting out pictures and all sorts of items and then writing the dates and whatever else we wanted to around the pictures said Jasper I m sure that s more important than the title of the book Polly Well won t the boys love to see them asked Polly suddenly with a light in her eyes ignoring the question as to her claim to the idea when we get home Jasper Won t they though he responded falling to work with a will And so Antwerp was entered with clear consciences as to journals and a strict determination not to fall behind again on them But Polly slipped in so many of the beautiful photographs of the Descent from the Cross and the other two famous pictures by Rubens that her red book was closed the third day of their stay in the old town of Antwerp and the photographs had even overflowed into the yellow book No three They had a habit most of their party of dropping into the Cathedral once a day at least usually in the morning and sometimes before service And then when it was quiet and before the ordinary throng of sight seers trailed through Jasper would hire some chairs of one of the old women who always seem to be part and parcel of European cathedrals and they would sit down before the painting its wings spread over the dingy green background and study what has made so many countless travellers take long and oftentimes wearisome journeys to see And Polly always wanted to go after that to see the Assumption which is the altar piece and then the Elevation of the Cross both by Rubens And I am sure Grandpapa she would always say I like them as well as I do the famous painting And so do I Polly in a way Grandpapa would invariably reply They are all marvellous and that is all we can say for no expressions could give the truth about them After the Cathedral which they loved all the more for being perched under its eaves as Polly always said when speaking of the hotel that was for the time being their home Polly and Jasper set next in their regard the Musee Plantin Moretus They were never tired of running down there to the Marche du Vendredi until it became a regular question every day at dinner Well what more have you discovered at the Musee Plantin And old mister King would often answer for he was as interested as the young people Marvellous things And then he would expatiate on the antique furniture the paintings engravings and tapestries till the little doctor fresh from his hospital visitations would remark that it was just as good as if he had time to visit the place to hear Grandpapa tell it all And Adela would bring out her little sketches which now she was not averse to showing since everybody was so kind and sympathising and there would be some little nook or corner of corridor or court that Polly would fall upon and pronounce Just perfect and how did you get it Oh I just drew a bit now and then when you were looking at things said Adela carelessly Everything just dances off your pencil said Polly wishing she could draw and wondering if it was any use for her to try to learn And every afternoon they would go to drive as usual very often around the docks which gave them all a good idea of this wonderful port They were never tired of watching the hydraulic cranes of inspecting the dry docks the intertwining railways by which all the docks large and small are connected and the two basins Le Petit and Le Grand Bassin Dear me exclaimed Jasper on one of these occasions I thought Amsterdam docks were huge affairs but Antwerp And he left his sentence in mid air which was more impressive after all But Parson Henderson liked the church of saint Jacques best of all things in Antwerp and he used to steal away mornings to go there again and again And he asked Polly and Jasper to go there with him one day and Polly begged to have Adela go too and they all came home as enthusiastic as he was And then suddenly mister King would wrench them all off from this delightful study and put his foot down peremptorily No more cathedrals for a time he would declare my old head cannot carry any more just yet And he would propose a little in letting of fun And then off they would go a shopping or to the Zoological Gardens and they always had concerts of course wherever they were for Polly and Jasper s sakes if for no other reason And by and by somebody announced one fine morning that they had been in Antwerp a fortnight And then one day Mother Fisher looked into Polly s brown eyes and finding them tired she calmly tucked Polly quietly in bed Why Mamsie declared Polly I m not sick No and I m not going to have you be observed missus Fisher sensibly This running about sight seeing is more tiresome child than you think for and dreadfully unsettling unless you stop to rest a bit No Jasper as he knocked at the door Polly can t go out to day at least not this morning I ve put her to bed Is Polly sick missus Fisher called Jasper in great concern No not a bit answered missus Fisher cheerily but she s tired I ve seen it coming on for two or three days back so I m going to take it in time And can t she come out to day asked Jasper dreadfully disappointed with a mind full of the host of fine things they had planned to do No Jasper said Mother Fisher firmly not to jaunt about So Jasper took himself off feeling sure despite his disappointment that Polly s mother was right And there was another person who wholly agreed with Mother Fisher and that was old mister King If you can stop those young folks from killing themselves running about to see everything you ll do more than I can missus Fisher he observed It makes no difference how long I plan to stay in a town so as to do it restfully if they won t rest That is a fact said Mother Fisher Well that s my part to see that they do rest I don t envy you the job said the old gentleman drily Polly fidgeted and turned on her pillow knowing Mamsie was right but unable to keep from thinking of the many beautiful plans that Jasper and she had formed for that very morning till her head spun round and round I can t get to sleep she said at last Don t try to said her mother dropping the heavy wool curtains till the room was quite dark that s the worst thing in the world to do if you want to rest Just lie still and don t try to think of anything But I can t help thinking said poor Polly feeling sure that Jasper was dreadfully disappointed at the upsetting of all the plans Never say you can t help anything Polly said her mother coming over to the bedside to lay a cool hand on Polly s hot forehead and then to drop a kiss there and somehow the kiss did what all Polly s trying had failed to accomplish That s good Mamsie she said gratefully and drew a long restful breath Mother Fisher went out and closed the door softly It was just three o clock that afternoon when Polly woke up Oh I m dreadfully ashamed she exclaimed when she found it out I ve slept almost this whole day Mother Fisher smiled And it s the best day s work you ve done in one long while Polly she said And here s my girl Polly cried Grandpapa when she ran down to him and holding her at arm s length he gazed into her bright eyes and on her rosy cheeks Well well your mother s a clever woman and no mistake So Polly knew if she didn t take care and not get tired again she would be tucked into bed another fine day It was a long summer morning and they were sailing up the Rhine with the delights of Brussels and Cologne behind them and in between the covers of the purple book No four Polly had been looking at ruined castles and fortresses at vine clad terraces and chalets until she turned to Grandpapa with a sigh Tired Polly little woman he said cuddling her up against him No not tired Grandpapa said Polly but oh there s so very much of it over here in Europe If you ve found that out you ve learned the lesson early said old mister King with a laugh As many times as I ve been over here there s nothing that surprises me so much as the presumption with which we travellers all rush about expecting to compass all there is But we ought to see everything said Polly oughtn t we Grandpapa when we ve come so far to see it and she looked troubled There s just where you are wrong Polly child said old mister King And this ought to see why it s an old dragon Polly lying in wait to destroy Don t you let it get hold of you but take my advice and see only what you can make your own and remember Then you ve got it XVII POLLY WROTE A NICE LITTLE NOTE Polly said Jasper running down the stairs after her on her way to the little garden on the terrace at Heidelberg here s something for you just came in the mail For me said Polly as he put a little parcel in her hand Yes said Jasper father just gave it to me What can it be cried Polly wonderingly oh something from Alexia or one of the other girls most likely and she tore off the outer wrapper It is registered said Jasper and mister Henderson got it out for you father said that can t be from one of the girls Polly as the next layer of paper dropping off disclosed the name of one of the biggest of big London jewellers across a wooden box What can it be gasped Polly tugging at the cover Here let me Jasper essayed to open it but it stuck fast in the slide Another pull and a little red leather case appeared in view What in the world began Polly oh it can t be for me and she stood staring at it without any attempt to take it out It must be for you Polly said Jasper There couldn t be any other Miss Mary Pepper and besides it is addressed to father s care and comes through our bankers see here He stooped and picked up the outer wrapper it was torn almost in two but the name and address was all there So Polly lifted out the little red leather case still feeling very much as if she were opening a parcel belonging to some one else and touching a spring at the end the top flew up and there on a white satin bed lay a little green enamelled watch set with diamonds O dear me exclaimed Polly tumbling back in the utmost distress now I have got some one else s box Jasper How very dreadful Let us go to father said Jasper feeling this quite beyond him Shut the box up tight Polly it might tumble out on the way You carry it do Jasper begged Polly with an eye askance at the little case and snapping the cover down she set it in his hand All right now then said Jasper We must carry these papers and wooden box and the whole business Don t worry Polly seeing her face father will straighten it out Give me the wrapper Jasper and the wooden box if only you ll take the other said Polly feeling very much depressed at coming into possession of other people s property and Jasper followed with the little enamelled watch And Grandpapa was just as much astounded as was Polly herself and all the family congregating in Mother Fisher s room the little watch was handed about from one to the other and everybody stared at everybody else and the mystery thickened every moment And the strangest thing about it was that no one opened the little back cover where any one might have read Polly Pepper from her grateful friend Arthur Selwyn until the middle of the night when Jasper was awakened by a noise as if some one were prowling around in his father s room He started up and listened It s I said old mister King s voice So Jasper threw on his wrapper and hurried in There sat his father in dressing gown and slippers by the table with the little enamelled watch in his hand Of all the idiots Jasper he exclaimed your father is the very worst I ve only just this moment thought to look in here He flashed the little watch around in Jasper s face it was now opened at the back Dear me cried Jasper for want of anything better to say as he read the inscription Then he looked helplessly at his father Earl or no earl this piece of foolishness goes back fumed old mister King getting out of his chair and beginning to march back and forth across the floor as he always did when irritated Yes sir the very first thing in the morning he repeated as vehemently as if Jasper had contradicted him But father began the boy Yes sir it goes back I tell you repeated his father now well wrought up to a passion What right has he to send such a piece of foolishness to my Polly Pepper I can give her all the watches she needs And this trumpery pointing to the jewelled gift still lying in Jasper s hand is utterly unfit for a schoolgirl You know that yourself Jasper But Polly was kind to him began Jasper again Kind to him snorted his father don t I know that Of course she was Polly Pepper would be kind to any one But that s no reason why the old idiot should presume to give her such a silly and expensive present as that The man doesn t know anything who would do such a thing And this one is queerer than the average As you say he is eccentric observed Jasper seeing here a loophole by which to get in a soothing word Eccentric That s a mild way to put it fumed his father He s odder than Dick s hatband Heaven save Old England if many of her earls are like him Well I shall just write the fellow a decent sort of a note and then I ll pack the box off to him and that ll be the end of the matter I m afraid Polly will be sorry said Jasper feeling at a standstill so far as finding the right word was concerned for everything he uttered only seemed to make matters worse So he said the best thing he could think of and stopped short Sorry Old mister King came to a dead stop and glared at him You can t mean that Polly Pepper would like me to keep that watch It s the last thing on earth that she would want such a gewgaw as that Why the child hates the sight of it already as much as I do I don t think Polly would want the watch said Jasper quickly I know she doesn t like it and I m sure I wish I could smash it myself he added in a burst That s the most sensible thing you ve said yet Jasper said his father with a grim smile But she would feel dreadfully for you to send it back for don t you see father that would hurt his feelings And Polly would worry awfully to have that happen Old mister King turned uneasily took a few steps then came back to throw himself into his chair again And this old gentleman has such ill attacks said Jasper pursuing his advantage that it might be the very thing to bring one on if he should get that watch back Say no more say no more Jasper said his father shortly put this thing up for tonight and then get back to bed again And Jasper knew that was the end of it And the next day Polly wrote a nice little note thanking the old earl for his gift and hoping that he was quite well and with so many other pleasant things in it that if she could have seen him when he received it she would have been glad indeed And then she handed the little red leather case to mister King Keep it for me Grandpapa she said simply All right Polly my child he said And then everybody forgot all about the episode and proceeded to enjoy Heidelberg I m so sorry for people who are not going to Bayreuth Adela exclaimed Polly looking out of the compartment window as the train steamed rapidly on from Nuremberg where they had passed several days of delight revelling in the old town Adela with her mind more on those past delights had less attention for thoughts of music so she answered absently Yes Oh Polly wasn t that Pentagonal Tower fine What is it they call it in German But Polly didn t hear being absorbed in the Wagner festival of which her mind was full so Jasper answered for her Alt Nuenberg you mean the oldest building of all Nuremberg Yes said Adela well I got two or three sketches of that tower Did you cried Jasper now that s good And I got that horrible old robber knight what s his name sitting inside his cell you know Eppelein von Gallingen supplied Jasper Well he was a horrible looking customer and that s a fact Oh I liked him said Adela who rejoiced in ugly things if only picturesque and I got into one corner of the cell opposite him so as to sketch it all as well as I could in such a dark place and a lady came down the little stairs you remember them I rather think I do said Jasper grimly I was trying to get out of the way of a huge party of tourists and I nearly broke my neck Well this lady came down the stairs I could see her where I sat but she couldn t see me it was so dark in the cell and she called to her husband I guess he was her husband because he looked so triste Adela often fell into French from being so long at the Paris school and not from affectation in the least And she said Come Henry let us see what is in there And she took one step in and peered into that robber knight s face you know how he is sitting on a little stool his black hair all round his face staring at one Yes I do said Jasper he was uncanny enough and in the darkness his wax features or whatever they were made of were unpleasantly natural to the last degree Well said Adela the lady gave a little squeal and tumbled right back into her husband s arms And I guess she stepped on his toes for he squealed too though in a different way and he gave her a little push and told her not to be a goose that the man had been dead a thousand years more or less and couldn t hurt her So then she stepped back awfully scared though I could see that and then she caught sight of me and she squealed again and jumped and she screamed right out Oh there s another in there in the corner and it glared at me And I didn t glare at all finished Adela in disdain And then I guess he was scared too for he said That old cell isn t worth seeing anyway and I m going down into the torture chamber and they hurried off That torture chamber exclaimed Jasper how any one can hang over those things I don t see for my part I d rather have my time somewhere else Oh I like them said Adela in great satisfaction and I ve got a picture of the Iron Virgin That was a good idea to put the old scold into that wooden tub concern said Jasper there was some sense in that I took a picture of it and the old tower itself I got a splendid photograph of it if it will only develop well he added Oh but the buildings was ever anything so fine as those old Nuremberg houses with their high peaked gables I have quantities of them thanks to my kodak What s this station I wonder asked Polly as the train slowed up Two ladies on the platform made a sudden dash at their compartment All full said the guard waving them off That was Fanny Vanderburgh gasped Polly And her mother added Jasper Who was it demanded old mister King His consternation when they told him was so great that Jasper racked his brains some way to avoid the meeting If once we were at Bayreuth it s possible that we might not come across them father for we could easily be lost in the crowd No such good luck groaned old mister King which was proved true For the first persons who walked into the hotel as the manager was giving directions that the rooms reserved for their party should be shown them were missus Vanderburgh and her daughter Oh exclaimed missus Vanderburgh as if her dearest friends were before her how glad I am to see you again dear mister King and you all She swept missus Fisher and missus Henderson lightly in her glance as if toleration only were to be observed toward them We have been perfectly desolee without you Polly my dear she went on with a charming smile Fanny will be happy once more She has been disconsolate ever since we parted I assure you Polly made some sort of a reply and greeted Fanny as of old times on the steamer but missus Vanderburgh went on all smiles and eagerness so rapidly in her friendly intentions that it boded ill for the future peace of mister King s party So mister King broke into the torrent of words at once without any more scruple And now missus Vanderburgh if you will excuse us we are quite tired and are going to our rooms And he bowed himself off and of course his family followed the next moment Fanny and her mother were alone If this is to be the way said missus Vanderburgh with a savage little laugh we might much better have stayed in Paris for I never should have thought as you know Fanny of coming to this out of the way place seeing that I don t care for the music if I hadn t heard them say on the steamer that this was their date here Well I wish that I was at home declared Fanny passionately and I never never will come to Europe Mamma again as long as I live You are always chasing after people who run away from you and those who like me you won t let me speak to Well I shall be thankful for the day when you are once in society said her mother every shred of self control now gone and I shall sell my tickets for this old Wagner festival and go back to Paris to morrow morning At that Fanny broke into a dismal fit of complaining which continued all the time they were dressing for dinner and getting settled in their room and then at intervals through that meal Polly looked over at her gloomy face three tables off and her own fell You are not eating anything child said Grandpapa presently with a keen glance at her Let me order something more Oh no Grandpapa and yes I will she cried incoherently making a great effort to enjoy the nice things he piled on her plate Jasper followed her glance as it rested on the Vanderburgh table They will spoil everything he thought And to think it should happen at Bayreuth Yes we are going said Fanny Vanderburgh as they met after dinner in the corridor Her eyes were swollen and she twisted her handkerchief in her fingers And I did did did here she broke down and sobbed so want to hear the Wagner operas Don t cry begged Polly quite shocked Oh Fanny why can t you stay How very dreadful to lose the Wagner music Polly could think of no worse calamity that could befall one Mamma doesn t know anybody here except your party mumbled Fanny and she s upset and declares that we must go back to Paris to morrow Oh Polly Pepper I hate Paris she exploded And then sobbed worse than ever Wait here said Polly till I come back Then she ran on light feet to Grandpapa just settling behind a newspaper in a corner of the general reading room Grandpapa dear may I speak to you a minute asked Polly with a woful feeling at her heart It seemed as if he must hear it beating Why yes child to be sure said mister King quite surprised at her manner What is it and he laid aside his paper and smiled reassuringly But Polly s heart sank worse than ever Grandpapa she began desperately Fanny Vanderburgh is feeling dreadfully And I should think she would with such a mother exclaimed the old gentleman but in a guarded tone Well what of it Polly Grandpapa said Polly she says her mother is going to take her back to Paris tomorrow morning How very fine exclaimed mister King approvingly that is the best thing I have heard yet Always bring me such good news Polly and I will lay down my newspapers willingly any time And he gave a pleased little laugh But Grandpapa and Polly s face drooped and there was such a sad little note in her voice that the laugh dropped out of his Fanny wanted above all things to hear the Wagner operas just think of losing those Polly clasped her hands and every bit of colour flew from her cheek Well what can I do about it asked the old gentleman in a great state of perturbation Speak out child and tell me what you want Only if I can be pleasant to Fanny said Polly a wave of colour rushing over her face I mean if I may go with her Can I Grandpapa this very evening just as if she hesitated As if what Polly As if we all liked them finished Polly feeling as if the words must be said There was an awful pause in which Polly had all she could do to keep from rushing from the room Then Grandpapa said If you can stand it Polly you may do as you like but I warn you to keep them away from me And he went back to his paper XVIII BAYREUTH AND OLD FRIENDS Jasper turned around to gaze at the vast audience filing into the Wagner Opera House before he took his seat This makes me think of Oberammergau Polly he said To think you ve seen the Passion Play she cried with glowing cheeks That was when I was such a little chap said Jasper ages ago nine years Polly Pepper just think so it will be as good as new next year Father is thinking a good deal of taking you there next summer Jasper cried Polly her cheeks all in a glow and regardless of next neighbours what can I ever do to repay your father for being so very good to me and to all of us Why you can keep on making him comfortable just as you are doing now Polly replied Jasper He said yesterday it made him grow younger every minute to look at you And you know he s never sick now and he was always having those bad attacks Don t you remember when we first came to Hingham Polly as they took their seats O dear me I guess I do Jasper and how you saved Phronsie from being carried off by the big organ man and she shivered even now at this lapse of years And all the splendid times at Badgertown and the little brown Just then a long hand came in between the people in the seat back of them I m no end glad to see you exclaimed a voice It was Tom Selwyn I m going over into that vacant seat Tom forgot his fear of Polly and his hatred of girls generally and rushed around the aisle to plunge awkwardly into the seat just back of Jasper I ll stay here till the person comes His long arms came in contact with several obstacles such as sundry backs and shoulders in his progress but he had no time to consider such small things or to notice the black looks he got in consequence Now isn t this jolly he exclaimed Jasper was guilty of staring at him there seemed such a change in the boy he could hardly believe it was really and truly Tom Selwyn My grandfather is well now and he would have sent some message to you if he knew I was to run across you went on Tom looking at Jasper but meaning Polly did you get a little trifle he sent you some weeks ago He s been in a funk about it because he didn t hear Wasn t Polly glad that her little note was on the way and perhaps in the old gentleman s hands at this very time Yes she said and he was very kind and Tom fumbled his tickets all the while and broke in abruptly I didn t know as you d like it but it made him sick not to do it and so the thing went Glad it didn t make you mad he ended suddenly He meant it all right I m sure said Jasper seeing that Polly couldn t speak Didn t he though exclaimed Tom And it didn t come till the day we left Heidelberg said Polly finding her tongue and speaking rapidly to explain the delay that was a week ago Whew whistled Tom oh beg pardon for several people turned around and stared so he ducked his head and was mostly lost to view for a breathing space When he thought they had forgotten him he bobbed it up Why Grandfather picked it out had a bushel of things sent up from London to choose from you know weeks and weeks ago as soon as he got up to London That s no end queer No said Polly it didn t come till then And I wrote to your grandfather the next morning and thanked him Now you did exclaimed Tom in huge delight and slapping his knee with one long hand That s no end good of you He couldn t conceal how glad he was and grinned all over his face At this moment missus Vanderburgh who seeing Fanny so happy again concluded to stay on the strength of resurrected hopes of Polly Pepper s friendship sailed into the opera house with her daughter And glancing across the aisle for their seats were at the side she caught sight of the party she was looking for and there was a face she knew but wasn t looking for Fanny she cried clutching her arm there is Tom Selwyn Well now we are in luck And Tom saw her and again he ducked but for a different reason When he raised his head he glanced cautiously in the direction he dreaded There s that horrible person he whispered in Jasper s ear Who asked Jasper in astonishment That woman on the steamer you knew her and she was looking straight at us Duck for your life Jasper King Oh that said Jasper coolly following the bob of his head Yes missus Vanderburgh I know and she is at our hotel The dickens And you re alive Tom raised his head and regarded him as a curiosity Very much so answered Jasper smothering a laugh well we mustn t talk any more Polly was sitting straight her hands folded in her lap with no thought for audience or anything but what she was to see and hear on that wonderful stage Old mister King leaned past Parson Henderson and gazed with the greatest satisfaction at her absorbed face I pity anybody he said to himself who hasn t some little Peppers to take about I only wish I had the boys too But fancy Joel listening to Parsifal This idea completely overcame him and he settled back into his seat with a grim smile Polly never knew that Mamsie with a happy look in her black eyes was regarding her intently too nor that many a glance was given to the young girl whose colour came and went in her cheek nor that Jasper sometimes spoke a low word or two She was lost in the entrancing world of mystery and legend borne upward by the grand music and she scarcely moved Well Polly Old mister King was smiling at her and holding out his hand The curtains had closed for the intermission and all the people were getting out of their chairs Polly sat still and drew a long breath Oh Grandpapa must we go Yes indeed I hope so answered mister King with a little laugh We shall have none too much time for our supper Polly as it is Polly got out of her seat very much wishing that supper was not one of the needful things of life It almost seems wicked to think of eating Jasper she said as they picked up their hats and capes where he had tucked them under the seats It would be more wicked not to eat said Jasper with a little laugh and I think you ll find some supper tastes good when we get fairly at it Polly I suppose so said Polly feeling dreadfully stiff in her feet and beginning to wish she could have a good run And what we should do with you if we didn t stop for supper observed Jasper snapping the case to the opera glasses I m sure I don t know Polly I spoke to you three times and you didn t hear me once Oh Jasper exclaimed Polly in horror pausing as she was pinning on her big flowered hat with the roses all around the brim O dear me there it goes as the hat spun over into the next row I ll get it cried Tom Selwyn vaulting over the tops of the seats before Jasper had a chance to try for it Just then missus Vanderburgh who hadn t heard any more of the opera than could fit itself into her lively plans for the campaign she laid out to accomplish in siege of Tom Selwyn pushed and elbowed herself along Of course the earl isn t here and the boy is alone and dreadfully taken with Jasper King so I can manage him And once getting him I ll soon have the earl to recognise me as a relation Then oh visions of the golden dream of bliss when she could visit such titled kin in Old England and report it all when at home in New York filled her head And with her mind eaten up with it she pushed rudely by a plain somewhat dowdy looking woman who obstructed her way The woman raised a quiet yet protesting face but missus Vanderburgh related to an earl surveyed her haughtily and pressed on Excuse me said the plain looking woman but it is impossible for me to move the people are coming out this way Madam and And I must get by answered missus Vanderburgh interrupting and wriggling past as well as she could But the lace on her flowing sleeve catching on the umbrella handle of a stout German coming the other way she tore it half across A dark flush of anger rushed over her face and she vented all her spite on the plain looking person in her path If you had moved this wouldn t have happened she exclaimed It was impossible for me to do so replied the woman just as quietly as ever Just then Tom Selwyn rushed up Mother to the plain looking woman well we did get separated Oh and seeing her companion he plunged back Fanny Vanderburgh well in the rear a party of young German girls impeding the way felt her mother s grasp and looked around Oh you ve torn your lace sleeve she exclaimed supposing the black looks referred to that accident Torn my sleeve echoed her mother irately that s a trifle while Fanny stared in surprise knowing by past experience that much lesser accidents had made black days for her I m the unluckiest person alive And think of all the money your father has given me to spend and it won t do any good Fanny I m going straight back to Paris as quickly as possible Why I m having a good time now said Fanny just beginning to enjoy herself Polly Pepper is real nice to me I don t want to go home a bit All this as they slowly filed out in the throng Well you re going and oh those Peppers and those Kings I m sick to death of their names muttered her mother frowning on her Why can t we wait for Polly asked Fanny not catching the last words and pausing to look back Because you can t that s why And never say a word about that Polly Pepper or any of the rest of that crowd commanded her mother trying to hurry on Polly Pepper is the sweetest girl the very dearest declared Fanny in a passion over her mother s shoulder and you know it Mamma Well I won t have you going with her anyway nor with any of them answered her mother shortly Because you can t echoed Fanny in her turn and with a malicious little laugh Don t I know it s the same old story those you chase after run away from you You ve been chasing Mamma you needn t tell me Oh Jasper Polly was saying did you really speak to me Three times said Jasper with a laugh but you couldn t answer for you didn t hear me No said Polly I didn t Jasper And I shouldn t have spoken for it isn t of course allowed But I couldn t help it Polly it was so splendid and his eyes kindled And you didn t seem to breathe or to move I don t feel as if I had done much of either said Polly laughing Isn t it good to take a long stretch And oh don t you wish we could run Jasper He burst into another gay little laugh as he picked up the rest of the things I thought so Polly and you ll want some supper yet Well here is Tom coming back again Indeed I shall and a big one Jasper said Polly laughing for I am dreadfully hungry Come to supper with us Jasper said socially over the backs of several people in response to Tom Selwyn s furious telegraphing Can t said Tom bobbing his head must stay with my mother Thought you never would turn around Jasper looked his surprise and involuntarily glanced by Tom Yes my mother s here we ve got separated she s gone ahead said Tom jerking his head toward the nearest exit She says we ll go and see you Where Hotel Sonne said Jasper Tom disappeared rushed off to his mother to jerk himself away to a convenient waiting place till the disagreeable woman on the steamer had melted into space Then he flew back and in incoherent sentences made missus Selwyn comprehend who she was and the whole situation The earl s daughter was a true British matron and preserved a quiet immovable countenance only a grim smile passed over it now and then At last she remarked coolly as if commenting on the weather I don t believe she will trouble you my son Never a word about the lace episode or the crowding process Tom sniffed uneasily You haven t crossed on a steamer with her mother Never you mind missus Selwyn gave him a pat on the back Tom let us talk about those nice people as they filed slowly out with the crowd Not a word did Tom lisp about the invitation to supper but tucked his mother s arm loyally within his own Sorry I forgot to engage a table he exclaimed as they entered the restaurant Why there is Tom exclaimed Jasper craning his neck as his party were about to sit down Father Tom Selwyn is here with his mother and they can t find places I almost know and we might have two more chairs easily at our table he hurried it all out What is all this about demanded old mister King whom are you talking about pray tell Jasper So Jasper ran around to his father s chair and explained The end of it all was that he soon hurried off being introduced to Tom s mother to whom he presented his father s compliments and would she do him the favour to join their party And in ten minutes every one felt well acquainted with the English matron and entirely forgot that she was an earl s daughter And Tom acquitted himself well and got on famously with old mister King But he didn t dare talk to Polly but edged away whenever there was the least chance of matters falling out so that he would have to And then it came out that the Selwyns thought of going to Munich and down to Lucerne And the Bernese Alps put in Jasper across the table How is that Tom for an outing Can t you do it For it transpired that missus Selwyn had left the other children two girls and two smaller boys with their grandfather on the English estate They all called this place home since the father was in a business in Australia that required many long visits and Tom s mother had decided that he should have a bit of a vacation with her so they had packed up and off taking in the Wagner festival first and here they were Yes after she considered a bit we can do that Join the party and then over to Lucerne and perhaps take in the Bernese Alps Only supposing that Polly s letter hadn t gone to the little old earl Jasper kept saying over and over to himself Just for one minute suppose it And in the midst of it all the horn sounded the intermission was over chairs were pushed back hastily and all flocked off No one must be late and there must be no noisy or bustling entrances into the opera house And if Polly Pepper sat entranced through the rest of the matchless performance Tom Selwyn three seats back and off to the left was just as quietly happy But he wasn t thinking so much of Parsifal as might have been possible It s no end fine of the little mother to say yes he kept running over and over to himself with a satisfied glance at the quiet face under the plain English bonnet It s funny we don t see Fanny Vanderburgh anywhere said Polly as they went through the corridor and up the hotel stairs that night She and her mother probably came home earlier said missus Fisher you know we were delayed waiting for our carriages You will see her in the morning Polly But in the morning it was ten o clock before mister King s party gathered for breakfast for Grandpapa always counselled sleeping late when out the night before And when Polly did slip into her chair there was a little note lying on her plate Fanny Vanderburgh has gone she said and turned quite pale It was too true missus Vanderburgh had sold her two tickets to the Flying Dutchman to be presented that evening and departed from Bayreuth It s no use Polly Fanny s note ran trying to make me have a good time Mamma says we are to go back to Paris and go we must You ve been lovely and I thank you ever so much and good by Mother Fisher found Polly a half hour later curled up in a corner of the old sofa in her room her face pressed into the cushion Why Polly exclaimed her mother seeing the shaking shoulders and bending over her she smoothed the brown hair gently this isn t right child Polly sprang up suddenly and threw her arms around her mother s neck Her face was wet with tears and she sobbed out Oh if I d done more for her Mamsie or been pleasant to missus Vanderburgh she might have stayed You haven t any call to worry Polly child said Mother Fisher firmly You did all that could be done and remember one thing it s very wrong to trouble others as you certainly will if you give way to your feelings in this manner Mamsie exclaimed Polly suddenly wiping away the trail of tears from her cheek I won t cry a single bit more You can trust me Mamsie I truly won t Trust you said Mother Fisher with a proud look in her black eyes I can trust you ever and always Polly and now run to mister King and let him see a bright face for he s worrying about you Polly XIX mister KING HAS A LITTLE PLAN FOR POLLY Oh Jasper exclaimed Polly clasping her hands do you suppose we ll ever get to a piano where it s all alone and nobody wants to play on it But just you and I finished Jasper I declare I don t know You see we don t stay still long enough in any one place to hire a decent one and besides father said when we started that it was better for us to rest and travel about without any practising this summer You know he did Polly I know it said Polly but oh if we could just play once in a while she added mournfully Well we can t said Jasper savagely you know we tried that at Brussels when we thought everybody had gone off And those half a dozen idiots came and stared at us through the glass door And then they came in added Polly with a little shiver at the recollection But that big fat man with the black beard was the worst Jasper She glanced around as if she expected to see him coming down the long parlour Well he didn t hear much there didn t any of them said Jasper that s some small satisfaction because you hopped off the piano stool and ran away You ran just as fast I m sure Jasper said Polly with a little laugh Well perhaps I did confessed Jasper bursting into a laugh Who wouldn t run with a lot of staring idiots flying at one he brought up in disgust And we forgot the music went on Polly deep in the reminiscence and we wouldn t go back don t you remember until the big fat man with the dreadful black beard had gone for he d picked it up and been looking at it Yes I remember all about it said Jasper dear me what a time we had It s enough to make one wish that the summer was all over and that we were fairly settled in Dresden he added gloomily as he saw her face Oh no exclaimed Polly quickly and quite shocked to see the mischief that she had done We wouldn t have the beautiful summer go a bit faster Jasper Why that would be too dreadful to think of But you want to get at your music Polly I ll fly at it when the time comes cried Polly with a wise little nod never you fear Jasper Now come on let s get Phronsie and go out and see the shops Old mister King in a nook behind the curtain dropped the newspaper in his lap and thought a bit Best to wait till we get to Lucerne he said to himself nodding his white head then says I Polly my child you shall have your piano And when their party were settling down in the hotel at Lucerne ending the beautiful days of travel after leaving Munich Jasper s father called him abruptly See here my boy What is it father asked Jasper wonderingly the luggage is all right it s gone up to the rooms all except the portmanteau and Francis will go down to the station and straighten that out I m not in the least troubled in regard to the luggage Jasper replied his father testily it s something much more important than the luggage question about which I wish to speak to you Jasper stared well knowing his father s views in regard to the luggage question The first thing that you must unpack the very first old mister King was saying is your music Don t wait a minute Jasper but go and get it And then call Polly and Why father exclaimed Jasper there isn t a single place to play in You don t know how people stare if we touch the piano We can t here father there s such a crowd in this hotel You do just as I say Jasper commanded his father And tell Polly to get her music and then do you two go to the little room out of the big parlour and play to your hearts content And he burst into a hearty laugh at Jasper s face as he dangled a key at the end of a string before him Now I do believe father that you ve got Polly a piano and a little room to play in cried Jasper joyfully and pouncing on the key You go along and do as I tell you said mister King mightily pleased at the success of his little plan And don t you tell Polly Pepper one word until she has taken her music down in the little room as Jasper bounded off on the wings of the wind And in that very hotel was the big fat man with the dreadful black beard resting after a long season of hard work But Polly and Jasper wouldn t have cared had they known it as long as they had their own delightful little music room to themselves as they played over and over all the dear old pieces and Polly revelled in everything that she was so afraid she had forgotten I really haven t lost it Jasper she would exclaim radiantly after finishing a concerto and dropping her hands idly on the keys And I was so afraid I d forgotten it entirely Just think I haven t played that for three months Jasper King Well you haven t forgotten a bit of it declared Jasper just as glad as she was You didn t make any mistakes hardly Polly Oh yes I made some said Polly honestly whirling around on the piano stool to look at him Oh well only little bits of ones said Jasper those don t signify I wish father could have heard that concerto What a pity he went out just before you began it But somebody else on the other side of the partition between the little music room and the big parlour had heard and he pulled his black beard thoughtfully with his long fingers then pricked up his ears to hear more And it was funny how almost every day whenever the first notes on the piano struck up in mister King s little music room the big fat man who was so tired with his season of hard work never seemed to think that he could rest as well as in that particular corner up against that partition And no matter what book or paper he had in his hand he always dropped it and fell to pulling his black beard with his long fingers before the music was finished And then Oh Polly come child you have played long enough from Mother Fisher on the other side of the partition or old mister King would say No more practising to day Miss Polly or Phronsie would pipe out Polly Grandpapa is going to take us out on the lake do come Polly And then it was funnier yet to see how suddenly the big fat man with the dreadful black beard seemed to find that particular corner by that partition a very tiresome place And as the piano clicked down its cover he would yawn and get up and say something in very rapid German to himself and off he would go forgetting all about his book or newspaper which very likely would tumble to the floor and flap away by itself till somebody came and picked it up and set it on the sofa One morning old mister King hurrying along with his batch of English mail to enjoy opening it in the little music room where Jasper and Polly were playing a duet ran up suddenly against a fat heavy body coming around an opposite angle Oh I beg your pardon sir exclaimed mister King in great distress the more so as he saw that the stranger s glasses were knocked off his nose by the collision I do trust they are not broken he added in a concerned tone endeavouring to pick them up But the big man was before him Not a beet not a beet he declared adjusting them on his nose again Then he suddenly grasped old mister King s hand And I be very glad sir very glad indeed dat I haf roon into you Indeed exclaimed mister King releasing his hand instantly and all the concern dropping out of his face Very glad indeed repeated the big man heartily then he pulled his black beard and stood quite still a moment If you have nothing more to remark sir said mister King haughtily perhaps you will be kind enough to stand out of my way and allow me to pass And it would be as well for you to observe more care in the future sir both in regard to your feet and your tongue sir Yes I am very glad began the big man again who hadn t even heard mister King s tirade for now and he gave his black beard a final twitch and his eyes suddenly lightened with a smile that ran all over his face I can speak to you of dis ting dat is in my mind Your I want to hear nothing of what is on your mind declared old mister King now thoroughly angry Stand aside fellow and let me pass he commanded in a towering passion The big man stared in astonishment into the angry face the smile dropping out of his own I beg to ex cuse myself he said with a deep bow and a wave of his long fingers Will you pass and he moved up as tightly as possible to the wall Old mister King went into the little music room in a furious rage and half an hour afterward Polly and Jasper pausing to look around saw him tossing and tumbling his letters and newspapers about on the table fuming to himself all the while Father has had bad news exclaimed Jasper turning pale something about his agents probably O dear me and here we have been playing cried Polly in remorse every vestige of colour flying from her cheek Well we didn t know said Jasper quickly But what can we do now Polly he turned to her appealingly I don t know she was just going to say helplessly but Jasper s face made her see that something must be done Let s go and tell him we are sorry she said that s what Mamsie always liked best if she felt badly So the two crept up behind old mister King s chair Father I m so sorry and Dear Grandpapa I m so sorry and Polly put both arms around his neck suddenly Eh what cried mister King sitting bolt upright in astonishment Oh bless me children I thought you were playing on the piano We were said Polly hurrying around to the side of the table her face quite rosy now but we didn t know and she stopped short unable to find another word that you felt badly finished Jasper Oh father we didn t know that you d got bad news He laid his hand as he spoke on the pile of tumbled up letters Bad news ejaculated old mister King in perplexity and looking from one to the other No we didn t repeated Polly clasping her hands Dear Grandpapa we truly didn t or we wouldn t have kept on playing all this time mister King put back his head and laughed long and loud as he hadn t done for many a day his ill humour dropping off in the midst of it The letters are all right he said wiping his eyes never had better news It was an impertinent fellow I met out there that s all Father who has dared began Jasper with flashing eyes Don t you worry my boy it s all right the fellow got his quietus besides he wasn t worth minding said mister King carelessly Why here is your mother turning to Polly Now then missus Fisher what is it for I see by your eye some plan is on the carpet Yes there is said missus Fisher coming in with a smile the doctor is going to take a day off Is that really so cried mister King with a little laugh What not even going to visit one of his beloved hospitals while Polly exclaimed radiantly Oh how perfectly elegant Now we ll have Papa Doctor for a whole long day Phronsie who had been close to her mother s gown during the delivery of this important news clasped her hands in a quiet rapture while Polly exclaimed Now Grandpapa can it be the Rigi Jasper echoing the cry heartily I suppose it is to be the Rigi assented old mister King leaning back in his chair to survey them all that is if missus Fisher approves We ll let you pick out the jaunting place turning to her seeing that it is the doctor s holiday I know that doctor Fisher wants very much to go up the Rigi said his wife in great satisfaction at the turn the plans were taking And we ll stay over night father cried Jasper won t we Stay over night repeated his father I should say so Why what would be the good of our going up at all pray tell if we didn t devote that much time to it and have a try for a sunrise We re to go up the Rigi exclaimed Polly giving a little whirl and beginning to dance around the room repeating We re to go up the Rigi exactly as if nobody knew it and she was telling perfectly fresh news Here that dance looks awfully good wait for me cried Jasper And seizing her hands they spun round and round Phronsie scuttling after them crying Take me too I want to dance Polly So you shall cried Polly and Jasper together so they made a little ring of three and away they went Polly this time crying Just think we re going to have the most beautiful sunrise in all this world And on the other side of the partition in his accustomed nook in the big parlour the big fat man with the black beard sat He pulled this same black beard thoughtfully a bit when mister King was telling about the impertinent fellow Then he smiled and jabbered away to himself very hard in German and it wasn t till the King party hurried off to get ready for the Rigi trip that he got up and sauntered off And almost the first person that old mister King saw on getting his party into a car on the funicular railway was the impertinent fellow also bound for the top of the Rigi Oh Grandpapa Polly got out of her seat and hurried to him with cheeks aflame when midway up I know isn t it wonderful cried Grandpapa happy in her pleasure and finding it all just as marvellous as if he hadn t made the ascent several times Yes yes cried Polly It is all perfectly splendid Grandpapa but oh I mean did you hear what that lady said and she dropped her voice and put her mouth close to Grandpapa s ear I m sure I didn t said old mister King carelessly and I m free to confess I m honestly glad of it For if there is one thing I detest more than another Polly my girl it is to hear people especially women rave and gush over the scenery Oh she didn t rave and gush cried Polly in a whisper afraid that the lady heard She said Grandpapa that Herr Bauricke is at Lucerne just think Grandpapa the great Herr Bauricke She took her mouth away from the old gentleman s ear in order to look in his face Polly Polly called Jasper from his seat on the farther end you are losing all this as the train rounded a curve Do come back Now I m glad of that exclaimed Grandpapa in a tone of the greatest satisfaction for I can ask him about the music masters in Dresden and get his advice and be all prepared before we go there for the winter to secure the very best And I can see him and perhaps hear him play breathed Polly in an awestruck tone quite lost to scenery and everything else Jasper leaned forward and stared at her in amazement Then he slipped out of his seat and made his way up to them to find out what it was all about How did she know he asked as Polly told all she knew I m just going to ask her But the lady who had caught snatches of the conversation though she hadn t heard mister King s part of it very obligingly leaned forward in her seat and told all she knew And by the time this was done they all knew that the information was in the American paper printed in Paris and circulated all over the Continent and that the lady had read it that very morning just before setting out The only time I missed reading that paper observed old mister King regretfully And he is staying at our very hotel finished the lady for I have seen you sir with your party there Another stroke of good luck thought old mister King and quite easy to obtain the information I want as to a master for Polly and Jasper Now then children he said to the two hanging on the conversation run back to your seats and enjoy the view This news of ours will keep So Polly and Jasper ran back obediently but every step of the toilsome ascent by which the car pushed its way to the wonderful heights above Polly saw everything with the words Herr Bauricke is at our hotel ringing through her ears and she sat as in a maze Jasper was nearly as bad And then everybody was pouring out of the cars and rushing for the hotel on the summit all but mister King s party and a few others who had their rooms engaged by telegraphing up When they reached the big central hall there was a knot of Germans all talking together and on the outside fringe of this knot people were standing around and staring at the central figure Suddenly some one darted away from this outer circle and dashed up to them It was the lady from their hotel I knew you d want to know she exclaimed breathlessly that s Herr Bauricke himself he came up on our train just think of it the big man in the middle with the black beard She pointed an excited finger at the knot of Germans Old mister King followed the course of the finger and saw his impertinent fellow who wasn t worth minding XX I SHOULD MAKE HIM HAPPY SAID PHRONSIE Polly got Jasper away into a side corridor by a beseeching little pull on his sleeve Oh just to think she mourned I called that great man such unpleasant things that he was big and fat and oh oh Well he is big and fat declared Jasper We can t say he isn t Polly But I meant it all against him said Polly shaking her head You know I did Jasper she added remorsefully Yes we neither of us liked him said Jasper and that s the honest truth Polly And to think it was that great Herr Bauricke exclaimed Polly Then her feelings overcame her and she sank down on the cushioned seat in the angle Jasper sat down beside her I suppose it won t do to say anything about people after this until we know them Will it Polly Jasper declared Polly clasping her hands while the rosy colour flew over her cheek I m never going to say a single Just then the big form of Herr Bauricke loomed up before them as he turned into the corridor Polly shrank up in her corner as small as she could wishing she was as little as Phronsie and could hop up and run away Herr Bauricke turned his sharp eyes on them for a moment hesitated then came directly up and stopped in front of them I meant I in tended to speak to your grandfader first Dat not seem best now The great man was really talking to them and Polly held her breath not daring to look into his face but keeping her gaze on his wonderful fingers My child those wonderful fingers seized her own and clasped them tightly you have great promise mind you you know only a leedle now and you must work work work He brought it out so sharply that the last word was fairly shrill But I tink you will he added kindly dropping his tone Then he laid her fingers gently in her lap Oh she does sir exclaimed Jasper finding his tongue first for Polly was beyond speaking Polly works all the time she can Dat is right Herr Bauricke bobbed his head in approval so that his spectacles almost fell off I hear dat in de music she play No leedle girl play like dat who doesn t work I will hear you sometime at de hotel he added abruptly and tell you some tings dat will help you To morrow maybe when we go down from dis place eh Oh sir exclaimed Polly springing off from her cushion before Jasper could stop her You are so good but but I cannot then her breath gave out and she stood quite still Eh exclaimed Herr Bauricke and pushing up his spectacles to stare into her flushed and troubled face Perhaps I not make my meaning clear I mean I geef you of my time and my best ad vice Now you understand eh He included Jasper in his puzzled glance Yes sir Jasper made haste to say We do understand and it is so very good of you and Polly will accept it sir For father will make it all right with him as to the payment he reflected easily Ah now exclaimed Herr Bauricke joyfully a light beaming all over his fat face dat is someting like to morrow den we But oh sir Polly interrupted I cannot and she twisted her hands in distress I I didn t like you and I said so Then she turned very pale and her head drooped Jasper leaned over and took her hand Neither did I sir he said I was just as bad as Polly You not tink me nice looking so said Herr Bauricke Well I not tink so myself eeder And I scare you maybe wid dis and he twisted his black beard with his long fingers Ah so well we will forget all dis leedle girl and he bent down and took Polly s other fingers that hung by her side And eef you not let me come to morrow to your leedle music room and tell you sometings to help you learn better I shall know dat you no like me now eh Oh sir Polly lifted her face flooded with rosy colour up to her brown hair if you only will forgive me I no forgeef I not remember at all said Herr Bauricke waving his long fingers in the air And I go to morrow to help you leedle girl and he strode down the corridor Polly and Jasper rushed off they scarcely knew how to Grandpapa to tell him the wonderful news to find him in a truly dreadful state of mind When they had told their story he was as much worse as could well be imagined Impossible impossible was all he could say but he brought his hand down on the table before him with so much force that Jasper felt a strange sinking of heart What could be the matter Why children and you all for his whole party was before him exclaimed mister King Herr Bauricke is that impertinent person who annoyed me this morning and I called him fellow to his face It was so very much worse than Jasper had dreamed that he collapsed into the first chair all Polly s prospects melting off like dew before the sun Hum Little doctor Fisher was the first to speak He took off his big spectacles and wiped them then put them on his nose and adjusted them carefully and glared around the group his gaze resting on old mister King s face Polly who had never seen Jasper give way like this forgot her own distress and rushed up to him Oh don t Jasper she begged You see I can t allow Herr Bauricke to give any lessons or advice to Polly after this went on mister King hastily Of course he would be paid but under the circumstances it wouldn t do not in the least It is quite out of the question he went on as if some one had been contradicting him But no one said a word Why don t some of you speak he asked breaking the pause doctor Fisher you don t generally keep us waiting for your opinion Speak out now man and let us have it It is an awkward affair surely began the little doctor slowly Awkward I should say so frowned mister King it s awkward to the last degree Here s a man who bumps into me in a hotel passage though for that matter I suppose it s really my fault as much as his and I offer to pick up his spectacles that were dropped in the encounter And he tells me that he is glad that we ran up against each other for it gives him a chance to tell me what is on his mind As if I cared what was on his mind or on the mind of any one else for that matter he declared in extreme irritation And I told him to his face that he was an impertinent fellow and to get out of my way Yes I did A light began to break on little doctor Fisher s face that presently shone through his big spectacles fairly beaming on them all Then he burst into a laugh hearty and long Why Adoniram exclaimed Mother Fisher in surprise Polly turned a distressed face at him and to say that old mister King stared would be stating the case very mildly indeed Can t you see oh can t you see exploded the little doctor mopping up his face with his big handkerchief that your big German was trying to tell you of Polly s playing and to say something probably pretty much the same that he has said to her and to Jasper O dear me I should like to have been there to see you both ended doctor Fisher faintly Then he went off into another laugh I don t see much cause for amusement said old mister King grimly when this idea broke into his mind for it s a certain fact that I called him a fellow and told him to get out of the way Well he doesn t bear you any malice apparently said the little doctor who having been requested to speak saw no reason for withholding any opinion he might chance to have for if he did he wouldn t have made that handsome offer to Polly That may be the offer is handsome enough answered mister King that is the trouble it s too handsome I cannot possibly accept it under the awkward circumstances No children he turned to Polly and Jasper as if they had been beseeching him all the while you needn t ask it or expect it and he got out of his chair and stalked from the room Jasper buried his face in his hands and a deep gloom settled over the whole party on all but little doctor Fisher He pranced over to Polly and Jasper just as merrily as if nothing dreadful had happened Don t you be afraid my boy he said your father is a dreadfully sensible man and there s no manner of doubt but that he will fix this thing up Oh you don t know father groaned Jasper his head in his hands when he thinks the right thing hasn t been done or said And now Polly will miss it all And his head sank lower yet Nonsense exclaimed doctor Fisher Yet he had a dreadful feeling coming over him and he turned to Polly imploringly Oh I do believe it Jasper cried Polly what Papa Doctor says And just look at Mamsie she cried beneath her breath And truly Mother Fisher was having a hard time to control herself That Jasper could see as he lifted his head And the little doctor also saw and skipped back across the room to her side And Phronsie feeling plunged into the deepest woe by all this dreadful state of affairs that had come too bewilderingly for her to rally to Grandpapa s side first began to cry And then thinking better of it went softly out of the door and no one noticed her when she went with the tears running down her cheeks Down the long corridor she hurried not knowing which way Grandpapa went but turning into the little reading room she spied him sitting by the table The apartment was otherwise empty He wasn t reading not even looking at a paper but sitting bolt upright and lost in thought Grandpapa she said laying a soft little hand on his arm Oh I m so glad I found you And she nestled up to his side Eh Oh Phronsie child Old mister King put his arm around her and drew her closely to him So you came after your old Grand daddy did you Yes I did said Phronsie with a glad little cry snuggling up tighter to him while the tears trailed off down his waistcoat but not before he had seen them Now Phronsie you are not to cry any more he said with a pang at the sight You won t dear promise me that So Phronsie promised and he held her hands and clearing his throat he began Well now I suppose they felt pretty badly back there in the room your mother and all eh Phronsie Yes Grandpapa said Phronsie her round face falling Yet she had promised not to cry and although she had a hard time of it every tear was kept back valiantly And Polly now asked old mister King cautiously and Jasper how were they feeling Grandpapa Phronsie did not trust herself to reply but springing up she laid her rosy little mouth close to his ear What does it all the dreadful thing mean she whispered It means old mister King whispered back but very distinctly that your old Granddaddy is an idiot Phronsie and that he has been rude and let his temper run away with him Oh no Grandpapa dear contradicted Phronsie falling back from him in horror You couldn t ever be that what you say And she flung both arms around his neck and hugged him tightly What An idiot Yes I have been an idiot of the worst kind declared mister King and all the rest just as I say rude and why what is the matter Phronsie for the little arms clutched him so tightly he could hardly breathe Oh Grandpapa she wailed and drawing away a bit to look at him he saw her face convulsed with the effort not to cry Don t say such things You are never naughty Grandpapa dear you can t be she gasped There there there ejaculated old mister King frightened at the effect of his words and patting her yellow hair at his wits end what to say So he broke out Well now Phronsie you must tell me what to do Thereupon Phronsie seeing there was something she could really do to help Grandpapa came out of her distress enough to sit up quite straight and attentive in his lap You see I spoke rudely to a man and I called him a fellow and he was a gentleman Phronsie you must remember that Yes I will Grandpapa she replied obediently while her eyes never wandered from his face And I told him to get out of the way and he did said mister King forcing himself to a repetition of the unpleasant truth O dear me nothing could be worse he groaned And you are sorry Grandpapa dear Phronsie leaned over and laid her cheek softly against his Yes I am Phronsie awfully sorry confessed the old gentleman but what good will that do now My temper has made a terrible mess of it all But you can tell the gentleman you are sorry said Phronsie Oh Grandpapa dear do go and tell him now this very minute She broke away from him again and sat straight on his knee while a glad little smile ran all over her face I can t you don t understand O dear me mister King set her abruptly on the floor and took a few turns up and down the room Phronsie s eyes followed him with a grieved expression When she saw the distress on his face she ran up to him and seized his hand but didn t speak You see child he grasped her fingers and held them closely it s just this way the gentleman wants to do me a favour that is to help Polly with her music Does he cried Phronsie and she laughed in delight Oh Grandpapa how nice And Polly will be so happy But I cannot possibly accept it groaned old mister King don t you see child after treating him so Why how could I The idea is too monstrous He set off now at such a brisk pace down the room that Phronsie had hard work to keep up with him But he clung to her hand Won t that make the gentleman sorry panted Phronsie trotting along by his side Eh oh what exclaimed old mister King coming to a dead stop suddenly What s that you say Phronsie Won t the gentleman feel sorry repeated Phronsie pushing back the waves of yellow hair that had fallen over her face to look up at him And won t he feel badly then Grandpapa Eh oh perhaps assented mister King slowly and passing a troubled hand across his brow Well now Phronsie you come and sit in my lap again and we ll talk it over and you tell me what I ought to do So the two got into the big chair again and Phronsie folded her hands in her lap Now begin said old mister King I should make the gentleman happy Grandpapa said Phronsie decidedly You would no matter what you had to do to bring it about asked Grandpapa with a keen pair of eyes on her face Eh think now Phronsie I should make the gentleman happy repeated Phronsie and she bobbed her head decidedly I really should Grandpapa Then the best way is to have it over with as soon as possible said old mister King so come on child and you can see that the business is done up in good shape He gathered her little fingers up in his hand and setting her once more on the floor they passed out of the apartment The door of the private parlour belonging to mister King s rooms was flung wide open and into the gloomy interior for Mother Fisher and Jasper were still inconsolable marched old mister King He was arm in arm so far as the two could at once compass the doorway with Herr Bauricke while Phronsie ducked and scuttled in as she could for the big German with ever so many honorary degrees to his name held her hand fast Old mister King continued his march up to Mother Fisher Allow me to introduce Herr Bauricke Professor and Doctor of Music of world wide distinction he said bowing his courtly old head And then Mother Fisher self controlled as she had always been astonished him by turning to her husband to supply the answering word Glad to see you exclaimed the little doctor bubbling over with happiness and wringing the long fingers extended My wife is overcome with delight which the big German understood very well and he smiled his knowledge of it as he looked into her black eyes She is like to mein Frau he thought having no higher praise And then he turned quickly to Polly and Jasper XXI ON THE RIGI KULM For all that grand old Rigi s summit claimed them it was some time before mister King s party left the little parlour Herr Bauricke surely didn t want to until he had gotten it settled just what he did mean about Polly s music That she showed great promise that some faults in the way she had been taught were there but it was by no means too late to mend them that she had spirit and expression and love for the art Ah dat is eet after all Herr Bauricke clasped his long fingers and beamed at her and then swept the entire party Lofe ah how one must lofe eet Eef not shame shame His countenance darkened frightfully and he fairly glared at them as he unclasped his hands and swung one over his head while his black beard vibrated with each word Goodness me exclaimed Tom Selwyn it takes a musical man to sling around I say Jasper I d like to do a bit of boxing or cricketing with him But Jasper didn t hear or see anything but Herr Bauricke and Polly and indeed the whole room was given up to the musical man and his words At last Polly drew a long breath Grandpapa was taking her hand Let us all go out and explore a bit and off they went the entire party And the musical man as Tom still continued to call him in private proved to be as expert in the use of his feet as his fingers for he led them here there and everywhere that promised the least chance of a good view But Polly saw only the glorious future when on the morrow Herr Bauricke would really show her on the piano how best to study and to work And the rosy glow of sunset wasn t one half as bright as all her dreams Polly said Phronsie pulling her hand gently as she peered up into her face are you looking at it What Pet Oh yes said Polly starting out of her revery with a little laugh you mean the sunset Yes said Phronsie I do mean that Are you looking at it Polly Because if you are not looking I wish you would Polly Well I suppose I am looking at it Phronsie said Polly with another little laugh but perhaps not in just the right way for you see Phronsie I can t seem to see anything but just the splendid thing that is coming to morrow Oh Phronsie Pepper just think of that I know said Phronsie with a little gurgle of delight at Polly s happiness and I am so glad Polly Of course you are declared Polly warmly just as glad as can be Phronsie and she threw her arm around her And now I m going to look at the sunset in the right way I hope Isn t it beautiful child Polly declared Phronsie suddenly wriggling away from Polly s arm to stand in front of her with a beaming face I think it s just as beautiful as it can be up top here I can see right in between that red cloud and that little pink teenty one And I wish I could just go in Polly Wouldn t it be nice echoed Polly enthusiastically What asked Adela hurrying up from a point of rocks below where she had been sketching Oh to go in between those clouds there and see it all said Polly Dear me exclaimed Adela I shouldn t like it I d much rather stay down here and sketch it We could go sailing off oh ever so far said Polly swinging her arms to suit the action to the words And you d be stuck to your rock here Adela while Phronsie you and I would sit on the edge of a cloud and let our feet hang over and oh Adela you could sketch us then as we went sailing by How that would look exclaimed Adela with such a face that Polly burst out into a merry laugh and Phronsie joining with her little crow of delight and clapping her hands at the idea of such fun brought pretty much the whole party around them What s up cried Tom to Jasper on the way to the girls with some fear for he didn t dare even yet to talk much to Polly As for Adela he let her severely alone Don t know said Jasper but we ll soon find out and they did by Phronsie s flying away from Polly and skipping down over the rocks to meet them Oh Jasper Polly s telling how we would sail on that beautiful cloud announced Phronsie her yellow hair flying from her face as she sped along heedless of her steps Take care or you ll fall warned Jasper See your mother is looking worried And truth to tell missus Fisher on a point of rocks a little way off with the others was getting a bit alarmed as she saw the progress of her baby I ll take care said Phronsie sobering down at thought of Mamsie s being troubled and beginning to pick her way carefully And Jasper gathered up her fingers in his thinking of the time when she toiled up and down the long stairway when she first came to what was now her home blessed thought and Polly and he sat down at the foot to watch her And so Polly and you are going to try sailing on that cloud there said Jasper squinting up at the brilliant sky We aren t really going Jasper said Phronsie shaking her head soberly because you see we can t But Polly s pretending it all and we re to sit on the edge and swing our feet And Adela is going to make a picture of us Whew whistled Jasper And I say Polly for now they had scrambled up to the two girls isn t there room for us on that cloud too While Tom kicked pebbles and wished he knew how to talk to girls Perhaps said Polly gaily Oh I suppose that those who couldn t get on our cloud could take the next one I d rather have your cloud Polly said Jasper And Grandpapa must come too cried Phronsie in alarm at the very thought of his being left out I want him on our cloud Polly Yes and Mamsie and Papa Doctor finished Polly ready for any nonsense she was just bubbling over so with joy at thought of the morrow and what it would bring Well it is good the cloud is big squinting up at the radiant sky And Tom you are coming on that cloud boat Jasper pulled him forward with a merry laugh giving him a clap on the back at the same time Eh oh I can t no thank you stammered Tom thus suddenly brought into notice Excuse me just as if the invitation had been a bona fide one Polly never smiled but Adela giggled right out Tom s face flushed and he rushed off furiously determined never to chance it again whereby he d be mortified before girls not he All the gay time was flown and the red and pink and purple clouds looked down upon a sorry uncomfortable little group Jasper spoke first I must go after him and he dashed down the rocks O dear me I couldn t help it said Adela twisting uncomfortably it was so silly in him to take it all in earnest He didn t really think we meant it said Polly her brown eyes very grave Would Jasper really persuade him to forget that laugh But he is shy and he said the first thing that came into his head Boys haven t any right to be shy said Adela fussing with her little sketching block and pencil they are so big and strong Why did Tom run away so fast asked Phronsie only half comprehending Never mind child said Polly with a reassuring pat on her head And isn t Jasper coming back asked Phronsie in great distress Yes oh I guess so said Polly Well there the pretty glow has all faded see Phronsie pointing up to the leaden clouds that no one who had failed to see a few moments before could have imagined alive with colour Now we ought to run over to the others for they ll be going back to the hotel It s all gone said Phronsie sadly looking up at the darkening sky Polly where has the pretty red and pink gone to Oh I don t know said Polly thinking only of Tom and what a hard time Jasper must be having with him Take care Phronsie don t look up now you ll fall There take my hand now come on O dear me I didn t mean to laugh Adela was saying to herself as she fell back in the zig zag path down the rocks I wish I hadn t I ll I ll What she meant to do wasn t very clear in her mind what she did do was to run up to her grandmother s and her room and toss her sketch book on the table and herself on the bed for a good hearty cry Polly found her there when they couldn t find her anywhere else with much searching and running about Little old missus Gray was worrying dreadfully so afraid she had been blown from the rocks for the wind had now risen and all the travellers were seeking the shelter and warmth of the hotel corridor and parlours Oh Adela how could you Polly was going to say And then she thought that would be the very worst thing in all the world for Adela s shoulders were shaking and it would only make her cry worse And besides Polly remembered how she had sometimes given way in just this fashion and how much worse she would have been had it not been for a wise good mother So she ran out in the hall I must tell her grandmother she said to herself Have you found her asked Jasper looking up from the foot of the staircase Yes said Polly I have All right And Jasper vanished and Polly went slowly back wishing she could be downstairs with all the dear people instead of trying to comfort this dismal girl The next moment she was kneeling down by the side of the bed and trying to get hold of one of Adela s hands But Adela bounced over to the farther side and she cried out angrily It s all very well for you to say so because you didn t do it And everybody likes you O dear me tee hee boo hoo But I ve often done things just as bad confessed Polly and Adela I ve cried like this too But Mamsie oh Adela she made me see it was wrong so I had to stop it you know How is it wrong asked Adela rolling over and taking the handkerchief away from one eye enough to see Polly Pepper s face I can cry I guess if I want to without asking anybody Oh no you can t said Polly decidedly I mean no one can Why not pray tell said Adela sniffing very hard My eyes are my own and I shall cry too whenever I want to Well I can t just tell you exactly why you can t cry when you want to said Polly afraid she wasn t going to say the right word but Mamsie could if she were here I ll go and call her Adela And Polly sprang to her feet She ll come I know Oh no no cried Adela in mortal alarm I don t want her I mean I d rather have you You re a girl and a woman talking at me scares me Then you mustn t cry if I stay said Polly stopping short and seeing her advantage for I surely shall go Adela she added firmly unless you stop crying O dear me Adela squirmed all over the bed I can t stop I ve always cried as much as I wanted to O dear me boo hoo hoo I mean I ll stop don t go sopping up her wet face with a nervous hand See Pol ly for Polly had slipped out of the room Adela flew off from the bed Polly Polly Pol ly she called in a piteous little tone Polly halfway down the stairs looked back Oh you are up she said with a smile Now that s fine come And she held out her hand Mercy me and O my cried Adela I can t go looking like this why I m a perfect sight I know Polly Pepper and my nose feels all bunged out of shape and as big Never mind said Polly as reassuringly just dash some water over it and it ll be all right I ll wait here for you So Polly stood on her stair while Adela bemoaning all the way that she didn t look fit to be seen and that she was a perfect sight and she couldn t go down among them all stumbled back into her room And pretty soon Polly heard a big splash O dear me oh what shall I do What is the matter cried Polly deserting her stair to run in and up to the washstand Just see what I ve done exclaimed Adela holding out one arm It was dripping wet and the water was running off in a stream and down to meet a small puddle where the splash had struck on the floor The pitcher slipped O dear me ugh cried Adela wriggling all over Stand still said Polly do Adela till I wipe your sleeve dry And she got the towel and began to sop and to pat Adela s arm It never ll feel dry it s perfectly awful ugh Polly Pepper declared Adela twisting away from Polly s fingers it s just like a wet snake ugh O dear me and it gives me the creeps You ll have to put on another waist I do think said Polly hanging up the towel aghast to find herself growing angry at all this delay and with half a mind to run and leave Adela to herself O dear me and there s this water running all over the floor cried Adela stepping gingerly over the pool and trying to pick off the wet sleeve from her arm at the same time I ll fix it said Polly as cheerily as she could while you get your waist on And she sopped the water up There that s done she announced with satisfaction now do hurry Adela I can t get out of this old horrid wet sleeve said Adela very red in the face and pulling and twitching at it Take care you ll tear it warned Polly I don t care if I do said Adela peevishly O dear me somebody s coming With that she flew into the closet and pulled to the door Why Polly exclaimed Mother Fisher in surprise what is the matter We are all waiting to go in to dinner Oh I m so sorry began Polly feeling as if nothing would be so delightful as to have a good cry in Mamsie s arms and tell all the story Well you must come right away said missus Fisher Why where is Adela looking around the room I m here said Adela from the closet Come out here Adela said missus Fisher So Adela came out the wet sleeve still on her arm but she had gotten out of the rest of the waist That s too bad said missus Fisher and in a minute Adela s wet arm was free and nicely dried and a clean waist being found it was soon on and then Mother Fisher took up the hairbrush We must have this all nice and smooth she said And Adela stood still liking it all very much and her hair was brushed much as if she had been Phronsie and then Mother Fisher released her with a smile There now you are ready she said She didn t scold a bit said Adela going after her with Polly down the stairs and forgetting her red eyes and swollen nose Our mother never scolds declared Polly with her head very high never in all this world Adela Gray And at dinner Tom Selwyn looked across the table and when he caught sight of Adela s face and saw that some one else could feel as badly as he could and he guessed the reason he made up his mind what he was going to do next And as soon as the meal was over without giving himself time to think he marched up to Adela Say I didn t much mind because you laughed don t you know and held out his hand I ve been crying ever since said Adela and I didn t mean to laugh I know it said Tom to the first part of her sentence and looking at her nose Well never mind now so it s quits and shake hands I don t know what quits is said Adela putting out her hand Oh it s when things are evened up somehow said Tom not exactly that but it will do well enough by way of explaining And I m never going to laugh again at anybody said Adela lifting her red eyes Well come on don t you want a game of draughts said Tom awkwardly Draughts repeated Adela very much puzzled I don t know it Why what a whopper Tom was going to say but changed it to Why I saw you playing it last night with Polly Pepper Why no you didn t said Adela not very politely that was checkers That s the same thing said Tom triumphantly only you Americans call it that funny name Well I think it s a great deal nicer name than draughts said Adela that s silly Well checkers that s senseless retorted Tom and besides you Americans always say nice at everything Then he looked at her red eyes and poor little nose and added kindly Well never mind call it checkers then I don t care let s have a game and he rushed for the board missus Selwyn looked from her corner where she had taken a book and smiled to see him playing a game with a girl Then she nodded over to Jasper and he smiled back And Adela never once thought how she looked And she beat Tom twice and that quite set her up And then for the next three games he routed her men completely off the board And strange to say she kept her temper and even smiled at the disaster That s a good game Old mister King came up as the last one was going on Tom my boy you play a fine one And she fights well said Tom generously She beat me twice You don t say so exclaimed mister King Well that s doing pretty well Adela to get ahead of the English lad But you don t stand much of a chance this time Tom s got the game sure And so it proved in less time than it takes to write it And then everybody said good night to everybody else for the Alpine horn would sound at the earliest dawn to waken the sleepers to see the sunrise Mamsie cried Polly raising her head suddenly as she cuddled into bed supposing we shouldn t hear that horn just supposing it Oh can t I stay awake Do let me Mamsie Your Grandfather has made arrangements for us all to be called said missus Fisher so we won t have to depend on the horn and now you must go to sleep just as fast as ever you can Then you ll be as bright as a button in the morning Polly Mamsie said Polly I don t think Grandpapa has kept from doing anything he could to make us happy do you Mamsie not a single thing No said Mother Fisher I don t Polly XXII POLLY TRIES TO HELP Mamsie what shall we do Polly clasped her hands in despair and looked down on Phronsie sleeping away as if she meant to take her own time to wake up regardless of sunrise on the Rigi O dear me and she went to bed so early last night on purpose You go right along Polly said Mother Fisher Put on your golf cape over your jacket child it s dreadfully cold out there I shall stay with Phronsie for of course we wouldn t leave her alone with Matilda and all go off for a nice time No of course not cried Polly in horror at the mere thought And she s in such a nice sleep and so warm that it s a pity to wake her up finished missus Fisher O dear me cried Polly in distress I d rather stay Mamsie and have you go No said missus Fisher firmly I shall stay so that is all there is about it Polly Now run along child and tell Matilda to hurry out too for she wants to see the sunrise Polly still lingered until her mother looked up in surprise Why Polly she said reprovingly O dear me exclaimed Polly I didn t mean to disobey Mamsie I really didn t I ll go And setting a kiss on Mother Fisher s black hair she ran out on unsteady feet and with all her comfort gone When she joined her group it would have been rather hard to distinguish any of them as everybody was wrapped up in shawls and rugs if Jasper hadn t been a sort of scout in waiting for her and missus Fisher and Phronsie And Tom could easily be picked out for he hung around in Jasper s wake and besides he was so very big Where are they asked Jasper looking down the corridor back of her Oh Mamsie isn t coming nor Phronsie either for she s asleep And Mamsie made me come finished Polly dismally O dear me said Jasper quite gone in sympathy Tom Selwyn poked his head forward to hear but as it was something quite beyond his powers to help he thrust his hands into his pockets and kicked aimlessly on the floor Well come on Polly said Jasper wishing he could lift the gloom from Polly s face and feeling quite dismal himself Little doctor Fisher muffled up in a big plaid shawl so that only his spectacles gleamed in between the folds and his cap suddenly edged up back of Polly and dropped the folds away from his ears so that he could hear what was going on And when the group hurried out of the door into the cold gray dawn he was skipping down to his wife s room in the liveliest way imaginable Old mister King had gone on ahead with the parson as he couldn t scramble so fast And now he met them with Well are you all here where s Phronsie Oh Jasper I can t tell him gasped Polly up on the tiptop bunch of rocks and trying to be glad of the promise of the beautiful sunrise to come for everybody agreed that it was apparently to be the best one that had gladdened the hearts of travellers for years Then she whirled around and stared with all her might If there isn t Mamsie coming As true as you live it is cried Jasper with a good look and springing down the rocks to help her up Tom Selwyn plunged after him getting there first So in the bustle nobody answered mister King And he supposing from the merry chatter that Phronsie was in the midst of it concluded it best not to interrupt their fun even if he could make them hear Your father made me come Polly said missus Fisher coming up between the two boys But I d so much rather that he saw it And her downcast face looked so very much like Polly that Jasper thought matters hadn t bettered themselves any But Mamsie said Polly creeping up to her with all the comfort she could it makes him happy just as it made you happy to have me go I know it said Mother Fisher with a sigh but he has so few pleasures Polly and he works so hard And her gaze wandered off to the distant clouds slowly beginning to break away Polly held her breath as they waited and looked although her heart was sad when the wee little streak of light began to come over in the east Isn t that just beautiful exclaimed Jasper trying to enjoy it as much as he had expected see Polly the stars seem going out daylight s coming I know said Polly so it is Sure enough a little strip of gold touched up the leaden sky and spread slowly See it s turning pink missus Selwyn s plain quiet face glowed See Polly look at that peak bathed in colour Just then a little voice said Oh isn t that beautiful And whirling around on her rock Polly saw little doctor Fisher staggering along with a big bundle in his arms out of which was peering Phronsie s face Mother Fisher had turned too Oh Adoniram was all she said as Polly sprang off to meet them Give her to me cried Tom Selwyn of course reaching there first before either Polly or Jasper and before doctor Fisher quite knew how Phronsie was perched on the broad shoulder and Tom was prancing up the rocky path as easily as if a bird had lighted on his arm She woke up luckily said little doctor Fisher and she s bundled up so there isn t a chance of her taking cold Wife this is grand He gained her side and drew her hand under the big shawl You ve come just in time cried Polly skipping around on her rock to the imminent danger of falling on her nose and varying the exercises by cuddling Phronsie s toes done up in a big bundle I declare if Papa Fisher hasn t tied them up in one of the blankets she announced merrily A blanket is just as good as anything when the sunrise is waiting for you said the little doctor coolly Isn t it cried Polly back at him happily Oh oh Everybody echoed Oh oh then stood hushed to silence A rosy blush spread from peak to peak and all the shadows fell away Everything below towns villages lakes and forests stood out in the clear cold dawn and at last the sun burst forth in all his glory I m so glad that people don t chatter said Polly when at last they turned away for the swift clouds had shut it all out Did you see Phronsie s face Jasper when that light burst out Yes and father s answered Jasper I expect he d been looking for her everybody is so bundled up you can hardly find your best friend And then he saw her Yes and she saw him and called him said Polly didn t you hear her Didn t I though said Jasper who could help it Wasn t father pleased when he got up to us Tom to think you had Phronsie in such good shape Phronsie you re in luck pinching as much of her toes as the bundle of blanket would allow you ve got the best place of any of us up on that perch I like it said Phronsie in grave delight very much indeed surveying them out of the depths of the shawl and I wish it needn t stop Well it must said Polly with a sigh Dear me see those people run Well it s cold said Jasper let s you and I race to the hotel Polly And the show is over said Tom why shouldn t they run as Jasper and Polly set off and he strode after getting there nearly as soon An hour later Polly who couldn t get to sleep again for a nap before breakfast went out to the little balcony window just outside her door where she might sit and write in her journal and meantime catch any chance view that the grey scudding clouds might afford In this way she strove to work off the impatience possessing her for the beautiful hour to come after breakfast I can hardly believe it now she thought and she gave herself a little pinch to see if she were really awake it seems too good to be true to think that the great Professor Bauricke is actually going to tell me how to learn to play well Say a voice struck upon her ear oh I m in the most awful distress Polly clapped her book to and looked up O dear dear It was a tall spare woman with a face that had something about it like Grandma Bascom s It must have been the cap frills flapping around her cheeks What can I do for you asked Polly springing up Oh do take my chair and sit down and tell me about it Oh will you help me The land I couldn t set when I m in such trouble declared the old woman My senses I should fly off the handle Polly feeling that she was in the presence of some dreadful calamity stood quite still You see me and my sister she s in highstrikes now in there The old woman tossed her head to indicate a room further down the hall whereat the cap frills flapped wilder than ever Bein as it belonged to both of us she feels as bad as I do but as I was the one that lost it why it stands to reason I ve got to shake around and get it again Say will you help me You ve got a pair of bright eyes as ever I see in a head and what s the good of em if you can t help in trouble like this Polly feeling that her eyes would never forgive her if she didn t let them help on such an occasion promised What is it you have lost she asked Don t you know cried the old woman impatiently Mercy me how many times shall I tell you My buzzom pin it was took of Pa when he was a young man and awful handsome and I didn t want to leave it in the room when we went out cause somebody might get in and they d be sure to want it so I pinned it on my nightcap strings and it s gone and I a gallivanting round on them rocks a looking at the sunrise and I can see that to home all I want to I must have been crazy Oh I see and you want me to go out and help you look for it said Polly her brow clearing Of course assented the old woman impatiently Land your intellects ain t as bright as your eyes My sakes how many times do you expect me to tell you I ve been a looking and a peeking everywhere but my eyes are old and I don t dare to tell any one to help me for like enough they d pick it up when I warn t seein and slip Pa in their pocket and I never d see him again Polly feeling if Pa were slipped in a pocket and carried off it would be a calamity indeed said heartily I ll get my jacket and cap and come right out She looks honest I guess I hain t done no harm to tell her about our buzzom pin said the old woman to herself as Polly disappeared Mamsie being asleep Polly could say nothing to her but feeling that she would allow it if she knew she threw on her things and ran out to meet the old woman with a shawl tied over her nightcap and a big long cape on I tell you she s in highstrikes said the old woman going down the hall That s our room thirty seven an I ve seen you an your folks goin by so I feel in some ways acquainted An if I don t find Pa I ll be flabbergasted myself Do let us hurry said Polly her mind now only on Pa So they went down the stairs and out by the door and up the rocky path just where the old woman said she and sister Car line took when they went out to see the sunrise An I wish we d kept in bed ejaculated Polly s companion I most lost my teeth out they chattered so and so did Car line hers But that wouldn t a been nothin to losin Pa cause we could a got more teeth but how could we a got him took when he was nineteen and so handsome There here we stopped just at this identical spot Well I think we shall find it said Polly consolingly How did the pin look she asked for the first time remembering to ask and beginning to poke around in the crevices My land sakes I never see such a girl for wanting to be told over and over exclaimed the old woman irritably picking up first one ample gaiter and then another to warm her cold toes in her hands Haven t I told you he was awful handsome Well he had on his blue coat and big brass buttons for one thing an his shirt front was ruffled And Was it gold around it asked Polly poking away busily Gold I guess it was and there was dents in it where Car line an I bit into it when we were babies cause mother give it to us when our teeth was comin twas better n a chicken bone she said Oh said Polly Well now you know said Car line s sister an don t for mercy s sakes ask any more useless questions I m most sorry I brung you I might go down and get the boys Jasper and Tom they d love to help said Polly feeling that she was very much out of place and there was no hope of finding Pa under the circumstances The old woman clutched her arm and held her fast Don t you say a single word about any boys she commanded I hate boys she exploded they re the worry of our lives Car line and mine they get into our garden and steal all our fruit and they hang on behind our chaise when we ride out and keep me a lookin round an slashin the whip at em the whole livelong time O my boys What in the world is Polly Pepper doing up on those rocks cried Jasper just spying her Come on Tom and let s see And they seized their caps and buttoned their jackets against the wind which had just sprung up and dashed off to see for themselves Ugh you go right away screamed Car line s sister as their heads appeared over the point of rocks and shaking both hands fiercely at them Whew whistled Jasper with his eyes in surprise on Polly And what old party are you demanded Tom finding it easy to talk to her as she was by no means a girl And do you own this mountain anyway Oh don t begged Polly And Jasper if you would go away please and not ask any questions All right said Jasper swallowing his disappointment not to know Come on Tom Polly doesn t want us here An I won t have you here screamed the old woman harder than ever So get away as soon as you can Why you are boys I know it Tom bobbed his head at her We ve always been ma am An boys are good for nothing an lazy an thieves yes I wouldn t trust em So she kept on as they hurried back over the rocky path That s a tiger for you ejaculated Tom Then he stopped and looked back a little anxiously Aren t you afraid to leave Polly with her No said Jasper it would trouble Polly to have us stay Yet he stopped and looked anxious too We will wait here And after a while down came the two searchers the old woman quite beside herself now and scolding every bit of the way that she didn t see what bright eyes were for when they couldn t find anything an now that Pa d gone sliding down that mountain they might as well give up she an Car line when a sudden turn in the path brought the boys into view waiting behind the rocks Then all her fury burst upon them See here now cried Tom suddenly squaring up to her and looking at the face between the nodding cap frills we are ready to take a certain amount of abuse my friend and I but we won t stand more I can tell you Oh don t began Polly clasping her hands Oh Tom please keep still She doesn t know what she s saying for she s lost her pin with her father on Hey cried Jasper Say it again Polly while Tom shouted and roared all through Polly s recital Was it an old fright with a long nose in a blue coat and ruffles and as big as a turnip he asked between the shouts While Polly tried to say Yes I guess so and Miss Car line s sister so far overcame her aversion to boys as to seize him by the arm Tom shook her off like a feather See here old party he cried that ancient pin of yours is reposing in the hotel office at this blessed moment Jasper and I indicating his friend ran across it on the rocks up there more than an hour ago and Oh Pa s found exclaimed the old woman in a shrill scream of delight beginning to trot down to the hotel office Yes it would have been impossible for Pa to have got off this mountain without making a landslide said Tom after her XXIII IN THE SHADOW OF THE MATTERHORN They had been days at dear Interlaken walking up and down the Hoheweg of which they never tired or resting on the benches under the plane and walnut trees opposite their hotel just sitting still to gaze their fill upon the Jungfrau This was best of all so Polly and Jasper thought and Phronsie was content to pass hour after hour there by Grandpapa s side and imagine all sorts of pretty pictures and stories in and about the snow clad heights of the majestic mountain And the throng of gaily dressed people sojourning in the big hotels and the stream of tourists passed and repassed with many a curious glance at the stately white haired old gentleman and the little yellow haired girl by his side A perfect beauty exclaimed more than one matron with a sigh for her ugly girls by her side or left at home She s stunning and no mistake Many a connoisseur in feminine loveliness turned for a last look or passed again for the same purpose Grandpapa Phronsie prattled on that looks just like a little tent up there a little white tent doesn t it Grandpapa dear Yes Phronsie said Grandpapa happily just as he would have said Yes Phronsie if she had pointed out any other object in the snowy outline And there s a cunning little place where you and I could creep into the tent said Phronsie bending her neck like a meditative bird And I very much wish we could Grandpapa dear We d find it pretty cold in there said Grandpapa and wish we were back here on this nice seat Phronsie What makes it so cold up there Grandpapa when the sun shines asked Phronsie suddenly Say Grandpapa what makes it
4846_18524_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh it s so far up in the air answered old mister King 
none	none	Don t you remember how cold it was up on the Rigi and that was about nine thousand feet lower Oh Grandpapa exclaimed Phronsie in gentle surprise unable to compass such figures mister King s party had made one or two pleasant little journeys to the Lauterbrunnen Valley staying there and at Muerren and to Grindelwald as well but they came back to sit on the benches by the walnut and the plane trees in front of the matchless Jungfrau And this is best of all said Polly And so the days slipped by till one morning at the breakfast table missus Selwyn said Tomorrow we must say good by my boy and I Hey what exclaimed mister King setting his coffee cup down not very gently Our vacation cannot be a very long one said Tom s mother with a little smile there are my father and my two daughters and my other boys in England Tom s face was all awry as mister King said And you mean to say missus Selwyn that you really must move on to morrow Yes we really must she said decidedly But oh and her plain quiet face changed swiftly you cannot know how sorry we shall be to leave your party In that case missus Fisher old mister King looked down the table length to Mamsie we must go too for I don t intend to lose sight of these nice travelling companions until I am obliged to Tom s face was one big smile Oh goody exclaimed Polly as if she were no older than Phronsie Jasper clapped Tom s back instead of wasting words So we will all proceed to pack up without more ado after breakfast After all it is wiser to make the move now for we are getting so that we want to take root in each place You just wait till you get to Zermatt whispered Polly to Phronsie who under cover of the talk buzzing around the table had confided to her that she didn t want to leave her beautiful mountain Grandpapa is going to take us up to the Gorner Grat and there you can see another mountain oh so near he says it seems almost as if you could touch it And it s all covered with snow Phronsie too Is it as big as my mountain here asked Phronsie Yes bigger a thousand feet or more answered Polly glad that she had looked it up Is it said Phronsie Every mountain is bigger isn t it Polly It seems to be said Polly with a little laugh And has it a little white tent on the side just like my mountain here asked Phronsie holding Polly s arm as she turned off to catch the chatter of the others Oh I suppose so answered Polly carelessly Then she looked up and caught Mamsie s eye and turned back quickly At any rate Phronsie it s all peaked on the top oh almost as sharp as a needle and it seems to stick right into the blue sky and there are lots and lots of other mountains oh awfully high and the sun shines up there a good deal and it s too perfectly lovely for anything Phronsie Pepper Then I want to go decided Phronsie I do so want to see that white needle Polly Well eat your breakfast said Polly because you know we all have ever so much to do to day to get off Yes I will declared Phronsie attacking her cold chicken and roll with great vigour It seems as if the whole world were at Zermatt said the parson looking out from the big piazza crowded with the hotel people out to the road in front with every imaginable tourist passing and repassing Donkeys were being driven up either loaded down to their utmost with heavy bags and trunks or else waiting to receive on their patient backs the heavier people Phronsie never could see the poor animals without such distress coming in her face that every one in the party considered it his or her bounden duty to comfort and reassure her So this time it was Tom s turn to do so Oh don t you worry he said looking down into her troubled little face where he sat on the piazza railing swinging his long legs they like it those donkeys do Do they asked Phronsie doubtfully Yes indeed said Tom with a gusto as if he wished he were a donkey and in just that very spot it gives them a chance to see things and to hear things too don t you know went on Tom at his wits end to know how he was going to come out of his sentences Oh said Phronsie yet she sighed as she saw the extremely fat person just being hauled up to a position on a very small donkey s back You see if they don t like it said Tom digging his knife savagely into the railing they have a chance to kick up their heels and unsettle that heavy party O dear me exclaimed Phronsie in great distress that would hurt the poor woman Tom Well it shows that the donkey likes it said Tom with a laugh because he doesn t kick up his heels And so ran on Tom why we mustn t worry you and I if the donkey doesn t Just think he made a fine diversion by pointing with his knife blade up to the slender spire of the Matterhorn we re going up on a little jaunt to morrow to look into that fellow s face Phronsie got out of her chair to come and stand by his side I like that white needle she said with a gleeful smile Polly said it was nice and I like it I should say it was declared Tom with a bob of his head Phronsie I d give I don t know what if I could climb up there He thrust his knife once more into the railing where it stuck fast Don t begged Phronsie her hand on his sleeve go up that big white needle Tom No I won t it s safe to promise that he said grimly with a little laugh Good reason why because I can t The little mother wouldn t sleep nights just to think of it and I promised the granddaddy that I wouldn t so much as think of it and here I am breaking my word but I can t help it He twitched his knife out suddenly sprawled off from the railing and took several hasty strides up and down the piazza Well that s all right Phronsie he said coming back to get astride the railing again this time he turned a cold shoulder on Phronsie s white needle Now to morrow we ll have no end of fun And he launched forth on so many and so varied delights that Phronsie s pleased little laugh rang out again and again bringing rest to many a wearied traveller tired with the sights sounds and scenes of a European journey I wish we could stay at this nice place said Phronsie the next morning poking her head out over the side of the car as it climbed off from the Riffelalp station Take care child said Grandpapa with a restraining hand You would want to stop at every place said Polly from the seat in front with a gay little laugh And we never should get on at that rate But then I am just as bad she confessed So am I chimed in Jasper Dear me how I wanted to get a chance to sketch some of those magnificent curves and rapids and falls in the Visp River coming up Oh that dear delicious Visp River echoed Polly while Adela began to bemoan that it was the best thing they had seen and the car whizzed them by so fast she couldn t do a thing O dear I got some snap shots but I don t believe they are good for anything said Jasper just from the pure perversity of the thing Take my advice said Tom lazily leaning forward and don t bother with a camera anyway As if you expected any one to take up with such a piece of advice ejaculated Jasper in high disdain Say something better than that Tom if you want to be heard Oh I don t expect to be heard or listened to in the slightest he said calmly Anybody who will trot round with a kodak hanging to his neck by a villanous strap can t be Who s got a villanous strap hanging to his neck cried Jasper while the rest shouted as he picked at the fern box thus hanging to Tom Oh that s quite a different thing declared Tom his face growing red I know one is a kodak and the other is a fern box said Jasper nodding I acknowledge they are different and they all burst out laughing again Well at least said Tom joining in the laugh you must acknowledge too that I go off by myself and pick up my wild flowers and green things and I m not bothering round focussing every living thing and pointing my little machine at every freak in nature that I see All right said Jasper good naturedly but you have the strap round your neck all the same Tom And Phronsie wanted to stay at the Riffelberg just as much and old mister King was on the point of saying Well we ll come up here for a few days Phronsie when he remembered missus Selwyn and her boy and how they must get on Instead he cleared his throat and said We shall see it after dinner child and Phronsie smiled well contented But when she reached the Corner Grat station and took Grandpapa s hand and began to ascend the bridle path to the hotel she couldn t contain herself and screamed right out Oh Grandpapa I d rather stay here It is beautiful isn t it echoed old mister King feeling twenty years younger since he started on his travels Well well child I m glad you like it looking down into her beaming little face You are very much to be envied sir I can t help speaking to you and telling you so said a tall sober looking gentleman evidently an English curate off on his vacation as he caught up with him on the ascent where they had paused at one of the look offs for having that child as company and those other young people You say the truth replied old mister King cordially from the depths of my heart I pity any one who hasn t some children to take along when going abroad But then they wouldn t be little Peppers he added under his breath as he bowed and turned back to the view There s dear Monte Rosa cried Polly enthusiastically Oh I just love her And there s Castor and Pollux said Jasper And there s the whole of them said Tom disposing of the entire range with a sweep of his hand Dear me what a lot there are to be sure It quite tires one Oh anybody but a cold blooded Englishman exclaimed Jasper with a mischievous glance to travel with Anything on earth but a gushing American retorted Tom to go round the world with I wish I could sketch a glacier bemoaned Adela stopping every minute or two as they wound around the bridle path but I can t I ve tried ever so many times Wait till we get to the Mer de Glace advised Tom You can sit down in the middle of it and sketch away all you want to Well I m going to said Adela with sudden determination I don t care you can all laugh if you want to You can sketch us all suggested Jasper for we shall have horrible old stockings on I sha n t have horrible old stockings on said Adela in a dudgeon sticking out her foot I wear just the same stockings that I do at home at school in Paris and they are quite nice Oh I mean you ll have to put on coarse woollen ones that the peasant women knit on purpose we all shall have to do the same on over our shoes explained Jasper O dear me cried Adela in dismay And I think we shall slip and slide a great deal worse with those things tied on our feet than to go without any said Polly wrinkling up her brows at the idea Twouldn t be safe to go without them said Jasper shaking his head unless we had nails driven in our shoes I d much rather have the nails cried Polly oh much rather Jasper Well we ll see what father is going to let us do said Jasper Wasn t that fun snowballing just think in July cried Polly craning her neck to look back down the path toward the Riffelberg station Did you pick up some of that snow asked Adela Didn t we though exclaimed Jasper I got quite a good bit in my fist My ball was such a little bit of a one mourned Polly I scraped up all I could but it wasn t much Well it did good execution said Tom I got it in my eye Oh did it hurt you cried Polly in distress running across the path to walk by his side
4846_18524_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Not a bit said Tom 
none	none	I tried to find some to pay you back and then we had to fly for the cars The plain quiet face under the English bonnet turned to missus Fisher as they walked up the path together I cannot begin to tell you what gratitude I am under to you said Tom s mother and to all of you When I think of my father I am full of thankfulness When I look at my boy the goodness of God just overcomes me in leading me to your party May I tell you of ourselves some time when a good opportunity offers for a quiet talk I d like nothing better said Mother Fisher heartily If there is one person I like more than another who isn t of our family or any of our home friends it s missus Selwyn she had confided to the little doctor just a few days before She hasn t any nonsense about her if she is an earl s daughter Earl s daughter sniffed the little doctor trying to slip a collar button into a refractory binding Dear me now that s gone no tisn t that s luck as the button rolled off into a corner of the bureau top where it was easily captured Let me do that for you Adoniram said Mother Fisher coming up to help him I guess you ll have to wife if it s done at all he answered resigning himself willingly to her hands the thing slips and slides like all possessed Well now I was going to say that I wouldn t hate a title so much if there was a grain of common sense went along with it And that missus Selwyn just saves the whole lot of English nobility and makes em worth speaking to in my opinion And after they had their dinner and were scattered in groups in the bright sunshine sitting on the wooden benches by the long tables or taking photographs or watching through the big glass some mountain climbers on one of the snowy spurs of the Matterhorn the good opportunity for a quiet talk came about Now said Mother Fisher with a great satisfaction in her voice may we sit down here on this bench missus Selwyn and have that talk Tom s mother sat down well pleased and folding her hands in her lap this earl s daughter mistress of a dozen languages as well as mistress of herself on all occasions began as simply and with as much directness as a child Well you know my father Let me tell you aside from the eccentricities that are mere outside matters and easily explained if you understood the whole of his life a kinder man never lived nor a more reasonable one But it was a misfortune that he had to be left so much alone as since my mother s death a dozen years ago has happened It pained me much A shadow passed over her brow but it was gone again and she smiled and her eyes regained their old placid look I live in Australia with my husband where my duty is putting the boys as fast as they were old enough and the little girls as well into English schools But Tom has always been with my father at the vacations for he is his favourite as of course was natural for he is the eldest And though you might not believe it missus Fisher my father was always passionately fond of the boy I do believe it said Mother Fisher quietly and she put her hand over the folded ones missus Selwyn unclasped hers soft and white to draw within them the toil worn one Now that s comfortable she said with another little smile And here is where his eccentricity became the most dangerous to the peace of mind of our family continued missus Selwyn My father seemed never able to discover that he was doing the lad harm by all sorts of indulgence and familiarity with him a sort of hail fellow well met way that surprised me more than I can express when I discovered it on my last return visit to my old home My father who never tolerated anything but respect from all of us who were accustomed to despotic government I can assure you was allowing Tom well you were with him on the steamer she broke off abruptly The placid look was gone again in a flash Yes said Mother Fisher her black eyes full of sympathy don t let that trouble you dear missus Selwyn Tom was pure gold down underneath we saw that and the rest is past Ah the placid look came back as quickly that is my only comfort that you did For father told the whole not sparing himself Now he sees things in the right light he says because your young people taught it to him And he was cruelly disappointed because you couldn t come down to visit him in his home We couldn t said Mother Fisher in a sorry voice at seeing the other face I understand quite said Tom s mother with a gentle pressure of the hand she held And then the one pleasure he had was in picking out something for Polly Oh if the little red leather case had gone back to the poor old man ran through Mother Fisher s mind possessing it at once I don t think his judgment was good missus Fisher in the selection said missus Selwyn a small pink spot coming on either cheek but he loves Polly and wanted to show it And he was so good to think of it cried Mother Fisher her heart warming more and more toward the little old earl And as he couldn t be turned from it and his health is precarious if he is excited why there was nothing to be done about it And then he insisted that Tom and I come off for a bit of a run on the Continent the other children being with him And as my big boy here a loving smile went all over the plain face making it absolutely beautiful had worried down deep in his heart over the past till I was more troubled than I can tell you why we came And then God was good for then we met you Oh missus Fisher She drew her hands by a sudden movement away and put them on Mother Fisher s shoulders And then that British matron rarely demonstrative with her own children even leaned over and kissed Polly s mother I can t see why it s so warm up here said Polly racing over to their bench followed by the others Dear me it s fairly hot And she pulled off her jacket Don t do that Polly said her mother Oh Mamsie it s so very hot said Polly but she thrust her arms into the sleeves and pulled it on again I know but you ve been running said missus Fisher and have gotten all heated up Well it s perfectly splendid to travel to places where we can run and race said Polly in satisfaction throwing herself down on the rocks The others all doing the same thing mister King and the Parson and missus Henderson found them and pretty soon the group was a big one Well well we are all here together no where is missus Gray asked mister King presently She is resting in the hotel said Mother Fisher fast asleep I think by this time Yes said Adela she is I just peeked in on her and she hasn t moved where you tucked her up on the lounge Grandpapa asked Polly suddenly from the centre of the group what makes it so very warm up here when we are all surrounded by snow You ask me a hard thing said old mister King Well for one thing we are very near the Italian border those peaks over there you know follow my walking stick as I point it are in sunny Italy Well it is just like sunny Italy up here said Polly I think blinking and pulling her little cap over her eyes It s all the Italy you will get in the summer season said Grandpapa You must wait for cold weather before I take one of you there XXIV THE ROUND ROBIN Dear me how the summer is going mourned Polly as they caught on the return journey the last glimpse of the roaring tumbling Visp and not all the craning of the necks could compass another view as the cars drew them away from the rushing river Never mind Polly said Jasper there s all next summer and after our winter in Dresden and all our hard work over music won t it be fine though to jaunt round again and his eyes glistened Dresden echoed Polly sitting quite straight with very red cheeks oh Jasper The magic word Dresden had unlocked visions of months of future delight bringing back every word of dear Herr Bauricke all the instruction he had given her on those happy days at Lucerne that Polly felt quite sure were engraven deep on her heart to last forever and ever And won t I study though exclaimed Polly to herself and make the professor that Herr Bauricke has engaged for me glad that he teaches me oh won t I Well I m sorry the summer is going said Adela because then I ve got to leave you at Paris and go into school But you like your school said Polly brightly you ve said so a dozen times Adela Yes I do said Adela and I ve got some sketches to take back and Mademoiselle will be glad of that And you ll go on drawing and painting until you get to be a great artist ran on Polly enthusiastically and then we ll see something you ve done in the Louvre maybe The Louvre cried Adela O dear me Polly Pepper I don t care said Polly recklessly pushing back the little rings of brown hair from her brow they ll be good enough the pictures you are going to do to put into the Louvre anyway Adela Gray Tom Selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor His mother looked over at him and slipping out of her seat went over to him Any room here Tom for mother she said Oh ah I should say so Tom slipped out gave her the window seat then flew back Now this is comfy observed missus Selwyn as the train sped on Tom see here What s up little mother asked Tom in surprise at her unusual manner It s just this Tom You know we are going to Chamonix and up the Mer de Glace with mister King s party Tom bobbed his head not allowing himself to exclaim But that will be only a short journey now and we must soon say good by Well I ve been thinking that I should like to go on to Geneva and to Paris continued missus Selwyn only you dislike Paris so much Tom she added Oh you re the bulliest I mean excuse me you re no end a brick oh I mean I can t say what I mean brought up Tom in despair And he ran one long arm around her neck very much to the detriment of her neat collar Then you can overcome your dislike to Paris enough to go there asked his mother with a little twinkle in her eye My dislike roared Tom O dear me as everybody looked around Why I just love Paris he finished in an awful whisper close to the plain black bonnet When the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into at all till Paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even Tom And as this particular party had the car entirely to themselves it wasn t so very dreadful as it seems and the elder members allowed indulgent smiles at it all That night in the market place at Martigny Jasper who was ahead with his father ran back to Polly and the others lingering behind Oh do hurry he begged it s the prettiest sight Oh what is it cried Polly as they scampered off There in the centre of the market place was a ring of little girls hand in hand singing a little French song and going round and round in a circle They were of all ages and sizes the littlest one in a blue pinafore being about three years of age and so chubby she had to be helped along continually by a big girl evidently her sister This big sister stopped the ring game every now and then to kiss the round face by the side of her gown an example that was followed by so many of the other girls that the game seemed to be never quite finished And once in a while big sister would pick up the chubby little blue pinafored maiden and carry her through a considerable portion of the game then down she would put her on her two chubby feet and away they all circled without any break in the proceedings at all Oh isn t it Oats Peas Beans and Barley grow cried Polly as they watched them intently Ever so much like it said Tom See those boys now they are going to make trouble Oh they sha n t declared Polly O dear me as one boy drew near on the side next to the travellers and watching his chance picked at a flying apron or two But the ring of girls paid no more attention to him than they had to any other outside matters being wholly absorbed in the game So Polly and the others breathed freely again But up came another boy O dear me cried Polly aghast When number three put in an appearance she gave up all hope at once They re jealous chaps cried Tom and are vexed because they can t get into the game Hear them jeer And his long arm went out and picked a jacket end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls Here you sir cried Tom with a bit of a shake and a torrent of remarkably good French not to be disregarded then he burst into a laugh And the urchin laughed too thinking this much better fun to tussle with the tall lad than to hang around a parcel of girls And presently a woman came and took little blue pinafore off and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands and the ring melted away and the game was over I m glad the girls over here have fun said Polly as Grandpapa and his party moved off Isn t it nice to think they do It isn t much matter where you live there s a good deal to be gotten out of life if you only know how said the parson thinking busily of the little brown house Two or three days of rest at Martigny put everybody in good shape and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that were behindhand Tom looked over all his floral treasures with their last additions made at the Riffelalp and discarded such as hadn t pressed well And Jasper and Polly rushed up to date with their journals and wrote letters home and Adela worked up her studies and sketches Tom looked on silently when Polly and Jasper were scraping their pens in a lively fashion in the little writing room of the hotel That s my third letter Polly announced Jasper on the other side of the table Now I am going to begin on Joel s One two said Polly counting why I thought I d written three well this one is most finished Jasper Yes said Jasper glancing over at her is that your last page Polly Yes said Polly hurrying away Then she thought of what Mamsie had said and slackened her speed Tom cleared his throat and tried to speak but the words wouldn t come nicely so he burst out I say I wish you d write to my granddaddy both of you and then he stood quite still and very red in the face Polly looked up quickly her pen dropping from her fingers and Jasper deserted his fourth letter and stared Why said Polly finding her tongue we wouldn t dare Tom Selwyn Dare said Tom delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily Oh if you knew granddaddy And he sank into a chair by the table and played with the heap of picture postal cards that Polly was going to address next We might said Polly slowly write a letter all of us A kind of a Round Robin thing you know and send that So we could cried Jasper how would that do Tom The very thing exclaimed Tom striking his hand so heavily on the table that for a minute it looked as if the ink bottle hopped Take care there s no reason you should knock things over because you are overjoyed cried Jasper gaily Well let s leave our letters to day Polly and set to on the Round Robin All right said Polly glad to think there was anything she could really do to please the little old earl but would your mother like it Tom She stopped slowly in putting her unfinished letter into the little writing case and looked at him If you think there s a shadow of doubt on that score I d best run and ask her now Tom got himself out of the chair and himself from the room and in an incredibly short space of time back there he was My mother says Thank Polly for thinking of it it will do father more good than anything else could possibly do I don t suppose you want any more answer said Tom quite radiant and looking down at Polly No only I didn t think first of it said Polly in a distressed little tone Why Polly Pepper exclaimed Tom I certainly heard you say Round Robin when I ll venture to say not a soul of us had even thought of it we certainly hadn t said so Well you spoke of the letter first said Polly unwilling to take the credit for all the comfort going to the little old earl and I shall tell your mother so Tom But I didn t say Round Robin persisted Tom wasn t smart enough to think of it And let s get to work cried Jasper huddling up his three letters I ll post yours too Polly give them here O dear my stamps are all gone said Polly peering into the little box in one corner of her writing case I ve plenty said Jasper hurrying off I ll stick on two for you Oh no Jasper cried Polly after him you know Mamsie would not allow me to borrow It isn t borrowing said Jasper turning back slowly I ll give them to you Polly But Mamsie said when we started I should get my stamps when I needed them said Polly You know she did Jasper Yes she did said Jasper uncomfortably Then his face brightened and he said And she s right Polly while Polly fished a franc out of Joel s little money bag that hung at her belt Do get the stamps please Jasper and put them on as he took up her two letters And she gave the bag a little pat for Joel s sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch Dear me you are dreadfully particular about taking two postage stamps seems to me said Adela who had taken that time as she hadn t any letters to write to work up one of her studies from memory of the Visp Tom s blue eyes flashed dangerously then he cleared his throat whistled and walked to the window I don t know where we are going to get nice white paper for our Round Robin said Polly leaning her elbows on the table and her chin in her hands I know ejaculated Tom whirling on his heel and dashing out In he came swinging three or four goodly sheets Filched em out of the old woman s room he said Oh Tom began Polly I mean the housekeeper matron conciergerie whatever you call the gentle lady who runs this house was fortunately at our desk where she has the pleasure of making up our bills and I worked on her feelings till she parted with em explained Tom Oh said Polly well I m glad she gave them Never you fear but what they ll be in our bills Polly said Tom who couldn t believe by this time that he hadn t always known Polly Pepper It s dreadfully thin paper said Adela critically getting off from the sofa to pick at one corner of the sheet Polly was beginning to divide I m glad we have any hummed Polly happily Thank your stars you have said Tom as gaily And Jasper running in the table was soon surrounded by the makers of the Round Robin Adela deserting her sketch book and pulling up a chair And Phronsie must come said Polly snipping away to get the paper the right width O dear me I can t cut it straight Do you please finish it Jasper That s all right said Jasper squinting at it critically only just this edge wants a little bit of trimming Polly And he snipped off the offending points I ll fetch Phronsie cried Tom springing off And hurry cried Polly and Jasper together after him Polly said Phronsie as Tom came careering in with her on his shoulder I want to write too I do she cried very much excited Of course you shall Pet That s just what we want you for cried Polly clearing a place on the table there do pull up a chair Jasper Now Phronsie I think you would better begin for you are the littlest and she flapped the long strip down in front of her Oh Polly you begin begged Tom No I think Phronsie ought to said Polly shaking her head I want Polly to said Phronsie wriggling away from the pen that Polly held out alluringly But Polly wants you to said Jasper I really would Phronsie dear to please her To please Polly being what Phronsie longed for next to pleasing Mamsie she gave a small sigh and took the pen in unsteady fingers Wait a minute Phronsie exclaimed Polly in dismay I believe we ve made a mistake Jasper and got the wrong sheet And Polly turned off with him to examine the rest of the paper Phronsie who hadn t heard what Polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible fell to scribbling the letters as fast as she could all of them running down hill Well I m glad to see that we haven t made any mistake cried Polly turning back in relief Oh Phronsie you haven t begun She spoke so sharply that Phronsie started and a little drop of ink trembling on the point of her pen concluded to hop off So it did and jumped down on the clean white paper to stare up at them all like a very bad black eye Oh see what she s written cried Polly quite aghast and tumbling into her chair she pointed at the top Deer Mister Erl scrawled clear across the top I didn t mean oh you said do it Polly Phronsie threw herself out of her chair and over into Polly s lap burrowing and wailing piteously O dear me how could I say anything cried Polly overcome with remorse and patting Phronsie s yellow hair but it is so very dreadful O dear me Phronsie there there don t cry O dear me Tom s mouth trembled It s all right Granddaddy ll like it he said Oh Tom Selwyn gasped Polly looking up over Phronsie s head you don t suppose we d let that letter go I would said Tom coolly running his hands in his pockets I tell you you don t know my granddaddy He s got lots of fun in him he added Phronsie said Jasper rushing around the table you are making Polly sick Just look at her face Phronsie lifted her head where she had burrowed it under Polly s arm When she saw that Polly s round cheeks were really quite pale she stopped crying at once Are you sick Polly she asked in great concern I sha n t be said Polly if you won t cry any more Phronsie I won t cry any more declared Phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down her nose Then you will be all well Polly Then I shall be all as well as ever said Polly kissing the wet little face When they got ready to begin on the letter again it was nowhere to be found and Tom had disappeared as well He took it out said Adela for the first time finding her tongue I saw him while you were all talking While they were wondering over this and were plunged further yet in dismay Tom came dancing in waving the unlucky sheet of the Round Robin over his head My mother says he announced in triumph that father will get no end of fun over that if you let it go It will cheer him up So that ended the matter although Polly who dearly loved to be elegant had many a twinge whenever her eye fell on the letter at which Phronsie was now labouring afresh We must put in little pictures said Polly trying to make herself cheery as the work went busily on Polly you always do think of the best things exclaimed Jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile I wouldn t feel so badly Polly he managed to whisper when Phronsie was absorbed with her work he ll like it probably just as father did the gingerbread boy But that was different groaned Polly Pictures Tom Selwyn was saying oh there s where I can come in fine with assistance I m no good in a letter And again he rushed from the room That s three times that boy has gone out announced Adela and he joggles the table awfully when he starts And he made me cut clear into that edge See Polly She was trimming the third strip of paper for the Round Robin was to be pasted together and rolled up when it was all done He seems to accomplish something every time he goes observed Jasper drily Halloo just look at him now In came Tom with a rush and turned a small box he held in his hand upside down on the table O dear me exclaimed Adela as her scissors slipped now you ve joggled the table again Then she caught Polly s eye Aren t those pictures pretty she burst out awkwardly Aren t they so cried Tom in satisfaction while Polly oh ed and ah ed and Phronsie dropped her pen suddenly making a second blot only as good fortune would have it it was so near the edge that they all on anxious examination decided to trim the paper down and thus get rid of it I don t see how you got so many said Jasper in admiration his fingers busy with the heap Oh I ve picked em up here and there said Tom I began because I thought the kids at home might like em And then it struck me I d make a book like yours Well do save them now said Jasper and we ll give some of our pictures though the prettiest ones are in our books he added regretfully Rather not much obliged Tom bobbed his thanks I want to donate something to granddaddy and I tell you I m something awful at a letter All right seeing you wish it so said Jasper with a keen look at him and these are beauties and no mistake we couldn t begin to equal them When the letter was finally unrolled and read to Grandpapa who strayed into the reading room to see what Phronsie was doing it certainly was a beauty Picture after picture cut from railroad guide books illustrated papers and it seemed to Jasper gathered as if by magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey I wrote that all myself hummed Phronsie smoothing her gown in great satisfaction pointing to the opening of the letter O dear me exclaimed Polly softly for she couldn t even yet get over that dreadful beginning The rest of it is nice whispered Jasper and I venture to say he ll like that the best of all mister King thought so too and he beamed at Phronsie So you did he cried now that s fine I wish you d write me a letter sometime I m going to write you one now declared Phronsie Since Grandpapa wanted anything it was never too soon to begin work on it Do cried old mister King in great satisfaction So he put down the Round Robin Adela crying out that she wanted her grandmother to see it and Polly saying that Mamsie and Papa Doctor and the Parson and missus Henderson must see it and most important of all said Jasper breaking into the conversation missus Selwyn must say if it is all right to go At that Polly began to have little creeps as she always called the shivers O dear me she exclaimed again and turned quite pale You don t know my mother exclaimed Tom if you think she won t like that She s got lots of fun in her and she always sees the sense of a thing But she s so nice breathed Polly who greatly admired missus Selwyn and so elegant Tom bobbed his head and accepted this as a matter of course That s the very reason she understands things like a shot and knows how to take em he said and I tell you Polly he declared with a burst of confidence that utterly surprised him I d rather have my mother than any other company I know of she s awful good fun I know it said Polly brightly with a little answering smile Well I hope she ll like it Never you fear cried Tom seizing the Round Robin and waving it over his head it trailed off back of him like a very long and broad ribbon Come on now all fall into line Take care cried Jasper as he ran after with Polly and Adela if you dare to tear that sir while Phronsie at the big table laboured away on her letter Grandpapa sitting by to watch the proceedings with the greatest interest And one look at missus Selwyn s face as she read that Round Robin was enough for Polly And then to post it Dear me said Polly when that important matter was concluded suppose anything should happen to it now before it gets there XXV ON THE MER DE GLACE Well we can t all get into one carriage said Polly on the little brick paved veranda of the hotel so what is the use of fussing Adela I don t care said Adela I m going to ride in the same carriage with you Polly Pepper so there and she ran her arm in Polly s and held it fast Jasper kicked his heel impatiently against one of the pillars where the sweetbrier ran then he remembered and stopped suddenly hoping nobody had heard The best way to fix it is to go where we are put he said at last trying to speak pleasantly No I m going with Polly declared Adela perversely holding Polly tighter than ever I m going with you Polly cried Phronsie running up gleefully Grandpapa says I may Well so am I announced Adela loudly Tom Selwyn gave a low whistle and thrust his hands in his pockets his great and only comfort on times like these Anything but a greedy girl he sniffed in lofty contempt Meanwhile the horses were being put in the carriages the stable men were running hither and thither to look to buckle and strap and a lot of bustle was going on that at any other time would have claimed the boys Now it fell flat as a matter of interest Halloo k lup The drivers gave the queer call clear down in their throats and hopped to their places on the three conveyances and with a rattle and a flourish the horses now spun around the fountain in the little courtyard to come up with a swing to the veranda Now then said Grandpapa who had been overseeing every detail here we are running his eyes over his party that s right in great satisfaction I never saw such a family as I have for being prompt on all occasions Well then the first thing I have to do is to get you settled in these carriages the right way Adela at that snuggled up closer than ever to Polly and gripped her fast Now missus Fisher said old mister King you ll ride with missus Selwyn in the first carriage and you must take two of the young folks in with you Oh let Polly and me go in there cried Adela forgetting her wholesome fear of the stately old gentleman in her anxiety to get her own way Polly is going with me and Phronsie said mister King Hop in Adela child and one of you boys Tom ducked off the veranda while Adela not daring to say another syllable slowly withdrew her arm from Polly s and mounted the carriage step with a miserable face Come on one of you boys cried mister King impatiently We should have started a quarter of an hour ago I don t care which one only hurry I can t declared Tom flatly grinding his heel into the pebbles and looking into Jasper s face Very well Jasper drew a long breath I must then And without more ado he got into the first carriage and they rattled off to wait outside the big gate till the procession was ready to start Old missus Gray the parson s wife and the parson and little doctor Fisher made the next load and then Grandpapa perfectly delighted that he had arranged it all so nicely with Polly and Phronsie climbed into the third and last carriage while Tom swung himself up as a fourth They say it is a difficult thing to arrange carriage parties with success observed mister King I don t find it so in the least he added complacently just on the point of telling the driver to give the horses their heads But that is because I ve such a fine party on my hands where each one is willing to oblige and Ugh exclaimed Tom Selwyn with a snort that made the old gentleman start I m going to get out a minute excuse me can t explain And he vaulted over the wheel Bless me what s come to the boy exclaimed mister King now he s forgotten something I hope he won t be long But Tom didn t go into the hotel Instead he dashed up to carriage number one Get out he was saying to Jasper and presenting a very red face to view I m going in here Oh no said Jasper it s all fixed and I m going to stay here And despite all Tom could say this was the sole reply he got So back he went and climbed into old mister King s carriage again with a very rueful face Old mister King viewed him with cold displeasure as the driver smacked his whip and off they went to join the rest of the party You must go first sang out the little doctor as Grandpapa s carriage drove up you are the leader and we ll all follow you Yes yes shouted the parson like a boy And the occupants of carriage number one saying the same thing Grandpapa s conveyance bowled ahead and he well pleased to head the procession felt some of his displeasure at the boy sitting opposite to him dropping off with each revolution of the wheels But Tom couldn t keep still I didn t want to come in this carriage sir he burst out Eh what Old mister King brought his gaze again to bear upon Tom s face Well you are here now he said only half comprehending Because Jasper won t take the place cried Tom setting his teeth together in distress That s what I got out for Oh I see said mister King a light beginning to break through Tom wilted miserably under the gaze that still seemed to go through and through him and Polly looked off at her side of the carriage wishing the drive over the Tete Noire was all ended Old mister King turned to Phronsie at his side Well now he said taking her hand we are in a predicament Phronsie for it evidently isn t going to be such an overwhelming success as I thought What is a predicament asked Phronsie wrenching her gaze from the lovely vine clad hills which she had been viewing with great satisfaction to look at once into his face Oh a mix up a mess generally answered Grandpapa not pausing to choose words Well what s to be done now that is the question Tom groaned at sight of the face under the white hair from which all prospect of pleasure had fled I was a beastly cad he muttered to himself Phronsie leaned over mister King s knee Tell me she begged what is it Grandpapa Oh nothing child said Grandpapa with a glance at Polly s face that you can help at least Polly drew a long breath Something must be done she decided Oh I know Why Grandpapa we can change before we get to the halfway place she cried suddenly glad to think of something to say Can t we And then we can all have different places The very thing exclaimed mister King his countenance lightening Come Tom my boy cheer up I ll put Jasper and every one else in the right place soon Here you stop a bit will you to the driver K lup cried the driver thinking it a call to increase speed so the horses bounded on smartly for several paces and no one could speak to advantage Make him hold up Tom commanded mister King sharply And Tom knowing quite well how to accomplish this Grandpapa soon stood up in the carriage and announced In half an hour or thereabout if we come to a good stopping place I shall change some of you twelve people about in the carriages Pass the word along But Adela didn t ride with Polly For rushing and pushing as the change about was effected to get her way and be with Polly she felt her arm taken in a very light but firm grasp No no my dear it was old mister King not that way Here is your place When a little girl pushes she doesn t get as much as if she waits to be asked It had to be done he said to himself for the poor child has had no mother to teach her and it will do her good But he felt sorry for himself to be the one to teach the lesson And so they went over the Tete Noire to catch the first sight of Mont Blanc I m going to have a donkey for my very own confided Phronsie excitedly the next morning to Jasper whom she met in the little sun parlour No cried Jasper pretending to be much amazed you don t say so Phronsie Yes I am she cried bobbing her yellow head Grandpapa said so he really did Jasper And I m going to ride up that long big mountain on my donkey She pointed up and off but in the wrong direction Oh no Phronsie that isn t the way we are going The Montanvert is over here child corrected Jasper And I m going to ride my donkey repeated Phronsie caring little which way she was going since all roads must of course lead to fairy land and we re going to see the water that s frozen and Grandpapa says we are to walk over it but I d rather ride my donkey Jasper confided Phronsie in a burst of confidence I guess you ll be glad enough to get off from your donkey by the time you reach the top of Montanvert observed Jasper wisely Well now Phronsie we are not going for a day or two you know for father doesn t wish us to be tired I m not a bit tired Jasper said Phronsie and I do so very much wish we could go to day O dear me exclaimed Jasper with a little laugh why we ve only just come Phronsie It won t be so very long before we ll be off Goodness the time flies so here it seems to me we sha n t hardly turn around before those donkeys will be coming into this yard after us to get on their backs But Phronsie thought the time had never dragged so in all her small life and although she went about hanging to Grandpapa s hand as sweet and patient as ever all her mind was on the donkeys and whenever she saw one and the street was full especially at morning and in the late afternoon of the little beasts of burden clattering up the stony roads she would beg to just go and pat one of the noses if by chance one of the beasts should stand still long enough to admit of such attention Oh no Phronsie expostulated old mister King when this pleasing little performance had been indulged in for a half a dozen times You can t pat them all goodness me child the woods are full of them he brought up in dismay Do they live in the woods asked Phronsie in astonishment I mean the place this whole valley of Chamonix is full of donkeys said Grandpapa so you see child it s next to impossible to pat all their noses I hope I m going to have that dear sweet little one cried Phronsie giving up all her mind since the soft noses couldn t be patted to happy thoughts of to morrow s bliss See Grandpapa she pulled his hand gently to ride up the mountain on Well you ll have a good one that is as good as can be obtained said the old gentleman but as for any particular one why they re all alike to me as two peas Phronsie But Phronsie had her own ideas on the subject and though on every other occasion agreeing with Grandpapa she saw good and sufficient reason why every donkey should be entirely different from every other donkey And when on the next morning their procession of donkeys filed solemnly into the hotel yard she screamed out Oh Grandpapa here he is the very one I wanted Oh may I have him Put me up do He s the worst one of the whole lot groaned Grandpapa his eye running over the file I know by the way he puts his vicious old feet down Phronsie here is a cunning little fellow he added artfully trying to lead her to one a few degrees better he fondly hoped But Phronsie already had her arms up by her particular donkey s neck and her cheek laid against his nose and she was telling him that he was her donkey for she thought Grandpapa would say Yes So what else could he do pray tell but say Yes And she mounted the steps and was seated her little brown gown pulled out straight and the saddle girth tightened and all the other delightful and important details attended to and then the reins were put in her overjoyed hands She never knew how it was all done seeing nothing hearing nothing of the confusion and chatter of the mounting of the others her gaze fixed on the long ears before her and only conscious that her very own donkey was really there and that she was on his back And it was not until they started and the guide who held her bridle loped off into an easy pace by the animal s head that she aroused from her dream of bliss as a sudden thought struck her What is my donkey s name she asked softly The man loped on not hearing and he wouldn t have understood had he heard I don t believe he has any name said old mister King just behind Phronsie is your saddle all right Do you like it child all in one breath I like it very much answered Phronsie trying to turn around Don t do that child said Grandpapa hastily Sit perfectly still and on no account turn around or move in the saddle I won t Grandpapa she promised obediently and presently she began again I want to know his name Grandpapa so that I can tell my pony when I get home Oh well we ll find out said Grandpapa Here you can t you tell the name of that donkey he cried to the guide holding Phronsie s bridle Oh I forgot he doesn t understand English and he tried it in French But this was not much better for old mister King preferring to use none but the best of French when he employed any was only succeeding in mystifying the poor man so that he couldn t find his tongue at all but stared like a clod till the old gentleman s patience was exhausted At last Jasper hearing what the trouble was shouted out something from his position in the rear that carried the meaning along with it and Phronsie the next minute was delighted to hear Boolah as the guide turned and smiled and showed all his teeth at her his pleasure was so great at discovering that he could really understand Why that s the name of my donkey said Polly patting the beast s rough neck He told me so when he helped me to mount So it is mine announced Jasper bursting into a laugh I guess they only have one name for the whole lot Well don t let us tell Phronsie so said Polly and I shall call mine Greybeard because he s got such a funny old stiff beard and it is grey And I shall christen mine Boneyard declared Jasper for he s got such a very big lot of bones and they aren t funny I can tell you And so with fun and nonsense and laughter as soon as they wound around by the little English church and across the meadows and struck into the pine wood the whole party of twelve Grandpapa and all began to sing snatches from the newest operas down to college songs For Grandpapa hadn t forgotten his college days when he had sung with the best and he had the parson on this occasion to keep him company and the young people of course knew all the songs by heart as what young person doesn t pray tell So the bits and snatches rolled out with a gusto and seemed to echo along the whole mountain side as the procession of sure footed animals climbed the steep curves Oh Polly your donkey is going over exclaimed Adela who rode the second in the rear after Polly he flirts his hind legs right over the precipice every time you go round a curve Well he brings them round all right said Polly composedly and with a little laugh Oh isn t this too lovely for anything she cried with sparkling eyes Well don t let him cried Adela huddling up on her donkey and pulling at the rein to make him creep closer to the protecting earth wall Na na one of the guides ran up to her shaking his head Adela fresh from her Paris school had all her French of the best kind too at her tongue s end but she seemed to get on no better than mister King My French is just bad enough to be useful laughed Jasper So he untangled the trouble again and made Adela see that she really must not pull at her bridle but allow the donkey to go his own gait for they were all trained to it Your French is just beautiful cried Polly Oh Jasper you know Monsieur always says Don t Polly begged Jasper in great distress No I won t promised Polly and I didn t mean to But I couldn t help it Jasper when you spoke against your beautiful French We ve all heard you talk French Jasper so you needn t feel so cut up if Polly should quote your Monsieur cried Tom who strange to say no matter how far he chanced to ride in the rear always managed to hear everything That s because we are everlastingly turning a corner he explained when they twitted him for it and as I m near the end of the line I get the benefit of the doubling and twisting for the front is always just above me So don t say anything you don t want me to hear old fellow he sang out to Jasper on the bridle path just above as Tom had said Now don t you want to get off cried Jasper deserting his donkey and running up to Phronsie as they reached the summit and drew up before the hotel Oh somebody take that child off groaned old mister King accepting the arm of the guide to help him dismount for I can t Every separate and distinct bone in my body protests against donkeys from this time forth and forevermore And yet I ve got to go down on one he added ruefully No I don t want to get down declared Phronsie still holding fast to the reins can t I sit on my donkey Jasper while you all walk over on the frozen water Oh my goodness no gasped Jasper Why Phronsie you d be tired to death the very idea child No said Phronsie shaking her yellow hair obstinately I wouldn t be tired one single bit Jasper And I don t want to get down from my donkey Well if you didn t go over the Mer de Glace why we couldn t any of us go said Jasper at his wits end how to manage it without worrying his father already extremely tired he could see and that s what we ve come up for Phronsie dropped the reins Take me down please Jasper she said putting out her arms How are you now father cried Jasper running over to him when he had set Phronsie on the ground It s astonishing said old mister King stretching his shapely limbs but all that dreadful sensation I always have after riding on one of those atrocious animals is disappearing fast That s good cried Jasper in delight Well I suppose we are all going to wait a bit he asked and longing to begin the tramp over the Mer de Glace Wait Yes indeed every blessed one of us declared his father Goodness me Jasper what are you thinking of to ask such a question after this pull up here Why we sha n t stir from this place for an hour I supposed we d have to wait said Jasper rushing off over the rocks feeling how good it was to get down on one s feet again and run and race And getting Polly and Tom and Adela they ran down where the donkeys were tethered and saw them fed and did a lot of exploring and it didn t seem any time before an Alpine horn sounded above their heads and there was Grandpapa tooting away and calling them to come up and buy their woollen socks for they were going to start So they scrambled up and picked out their socks and each seizing a pair in one hand and an alpenstock with a long sharp spike on the end in the other they ran off down the zigzag path to the glacier two or three guides helping the others along At the foot of the rocky path the four drew up O dear it s time to put on these horrible old stockings grumbled Adela shaking hers discontentedly Good old stockings you d much better say broke in Jasper They re better than a broken neck observed Tom just meaning to ask Polly if he could put hers on for her But he was too slow in getting at it and Jasper was already kneeling on the rocks and doing that very thing Now I m all ready announced Polly stamping her feet arrayed in marvellous red and white striped affairs Thank you Jasper Oh how funny they feel Shall I help you asked Tom awkwardly enough of Adela Oh I don t want them on and I don t mean to wear them said Adela with a sudden twist I m going to throw them away Then you ll just have to stay back said Jasper decidedly for no one is to be allowed on that glacier who doesn t put on a pair I won t slip the idea grumbled Adela Yet she stuck out her foot and Tom getting down on his knees suppressed a whistle as he securely tied them on Then the boys flew into theirs instanter Mine are blue said Phronsie as the others filed slowly down the winding path between the rocks and she pointed to the pair dangling across her arm I am so very glad they are blue Grandpapa So am I Pet he cried delighted to find that he was apparently as agile as the parson No one could hope to equal little doctor Fisher who was here there and everywhere skipping about among the rocks like a boy let loose from school Well well the children are all ready exclaimed old mister King coming upon the four impatient to begin their icy walk Didn t you expect it cried little doctor Fisher skipping up Well to say the truth I did answered old mister King with a laugh Now Phronsie sit down on that rock and let the guide tie on your stockings So Phronsie s little blue stockings were tied on and after Grandpapa had gallantly seen that everybody else was served he had his pulled on over his boots and fastened securely and the line of march was taken up You go ahead father begged Jasper and we ll all follow So old mister King with Phronsie and a guide on her farther side led the way and the red stockings and the brown and the black and some of indescribable hue moved off upon the Mer de Glace It s dreadfully dirty said Adela turning up her nose I thought a glacier was white when you got up to it Oh I think it is lovely cried Polly and that green down in the crevasse look Adela It s a dirty green persisted Adela whose artistic sense wouldn t be satisfied O dear me as her foot slipped and she clutched missus Henderson who happened to be next Now how about the woollen stockings asked Tom while Polly and Jasper both sang out Take care and Go slowly Adela didn t answer but stuck the sharp end of her alpenstock smartly into the ice Something is the matter with my stocking at last said the parson s wife stopping and holding out her right foot The guide nearest her stopped too and kneeling down on the ice he pulled it into place for it had slipped half off Now be very careful warned Grandpapa and don t venture too near the edge as he paused with Phronsie and the guide The others coming up looked down into a round green pool of water that seemed to stare up at them as if to say I am of unknown depth so beware of me That gives me the creeps Polly as you say missus Henderson observed Dear me I shall never forget how that green water looks and she shivered and edged off farther yet Supposing any one should fall in Well he d go down right straight through the globe seems to me said Tom with a last look at the pool as they turned off It looks as if it had no end till one would fetch up on the other side I love to hop over these little crevasses said Polly and suiting the action to the word Something is the matter with my stocking again announced missus Henderson to the guide presently I am sorry to trouble you but it needs to be fixed He didn t understand the words but there was no mistaking the foot thrust out with the woollen sock now wet and sodden half off again So he kneeled down and pulled it on once more Before they reached the other side the parson s wife had had that stocking pulled on six times until at last the guide finding no more pleasure in a repetition of the performance took a string from his pocket and bunching up in his fist a good portion of the stocking heel he wound the string around it and tied it fast cut off the string and returned the rest to his pocket Why do you tie up the heel queried missus Henderson I should think it much better to secure it in front But he didn t understand and the rest were quite a good bit in advance and hating to give trouble she went on the stocking heel sticking out a few inches But she kept it on her foot so that might be called a success The little Widow Gray was not going over the Mauvais Pas neither was missus Selwyn as she had traversed it twice before So on reaching the other side they were just about bidding good by to the others when without a bit of warning the parson s wife in turning around fell flat and disappeared to the view of some of them behind a boulder of ice All was confusion in an instant The guides rushed everybody rushed pellmell to the rescue Tom s long legs as usual getting him there first There she was in a heap in a depression of ice and snow and water I m all right except and she couldn t help a grimace of pain my foot The little doctor swept them all to one side as they seated her on one of the boulders of ice Humph I should think likely at sight of the tied up stocking heel You stepped on that and it flung you straight as a die and turned your foot completely over Yes said missus Henderson Then she saw the guide who had tied the stocking looking on with a face of great concern Oh don t say anything it makes him feel badly she mumbled wishing her foot wouldn t ache so Little doctor Fisher was rapidly untying the unlucky stocking and whipping off the boot he soon made sure that no ligaments were broken Then he put on the boot and the woollen sock being careful to tie it in front over the instep and whipping out his big handkerchief he proceeded to bandage the ankle in a truly scientific way Now then missus Henderson you are all right to take the walk slowly back to the hotel Parson Henderson took his wife s hand Come Sarah he said gently helping her up Oh you are going over the Mauvais Pas she cried in distress at the thought of his missing it Come Sarah he said gently keeping her hand in his I ll go back with her too said little doctor Fisher Oh Adoniram exclaimed his wife but it was under her breath and no one heard the exclamation I think doctor Fisher ought to go with the other party he will be needed there missus Selwyn was saying in her quiet way And I will bathe missus Henderson s foot just as he says it should be done so good by and any one looking down with a field glass from the Montanvert hotel could have seen at this point two parties one proceeding to the Mauvais Pas and the Chapeau and the other of three ladies the parson and a guide wending their way slowly on the return across the crevasses XXVI WELL HERE WE ARE IN PARIS 
5054_18527_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Notwithstanding all the glory of the shops and the tempting array of the jewellery and trinkets of every description therein displayed after a few days of sailing on the exquisite lake and some walks and drives Polly down deep in her heart was quite ready to move on from Geneva 
5054_18527_000002_000001	train-clean-360	And although she didn t say anything old mister King guessed as much and broke out suddenly Well are you ready to start Polly 
none	none	Yes Grandpapa she answered
5054_18527_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 I have the presents for the girls 
none	none	I m all ready
5054_18527_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Polly you haven t anything for yourself Mother Fisher exclaimed as Polly ran into her room and told the news how Grandpapa said they were to pack up and leave in the morning 
none	none	You haven t bought a single thing Oh I don t want anything said Polly I ve so many things at home that Grandpapa has given me 
5054_18527_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Mamsie isn t this pin for Alexia just too lovely for anything 
5054_18527_000006_000000	train-clean-360	She curled up on the end of the bed and drew it out of its little box I think she ll like it with anxious eyes on Mother Fisher s face 
5054_18527_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Like it repeated her mother 
none	none	How can she help it Polly
5054_18527_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I think so too said Polly happily replacing it on the bed of cotton and putting on the cover to look over another gift 
none	none	missus Fisher regarded her keenly
5054_18527_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 Well now Polly she said decidedly I shall go down and get that chain we were looking at 
5054_18527_000009_000002	train-clean-360	For you do need that and your father and I are going to give it to you 
5054_18527_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Mamsie protested Polly I don t need it really I don t 
5054_18527_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Well we shall give it to you said Mother Fisher 
none	none	Then she went over to the bed and dropped a kiss on Polly s brown hair Mamsie exclaimed Polly springing off the bed and throwing her arms around her mother s neck I shall love that chain and I shall wear it just all the time because you and Papa Doctor gave it to me 
5054_18527_000013_000000	train-clean-360	When they neared Paris Adela drew herself up in her corner of the compartment 
none	none	I expect you ll stare some when you get to Paris Polly Pepper
5054_18527_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve been staring all the time since we started on our journey Adela as hard as I could said Polly laughing 
5054_18527_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you ll stare worse than ever now said Adela in an important way 
5054_18527_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 There isn t anything in all this world that isn t in Paris she brought up not very elegantly 
5054_18527_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t like Paris Tom let the words out before he thought 
5054_18527_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 That s just because you are a boy sniffed Adela 
none	none	Oh Polly you ought to see the shops When Mademoiselle has taken us into some I declare I could stay all day in one Such dreams of clothes and bonnets 
5054_18527_000017_000004	train-clean-360	You never saw such bonnets Polly Pepper in all your life She lifted her hands unable to find words enough 
5054_18527_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 And the parks and gardens I suppose are perfectly lovely cried Polly feeling as if she must get away from the bonnets and clothes 
5054_18527_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and the Bois de Boulogne to drive in that s elegant 
none	none	Only Mademoiselle won t take us there very often I wish I was rich and I d have a span of long tailed grey horses and drive up and down there every day Polly laughed Well I should like the tram ways and the stages said Polly
5054_18527_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh those don t go into the Bois de Boulogne cried Adela in a tone of horror 
none	none	Why Polly Pepper what are you thinking of she exclaimed 
5054_18527_000022_000000	train-clean-360	This nettled Tom 
5054_18527_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 Of something besides clothes and bonnets he broke out 
none	none	Then he was sorry he had spoken
5054_18527_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Well there s the Louvre said Polly after an uncomfortable little pause 
5054_18527_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Adela that s best of all and it doesn t cost anything so Mademoiselle takes us there very often 
5054_18527_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I should think it would be cried Polly beaming at her and answering the first part of Adela s sentence 
5054_18527_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh Adela I do so long to see it 
5054_18527_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 And you can t go there too often Polly said Jasper 
none	none	It s the only decent thing in Paris said Tom that I like I mean that and to sail up and down on the Seine
5054_18527_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll go there the first day Polly said Jasper the Louvre I mean 
5054_18527_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Well here we are in Paris And then it was all confusion for the guards were throwing open the doors to the compartments and streams of people were meeting on the platform in what seemed to be inextricable confusion amid a babel of sounds 
5054_18527_000028_000002	train-clean-360	And it wasn t until Polly was driving up in the big cab with her part of mister King s family as he called it through the broad avenues and boulevards interspersed with occasional squares and gardens and the beautiful bridges here and there across the Seine gleaming in the sunshine that she could realise that they were actually in Paris 
5054_18527_000029_000000	train-clean-360	And the next day they did go to the Louvre 
5054_18527_000029_000001	train-clean-360	And Adela who was to stay a day or two at the hotel with them before going back into her school was very important indeed 
none	none	And she piloted them about the parson and missus Henderson joining their group the others with the exception of the little Widow Gray who stayed at home to look over Adela s clothes and take any last stitches going off by themselves
5054_18527_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I do want to see the Venus de Milo said Polly quite gone with impatience 
none	none	Oh Adela these paintings will wait
5054_18527_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Well that old statue will wait too cried Adela pulling her off into another gallery 
5054_18527_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Now Polly Mademoiselle says in point of art the pictures in here are quite important 
5054_18527_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Are they said poor Polly listlessly 
5054_18527_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes they are said Adela twitching her sleeve and Mademoiselle brings us in this room every single time we come to the Louvre 
5054_18527_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 It s the early French school you know she brought up glibly 
none	none	Well it s too early for us to take it in said Tom
5054_18527_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 Come I m for the Venus de Milo 
none	none	It s this way and Adela was forced to follow which she did in a discontented fashion Oh cried Polly catching her breath and standing quite still as she caught sight of the wonderful marble instinct with life at the end of the long corridor below stairs
5054_18527_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 Why she s smiling at us as the afternoon sunshine streamed across the lovely face to lose itself in the folds of the crimson curtain in the background 
5054_18527_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The parson folded his arms and drew in long breaths of delight 
none	none	It s worth fifty journeys over the ocean to once see that Sarah he said Do come back and look at the pictures begged Adela pulling Polly s arm again after a minute or two Oh don t exclaimed Polly under her breath Oh she s so beautiful Adela
5054_18527_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Well it s much better to see the pictures said Adela 
5054_18527_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 And then we can come here again to morrow 
none	none	Oh I haven t seen this half enough began Polly and I ve wanted to for so long Then she glanced at Adela s face
5054_18527_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 Well all right she said and turned off to come directly into the path of Grandpapa with Phronsie clinging to his hand and the rest of his part of the family standing in silent admiration 
5054_18527_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 We thought we d come here first said old mister King 
5054_18527_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t mean to see anything else to day 
5054_18527_000042_000002	train-clean-360	The Venus de Milo is quite enough for me To morrow now we ll drop in again and look at some of the pictures 
none	none	There is beauty enough in that statue said a lady who just passed them to the gentleman with her to satisfy any one but living beauty after all is most appealing 
5054_18527_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Just look at that child s face Edward 
none	none	They were guilty of standing in a niche at a little remove and studying Phronsie with keen critical eyes It s a wonderful type of beauty said Edward yellow hair and brown eyes and such features
5054_18527_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t care about the features said the lady it s the expression the child hasn t a thought of herself and that s wonderful to begin with 
none	none	That s about it replied Edward and I suppose that s largely where the beauty lies Evelyn
5054_18527_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us walk slowly down the corridor again said Evelyn and then come up otherwise we shall attract attention to be standing here and gazing at them 
5054_18527_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 And I d like to see that little beauty again remarked Edward I ll confess Evelyn 
none	none	So Evelyn and Edward continued to gaze at intervals at the living beauty and mister King and his party were absorbed in the marble beauty and Adela was running over in her mind how she meant to have Polly Pepper all to herself at the visit to the Louvre the next afternoon when she would show her the pictures she specially liked But they didn t any of them go to the Louvre that next day as it happened It was so beautifully bright and sunshiny that Grandpapa said it would be wicked to pass the day indoors so they had all the morning in a walk and a sail on the Seine and that pleased Tom and all the afternoon or nearly all sitting up in state in carriages driving up and down the Bois de Boulogne And that pleased Adela 
5054_18527_000052_000000	train-clean-360	And when they tired of driving old mister King gave orders for the drivers to rest their horses 
5054_18527_000052_000001	train-clean-360	And then they all got out of the carriages and walked about among the beautiful trees and on the winding sheltered paths 
5054_18527_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 It s perfectly lovely off there said Polly and almost like the country with a longing glance off into the green cool shade beyond So they strolled off there separating into little groups Polly and Jasper in front and wishing for nothing so much as a race 
none	none	I should think we might try it said Jasper there is no one near to see Come on Polly do I suppose we ought not to said Polly with a sigh as Adela overtook them Ought not to what she asked eagerly Jasper and I were wanting to run a race said Polly Why Polly Pepper You are in Paris exclaimed Adela quite shocked I know it said Polly and I wish we weren t O dear this seems just like the country and 
5054_18527_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Just then a child screamed 
none	none	That s Phronsie exclaimed Polly her cheek turning quite white And she sped back over the path
5054_18527_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no Polly Jasper tried to reassure her as he ran after her They were having their race after all but in a different way from what they had planned 
none	none	Dear me you are running said Adela who hadn t got it into her head what for as she didn t connect the scream with any of their party And she walked just as fast as she could to catch up with them 
5054_18527_000062_000002	train-clean-360	As that was impossible she gave a hasty glance around the shrubbery and seeing no one to notice her she broke out into a lively run 
5054_18527_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Phronsie Grandpapa was saying as the young people had left them and the others had wandered off to enjoy the quiet shady paths this place was the old Foret de Rouvray 
5054_18527_000063_000001	train-clean-360	It wasn t a very pretty place to come to in those days what with the robbers and other bad people who infested it 
5054_18527_000063_000002	train-clean-360	And now let us go and find a seat child and I ll show you one or two little pictures I picked up in the shop this morning and you can send them in your next letter to Joel and David if you like 
none	none	Old mister King took out his pocket book and had just opened it when a man darted out from the thick shrubbery behind him cast a long searching glance around and quick as lightning threw himself against the stately old gentleman and seized the pocket book It was then that Phronsie screamed long and loud What ho exclaimed mister King starting around to do battle but the man was just disappearing around the clump of shrubbery Which way Tom Selwyn dashed up It didn t seem as if Phronsie s cry had died on her lips Old mister King pointed without a word And Polly and Jasper were close at hand 
5054_18527_000068_000002	train-clean-360	Polly flew to Phronsie who was clinging to Grandpapa s hand and wailing bitterly 
none	none	What is it Oh what is it cried Polly
5054_18527_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 My pocket book said Grandpapa some fellow has seized it and frightened this poor child almost to death He seemed to care a great deal more about that than any loss of the money 
none	none	Which way cried Jasper in his turn and was off like a shot on getting his answer 
5054_18527_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Tom saw the fellow slink with the manner of one who knew the ins and outs of the place well now gliding and ducking low in the sparser growth now making a bold run around some exposed curve now dashing into a dense part of the wood 
5054_18527_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll have you yet said Tom through set teeth I haven t trained at school for nothing 
5054_18527_000073_000000	train-clean-360	A thud of fast flying feet in his rear didn t divert him an instant from his game although it might be a rescue party for the thief in the shape of a partner who could tell 
5054_18527_000073_000001	train-clean-360	And realising if he caught the man at all he must do one of his sprints he covered the ground by a series of flying leaps dashed in where he saw his prey rush one more leap with all his might and I have you cried Tom 
5054_18527_000074_000000	train-clean-360	The man under him thrown to the ground by the suddenness of Tom s leap on him was wriggling and squirming with all the desperation of a trapped creature when the individual with the flying footsteps hove in sight 
none	none	It was Jasper 
5054_18527_000074_000002	train-clean-360	And they had just persuaded the robber that it would be useless to struggle longer against his fate when the parson running as he hadn t run for years appeared to their view 
5054_18527_000074_000003	train-clean-360	And after him at such a gait that would have been his fortune in a professional way was the little doctor 
5054_18527_000074_000004	train-clean-360	His hat was gone and his toes scarcely seemed to touch the ground 
none	none	He was last at the scene simply because the news had only just reached him as he sauntered leisurely up to meet mister King in his promenade 
5054_18527_000075_000000	train-clean-360	When the thief saw him he looked to see if any more were coming and resigned himself at once and closed his eyes instinctively 
none	none	He was a miserable looking man tall thin and stoop shouldered they saw when they got him on his feet 
5054_18527_000076_000001	train-clean-360	Unkempt and unwashed his long black hair hung around a face sallow in the extreme 
none	none	And he shook so as Tom and Jasper marched him back escorted by the body guard of the parson and the little doctor that the two boys put their hands under his arms to help him along Well well well ejaculated mister King as he saw this array Polly gathered Phronsie s other hand in hers while she clung closer than ever to Grandpapa Here s your pocket book said Tom handing the article over he hasn t spent much
5054_18527_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t Tom said Jasper joke about it 
5054_18527_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Can t help it said Tom 
none	none	Well now shall we turn him over to the sergents de ville
5054_18527_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Turn him over repeated mister King 
5054_18527_000081_000001	train-clean-360	 I should say so he added drily and give him the best recommendation for a long term too 
none	none	What else is there to do pray tell
5054_18527_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Grandpapa suddenly cried Phronsie who hadn t taken her eyes from the man s face what are you going to do where is he going 
none	none	We are going to hand him over to the police child answered old mister King harshly
5054_18527_000083_000001	train-clean-360	 And as soon as possible too 
none	none	Grandpapa perhaps he s got some little children at home ask him Grandpapa do
5054_18527_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 No no Phronsie said mister King hastily 
5054_18527_000085_000001	train-clean-360	 Say no more child you don t understand 
none	none	We must call the sergents de ville At the words sergents de ville the man shivered from head to foot and wrenched his hands free from the boys grasp to tear open his poor coat and show a bare breast covered with little apparently but the skin drawn over the bones He didn t attempt to say anything
5054_18527_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh my goodness exclaimed old mister King starting backward and putting up his hands to his face to shut out the sight 
5054_18527_000087_000001	train-clean-360	 Cover it up man bless me no need to ask him a question 
5054_18527_000087_000002	train-clean-360	Why the fellow is starving 
none	none	His little children four of them his wife all starving hadn t a bit to eat since he could scarcely say when it seemed so very long ago since he had eaten last it all came out in a torrent of words that choked him and like the true Frenchman that he was he gestured in a way that told the story with his face and his fingers as well as with his tongue A sergent de ville strolled by and looked curiously at the group but as mister King met his eye coolly and the party seemed intelligent and well able to take care of themselves it wasn t necessary to tender his services if they were talking to a worthless vagabond
5054_18527_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Hum hum very bad case very bad case indeed mister King was exploding at intervals while the torrent was rushing on in execrable French as far as accent went 
none	none	No one else of the spellbound group could have spoken if there had been occasion for a word Then he pulled out the pocket book again and taking out several franc notes of a good size he pressed them between the man s dirty fingers Go and get something to eat was all he said and take care of the children XVII I VE FOUND HIM EXCLAIMED JASPER And for the next few days Phronsie talked about the poor man and wished they could see his children and hoped he had bought them some nice things to eat and worried over him because he was all skin and bones Ah the bones were real even if the children aren t Grandpapa would say to himself Well I suppose I have been taken in but at least the fellow hasn t starved to death And then off they would go sight seeing as fast as possible to take up the mind of Phronsie who watched for Grandpapa s poor man in every wretched creature she saw And there were plenty of them And then Adela went back to school happy in the thought of the little pile of sketches she had to show as her summer s work and with ever so many studies and bits to finish up under Mademoiselle s direction and little old missus Gray breathing blessings on mister King s head departed for her English country home Now then I have ever so much shopping to do announced old mister King briskly and I shall want you to help me Phronsie I ll help you Grandpapa promised Phronsie well pleased and gravely set herself to the task So they wandered away by themselves having the most blissful of times and coming home to the hotel they would gaily relate their adventures and Phronsie would often carry a little parcel or two which it was her greatest delight to do and then the trail of big boxes would follow them as they were sent home to the hotel to tell of their experiences in the shops And Grandpapa is going to get me a new doll announced Phronsie on one of these days Do you mean a peasant doll to add to the collection asked Polly for old mister King had bought a doll in the national costume in every country in which they had travelled and they had been packed away together with the other things as fast as purchased and sent off home across the sea Yes said Phronsie I do Polly and it s to be a most beautiful French doll oh And sure enough mister King who knew exactly what kind of a doll he meant to purchase and had kept his eyes open for it stumbled upon it by a piece of rare good luck in a shop where he least expected to find it Oh may I carry her home Grandpapa begged Phronsie hanging over the doll in a transport Please don t have her shut up in a box but do let me carry her in my arms Oh Phronsie she s too big objected mister King and very heavy Oh Grandpapa she s not heavy cried Phronsie not meaning to contradict but so anxious not to have her child sent home shut up in a box that she forgot herself Well I don t know but what you may said Grandpapa relenting I will call a cab after we get through with this next shop he reflected and it won t hurt her to carry the doll that short distance So they came out of the shop and deciding to take a short cut they started across the boulevard he taking the usual precaution to gather Phronsie s hand in his As they were halfway across the street with its constant stream of pedestrians and vehicles a sudden gust of wind flapped the doll s pink silk cape up against Phronsie s eyes and taking her hand away from Grandpapa s a second to pull down the cape for she couldn t see she slipped and before she knew it had fallen on top of the doll in the middle of the street A reckless cabby driving as only a French cabman can came dashing down the boulevard directly in her path while a heavily loaded omnibus going in the opposite direction was trying to get out of his way Ever so many people screamed and some one pulled mister King back as he started to pick her up It was all done in an instant and every person expected to see her killed when a long gaunt individual in a shabby coat dashed in among the plunging horses knocked up the head of the one belonging to the reckless cabby swung an arm at the other pair to divert their course and before any one could quite tell how he picked up Phronsie and bore her to the curbstone Some one got mister King to the same point too exhausted with fright to utter a word When he came out of his shock the shabby man was standing by Phronsie the crowd that saw nothing in the incident to promise further diversion having melted away and she was holding his hand her little mud stained face radiant with happiness Oh Grandpapa she piped out it s your poor man The dickens it is exploded mister King Well I m glad to find you Here call a cab will you I must get this child home that s the first thing to be done The shabby man hailed a cab but the cabman jeered at him and whirled by So the old gentleman held up his hand Phronsie all this time strange to say not mentioning her doll and mister King who wouldn t have cared if a hundred dolls had been left behind not giving it a thought Now she looked anxiously on all sides Oh where is she Grandpapa dear she wailed my child where is she Never mind Phronsie cried mister King I ll get you another one to morrow There get in the cab child But I want her I can t go home without my child And Phronsie s lip began to quiver Oh there she is Grandpapa and she darted off a few steps where somebody had set the poor thing on the pavement propped up against a lamp post Oh you can t carry her home said mister King in dismay at the muddy object splashed from head to foot with the smart pink cape that had been the cause of the disaster now torn clear through the middle by the hoof of a passing horse He shuddered at the sight of it Do leave it Phronsie child But she s sick now and hurt oh Grandpapa I can t leave my child sobbed Phronsie trying with all her might to keep the tears back All this time the shabby man stood silently by looking on A bright thought struck the old gentleman I ll tell you Phronsie he said quickly Give the doll to this man for one of his little children they ll take care of it and like it Oh Grandpapa screamed Phronsie skipping up and down and clapping her muddy little hands then she picked up the doll and lifted it toward him Give my child to your little girl and tell her to take good care of it she said As Phronsie s French had long been one of Grandpapa s special responsibilities in the morning hours she spoke it nearly as well as Polly herself so the man grasped the doll as he had seized the money before And now said mister King you are not going to run away this time without telling me oh bless me This last was brought out by an excited individual rushing up over the curbstone to get out of the way of a passing dray and the walking stick which he swung aloft as a protection coming into collision with mister King s hat knocked it over his eyes A thousand pardons Monsieur exclaimed the Frenchman bowing and scraping You may well beg a thousand pardons cried mister King angrily to go about in this rude fashion through the street A thousand pardons repeated the Frenchman with more empressement than before and tripping airily on his way When old mister King had settled his hat he turned back to the man Now tell me why The man was nowhere to be seen It surely does look bad said the old gentleman to himself as he stepped into the cab with Phronsie that man s children are a myth And I wanted to do something for them for he saved Phronsie s life This being the only idea he could possibly retain all the way home to the hotel he held her closely within his arm Phronsie chattering happily all the way how the little girl she guessed was just receiving the doll and wondering what name she would give it and would she wash its face clean at once and fix the torn and muddy clothes Oh yes yes I hope so answered Grandpapa when she paused for an answer Jasper came running out as the cab drove into the court Oh he exclaimed at sight of Phronsie s face then drove the words on his tongue back again as he lifted her out Give her to Polly to fix up a bit said his father She s all right Jasper my boy I can t talk of it now Hurry and take her to Polly And for the following days mister King never let Phronsie out of his sight A new and more splendid doll if possible was bought and all sorts and styles of clothes for it which Phronsie took the greatest delight in caring for humming happily to herself at the pleasure the poor man s little girl was taking at the same time with her other child Grandpapa she said laying down the doll carefully on the sofa and going over to the table where mister King had just put aside the newspaper I do wish we could go and see that poor man and all his children why didn t he tell us where he lived The dickens exclaimed old mister King unguardedly because the fellow is an impostor Phronsie He saved your life and he seized Phronsie and drew her to his knee but he lied about those children O dear me And he pulled himself up Then he hasn t any little children said Phronsie opening her eyes very wide and speaking very slowly Er oh I don t know stammered Grandpapa it s impossible to tell Phronsie But you don t believe he has any said Phronsie with grave persistence fastening her brown eyes on his face No Phronsie I don t replied old mister King in desperation If he had why should he run in this fashion when I was just asking him where he lived But he didn t hear you Grandpapa said Phronsie when the man knocked your hat off Oh well he knew enough what I wanted said mister King who now that he had let out his belief was going to support it by all the reasons in his power No no Phronsie it won t do the fellow was an impostor and we must just accept the fact and make the best of it my child But he told a lie said Phronsie in horror unable to think of anything else Well mister King had no words to say on that score so he wisely said nothing That poor man told a lie repeated Phronsie as if producing a wholly fresh statement There child I wouldn t think anything more of it said Grandpapa soothingly patting her little hand Grandpapa said Phronsie I ve given away my child and she s sick because she fell and hurt her and there isn t any little girl and and that poor man told a lie And she flung herself up against Grandpapa s waistcoat and sobbed as if her heart would break Old mister King looked wildly around for Polly And as good fortune would have it in she ran This wasn t very strange for Polly kept nearly as close to Phronsie in these days as Grandpapa himself Here Polly he called brokenly this is something beyond me You must fix it child Why Phronsie exclaimed Polly in dismay and her tone was a bit reproachful Crying Don t you know that you will make Grandpapa very sick unless you stop Phronsie s little hand stole out from over her mouth where she had been trying to hold the sobs back and up to give a trembling pat on old mister King s cheek Bless you my child cried Grandpapa quite overcome so that Polly said more reproachfully Yes very sick indeed Phronsie unless you stop this minute You ought to see his face Phronsie Phronsie gathered herself up out of his arms and through a rain of tears looked up at him Are you sick Grandpapa she managed to ask Yes dear or I shall be if you don t stop crying Phronsie said mister King pursuing all the advantage so finely gained I ll stop said Phronsie her small bosom heaving I really will Grandpapa Now you are the very goodest child exclaimed Polly down on her knees by Grandpapa s side cuddling Phronsie s toes the very most splendid one in all this world Phronsie Pepper And you ll be all well Grandpapa asked Phronsie anxiously Yes child said old mister King kissing her wet face just as well as I can be since you are all right And oh Grandpapa can t we go to Fontainebleau to day begged Polly Phronsie just think it will be precisely like the country and we can get out of the carriages and can run and race in the forest Can t we Grandpapa All you want to promised Grandpapa recklessly and only too thankful to have something proposed for a diversion The very thing he added enthusiastically Now Polly and Phronsie run and tell all the others to get ready just as fast as they can and we ll be off Goodness me Jasper what makes you run into a room in this fashion I ve found him exclaimed Jasper dashing in and tossing his cap on the table and his dark hair back from his forehead And he s all right as straight as a die he panted Now what in the world are you talking of demanded his father in extreme irritation Can t you make a plain statement and enlighten us without all this noise and confusion pray tell Polly who had Phronsie s hand in hers just ready to run off stood quite still with glowing cheek Oh I do believe Grandpapa it is it is she screamed suddenly your poor man Isn t it Jasper isn t it she cried turning to him Yes Polly said Jasper still panting from his run up the stairs and do hurry father and see for yourself and we ll all go to him I ll tell you all about it on the way When mister King comprehended that the man was found and that he was all right as Jasper vehemently repeated over and over he communicated that fact to Phronsie whose delight knew no bounds and in less time than it takes to write it Tom who was the only one of the party to be collected on such short notice had joined them and they were bowling along in a big carriage Jasper as guide to the spot where the man was waiting You see it was just this way Jasper was rapidly telling off I was going down by the Madeleine and I thought I would bring Phronsie some flowers so I stopped at the market and I couldn t find a little pot of primroses I wanted though I went the whole length and at last when I had given up I saw just one in front of a woman who sat at the very end Do hurry Jasper and get to the conclusion said his father impatiently Polly dearly loved to have the story go on in just this way as she leaned forward her eyes on Jasper s face but she said nothing only sighed Well said Jasper I ll tell it as quickly as I can father And there were a lot of children father all round the woman where she sat on a box and she was tying in a bunch some flowers that were huddled in her lap and the children were picking out the good ones for her and just then a man who was bending over back of them all breaking off some little branches from a big green one straightened up suddenly and father as true as you live cried Jasper in intense excitement it was your poor man The children asked mister King as soon as he could be heard for the excitement Are all his cried Jasper and he took the money you gave him and set his wife up in the flower business down in front of the Madeleine Oh and Phronsie the doll you gave him was sitting up on another box and every once in a while the littlest girl would stop picking out the flowers in her mother s lap and would run over and wipe its face with her apron XXVIII WELL I GOT HIM HERE SAID THE LITTLE EARL They were really on their way to see the little old earl after all How it came about mister King even days after it had all been decided couldn t exactly remember He recalled several conversations in Paris with Tom s mother who showed him bits of letters and one in particular that somehow seemed to be a very potent factor in the plan that almost before he knew it came to be made And when he held out as hold out he did against the acceptance of the invitation he found to his utmost surprise that every one Mother Fisher and all was decidedly against him Oh well he had declared when that came out I might as well give in gracefully first as last And he sat down at once and wrote a very handsome note to the little old earl and that clinched the whole business And after the week of this visit should be over for old mister King was firmness itself on not accepting a day more they were to bid good by to missus Selwyn and Tom and jaunt about a bit to show a little of Old England to the Hendersons and then run down to Liverpool to see them off and at last turn their faces toward Dresden their winter home and to my work said Polly to herself in delight So now here they were actually driving up to the entrance of the park and stopping at the lodge gate An old woman in an immaculate cap and a stiff white apron over her best linsey woolsey gown which she had donned for the occasion came out of the lodge and courtesied low to the madam and held open the big gate How have you been missus Bell asked missus Selwyn with a kind smile as the carriage paused a bit Very well my lady said missus Bell her round face glowing with pride And the earl is well bless him and we are glad to welcome you home again and Master Tom And I m glad enough to get here missus Bell cried Tom Now drive on at your fastest Hobson Hobson who knew very well what Master Tom s fastest gait was preferred to drive through the park at what he considered the dignified pace So they rolled on under the stately trees going miles it seemed to Polly who sat on the back seat with Tom He turned to her unable to conceal his impatience Anybody would think this pair were worn out old cobs he fumed Polly you have no idea how they can go when Hobson lets them out What are you wasting all this time for crawling along in this fashion Hobson when you know we want to get on Thus publicly addressed Hobson let the handsome bays go as Tom expressed it and they were bowled along in a way that made Polly turn in delight to Tom There that s something like declared Tom Don t you like it Polly looking into her rosy face Like it cried Polly why Tom Selwyn it s beautiful And these splendid trees she looked up and around Oh I never saw any so fine They re not half bad assented Tom these oaks aren t and we have some more on the other end of the park about five miles off that Five miles off cried Polly with wide eyes Is the park as big as that Tom He laughed That isn t much But you ll see it all for yourself he added Then he rushed off into wondering how his dogs were And oh you ll ride with the hounds Polly Just then some rabbits scurried across the wood followed by several more pattering and leaping through the grass Oh Tom see those rabbits cried Polly excitedly Yes the warrens are over yonder said Tom bobbing his head in the right direction What asked Polly in perplexity Rabbit warrens oh I forgot you haven t lived in England You seem so much like an English girl though said Tom paying the highest compliment he knew of Well what are they asked Polly quite overcome by the compliment coming from Tom Oh they are preserves you know where the rabbits live and they are not allowed to be hunted here Oh do you ever hunt rabbits cried Polly in horror leaning out of her side of the big coach to see the scurrying little animals Not often said Tom we mostly ride after the fox You ll ride with the hounds Polly he cried with enthusiasm We ll have a hunt while you re here and we always wind up with a breakfast you know Oh we ll have no end of sport He hugged his long arms in huge satisfaction And away and away over the winding road and underneath the stately trees rolled the big coach to be followed by the other carriages like a dream it seemed to Polly and more than ever when at last they stopped in front of a massive pile of buildings with towers and arches and wings And the little old earl was kissing her rosy cheek in the most courtly fashion and saying while he shook her hand in his long fingers And how do you do my dear And missus Selwyn was by his other side And Tom was screeching out How do you do Granddaddy And then Oh Elinor and Mary to two quiet plain looking girls standing in the background And Ah how d ye kids as the faces of his two small brothers appeared And Polly forgot all about the fact that she was in an earl s house and she laughed and chatted and in two minutes one of Tom s sisters was on either side of her and the small boys in front and the little groups were moving in and out of the old hall as Grandpapa and the rest came in and the head housekeeper in a black silk gown that seemed quite able to stand alone and a perfect relay of stiff figures in livery were drawn up underneath the armour hanging on the wall And the little old earl worked his way up to her and he had Grandpapa on his arm Well I got him here he said with twinkling eyes and a chuckle But the next morning oh the next morning when Polly tried to compass as much of the thronging attractions as she could and Jasper was at his wits end whenever he was appealed to to decide what he wanted to do first cricket or punting on the river that ran through the estate or riding through the park and to the village owned by his grandfather I always go see the tenantry as soon as I get home said Tom simply Oh then let us go there by all means said Jasper quickly I mean oh I m no end awkward exclaimed Tom breaking off his face covered with confusion It s not necessary to go at once we can fetch up there to morrow Oh do let us go Tom begged Polly clasping her hands I should dearly love most of all to see the tenantry and those dear little cottages And so that was decided upon And Tom had his beloved hunt several of the gentry being asked And Polly rode a special horse selected by the little old earl himself It s perfectly safe he has an excellent disposition he declared to old mister King and he ll carry her all right I m not afraid said mister King the child rides well So she must so she must I was sure of it cried the little old earl with a series of chuckles And he busied himself especially with seeing her mounted properly when the party gathered on the lawn in front of the old hall The hounds were baying and straining at the leashes impatient to be off the pink hunting coats gave dashes of colour as their owners moved about over the broad green sward under the oaks and Polly felt her heart beat rapidly with the exhilarating sights and sounds It was only when they were off and Tom riding up by her side expatiated on the glory of running down the fox and being in at the death that the colour died down on her cheek Oh Tom she said reining in her horse If he hadn t been the possessor of a good disposition he certainly would have bolted in his disappointment at being pulled up so abruptly It s so cruel to kill the poor fox in that way Eh what exclaimed Tom not hearing the words falling back to her side consternation all over his face Why I never knew Meteor to break in this way before Oh it isn t his fault said Polly hastily and patting her horse s neck I pulled him up Oh Tom it s all so very cruel Eh said Tom in a puzzled way To kill the fox in this way said Polly her heart sinking as she thought how dreadful it was for her to object when visiting to anything her host might plan O dear me and she looked so distressed that Tom turned comforter at once We all do it he was saying as Jasper rode up Anything the matter he asked in great concern What s happened Nothing said Tom only Polly doesn t like the fox hunt It s so cruel cried Polly turning to Jasper with a little pink spot coming in either cheek I ought to have thought of it before but I didn t it only seemed so very splendid to be rushing along with the horses and dogs But to chase that poor fox to death O dear me We ll go back suggested Tom in distress don t be afraid Polly I ll make it all right with granddaddy He concealed as best he might his awful disappointment as the echoes of the horn the baying of the dogs and now and then a scrap of chatter or a peal of laughter was borne to them on the wind Polly said Jasper in a low voice it isn t quite right is it to disturb the party now Just think Tom will go back with us The pink spots died out on Polly s cheek No Jasper she said it isn t right Tom you needn t say one word about going back for I am going on She gave the rein to Meteor and dashed off We ll have a race through the park some day Polly called Tom as he sped after her without any fox Too bad Polly you weren t in at the death said the little old earl sympathisingly when at the hunt breakfast following the brush dangling to a victorious young lady s belt had been admired as an extremely fine one Never mind better luck next time little girl But the fete to the tenantry oh that was something like and more to Polly s taste when this annual affair postponed while Tom s mother and Tom were away took place For days before the preparations had been making the stewards up to their eyes in responsibility to carry out the plans of the little old earl who meant on this occasion to outdo all his former efforts and show his American friends how an Englishman treats those under his care Oh the big joints of beef the haunches of venison the fowls the meat pies and the gooseberry tarts the beer and the ale and the tea for the old women with nuts and sweeties for the children Oh Polly knew about it all as she went about with the little old earl while he gave his orders her hand in his just as if she were no older than Phronsie and not such a tall big girl And missus Selwyn was busy as a bee and Mother Fisher was just in her element here in helping her for flannel petticoats were to be given out and stuff frocks and pieces of homespun and boots and shoes as prizes for diligent and faithful service or an order for coals for the coming winter for some poor cottager or packages of tea or some other little comfort And before any of them quite realised it the days flew by and in two more of them the King party would be off It s perfectly useless to mention it said the little old earl quite confident in his power to influence old mister King to remain when he saw how happily everything was running on My dear sir you were asked for a fortnight And I accepted for a week retorted mister King and I go when that time is up We ve had a visit I can t express it to you what a fine time as near to perfection as it is possible for a visit to be but day after to morrow we surely must leave Tom was so despondent as well as the old earl that it was necessary to cheer him up in some way Just think what a splendid thing for us to be in the midst of that fete for the peasantry exclaimed Polly with sparkling eyes It s quite too lovely for our last day But Tom wasn t to be raised out of his gloom in this way We ve had only one game of cricket he said miserably And one afternoon at tennis and we ve been out punting on the river three times said Polly What s that only a bagatelle sniffed Tom compared to what I meant to do Well let s have the race on horseback this afternoon proposed Polly down through the park that you said you were going to have Tom Wouldn t that be nice Do urged Jasper It would be so capital Tom All right assented Tom if you d really rather have that than anything else but it seems as if I ought to think up something more for the last afternoon but the fete and that doesn t count Oh nothing could be finer declared Polly and Jasper joined So Tom rushed off to the stables to give the orders And Polly on Meteor was soon flying up and down with the boys and Elinor and Mary And the two small lads trotted after on their Shetland ponies in and out the winding roads of the park confines without any haunting fear of a poor red fox to be done to death at the end And on the morrow the sun condescended to come out in all his glory upon the groups of tenantry scattered over the broad lawns There were games in abundance for the men and boys and others for the children There were chairs for the old women and long benches for those who desired to sit under the spreading branches of the great oaks to look on And there were cups of tea and thin bread and butter passed around by the white capped maids superintended by the housekeeper and the butler quite important in their several functions This was done to appease the hunger before the grand collation should take place later And there was music by the fiddlers on the upper terrace and there was dear me it would take quite too long to tell it all And at last the order was given to fall into line and march around the long tables resplendent with their cold joints and hot joints their pasties and tarts and cakes and great flagons of ale And over all was a wealth of bloom from the big old English gardens in the rear of the old hall The posies filled Polly with delight as she and Tom s sisters and Phronsie had gathered them under the direction of the gardeners in the early morning and then oh best of all missus Selwyn had allowed her to give the finishing touches to them as they became the decoration for the feast And the little old earl called the large assemblage to order and the vicar asked the grace and the feast was begun And then one of the tenants found his feet and leaning on his staff he thanked the Earl of Cavendish for all his goodness and he hoped there would be many blessings in store for im and is and sank on his bench again mopping his face with his big red handkerchief And then the little old earl responded in as pretty a speech as could well be imagined in which he forgot nothing that he ought to say And there were many God bless ims to follow it and then there were cries of Master Tom Master Tom who appeared to be an immense favourite and the earl well pleased pulled him forward saying Go ahead youngster and give it to them And Tom extremely red in the face tried to duck away but found himself instead in front of the longest table with everybody looking at him And he mumbled out a few words and bobbed his head And every one was just as well pleased And then they gave cheer on cheer for the earl and as many more for his oldest grandson And then the little old earl raised his hand and said And now my men give a rousing good one for my dear American friends And didn t they do it And on the following morning the old hall with its towers and its wings had only the memory of the happy week to sustain it Jasper ran up to Polly on the deck We ought to go he said the order has been given to leave the steamer Yes Polly said Mother Fisher we must go child Give my love to dear Grandma Bascom said Polly for about the fiftieth time Oh missus Henderson and don t forget to take over the new cap just as soon as you can will you I won t forget promised the parson s wife And take mine to my dear missus Beebe begged Phronsie twitching gently at missus Henderson s sleeve and tell her I got pink ribbon because I know she loves that best I won t forget said missus Henderson again Oh and give the big handkerchief to my dear mister Beebe said Phronsie please missus Henderson to tie his throat up in because you know he says it gets so cold when he goes out I ll remember every single thing promised the parson s wife Don t you worry children Oh how we hate to leave you only we are going to see our boys We really are Polly And her eyes shone Polly Polly called Jasper All off who aren t going roared the order out again Polly The little doctor seized one arm and Phronsie s hand There now here you are and whisked them off amid good by good by and a flutter of handkerchiefs And give my love to dear Grandma Bascom piped Phronsie on the wharf by old mister King s side as the big steamer slowly pushed from its moorings End of Project Gutenberg s Five Little Peppers Abroad by Margaret Sidney END OF THIS PROJECT
