certified that he died from natural causes heart failure That is what the world believes of course His death was a nation s loss and the truth was hushed up But you Phil Poland know it Upon the floor was found something a cigar eh Nothing very extraordinary in that surely He died while smoking Yes said the bald headed man bending towards the other and lowering his voice into a harsh whisper He died while smoking a cigar a cigar that had been poisoned You know it well enough What s the use of trying to affect ignorance with me Well asked Philip Poland after a brief pause his brows knit darkly and his face drawn and pale Well I merely wish to recall that somewhat unpleasant fact and to tell you that I know the truth said the other with slow deliberation his eyes fixed upon the man seated opposite him Why recall unpleasant facts asked Poland with a faint attempt to smile I never do A brief memory is always an advantage remarked Arnold Du Cane with a sinister grin Ah I quite follow you Poland said with a hardness of the mouth But I tell you Arnold I refuse to lend any hand in this crooked bit of business you ve just put before me Let s talk of something else Crooked business indeed Fancy you Phil Poland denouncing it as crooked he laughed And I m a crook I suppose and he thoughtfully caressed his small moustache which bore traces of having been artificially darkened I didn t say so But you implied it Bah You ll be teaching the Sunday School of this delightful English village of yours before long I expect No doubt the villagers believe the gentleman at the Elms to be a model of every virtue especially when he wears a frock coat and trots around with the plate in church on Sundays he sneered My hat Fancy you Phil turning honest in your old age I admit that I m trying to be honest Arnold for the girl s sake And by Jove if the good people here in Middleton knew the truth eh the truth that you Hush Somebody may overhear cried the other starting and glancing apprehensively at the closed door of his cosy study What s the use of discussing the business further I ve told you once and for all Arnold that I refuse to be a party to any such dastardly transaction Ho ho laughed Du Cane Why wasn t the Burke affair an equally blackguardly bit of business the more so indeed when one recollects that young Ronald Burke had fallen in love with Sonia Leave my girl s name out of our conversation Arnold or by Gad you shall pay for it cried the tall dark haired clean shaven man as he sprang from his chair and faced his visitor threateningly Taunt me as much as ever it pleases you Allege what you like against me I know I m an infernal blackguard posing here as a smug and respectable churchgoer I admit any charge you like to lay at my door but I ll not have my girl s name associated with my misdeeds Understand that She s pure and honest and she knows nothing of her father s life Don t you believe that my dear fellow She s eighteen now remember and I fancy she had her eyes opened last February down at the Villa Vespa when that unfortunate little trouble arose Arnold Du Cane the round faced man who spoke was rather short and stout with ruddy cheeks a small moustache and a prematurely bald head a man whose countenance showed him to be a bon vivant but whose quick shifty eyes would have betrayed to a close observer a readiness of subterfuge which would have probably aroused suspicion His exterior was that of a highly refined and polished man His grey tweed suit bore evidence of having been cut by a smart tailor and as he lolled back in his big saddle bag chair he contemplated the fine diamond upon his white well manicured hand and seemed entirely at his ease That August afternoon was stiflingly hot and through the open French windows leading into the old world garden so typically English with its level lawns neatly trimmed box hedges and blazing flowerbeds came the drowsy hum of the insects and the sweet scent of a wealth of roses everywhere The pretty house in which his host Philip Poland alias Louis Lessar lived stood back a little distance from the London road two miles or so out of the quiet market town of Andover a small picturesque old place surrounded by high old elms wherein the rooks cawed incessantly and commanding extensive views over Harewood Forest and the undulating meadow lands around while close by at the foot of the hill nestled a cluster of homely thatched cottages with a square church tower the obscure village of Middleton In that rural retreat lived the Honourable Philip Poland beneath a cloak of highest respectability The Elms was indeed delightful after the glare and glitter of that fevered life he so often led and here with his only child Sonia to whom he was so entirely devoted he lived as a gentleman of leisure Seldom he went to London and hardly ever called upon his neighbours With Sonia he led a most retired existence reading much fishing a little and taking long walks or cycling with his daughter and her fox terrier Spot over all the country side To the village he had been somewhat of a mystery ever since he had taken the house three years before Yet being apparently comfortably off subscribing to every charity and a regular attendant at Middleton church the simple country folk had grown to tolerate him even though he was somewhat of a recluse Country folk are very slow to accept the stranger at his own valuation Little did they dream that when he went away each winter he went with a mysterious purpose that the source of his income was a mystery As he stood there leaning against the roll top writing table of his prettily furnished little study and facing the man who had travelled half across Europe to see him Phil Poland with clean shaven face and closely cropped hair tinged with grey presented the smart and dapper appearance of a typical British naval officer as indeed he had been for prior to his downfall he had been first lieutenant on board one of his Majesty s first class cruisers His had been a strangely adventurous career his past being one that would not bear investigation In the smart go ahead set wherein he had moved when he was still in the Navy opinion regarding him had been divided There were some who refused to believe the truth of the scandals circulated concerning him while others believed and quickly embellished the reports which ran through the service clubs and ward rooms Once he had been one of the most popular officers afloat yet to day well he found it convenient to thus efface himself in rural Hampshire and live alone with the sweet young girl who was all in all to him and who was happy in her belief that her devoted father was a gentleman This girl with the blue eyes and hair of sunshine was the only link between Phil Poland and his past that past when he held a brilliant record as a sailor and had been honoured and respected He held her aloof from every one being ever in deadly fear lest by some chance word she should learn the bitter truth the truth concerning that despicable part which he had been compelled to play Ah yes his was a bitter story indeed Before Sonia should know the truth he would take his own life She was the only person remaining dear to him the only one for whom he had a single thought or care the only person left to him to respect and to love Her influence upon him was always for good For the past year he had been striving to cut himself adrift from evil to reform to hold back from participating in any dishonest action for her dear sake Her soft spoken words so often caused him to hate himself and to bite his lip in regret for surely she was as entirely ignorant of the hideous truth as mister Shuttleworth the white headed parson or the rustic villagers themselves Yes Phil Poland s position was indeed a strange one What Du Cane had just suggested to him would he saw put at least twenty thousand pounds into the pockets of their ingenious combination yet he had refused refused because of the fair headed girl he loved so well Within himself he had made a solemn vow to reform Reformation would probably mean a six roomed cottage with a maid of all work yet even that would be preferable to a continuance of the present mode of life Bitter memories had of late constantly arisen within him Certain scenes of violence even of tragedy in that beautiful flower embowered villa beside the Mediterranean at Beaulieu half way between Nice and Monte Carlo had recurred vividly to him He was unable to wipe those horrible visions from the tablets of his memory He had realized at last what a pitiless blackguard he had been so he had resolved to end it all And now just as he had made up his mind Arnold Du Cane had arrived unexpectedly from Milan with an entirely new and original scheme one in which the risk of detection was infinitesimal while the stakes were high enough to merit serious consideration He had refused to be a party to the transaction whereupon Du Cane had revived a subject which he had fondly believed to be buried for ever that terrible affair which had startled and mystified the whole world and which had had such an important political bearing that by it the destinies of a great nation had actually been changed A certain man a great man had died but until that hour Phil Poland s connection with the tragedy had never been suspected Yet from what Arnold Du Cane had just said he saw that the truth was actually known and he realized that his own position was now one of distinct insecurity He was silent full of wonder How could Arnold have gained his knowledge What did he know How much did he know The strength of his defiance must be gauged upon the extent of Arnold s knowledge He set his teeth hard The scandal was one which must never see the light of day he told himself Upon the suppression of the true facts depended the honour and welfare of a nation Arnold Du Cane knew the truth Of that there could be no doubt Did he intend to use this knowledge in order to secure his assistance in this latest dastardly scheme At last after a long silence Poland asked in as cool a voice as he could What causes you to suspect that Sonia knows anything Well replied this crafty round faced visitor considering how that young Russian let out at you when you were walking with her that moonlight night out in the garden I don t think there can be much doubt that she is fully aware of the mysterious source of her father s income Sonia doesn t know Russian The fellow spoke in that language I remember was his reply Yet I was a fool I know to have taken her over that accursed place that hell in paradise She is always perfectly happy at the Hotel de Luxembourg at Nice where each season she makes some pleasant friends and never suspects the reason of my absences All of us are fools at times Phil was his visitor s response as he selected a fresh cigar from the silver box upon the table and slowly lit it But he went on I do really think you are going too far in expecting that you can conceal the truth from the girl much longer She isn t a child you must recollect She must never know cried the unhappy man in a hoarse voice By Gad she must never know of my shame Arnold Then go in with us in this new affair It ll pay you well No he cried I I feel that I can t I couldn t face her if she knew Her mother was one of the best and purest women who ever lived and Of course of course I know all that my dear fellow cried the other hastily I know all the tragedy of your marriage but that s years ago Let the past bury itself and have an eye to the main chance and the future Just take my advice Phil Drop all this humbug about your girl and her feelings if she learnt her father s real profession She ll know it one day that s certain You surely aren t going to allow her to stand in your way and prevent you from participating in what is real good solid business eh You want money you know I ve given my answer was the man s brief response Then a silence fell between the pair of well dressed cosmopolitans a dead painful silence broken only by the low hum of the insects the buzzing of a fly upon the window pane and the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the corner Reflect urged Du Cane at last as he rose to his feet Then lowering his voice he said in a hoarse whisper You may find yourself in a corner over that affair of young Burke If so it s only I and my friends who could prove an alibi Remember that And you offer that in return for my assistance Poland said reflectively hesitating for a moment and turning to the window His visitor nodded in the affirmative Next second the man to whom those terms had been offered quickly faced his friend His countenance was haggard blanched to the lips for he had been quick to realize the full meaning of that covert threat Arnold he said in a hoarse strained voice full of bitter reproach you may turn upon me give me away to the police tell them the truth but my decision remains the same I will lend no hand in that affair You are prepared to face arrest eh If it is your will yes And your daughter That is my own affair Very well then As you will was the bald headed man s response as he put on his grey felt hat and taking his stick strode through the open French windows and disappeared Phil Poland stood rigid as a statue The blow had fallen His secret was out He sprang forward towards the garden in order to recall his visitor But next instant he drew himself back No Now that the friend whom he had trusted had turned upon him he would face the music rather than add another crime to his discredit and dishonour Philip Poland alias Louis Lessar and half a score of other names halted and raised his pale repentant face to Heaven for help and guidance II CONCERNS TWO STRANGERS That night Phil Poland glanced longingly around the well furnished dining room with its white napery its antique plate and its great bowl of yellow roses in the centre of the table between the silver candelabra with white silk shades Alone he sat at his dinner being waited upon by Felix the thin faced silent Frenchman in black who was so devoted to his master and so faithful in his service It was the last time he would eat his dinner there he reflected The choice of two things lay before him flight or arrest Sonia was on a visit to an old school fellow in London and would not return until the morrow For some reasons he was glad for he desired to be alone alone in order to think Since the abrupt departure of his visitor he had become a changed man His usually merry face was hard and drawn his cheeks pale with red spots in the centre and about his clean shaven mouth a hardness quite unusual Dinner concluded he had strolled out upon the lawn and reclining in a long deck chair sipped his coffee and curacao his face turned to the crimson sundown showing across the dark edge of the forest He was full of dark forebodings The end of his career a scandalous career was near The truth was out As he lay back with his hot fevered head upon the cushion of the long cane chair his dead cigar between his nerveless fingers a thousand bitter thoughts crowded upon him He had striven to reform he had tried hard to turn aside and lead an honest life yet it seemed as though his good intentions had only brought upon him exposure and disaster He thought it all over His had indeed been an amazing career of duplicity What a sensation would be caused when the truth became revealed At first he had heaped opprobrium upon the head of the man who had been his friend but now on mature consideration he realized that Du Cane s motive in exposing him was twofold in order to save himself and also to curry favour in certain high quarters affected by the mysterious death of the young Parliamentary Under Secretary who had placed to his lips that fatal cigar Self preservation being the first instinct of the human race it surely was not surprising that Arnold Du Cane should seek to place himself in a position of security Enormous eventualities would be consequent upon solving the mystery of that man s death Medical science had pronounced it to have been due to natural causes Dare the authorities re open the question and allege assassination Aye that was the question There was the press political parties and public opinion all to consider in addition to the national prestige He held his breath gazing blankly away at the blood red afterglow How strange how complicated how utterly amazing and astounding was it all If the truth of that dastardly plot were ever told it would not be believed The depths of human wickedness were surely unfathomable Because he Phil Poland had endeavoured to cut himself adrift from his ingenious friends they were about to make him the scapegoat He contemplated flight but if he fled whither should he go Where could he hide successfully Those who desired that he should pay the penalty would search every corner of the earth No Death itself would be preferable to either arrest or flight and as he contemplated how he might cheat his enemies a bitter smile played upon his grey lips The crimson light slowly faded The balmy stillness of twilight had settled upon everything the soft evening air became filled with the sweet fragrance of the flowers and the birds were chattering before roosting He glanced across the lawns and well kept walks at the rose embowered house itself his harbour of refuge the cosy place which Sonia loved so well and as his eyes wandered he sighed sadly He knew alas that he must bid farewell to it for ever bid farewell to his dear daughter bid farewell to life itself He drew at his dead cigar Then he cast it from him It tasted bitter Suddenly the grave faced Felix the man who seldom if ever spoke and who was such a mystery in the village came across the lawn and bowing exclaimed in French that the cure M sieur Shuttleworth had called Ah yes exclaimed his master quickly arousing himself How very foolish of me I quite forgot I had invited mister Shuttleworth to come in and smoke to night Ask him to come out here and bring the cigars and whisky Oui M sieur replied the funereal looking butler bowing low as he turned to go back to the house How strange laughed Poland to himself What would the parson think if he knew who I am and the charge against me What will he say afterwards I wonder Then a few moments later a thin grey faced rather ascetic looking clergyman the Reverend Edmund Shuttleworth rector of Middleton came across the grass and grasped his host s hand in warmest greeting When he had seated himself in the low chair which Poland pulled forward and Felix had handed the cigars the two men commenced to gossip as was their habit Phil Poland liked the rector because he had discovered that notwithstanding his rather prim exterior and most approved clerical drawl he was nevertheless a man of the world In the pulpit he preached forgiveness and unlike many country rectors and their wives was broad minded enough to admit the impossibility of a sinless life Both he and missus Shuttleworth treated both chapel and church going folk with equal kindliness and the deserving poor never went empty away Both in the pulpit and out of it the rector of Middleton called a spade a spade with purely British bluntness and though his parish was only a small one he was the most popular man in it a fact which surely spoke volumes for a parson I was much afraid I shouldn t be able to come to night he said presently Old missus Dixon over at Forest Farm is very ill and I ve been with her all the afternoon Then you didn t go to Lady Medland s garden party No I wanted to go very much but was unable I fear poor old missus Dixon may not last the night She asked after Miss Sonia and expressed a great wish to see her You have no idea how popular your daughter is among the poor of Middleton mister Poland Sonia returns from London to morrow afternoon her father said She shall go over and see missus Dixon If the old lady is still here said the rector I fear her life is fast ebbing but it is reassuring to know she has made peace with her Maker and will pass happily away into the unknown beyond His host was silent The bent old woman the wife of a farm labourer had made repentance If there was repentance for her was there not repentance for him He held his breath at the thought Little did Shuttleworth dream that the merry easy going man who sat before him was doomed a man whose tortured soul was crying aloud for help and guidance a man with a dread and terrible secret upon his conscience a man threatened by an exposure which he could never live to face Poland allowed his visitor to chatter on to gossip about the work in his parish He was reviewing his present position He desired some one in whom he could confide some one of whom he might seek advice and counsel Could he expose his real self in all his naked shame dare he speak in confidence to Edmund Shuttleworth Dare he reveal the ghastly truth and place the seal of the confessional upon his lips Twilight deepened into night and the crescent moon rose slowly Yet the two men still sat smoking and chatting Shuttleworth somewhat surprised to notice how unusually preoccupied his host appeared At last when the night wind blew chill they rose and passed into the study where Poland closed the French windows and then with sudden resolve and a word of apology to his visitor he crossed the room and turned the key in the lock saying in a hard strained tone Shuttleworth I I want to speak to you in in strictest confidence to ask your advice Yet yet it is upon such a serious matter that I hesitate fearing Fearing what asked the rector somewhat surprised at his tone Because in order to speak I must reveal to you a truth a shameful truth concerning myself May I rely upon your secrecy Any fact you may reveal to me I shall regard as sacred That is my duty as a minister of religion Poland was the other s quiet reply You swear to say nothing cried his host eagerly standing before him Yes I swear to regard your confidence replied his visitor And then the Honourable Philip Poland slowly sank into the chair on the opposite side of the fireplace and in brief hesitating sentences related one of the strangest stories that ever fell from any sane man s lips a story which held its hearer aghast transfixed speechless in amazement There is repentance for me Shuttleworth tell me that there is cried the man who had confessed his eyes staring and haggard in his agony I have told you the truth because because when I am gone I want you if you will to ask your wife to take care of my darling Sonia Financially she is well provided for I have seen to all that but ah he cried wildly she must never know that her father was Hush Poland urged the rector placing his hand tenderly upon his host s arm Though I wear these clothes I am still a man of the world like yourself I haven t been sinless You wish to repent to atone for the past It is my duty to assist you And he put out his strong hand frankly His host drew back But next instant he grasped it and in doing so burst into tears I make no excuse for myself he faltered I am a blackguard and unworthy the friendship of a true honest man like yourself Shuttleworth But I love my darling child She is all that has remained to me and I want to leave her in the care of a good woman She must forget me forget what her father was Enough cried the other holding up his hand and then until far into the night the two men sat talking in low solemn tones discussing the future while the attitude of Philip Poland as he sat pale and motionless his hands clasped upon his knees was one of deep repentance That same night if the repentant transgressor could but have seen Edmund Shuttleworth an hour later pacing the rectory study if he could have witnessed the expression of fierce murderous hatred upon that usually calm and kindly countenance if he could have overheard the strangely bitter words which escaped the dry lips of the man in whom he had confided his secret he would have been held aghast aghast at the amazing truth a truth of which he had never dreamed His confession had produced a complication unheard of undreamed of so cleverly had the rector kept his countenance and controlled his voice But when alone he gave full vent to his anger and laughed aloud in the contemplation of a terrible vengeance which he declared aloud to himself should be his That voice he cried in triumph Why did I not recognize it before But I know the truth now I know the amazing truth And he laughed harshly to himself as he paced his room Next day Philip Poland spent in his garden reading beneath the big yew as was his wont But his thoughts ever wandered from his book as he grew apprehensive of the evil his enemy was about to hurl upon him His defiance he knew must cost him his liberty his life Yet he was determined For Sonia s sake he had become a changed man At noon Shuttleworth calm and pleasant came across the lawn with outstretched hand He uttered low words of encouragement and comfort He said that poor missus Dixon had passed away and later on he left to attend to his work in the parish After luncheon served by the silent Felix Poland retired to his study with the newspaper and sat for two hours staring straight before him until just after four o clock the door was suddenly flung open and a slim athletic young girl with a wealth of soft fair hair a perfect countenance a sweet lovable expression and a pair of merry blue eyes burst into the room crying Hallo dad Here I am so glad to be back again with you And bending over him she gave him a sounding kiss upon the cheek She was verily a picture of youthful beauty in her cool pale grey gown her hair dressed low and secured by a bow of black velvet while her big black hat suited her to perfection her blue eyes adoring in their gaze and her lovely face flushed with pleasure at her home coming Her father took her hand and gazing lovingly into her eyes said in a slow voice And I too darling am glad to have you at home Life here is very dull indeed without you That night when seated together in the pretty old fashioned drawing room before retiring to bed a room of bright chintzes costly knick knacks and big blue bowls of sweet smelling pot pourri Sonia looked delightful in her black net dinner gown cut slightly decollete and wearing around her slim white throat a simple necklace of pale pink coral My dear exclaimed her father in a slow hesitating way after her fingers had been running idly over the keys of the piano I want to speak very seriously to you for a few moments She rose in surprise and came beside his chair He grasped her soft hand and she sank upon her knees as she so often did when they spoke in confidence Well I ve been wondering child what what you will do in future he said with a catch in his voice Perhaps perhaps I may have to go away for a very very long time years perhaps on a long journey and I shall I fear be compelled to leave you to To leave me dad gasped the girl dismayed No surely you won t do that What could I do without you without my dear devoted dad my only friend You will have to to do without me dearest to to forget your father said the white faced man in a low broken voice I couldn t take you with me It would be impossible The girl was silent her slim hand was clutching his convulsively her eyes filled with the light of unshed tears But what should I do dad without you she cried Why do you speak so strangely Why do you hide so many things from me still about our past I m eighteen now remember dad and you really ought to speak to me as a woman not as a child Why all this mystery Because because it is imperative Sonia he replied in a tone quite unusual I I would tell you all only only you would think ill of me So I prefer that you my daughter should remain in ignorance and still love me still His words were interrupted by Felix who opened the door and advancing with silent tread said A gentleman wishes to speak with m sieur on very urgent business You are unacquainted with him he says His name is Max Morel and he must see you at once He is in the hall Poland s face went a trifle paler Whom could the stranger be Why did he desire an interview at that hour for it was already eleven o clock Sonia dear he said quietly turning to his daughter will you leave me for a few moments I must see what this gentleman wants The girl followed Felix out somewhat reluctantly when a few seconds later a short middle aged Frenchman with pointed grey beard and wearing gold pince nez was ushered in Philip Poland started and instantly went pale at sight of his visitor I need no introduction m sieur You recognize me I see remarked the stranger in French Yes was the other s reply You are Henri Guertin chief inspector of the surete of Paris We have met before once And you are no doubt aware of the reason of my visit I can guess replied the unhappy man You are here to arrest me I know I The renowned detective one of the greatest criminal investigators in Europe glanced quickly at the closed door and dropping his voice said I am here not to arrest you M sieur Poland but to afford you an opportunity of escape Of escape gasped the other his drawn countenance blanched to the lips Yes escape Listen My instructions are to afford you an easy opportunity of well of escaping the ignominy of arrest exposure trial and penalty by a very simple means death by your own hand Suicide echoed Poland after a painful pause Ah I quite understand The Government are not anxious that the scandal should be made public eh he cried bitterly I have merely told you my instructions was the detective s response as with a quick foreign gesture he displayed on his left hand a curious old engraved amethyst set in a ring probably an episcopal ring of ages long ago At midnight I have an appointment at the cross roads half a mile away with Inspector Watts of Scotland Yard who holds a warrant for your arrest and extradition to France If you are still alive when we call then you must stand your trial that is all Trial will mean exposure and And my exposure will mean the downfall and ruin of those political thieves now in power eh cried Poland They are not at all anxious that I should fall into the hands of the police And you are equally anxious that the world and more especially your daughter shall not know the truth remarked the detective speaking in a meaning tone I have given you the alternative and I shall now leave At midnight I shall return officially when I hope you will have escaped by the loophole so generously allowed you by the authorities If I fled would you follow Most certainly It would be my duty You cannot escape only by death I regret m sieur that I have been compelled to put the alternative so bluntly but you know full well the great issues at stake in this affair Therefore I need say nothing further except to bid you au revoir till midnight Then the portly man bowed bowed as politely as though he were in the presence of a crowned head and turning upon his heel left the room followed by his host who personally opened the door for him as he bade him good night One hour s grace had been given Philip Poland After that the blackness of death His blanched features were rigid as he stood staring straight before him His enemy had betrayed him His defiance had alas cost him his life He recollected Shuttleworth s slowly uttered words on the night before and his finger nails clenched themselves into his palms Then he passed across the square old fashioned hall to the study dim lit save for the zone of light around the green shaded reading lamp the sombre room where the old grandfather clock ticked so solemnly in the corner Sonia had returned to the drawing room as he let his visitor out He could hear her playing and singing in her sweet contralto a tuneful French love song ignorant of the hideous crisis that had fallen ignorant of the awful disaster which had overwhelmed him Three quarters of an hour had passed when stealthily on tiptoe the girl crept into the room and there found her father seated by the fireplace staring in blank silence The long old brass faced clock in the shadow struck three times upon its strident bell Only fifteen minutes more and then the police would enter and charge him with that foul crime Then the solution of a remarkable mystery which had puzzled the whole world would be complete He started and glancing around realized that Sonia with her soft hand in his was again at his side Why dad cried the girl in alarm how pale you are Whatever ails you What can I get you Nothing child nothing was the desperate man s hoarse response I m I m quite well only a little upset at some bad news I ve had that s all But come Let me kiss you dear It s time you were in bed And he drew her down until he could print a last fond caress upon her white open brow But dad exclaimed the girl anxiously I really can t leave you You re not well You re not yourself to night As she uttered those words Felix entered the room saying in an agitated voice May I speak with you alone m sieur His master started violently and rising went forth into the hall where the butler his face scared and white whispered Something terrible has occurred m sieur Davis the groom has just found a gentleman lying dead in the drive outside He s been murdered m sieur Murdered gasped Poland breathlessly Who is he The gentleman who called upon you three quarters of an hour ago He s lying dead out yonder Where s a lantern Let me go and see cried Poland And a few moments later master and man were standing with the groom beside the lifeless body of Henri Guertin the great detective the terror of all French criminals The white countenance with its open staring eyes bore a horrified expression but the only wound that could be distinguished was a deep cut across the palm of the right hand a clean cut evidently inflicted by a keen edged knife Davis on his way in had he explained stumbled across the body in the darkness ten minutes before Philip Poland had knelt his hand upon the dead man s heart when suddenly all three were startled by the sound of footsteps upon the gravel and next moment two men loomed up into the uncertain light of the lantern One was tall and middle aged in dark tweeds and a brown hat of soft felt the other short and stout wearing gold pince nez A loud cry of dismay broke from Poland s fevered lips as his eyes fell upon the latter Hallo What s this cried a sharp imperious voice in French the voice of the man in pince nez as next moment he stood gazing down upon the dead unknown who strangely enough resembled him in countenance in dress indeed in every particular The startled men halted for a moment speechless The situation was staggering Henri Guertin stood there alive and as he bent over the prostrate body an astounding truth became instantly revealed the dead man had been cleverly made up to resemble the world renowned police official The reason of this was an entire mystery although one fact became plain he had through posing as Guertin been foully and swiftly assassinated Who was he Was he really the man who came there to suggest suicide in preference to arrest or had that strange suggestion been conveyed by Guertin himself The point was next moment decided You see m sieur exclaimed Poland defiantly turning to the great detective I have preferred to take my trial to allow the public the satisfaction of a solution of the problem rather than accept the generous terms you offered me an hour ago Terms I offered you cried the Frenchman What are you saying I was not here an hour ago If you have had a visitor it must have been this impostor this man who has lost his life because he has impersonated me Philip Poland without replying snatched at the detective s left hand and examined it There was no ring upon it Swiftly he bent beside the victim and there sure enough upon the dead white finger was revealed the curious ring he had noticed an oval amethyst engraved with a coat of arms surmounted by a cardinal s hat the ring worn by the man who had called upon him an hour before THE STORY OF OWEN BIDDULPH CHAPTER ONE BESIDE STILL WATERS If I make too frequent use of the first person singular in these pages I crave forgiveness of the reader I have written down this strange story for two reasons first because I venture to believe it to be one of the most remarkable sequences of curious events that have ever occurred in a man s life and secondly by so doing I am able to prove conclusively before the world the innocence of one sadly misjudged and also to set at rest certain scandalous tales which have arisen in consequence At risk of betraying certain confidences at risk of placing myself in the unenviable position of chronicler of my own misfortunes at risk even of defying those who have threatened my life should I dare speak the truth I have resolved to recount the whole amazing affair just as it occurred to me and further to reveal completely what has hitherto been regarded as a mystery by readers of the daily newspapers You already know my name Owen Biddulph As introduction I suppose I ought to add that after coming down from Oxford I pretended to read for the Bar just to please the dear old governor Sir Alfred Biddulph Knight At the age of twenty five owing to his unfortunate death in the hunting field I found myself possessor of Carrington Court our fine Elizabethan place in North Devon and town house sixty foura Wilton Street Belgrave Square together with a comfortable income of about nine thousand a year mostly derived from sound industrial enterprises My father before his retirement had been a Liverpool ship owner and like many others of his class had received his knighthood on the occasion of Queen Victoria s Jubilee My mother had been dead long since I had but few relatives and those mostly poor ones therefore on succeeding to the property I went down to Carrington just to interview Browning the butler and the other servants all of them old and faithful retainers and then having given up all thought of a legal career I went abroad in order to attain my long desired ambition to travel and to see the world Continental life attracted me just as it attracts most young men Paris with its glare and glitter its superficial gaiety its bright boulevards and its feminine beauty is the candle to the moth of youth I revelled in Paris just as many a thousand other young men had done before me I knew French Italian and German and I was vain enough to believe that I might have within me the making of a cosmopolitan So many young men believe that and alas so many fail on account of either indolence or of narrow mindedness To be a thorough going cosmopolitan one must be imbued with the true spirit of adventure and must be a citizen of all cities a countryman of all countries This I tried to be and perhaps in a manner succeeded At any rate I spent nearly three whole years travelling hither and thither across the face of Europe from Trondhjem to Constantinople and from Bordeaux to Petersburg Truly if one has money one can lead a very pleasant life year in year out at the various European health and pleasure resorts without even setting foot in our dear old England I was young and enthusiastic I spent the glorious golden autumn in Florence and in Perugia the Tuscan vintage in old Siena December in Sicily January in Corsica February and March at Nice taking part in the Carnival and Battles of Flowers April in Venice May at the Villa d Este on the Lake of Como June and July at Aix August the month of the Lion among the chestnut woods high up at Vallombrosa and September at San Sebastian in Spain that pretty town of sea bathing and of gambling Next year I spent the winter in Russia the guest of a prince who lived near Moscow the early spring at the Hermitage at Monte Carlo May at the Meurice in Paris the summer in various parts of Switzerland and most of the autumn in the high Tatra the foot hills of the Carpathians And so with my faithful Italian valet Lorenzo a dark haired smart man of thirty who had been six years in my service and who had on so many occasions proved himself entirely trustworthy I passed away the seasons as they came and went always living in the best hotels and making a good many passing acquaintances Life was indeed a perfect phantasmagoria Now there is a certain section of English society who being for some reason or another beyond the pale at home make their happy hunting ground in the foreign hotel Men and women consumptive sons and scraggy daughters they generally live in the cheapest rooms en pension and are ever ready to scrape up acquaintance with anybody of good appearance and of either sex as long as they are possessed of money Every one who has lived much on the Continent knows them and be it said gives them a wide berth I was not long before I experienced many queer acquaintanceships in hotels some amusing some the reverse At Verona a man an Englishman named Davis who had been at my college in Oxford borrowed fifty pounds of me but disappeared from the hotel next morning before I came down while among other similar incidents a dear quiet mannered old widow a Russian who spoke English induced me at Ostend to assist her to pay her hotel bill of one thousand six hundred francs giving me a cheque upon her bank in Petersburg a cheque which in due course was returned to me marked no account Still I enjoyed myself The carelessness of life suited me for I managed to obtain sunshine the whole year round and to have a good deal of fun for my money I had a fine sixty horse power motor car and usually travelled from place to place on it my friend Jack Marlowe who had been at Oxford with me and whose father s estates marched with mine on the edge of Dartmoor frequently coming out to spend a week or two with me on the roads He was studying for the diplomatic service but made many excuses for holidays which he invariably spent at my side And we had a merry time together I can assure you For nearly three years I had led this life of erratic wandering returning to London only for a week or so in June to see my lawyers and put in an appearance for a few days at Carrington to interview old Browning And I must confess I found the old place deadly dull and lonely Boodles to which I belonged just as my father had belonged I found full of pompous bores and old fogeys and though at White s there was a little more life and movement now they had built a new roof yet I preferred the merry recklessness of Monte Carlo or the gaiety of the white and gold casinos at Nice or Cannes Thus nearly three years went by careless years of luxury and idleness years of living a la carte at restaurants of the first order from the Reserve at Beaulieu to the Hermitage at Moscow from Armenonville in the Bois to Salvini s in Milan years of the education of an epicure The first incident of this strange history however occurred while I was spending the early spring at Gardone Possibly you as an English reader have never heard of the place If however you were Austrian you would know it as one of the most popular resorts on the beautiful mountain fringed Lake of Garda that deep blue lake half in Italian territory and half in Austrian with the quaint little town of Desenzano at the Italian end and Riva with its square old church tower and big white hotels at the extreme north Of all the spring resorts on the Italian lakes Gardone appeals to the visitor as one of the quietest and most picturesque The Grand Hotel with its long terrace at the lake side is during February and March filled with a gay crowd who spend most of their time in climbing the steep mountain sides towards the jealously guarded frontier or taking motor boat excursions up and down the picturesque lake From the balcony of my room spread a panorama as beautiful as any in Europe more charming indeed than at Lugano or Bellagio or other of the many lake side resorts for here along the sheltered banks grew all the luxuriant vegetation of the Riviera the camellias magnolias aloes and palms I had been there ten days or so when one evening at dinner in the long restaurant which overlooked the lake there came to the small table opposite mine a tall fair haired girl with great blue eyes dressed elegantly but quietly in black chiffon with a band of pale pink velvet twisted in her hair She glanced at me quickly as she drew aside her skirt and took her seat opposite her companion a rather stout dark bald headed man red faced and well dressed whose air was distinctly paternal as he bent and handed the menu across to her The man turned and glanced sharply around By his well cut dinner coat the way his dress shirt fitted and his refinement of manner I at once put him down as a gentleman and her father I instantly decided on account of their smartness of dress that they were not English Indeed the man addressed her in French to which she responded Her coiffure was in the latest mode of Paris her gown showed unmistakably the hand of the French dressmaker while her elegance was essentially that of the Parisienne There is always a something something indescribable about the Frenchwoman which is marked and distinctive and which the English bred woman can never actually imitate Not that I like Frenchwomen Far from it They are too vain and shallow too fond of gaiety and flattery to suit my taste No among all the many women I have met I have never found any to compare with those of my own people I don t know why I watched the new comers so intently Perhaps it was on account of the deliberate and careful manner in which the man selected his dinner his instructions to the maitre d hotel as to the manner the entree was to be made and the infinite pains he took over the exact vintage he required He spoke in French fluent and exact and his manner was entirely that of the epicure Or was it because of that girl the girl with eyes of that deep fathomless blue the wonderful blue of the lake as it lay in the sunlight the lake that was nearly a mile in depth In her face I detected a strange almost wistful look an expression which showed that her thoughts were far away from the laughter and chatter of that gay restaurant She looked at me without seeing me she spoke to her father without knowing what she replied There was in those wonderful eyes a strange far off look and it was that which more than anything else attracted my attention and caused me to notice the pair Her fair sweet countenance was perfect in its contour her cheeks innocent of the Parisienne s usual aids to beauty her lips red and well moulded while two tiny dimples gave a piquancy to a face which was far more beautiful than any I had met in all my wanderings Again she raised her eyes from the table and gazed across the flowers at me fixedly with just a sudden inquisitiveness shown by her slightly knit brows Then suddenly starting as though realizing she was looking at a stranger she dropped her eyes again and replied to some question her father had addressed to her Her dead black gown was cut just discreetly decollete which well became a girl not yet twenty while at her throat suspended by a very thin gold chain was a single stone a splendid ruby of enormous size and of evident value The only other ornament she wore was a curious antique bracelet in the form of a jewelled snake the tail of which was in its mouth the ancient emblem of Eternity Why she possessed such an attraction for me I cannot tell except that she seemed totally unlike any other woman I had ever met before a face that was as perfect as any I had seen on the canvases of the great painters or in the marbles of the Louvre or the Vatican Again she raised her eyes to mine Again I realized that the expression was entirely unusual Then she dropped them again and in a slow inert way ate the crayfish soup which the waiter had placed before her Others in the big long room had noticed her beauty for I saw people whispering among themselves while her father leaning back in his chair on placing down his spoon was entirely conscious of the sensation his daughter had evoked Throughout the meal I watched the pair carefully trying to overhear their conversation It was however always in low confidential tones and strain my ears how I might I could gather nothing They spoke in French which I detected from the girl s monosyllables but beyond that I could understand nothing From the obsequious manner of the maitre d hotel I knew that her father was a person of importance Yet the man who knows what to order in a restaurant and orders it with instructions is certain to receive marked attention The epicure always commands the respect of those who serve him And surely this stranger was an epicure for after his dessert I heard him order with his coffee a petit verre of gold water of Dantzig a rare liqueur only known and appreciated by the very select few who really know what is what a bottle of which if you search Europe from end to end you will not find in perhaps twenty restaurants and those only of the very first order The eyes of the fair haired girl haunted me Instinctively I knew that she was no ordinary person Her apathy and listlessness her strangely vacant look combined with the wonderful beauty of her countenance held me fascinated Who was she What mystery surrounded her I felt by some strange intuition that there was a mystery and that that curious wistfulness in her glance betrayed itself because though accompanied by her father she was nevertheless in sore need of a friend When her father had drained his coffee they rose and passed into the great lounge with its many little tables set beneath the palms where a fine orchestra was playing Maillart s tuneful Les Dragons de Villars As they seated themselves many among that well dressed gay crowd of winter idlers turned to look at them I however seldom went into the nightly concert therefore I strolled along the wide corridor to the hall porter and inquired the names of the fresh arrivals Yes monsieur replied the big dark bearded German you mean of course numbers one hundred and seventeen and one hundred and forty six English father and daughter arrived by the five o clock boat from Riva with a great deal of baggage here are the names and he showed me the slips signed by them on arrival They are the only new comers to day There I saw written on one in a man s bold hand Richard Pennington rentier Salisbury England and on the other Sylvia Pennington I thought they were French I remarked So did I monsieur they speak French so well I was surprised when they registered themselves as English CHAPTER TWO TOLD IN THE NIGHT Sylvia Pennington The face the name those wistful appealing eyes haunted me in my dreams that night Why Even now I am at a loss to tell unless well unless I had become fascinated by that strange mysterious indescribable expression fascinated perhaps by her marvellous beauty unequalled in all my experience Next morning while my man Lorenzo was waiting for me I told him to make discreet inquiry regarding the pair when in the steward s room where he ate his meals Soon after noon he came to me saying he had discovered that the young lady had been heard by the night porter weeping alone in her room for hours and that as soon as it was dawn she had gone out for a long walk alone along the lake side It was apparent that she and her father were not on the very best of terms The servants believe they are French sir my man added but it seems that they tell people they are English The man speaks English like an Englishman I heard him half an hour ago asking the hall porter about a telegram Well Lorenzo I said just keep your eyes and ears open I want to learn all I can about mister Pennington and his daughter She hasn t a maid I suppose Not with her sir he replied If she had I d soon get to know all about them I was well aware of that for Lorenzo Merli like all Italians was a great gossip and quite a lady killer in the servants hall He was a dark haired good looking young man whose character was excellent and who had served me most faithfully His father was farm bailiff to an Italian marquis I knew and with whom I had stayed near Parma while before entering my service he had been valet to the young Marchese di Viterbo one of the beaux of Roman society When I reposed a confidence in Lorenzo I knew he would never betray it And I knew that now I had expressed an ardent desire for information regarding the man Pennington and his daughter he would strain every effort to learn what I wanted to know The pair sat at their usual table at luncheon She was in a neat gown of navy blue serge and wore a pretty cream hat which suited her admirably Her taste in dress was certainly wonderful for an Englishwoman Yet the pair always spoke French together and presented no single characteristic of the British whatsoever Because of his epicurean tastes the stout bald headed man received the greatest attention from the waiters but those splendid eyes of his daughter betrayed no evidence of either tears or sleeplessness They were the same wistful yet wonderful with just that slightest trace of sadness which had filled me with curiosity After luncheon he strolled along the broad palm lined terrace in the sunshine beside the water s edge while she lolled in one of the long cane chairs Yet as I watched I saw that she was not enjoying the warm winter sunshine or the magnificent view of snow capped mountains rising on the far horizon Presently she rose and walked beside her father who spoke to her rapidly and earnestly but she only replied in monosyllables It seemed that all his efforts to arouse her interest utterly failed I was lounging upon the low wall of the terrace pretending to watch the arrival of the little black and white paddle steamer on its way to Riva when as they passed me Pennington halted to light a cigar Suddenly he glanced up at me with a strangely suspicious look His dark eyes were furtive and searching as though he had detected and resented my undue interest in his daughter Therefore I strolled down to the landing stage and going on board the steamer spent the afternoon travelling up to Riva the pretty little town with the tiny harbour at the Austrian end of the lake The afternoon was lovely and the panorama of mountain mirrored in the water with picturesque villages and hamlets nestling at the water s edge was inexpressibly grand The deep azure of the unruffled water stood out in contrast to the dazzling snow above and as the steamer hugging the shore rounded one rocky point after another the scene was certainly as the Italian contadino puts it a bit of Paradise fallen from heaven upon earth But to you who know the north Italian lakes why need I describe it Suffice it to say that I took tea in the big hall of the Lido Palace Hotel at Riva and then boarding the steamer again returned to Gardone just in time to dress for dinner I think that Pennington had forbidden his daughter to look at me for never once during dinner the next evening as far as I could detect did she raise her eyes to mine When not eating she sat a pretty figure in cream chiffon with her elbows upon the table her chin upon her clasped hands talking to her father in that low confidential tone Were they talking secrets Just before they rose I heard him say in English I m going out for an hour just for a stroll I may be longer If I m not back all night don t be anxious I may be detained Where are you going she asked quickly That is my affair was his abrupt reply Her face assumed a strange expression Then she passed along the room he following As soon as they had gone my mind was made up I scented mystery I ascended in the lift to my room got my coat and going outside into the ill lit road beyond the zone of the electric lights in front of the hotel I waited The man was not long in coming He wore a golf cap and a thick overcoat and carried a stout stick On the steps of the hotel he paused lit his cigar and then set off to the left down the principal street the highroad which led to the clean little town of Salo and the southern end of the lake I lounged along after him at a respectable distance all curiosity at the reason why in that rural retreat he intended to be absent all night He went along at a swinging pace passing around the lake front of the town which almost adjoins Gardone and then began to ascend the steep hill beyond Upon the still night air I could scent the aroma of his cigar He was now on his way out into a wild and rather desolate country high above the lake But after walking about a mile he came to a point where the roads branched one to Verona the other to Brescia There he halted and seating himself upon a big stone at the wayside smoked in patience and waited I advanced as near as I could without risk of detection and watched He struck a match in order to look at his watch Then he rose and listened intently The night was dark and silent with heavy clouds hanging about the mountains threatening rain I suppose he had waited fully another quarter of an hour when suddenly far away over the brow of the hill in the direction of Brescia I saw a peculiar light in the sky At first I was puzzled but as it gradually grew larger and whiter I knew that it came from the head lights of an approaching motor car Next moment the hum of the engine fell on my ears and suddenly the whole roadway became illuminated so suddenly indeed that I had only just time to crouch down in order to avoid detection Pennington shouted to the driver and he instantly pulled up Then two men in thick overcoats descended and welcomed him warmly in English Come along old man I heard one of them cry Come inside We must be off again for we haven t a moment to spare How s the girl Then they entered the car which was quickly turned and a few moments later disappeared swiftly along the road it had come I stood full of wonder watching the white light fade away Who were Pennington s friends that he should meet them in so secret a manner How s the girl Had that man referred to Sylvia There was mystery somewhere I felt certain of it Down the hill I retraced my steps on through the little town now wrapped in slumber and back to the Grand Hotel where nearly every one had already retired to bed In a corner of the big lounge however Pennington s daughter was seated alone reading a Tauchnitz novel I felt in no humour to turn in just then for I was rather used to late hours therefore I passed through the lounge and out upon the terrace in order to smoke and think The clouds were lifting and the moon was struggling through casting an uncertain light across the broad dark waters I had thrown myself into a wicker chair near the end of the terrace and with a cigarette was pondering deeply when of a sudden I saw a female figure wrapped in a pale blue shawl coming in my direction I recognized the cream skirt and the shawl It was Sylvia Ah how inexpressibly charming and dainty she looked When she had passed I rose and meeting her face to face raised my hat and spoke to her She started slightly and halted What words I uttered I hardly knew but a few moments later I found myself strolling at her side chatting merrily in English Her chiffons exuded the delicate scent of Rose d Orsay that sweet perfume which is the hall mark of the modern well dressed woman And she was undoubtedly English after all Oh no she declared in a low musical voice in response to a fear I had expressed I am not at all cold This place is so charming and so warm to where my father and I have recently been at Uleaborg in Finland At Uleaborg I echoed Why that is away out of the world at the northern end of the Gulf of Bothnia Yes she declared with a light laugh It is so windy and cold and oh so wretchedly dull I should rather think so I cried Why it is almost within the Arctic Circle Why did you go up there so far north in winter Ah she sighed we are always travelling My father is the modern Wandering Jew I think Our movements are always sudden and our journeys always long ones from one end of Europe to the other very often You seem tired of it I remarked Tired she gasped her voice changing Ah if you only knew how I long for peace for rest for home and she sighed Where is your home Anywhere now a days was her rather despondent reply We are wanderers We lived in England once but alas that is now all of the past My father is compelled to travel and I must of necessity go with him I am afraid she added quickly that I bore you with this chronicle of my own troubles I really ought not to say this to you a stranger she said with a low nervous little laugh Though I may be a stranger yet surely I may become your friend I remarked looking into her beautiful face half concealed by the blue wrap For a moment she hesitated then halting in the gravelled path and looking at me she replied very seriously No please do not speak of that again Why not Well only because you must not become my friend You are lonely I blurted forth I have watched you and I have seen that you are in sore need of a friend Do you deny that No she faltered I I yes what you say is alas correct How can I deny it I have no friend I am alone Then allow me to be one Put to me whatever test you will I exclaimed and I hope I may bear it satisfactorily I too am a lonely man a wanderer I too am in need of a friend in whom I can confide whose guidance I can ask Surely there is no friend better for a lonely man than a good woman Ah no she cried suddenly covering her face with both her hands You don t know you are ignorant Why do you say this Why Shall I tell you why I asked gallantly bending to her in deep earnestness Because I have watched you because I know you are very unhappy She held her breath By the faint ray of the distant electric light I saw her face had become changed She betrayed her emotions and her nervousness by the quick twitching of her fingers and her lips No she said at last very decisively you must abandon all thought of friendship with me It is impossible quite impossible Would my friendship be so repugnant to you then I asked quickly No no not that she cried laying her trembling fingers upon my coat sleeve You you don t understand you cannot dream of my horrible position of the imminent peril of yours Peril What do you mean I asked very much puzzled You are in grave danger Be careful of yourself she said anxiously You should always carry some weapon with you because and she broke off short without concluding her sentence Because why Well because an accident might happen to you an accident planned by those who are your enemies I really don t understand you I said Do you mean to imply that there is some conspiracy afoot against me I warn you in all seriousness she said I well the fact is I came out here I followed you out in order to tell you this in secret Leave here I beg of you leave early to morrow morning and do not allow the hotel people to know your new address Go somewhere far away and live in secret under an assumed name Let Owen Biddulph disappear as though the earth had swallowed him up Then you are aware of my name I exclaimed Certainly she replied But do I beg of you for your own sake heed my warning Ah it is cruel and horrible that I of all women have to tell you this I always carry a revolver I replied and I have long ago learned to shoot straight Be guarded always against a secret and insidious attack she urged I must go in now that I have told you the truth And do you then refuse to become my friend Miss Pennington I asked very earnestly Surely you are my friend already because you have told me this Yes she answered adding Ah you do not know the real facts You would not ask this if you were aware of the bitter ghastly truth You would not ask my friendship nay you would hate and curse me instead But why I asked amazed at her words You speak in enigmas She was silent again Then her nervous fingers once more gripped my arm as looking into my face her eyes shining with a weird unusual light she replied in quick breathless sentences Because because friendship between us must never never be it would be fatal to you just as it would be fatal to me Death yes death will come to me quickly and swiftly perhaps to night perhaps to morrow perhaps in a week s time For it I am quite prepared All is lost lost to me for ever Only have a care of yourself I beseech of you Heed what I say Escape the cruel fate which your enemies have marked out for you escape while there is yet time and and she faltered in a low hoarse voice full of emotion some day in the future perhaps you will give a passing thought to the memory of a woman who revealed to you the truth who saved you from an untimely end the unhappy woman without a friend But I will be your friend I repeated No That can never be never and she shuddered I dare not risk it Reflect and escape get away in secret and take care that you are not followed Remember however we can never be friends Such a course would be fatal yes alas fatal Instinctively she put out her tiny white hand in frank farewell Then when I had held it for a second in my own she turned and drawing her shawl about her hurried back to the big hotel Utterly dumbfounded I stood for a few seconds dazed and wondering the sweet odour of Rose d Orsay filling my nostrils What did she know Then suddenly I held my breath for there I saw for the first time standing back in the shadow of the trees straight before me motionless as a statue the tall dark figure of a man who had evidently watched us the whole time and who had no doubt overheard all our conversation CHAPTER THREE THE CLERGYMAN FROM HAMPSHIRE What was the meaning of it all Why had that tall mysterious stranger watched so intently I looked across at him but he did not budge even though detected In a flash all the strange warnings of Sylvia Pennington crowded upon my mind I stood facing the man as he lurked there in the shadow determined that he should reveal his face Those curious words of the mysterious girl had placed me upon my mettle Who were the unknown enemies of mine who were conspiring against me Should I take her advice and leave Gardone or should I remain on my guard and hand them over to the police at first sign of attack The silent watcher did not move He stood back there in the darkness motionless as a statue while I remained full in the light of the moon which had now come forth causing the lake and mountains to look almost fairy like In order to impress upon him the fact that I was in no hurry I lit a cigarette and seated myself upon the low wall of the terrace softly whistling an air of the cafe chantant The night was now glorious the mountain crests showing white in the moonlight Who was this man I wondered I regretted that we had not discovered his presence before Sylvia had left She would no doubt have recognized him and told me the reason of his watchfulness At last I suppose I must have tired him out for suddenly he hastened from his hiding place and creeping beneath the shadow of the hotel succeeded in reaching the door through which Sylvia had passed As he entered the light from the lounge within gave me a swift glance of his features He was a thin grey faced rather sad looking man dressed in black but to my surprise I noticed that his collar was that of an English clergyman This struck me as most remarkable Clergymen are not usually persons to be feared I smiled to myself for after all was it not quite possible that the reverend gentleman had found himself within earshot of us and had been too embarrassed to show himself at once What sinister motive could such a man possess I looked around the great lounge with its many tables and great palms but it was empty He had passed through and ascended in the lift to his room Inquiry of the night porter revealed that the man s name was the Reverend Edmund Shuttleworth and that he came from Andover in England He had arrived at six o clock that evening and was only remaining the night having expressed his intention of going on to Riva on the morrow So laughing at my fears fears which had been aroused by that strange warning of Sylvia s I ascended to my room I did not leave next morning as my fair faced little friend had suggested neither did Pennington return About eleven o clock I strolled forth into the warm sunshine on the terrace and there to my surprise saw Sylvia sitting upon one of the seats with a cream sunshade over her head a book in her lap while by her side lounged the mysterious watcher of the night before the English clergyman mister Shuttleworth of Andover Neither noticed me He was speaking to her slowly and earnestly she listening attentively to his words I saw that she sighed deeply her fine eyes cast upon the ground It all seemed as though he were reproaching her with something for she was silent in an attitude almost of penitence Now that I obtained a full view of the reverend gentleman s features in full daylight they seemed less mysterious less sinister than in the half light of midnight He looked a grave earnest sober living man with that slight affectation of the Church which one finds more in the rural districts than in cities for the black clerical straw hat and the clerical drawl seem always to go together It is strange that the village curate is always more affected in his speech than the popular preacher of the West End and the country vicar s wife is even more exclusive in her tea and tennis acquaintances than the wife of the lord bishop himself For a few moments I watched unseen I rather liked the appearance of the Reverend Edmund Shuttleworth whoever he might be He had the look of an honest open God fearing man Yet why was he in such earnest consultation with the mysterious Sylvia With his forefinger he was touching the palm of his left hand apparently to emphasize his words while she looked pale even frightened She was listening without comment without protest while I stood watching them from behind Many other visitors were idling about the terrace reading letters or newspapers or chatting or flirting the usual morning occupations of a fashionable lake side hotel far removed from the strenuous turmoil of the business or social worlds Suddenly she objected to some words which he uttered objected strongly with rapid interruption and quick protest But he laid his hand quietly upon her arm and seemed to convince her of the truth or justice of his words Then as she turned she recognized me and I raised my hat politely in passing Shuttleworth s eyes met mine and he stared at me But I passed on in pretence that I had not recognized him as the watcher of the previous night I idled about the terrace and the little landing stage till noon when the steamer for Riva came up from Desenzano and Shuttleworth taking leave of Sylvia boarded the little craft with his two kit bags and waved her farewell as the vessel drew away making a wide wake upon the glassy surface of the deep blue waters When he had gone I crossed to her and spoke She looked inexpressibly charming in her white cotton gown and neat straw sailor hat with black velvet band There was nothing ostentatious about her dress but it was always well cut and fitted her to perfection She possessed a style and elegance all her own Ah mister Biddulph she exclaimed reproachfully Why have you not heeded my words last night Why have you not left Go go before it is too late she urged looking straight into my face with those wonderful eyes of hers But I don t understand you Miss Pennington I replied Why should I leave here What danger threatens me A grave one a very grave one she said in a low hoarse whisper If you value your life you should get away from this place Who are these enemies of mine I demanded You surely should tell me so that I can take precautions against them Your only precaution lies in flight she said But will you not tell me what is intended If there is a conspiracy against me is it not your duty as a friend to reveal it Did I not tell you last night that I am not your friend that our friendship is forbidden I don t understand you I said As far as I know I haven t an enemy in the world Why should I fear the unknown Ah will you not take heed of what I have told you she cried in desperation Leave here Return to England hide yourself anywhere for a time until the danger passes I have no fear of this mysterious danger Miss Pennington I said If these secret enemies of mine attack me then I am perfectly ready and able to defend myself But they will not attack openly They will strike at a moment when you least expect it and strike with accuracy and deadly effect Last night after you had left me I found a man standing in the shadow watching us I said He was the clergyman whom I saw sitting with you just now Who is he mister Shuttleworth an old friend of mine in England An intimate friend of my father s To him I owe very much I had no idea he was here until an hour ago when we met quite accidentally on the terrace I haven t seen him for a year We once lived in his parish near Andover in Hampshire He was about our only friend Why did he spy upon us I had no idea that he did It must have been only by chance she assured me From Edmund Shuttleworth you certainly have nothing to fear He and his wife are my best friends She is staying up at Riva it seems and he is on his way to join her Your father is absent I said abruptly Yes she replied with slight hesitation He has gone away on business I don t expect he will be back till to night And how long do you remain here Who knows Our movements are always so sudden and erratic We may leave to night for the other end of Europe or we may remain here for weeks yet Father is so uncertain always But why are you so eager that I shall leave you I asked as we strolled together along the terrace You have admitted that you are in need of a friend and yet you will not allow me to approach you with the open hand of friendship Because ah have I not already explained the reason why why I dare not allow you to show undue friendship towards me Well tell me frankly I said who is this secret enemy of mine She was silent In that hesitation I suspected an intention to deceive Is it against your own father that you are warning me I exclaimed in hesitation You fear him evidently and you urge me to leave here and return to England Why should I not remain here in defiance In some cases defiance is distinctly injudicious she remarked It is so in this Your only safety is in escape I can tell you no more These words of yours Miss Pennington are remarkably strange I said Surely our position is most curious You are my friend and yet you conceal the identity of my enemy She only shrugged her shoulders without any reply falling from her lips Will you not take my advice and get back to England at once she asked very seriously as she turned to me a few minutes later I have suggested this in your own interests But why should I go in fear of this unknown enemy I asked What harm have I done Why should any one be my bitter enemy Ah how do I know she cried in despair We all of us have enemies where we least suspect them Sometimes the very friend we trust most implicitly reveals himself as our worst antagonist Truly one should always pause and ponder deeply before making a friend You are perfectly right I remarked A fierce enemy is always better than a false friend Yet I would dearly like to know what I have done to merit antagonism Where has your father gone To Brescia I believe to meet his friends Who are they His business friends I only know them very slightly they are interested in mining properties They meet at intervals The last time he met them was in Stockholm a month ago This struck me as curious Why should he meet his business friends so clandestinely why should they come at night in a car to cross roads But I told her nothing of what I had witnessed I decided to keep my knowledge to myself The boat leaves at two o clock she said after a pause her hand upon her breast as though to stay the wild beating of her heart Will you not take my advice and leave by that Go to Milan and then straight on to England she urged in deep earnestness her big wide open eyes fixed earnestly upon mine No Miss Pennington I replied promptly the fact is I do not feel disposed to leave here just at present I prefer to remain and to take the risk whatever it may be But why she cried for we were standing at the end of the terrace and out of hearing Because you are in need of a friend because you have admitted that you too are in peril Therefore I have decided to remain near you No she cried breathlessly Ah you do not know the great risk you are running You must go do go mister Biddulph go for for my sake I shook my head I have no fear of myself I declared I am anxious on your behalf Have no thought of me she cried Leave and return to England And see you no more eh If you will leave to day I I will see you in England perhaps Perhaps I cried That is not a firm promise Then if you really wish she replied in earnestness I will promise I ll promise anything I ll promise to see you in England when the danger has passed if if disaster has not already fallen upon me she added in a hoarse whisper But my place is here near you I declared To fly from danger would be cowardly I cannot leave you No she urged her pale face hard and anxious Go mister Biddulph go and save yourself Then if you so desire we shall meet again in secret in England And that is an actual promise I asked holding forth my hand Yes she answered taking it eagerly It is a real promise Give me your address and very soon I shall be in London to resume our acquaintanceship but remember not our friendship That must never be never CHAPTER FOUR THE PERIL BEYOND My taxi pulled up before my own white enamelled door in Wilton Street off Belgrave Square and alighting I entered with my latch key I had been home about ten days back again once more in dear dirty old London spending most of my time idling in White s or Boodle s for in May one meets everybody in saint James s Street and men foregather in the club smoking room from the four ends of the earth The house in Wilton Street was a small bijou place which my father had occupied as a pied a terre in town he being a widower He had been a man of artistic tastes and the house though small was furnished lightly and brightly in the modern style At Carrington he always declared there was enough of the heaviness of the antique Here in the dulness of London he preferred light decorations and modern art in furnishing Through the rather narrow carpeted hall I passed into the study which lay behind the dining room a small cosy apartment the acme of comfort I as a bachelor hated the big terra cotta and white drawing room upstairs When there I made the study my own den I had an important letter to write but scarcely had I seated myself at the table when old Browning grave grey faced and solemn entered saying A clergyman called to see you about three o clock sir He asked if you were at home When I replied that you were at the club he became rather inquisitive concerning your affairs and asked me quite a lot of questions as to where you had been lately and who you were I was rather annoyed sir and I m afraid I may have spoken rudely But as he would leave no card I felt justified in refusing to answer his inquiries Quite right Browning I replied But what kind of a man was he Describe him Well sir he was rather tall of middle age thin faced and drawn as though he had seen a lot of trouble He spoke with a pronounced drawl and his clerical coat was somewhat shabby I noticed too sir that he wore a black leather watch guard That last sentence at once revealed my visitor s identity It was the Reverend Edmund Shuttleworth But why had he returned so suddenly from Riva And why was he making secret inquiry concerning myself I think I know the gentleman Browning I replied while the faithful old fellow stood a quaint stout figure in a rather tight fitting coat and grey trousers his white whiskered face full of mystery I fancy Browning viewed me with considerable suspicion In his eyes young mister Owen had always been far too erratic On many occasions in my boyhood days he had expressed to my father his strong disapproval of what he termed Master Owen s carryings on If he should call again tell him that I have a very great desire to renew our acquaintance I met him abroad I said Very well sir replied my man But I don t suppose he will call again sir I was rude to him Your rudeness was perfectly justifiable Browning Please refuse to answer any questions concerning me I know my duty sir was the old man s stiff reply and I hope I shall always perform it And he retired closing the door silently behind him With my elbows upon the table I sat thinking deeply Had I not acted like a fool Those strange words and that curious promise of Sylvia Pennington sounded ever in my ears She had succeeded in inducing me to return home by promising to meet me clandestinely in England Why clandestinely Before me every moment that I now lived arose that pale beautiful face that exquisite countenance with the wonderful eyes that face which had held me in fascination that woman who indeed held me now for life or death In those ten days which had passed the first days of my home coming after my long absence I knew by the blankness of our separation though I would not admit it to myself that she was my affinity I was hers She the elegant little wanderer possessed me body and soul I felt for her a strong affection and affection is the half and half of love Why had her friend that thin faced country clergyman called Evidently he was endeavouring to satisfy himself as to my bona fides And yet for what reason What had I to do with him She had told me that she owed very much to that man Why however should he interest himself in me I took down a big black volume from the shelf Crockford s Clerical Directory and from it learned that Edmund Charles Talbot Shuttleworth M A was rector of the parish of Middleton cum Bowbridge near Andover in the Bishopric of Winchester He had held his living for the past eight years and its value was Lfive hundred fifty per annum He had had a distinguished career at Cambridge and had been curate in half a dozen places in various parts of the country I felt half inclined to run down to Middleton and call upon him I could make some excuse or other for I felt that he might perhaps give me some further information regarding the mysterious Pennington and his daughter Yet on further reflection I hesitated for I saw that by acting thus I might incur Sylvia s displeasure During the three following days I remained much puzzled I deeply regretted that Browning had treated the country parson abruptly and wondered whether I could not make excuse to call by pretending to express regret for the rudeness of my servant I was all eagerness to know something concerning this man Pennington and was prepared even to sink my own pride in order to learn it Jack Marlowe was away in Copenhagen and would not return for a week In London I had many friends but there were few who interested me for I was ever thinking of Sylvia of her only and always At last one morning I made up my mind and leaving Waterloo travelled down to Andover Junction where I hired a trap and after driving through the little old fashioned town out upon the dusty London Road for a couple of miles or so I came to the long straggling village of Middleton at the further end of which stood the ancient little church and near it the comfortable old world rectory Entering the gateway I found myself in pretty well wooded and well kept grounds the house itself long low and covered with trailing roses was a typical English country rectory Beyond that lay a paddock while in the distance the beautiful Harewood Forest showed away upon the skyline Yes mister Shuttleworth was at home the neat maid told me and I was ushered into a long old fashioned study the French windows of which opened out upon a well rolled tennis lawn The place smelt of tobacco smoke Upon the table lay a couple of well seasoned briars and on the wall an escutcheon bearing its owner s college arms Crossed above the window was a pair of rowing sculls and these with a pair of fencing foils in close proximity told mutely of long past athletics It was a quiet book lined den an ideal retreat for a studious man As my eyes travelled around the room they suddenly fell upon a photograph in a dark leather frame the picture of a young girl of seventeen or so with her hair dressed low and secured by a big black bow I started at sight of it It was the picture of Sylvia Pennington I crossed to look at it more closely but as I did so the door opened and I found myself face to face with the rector of Middleton He halted as he recognized me halted for just a second in hesitation then putting out his hand he welcomed me saying in his habitual drawl mister Biddulph I believe and invited me to be seated Ah I exclaimed with a smile I see you recognize me though we were only passers by on the Lake of Garda I must apologize for this intrusion but as a matter of fact my servant Browning described a gentleman who called upon me a few days ago and I at once recognized him to have been you He was rather rude to you I fear and My dear fellow he interrupted with a hearty good natured laugh He only did his duty as your servant He objected to my infernal impertinence and very rightly too It was surely no impertinence to call upon me I exclaimed Well it s all a question of one s definition of impertinence he said I made certain inquiries rather searching inquiries regarding you that was all Why I asked He moved uneasily in his padded writing chair then reached over and placed a box of cigarettes before me After we had both lit up he answered in a rather low changed voice Well I wanted to satisfy myself as to who you were mister Biddulph he laughed Merely to gratify a natural curiosity That s just it I said Why should your curiosity have been aroused concerning me I do not think I have ever made a secret to any one regarding my name or my position or anything else But you might have done remember replied the thin faced rector looking at me calmly yet mysteriously with those straight grey eyes of his I don t follow you mister Shuttleworth I said much puzzled Probably not was his response I had no intention to obtrude myself upon you I merely called at Wilton Street in order to learn what I could and I came away quite satisfied even though your butler spoke so sharply But with what motive did you make your inquiries I demanded Well as a matter of fact my motive was in your own interests mister Biddulph he replied as he thoughtfully contemplated the end of his cigarette This may sound strange to you but the truth could I but reveal it to you would be found much stranger a truth utterly incredible The truth of what The truth concerning a certain young lady in whom I understand you have evinced an unusual interest was his reply I could see that he was slightly embarrassed I recollected how he had silently watched us on that memorable night by the moonlit lake and a feeling of resentment arose within me Yes I said anxiously next moment I am here to learn the truth concerning Miss Pennington Tell me about her She has explained to me that you are her friend and I see yonder you have her photograph It is true he said very slowly in a low earnest voice quite true Son er Sylvia is my friend and he coughed quickly to conceal the slip in the name Then tell me something about her and her father Who is he I urged At her request I left Gardone suddenly and came home to England At her request he echoed in surprise Why did she send you away from her side I hesitated Should I reveal to him the truth She declared that it was better for us to remain apart I said Yes he sighed And she spoke the truth mister Biddulph the entire truth remember Why Do tell me what you know concerning the man Pennington I regret that I am not permitted to do that Why For some moments he did not reply He twisted his cigarette in his thin nervous fingers his gaze being fixed upon the lawn outside At last however he turned to me and in a low rather strained tone said slowly The minister of religion sometimes learns strange family secrets but as a servant of God the confidences and confessions reposed in him must always be treated as absolutely sacred Therefore he added please do not ask me again to betray my trust His was indeed a stern rebuke I saw that in my eager enthusiasm I had expected him to reveal a forbidden truth Therefore I stammered an apology No apology is needed was his grave reply his keen eyes fixed upon me But I hope you will forgive me if I presume to give you in your own interests a piece of advice And what is that To keep yourself as far as possible from both Pennington and his daughter he responded slowly and distinctly a strange expression upon his clean shaven face But why do you tell me this I cried still much mystified Have you not told me that you are Sylvia s friend I have told you this because it is my duty to warn those in whose path a pitfall is spread And is a pitfall spread in mine Yes replied the grave faced ascetic looking rector as he leaned forward to emphasize his words Before you my dear sir there lies an open grave Behind it stands that girl yonder and he pointed with his lean finger to the framed photograph and if you attempt to reach her you must inevitably fall into the pit that death trap so cunningly prepared Do not I beg of you attempt to approach the unattainable I saw that he was in dead earnest But why I demanded in my despair for assuredly the enigma was increasing hourly Why are you not open and frank with me I I confess I You love her eh he asked looking at me quickly as he interrupted me Ah yes he sighed as a dark shadow overspread his thin pale face I guessed as much a fatal love You are young and enthusiastic and her pretty face her sweet voice and her soft eyes have fascinated you How I wish mister Biddulph that I could reveal to you the ghastly horrible truth Though I am your friend and hers yet I must alas remain silent The inviolable seal of The Confessional is upon my lips CHAPTER FIVE THE DARK HOUSE IN BAYSWATER Edmund Shuttleworth the thin faced clean shaven Hampshire rector had spoken the truth His manner and speech were that of an honest man Within myself I could but admit it Yet I loved Sylvia Why I cannot tell How can a man tell why he loves First love is more than the mere awakening of a passion it is transition to another state of being When it is born the man is new made Yet as the spring days passed I lived in suspicion and wonder ever mystified ever apprehensive Each morning I looked eagerly for a letter from her yet each morning I was disappointed It seemed true as Shuttleworth had said that an open gulf lay between us Where was she I wondered I dared not write to Gardone as she had begged me not to do so She had left there no doubt for was she not a constant wanderer Was not her stout bald headed father the modern incarnation of the Wandering Jew May lengthened into June with its usual society functions and all the wild gaiety of the London season The Derby passed and Ascot came the Park was full every day theatres and clubs were crowded and the hotels overflowed with Americans and country cousins I had many invitations but accepted few Somehow my careless cosmopolitanism had left me I had become a changed man And if I were to believe the woman who had come so strangely and so suddenly into my life I was a marked man also Disturbing thoughts often arose within me in the silence of the night but laughing at them I crushed them down What had I possibly to fear I had no enemy that I was aware of The whole suggestion seemed so utterly absurd and far fetched Jack Marlowe came back from Denmark hale and hearty and more than once I was sorely tempted to explain to him the whole situation Only I feared he would jeer at me as a love sick idiot What was the secret held by that grey faced country parson Whatever it might be it was no ordinary one He had spoken of the seal of The Confessional What sin had Sylvia Pennington confessed to him Day after day as I sat in my den at Wilton Street smoking moodily and thinking I tried vainly to imagine what cardinal sin she could have committed My sole thoughts were of her and my all consuming eagerness was to meet her again On the night of the twentieth of June I remember the date well because the Gold Cup had been run that afternoon I had come in from supper at the Ritz about a quarter to one and retired to bed I suppose I must have turned in about half an hour when the telephone at my bedside rang and I answered Hulloa asked a voice Is that you Owen Yes I replied Jack speaking Jack Marlowe exclaimed the distant voice Is that you Owen Your voice sounds different So does yours a bit I said Voices often do on the phone Where are you I m out in Bayswater Althorp House Porchester Terrace my friend replied I m in a bit of a tight corner Can you come here I m so sorry to trouble you old man I wouldn t ask you to turn out at this hour if it weren t imperative Certainly I ll come I said my curiosity at once aroused But what s up Oh nothing very alarming he laughed Nothing to worry over I ve been playing cards and lost a bit that s all Bring your cheque book I want to pay up before I leave You understand I know you ll help me like the good pal you always are Why of course I will old man was my prompt reply I ve got to pay up my debts for the whole week nearly a thousand Been infernally unlucky Never had such vile luck Have you got it in the bank I can pay you all right at the end of next week Yes I said I can let you have it These people know you and they ll take your cheque they say Right ho I said I ll get a taxi and be up with you in half an hour You re a real good pal Owen Remember the address Althorp House Porchester Terrace cried my friend cheerily Get here as soon as you can as I want to get home So long And after promising to hurry I hung up the receiver again Dear old Jack always was a bit reckless He had a good income allowed him by his father but was just a little too fond of games of chance He had been hard hit in February down at Monte Carlo and I had lent him a few hundreds to tide him over Yet by his remarks over the phone I could only gather that he had fallen into the hands of sharpers who held him up until he paid no uncommon thing in London Card sharpers are generally blackmailers as well and no doubt these people were bleeding poor Jack to a very considerable tune I rose dressed and placing my revolver in my hip pocket in case of trouble walked towards Victoria Station where I found a belated taxi Within half an hour I alighted before a large dark house about half way up Porchester Terrace Bayswater standing back from the road with small garden in front a house with closely shuttered windows the only light showing being that in the fanlight over the door My approaching taxi was being watched for I suppose for as I crossed the gravel the door fell back and a smart middle aged man servant admitted me I want to see mister Marlowe I said Are you mister Biddulph he inquired eyeing me with some suspicion I replied in the affirmative whereupon he invited me to step upstairs while I followed him up the wide well carpeted staircase and along a corridor on the first floor into a small sitting room at the rear of the house mister Marlowe will be here in a few moments sir he said he left a message asking you to wait He and mister Forbes have just gone across the road to a friend s house I ll send over and tell him you are here if you ll kindly take a seat The room was small fairly well furnished but old fashioned and lit by an oil lamp upon the table The air was heavy with tobacco smoke and near the window was a card table whereat four players had been seated The cigar ash bore testimony to recent occupation of the four chairs while two packs of cards had been flung down just as the men had risen The window was hidden by long curtains of heavy moss green plush while in one corner of the room upon a black marble pedestal stood a beautiful sculptured statuette of a girl her hands uplifted together above her head in the act of diving I examined the exquisite work of art and saw upon its brass plate the name of an eminent French sculptor The carpet of a peculiar shade of red which contrasted well with the dead white enamelled walls was soft to the tread so that my footsteps fell noiselessly as I moved Beside the fireplace was a big inviting saddle bag chair into which I presently sank awaiting Jack Who were his friends I wondered The house seemed silent as the grave I listened for Jack s footsteps but could hear nothing I was hoping that the loss of nearly a thousand pounds would cure my friend of his gambling propensities Myself I had never experienced a desire to gamble A sovereign or so on a race was the extent of my adventures The table the cards the tantalus stand and the empty glasses told their own tale I was sorry truly sorry that Jack should mix with such people professional gamblers without a doubt Every man about town in London knows what a crowd of professional players and blackmailers infest the big hotels on the look out for pigeons to pluck The American bars of London each have their little circle of well dressed sharks and woe betide the victims who fall into their unscrupulous hands I had believed Jack Marlowe to be more wary He was essentially a man of the world and had always laughed at the idea that he could be had by sharpers or induced to play with strangers I think I must have waited for about a quarter of an hour As I sat there I felt overcome by a curious drowsiness due no doubt to the strenuous day I had had for I had driven down to Ascot in the car and had gone very tired to bed Suddenly without a sound the door opened and a youngish dark haired clean shaven man in evening dress entered swiftly accompanied by another man a few years older tall and thin whose nose and pimply face was that of a person much dissipated Both were smoking cigars You are mister Biddulph I believe exclaimed the younger Marlowe expects you He s over the road talking to the girl What girl Oh a little girl who lives over there he said with a mysterious smile But have you brought the cheque he asked He told us that you d settle up with us Yes I said I have my cheque book in my pocket Then perhaps you ll write it he said taking a pen and ink and blotter from a side table and placing it upon the card table The amount altogether is one thousand one hundred and ten pounds he remarked consulting an envelope he took from his pocket I shall give you a cheque for it when my friend comes I said Yes but we don t want to be here all night you know laughed the pimply faced man You may as well draw it now and hand it over to us when he comes in How long is he likely to be How can we tell He s a bit gone on her Who is she Oh a little girl my friend Reckitt here knows interrupted the younger man Rather pretty Reckitt is a fair judge of good looks Have a cigarette and the man offered me a cigarette which out of common courtesy I was bound to take from his gold case I sat back in my chair and lit up and as I did so my ears caught the faint sound of a receding motor car Aren t you going to draw the cheque asked the man with the pimply face Marlowe said you would settle at once Charles Reckitt is my name Make it out to me And so I will as soon as he arrives I replied Why not now We ll give you a receipt I don t know at what amount he acknowledges the debt I pointed out But we ve told you haven t we One thousand one hundred and ten pounds That s according to your reckoning He may add up differently you know I said with a doubtful smile You mean that you doubt us eh asked Reckitt a trifle angrily Not in the least I assured him with a smile If the game is fair then the loss is fair also A good sportsman like my friend never objects to pay what he has lost But you evidently object to pay for him eh he sneered I do not I protested If it were double the amount I would pay it Only I first want to know what he actually owes That he ll tell you when he returns Yet I can t see why you should object to make out the cheque now and hand it to us on his arrival I ll prepare the receipt at any rate I for one want to get off to bed And the speaker sat down in one of the chairs at the card table and wrote out a receipt for the amount signing it Charles Reckitt across the stamp he stuck upon it Then presently he rose impatiently and crossing the room exclaimed How long are we to be humbugged like this I ve got to get out to Croydon and it s late Come on Forbes Let s go over and dig Marlowe out eh So the pair left the room promising to return with Jack in a few minutes and closed the door after them When they had gone I sat for a moment reflecting I did not like the look of either of them Their faces were distinctly sinister and their manner overbearing I felt that the sooner I left that silent house the better So crossing to the table I drew out my cheque book and hastily wrote an open cheque payable to Charles Reckitt for one thousand one hundred and ten pounds I did so in order that I should have it in readiness on Jack s return in order that we might get away quickly Whatever possessed my friend to mix with such people as those I could not imagine A few moments later I had already put the cheque back into my breast pocket and was re seated in the arm chair when of a sudden and apparently of its own accord the chair gave way the two arms closing over my knees in such a manner that I was tightly held there It happened in a flash So quickly did it collapse that for a moment I was startled for the chair having tipped back I had lost my balance my head being lower than my legs And at that instant struggling in such an undignified position and unable to extricate myself the chair having closed upon me the door suddenly opened and the man Reckitt with his companion Forbes re entered the room CHAPTER SIX A GHASTLY TRUTH Ere I could recover myself or utter a word the pair dashed towards me seized my hands deftly and secured them behind the chair What do you mean by this you infernal blackguards I cried angrily Release me They only grinned in triumph I struggled to free my right hand in order to get at my revolver But it was held far too securely I saw that I had been cleverly entrapped The man with the pimply face placed his hand within my breast pocket and took therefrom its contents with such confidence that it appeared certain I had been watched while writing the cheque He selected it from among my letters and papers and opening it said in a tone of satisfaction That s all right as far as it goes But we must have another thousand You ll have nothing from me I replied sitting there powerless yet defiant I don t believe Marlowe has been here at all It s only a trap and I ve fallen into it You ve paid your friend s debts replied the man gruffly now you ll pay your own I owe you nothing you infernal swindler I responded quickly This is a pretty game you are playing one which you ve played before it seems The police shall know of this It will interest them They won t know through you laughed the fellow But we don t want to discuss that matter I m just going to write out a cheque for one thousand and you ll sign it I ll do nothing of the sort I declared firmly Oh yes you will remarked the younger man You ve got money and you can easily afford a thousand I ll not give you one single penny I declared And further I shall stop that cheque you ve stolen from me Reckitt had already seated himself opened my cheque book and was writing out a draft When he had finished it he crossed to me with the book and pen in hand saying Now you may as well just sign this at first as at last I shall do no such thing was my answer You ve entrapped me here but you are holding me at your peril You can t frighten me into giving you a thousand pounds for I haven t it at the bank Oh yes you have replied the man with the red face We ve already taken the precaution to find out We don t make haphazard guesses you know Now sign it and at eleven o clock to morrow morning you shall be released after we have cashed your cheques Where is Marlowe I inquired With the girl I suppose What girl Well exclaimed the other her photograph is in the next room perhaps you d like to see it It does not interest me I replied But the fellow Forbes left the room for a moment and returned with a fine panel photograph in his hand He held it before my gaze I started in utter amazement It was the picture of Sylvia The same that I had seen in Shuttleworth s study You know her eh remarked Reckitt with a grim smile Yes I gasped Where is she Across the road with your friend Jack Marlowe It s a lie A confounded lie I won t believe it I cried Yet at that moment I realized the ghastly truth that I had tumbled into the hidden pitfall against which both Shuttleworth and Sylvia had warned me Could it be possible I asked myself that Sylvia my adored Sylvia had some connection with these blackguards that she had been aware of their secret intentions Sign this cheque and you shall see her if you wish said the man who had written out the draft She will remain with you here till eleven to morrow Why should I give you a thousand pounds I demanded Is not a thousand a small price to pay for the service we are prepared to render you to return to you your lost lady love queried the fellow I was dying with anxiety to see her to speak with her to hold her hand Had she not warned me against this cunningly devised trap yet had I not foolishly fallen into it They had followed me to England and run me to earth at home And supposing that I gave you the money how do I know that you would keep faith with me I asked We shall keep faith with you never fear Reckitt replied his sinister face broadening into a smile It is simply for you to pay for your release or we shall hold you here until you submit Just your signature and to morrow at eleven you are a free man And if I refuse what then I asked If you refuse well I fear that you will ever regret it that s all I can only tell you that it is not wise to refuse We are not in the habit of being met with refusal the punishment is too severe The man spoke calmly leaning with his back against the table the cheque and pen still in his hand And if I sign you will bring Sylvia here You will promise me that upon your word of honour Yes we promise you was the man s reply I want to see Marlowe if he is here I tell you he s not here He s across the way with her I believe if I could have got to my revolver at that moment I should have shot the fellow dead I bit my lip and remained silent I now felt no doubt that this was the trap of which Sylvia had given me warning on that moonlit terrace beside the Italian lake By some unaccountable means she knew what was intended against me This clever trapping of men was apparently a regular trade of theirs If I could but gain time I felt that I might outwit them Yet sitting there like a trussed fowl I must have cut a pretty sorry figure How many victims had like myself sat there and been bled Come exclaimed the red faced adventurer impatiently we are losing time Are you going to sign the cheque or not I shall not was my firm response You already have stolen one cheque of mine And we shall cash it when your bank opens in the morning my dear sir remarked Forbes airily And make yourselves scarce afterwards eh But I ve had a good look at you remember I could identify you anywhere I said You won t have that chance I m afraid declared Reckitt meaningly You must think we re blunderers if you contemplate that and he grinned at his companion Now he added turning again to me for the last time I ask you if you will sign this cheque I have written And for the last time I tell you that you are a pair of blackguards and that I will do nothing of the sort Not even if we bring the girl here to you I hesitated much puzzled by the strangeness of the attitude of the pair Their self confidence was amazing Sign it he urged Sign it in your own interests and in hers Why in hers You will see after you have appended your signature When I have seen her I will sign I replied at last but not before You seem to have regarded me as a pigeon to pluck But you ll find out I m a hawk before you ve done with me I think not smiled the cool mannered Reckitt Even if you are a hawk you re caged You must admit that I shall shout murder and alarm the police I threatened Shout away my dear fellow replied my captor No sound can be heard outside this room Shriek We shall like to hear you You won t have opportunity to do so very much longer Why Because refusal will bring upon you a fate more terrible than you have ever imagined was the fellow s hard reply We are men of our word remember It is not wise to trifle with us And I am also a man of my word You cannot obtain money from me by threats But we offer you a service in return to bring Sylvia to you Where is her father I demanded You d better ask her replied Forbes with a grin Sign this and see her She is anxious very anxious to meet you How do you know that We know more than you think mister Biddulph was the sharper s reply His exterior was certainly that of a gentleman in his well cut dinner jacket and a fine diamond stud in his shirt I could only think that the collapsible chair in which I sat was worked by a lever from outside the room There was a spy hole somewhere at which they could watch the actions of their victims and take them unawares as I had been taken And now asked Reckitt have you fully reflected upon the serious consequences of your refusal to sign this cheque I have was my unwavering reply Do as you will I refuse to be blackmailed Your refusal will cause disaster to yourself and to her You will share the same fate a horrible one She tried to warn you and you refused to heed her So you will both experience the same horror What horror I have no fear of you I said He refuses Reckitt said with a harsh laugh addressing his accomplice We will now let him see what is in store for him how we punish those who remain defiant Bring in the table Forbes disappeared for a moment and then returned bearing a small round table upon which stood a silver cigar box and a lighted candle The table he placed at my side close to my elbow Then Forbes took something from a drawer and ere I was aware of it he had slipped a leathern collar over my head and strapped it to the back of the chair so that in a few seconds I was unable to move my head from side to side What are you doing you blackguards I cried in fierce anger You shall pay for this I warrant But they only laughed in triumph for held as I was I was utterly helpless in their unscrupulous hands and unable to lift a finger in self defence my defiance must have struck them as ridiculous Now said Reckitt standing near the small table you see this and leaning forward he touched the cigar box the lid of which opened with a spring Next second something shot quite close to my face startling me I looked and instantly became filled with an inexpressible horror for there upon the table lay a small black venomous snake To its tail was attached a fine green silken cord and this was in turn fastened to the candle The wooden candle stick was I saw screwed down to the table The cord entered the wax candle about two inches lower than the flame I gave a cry of horror whereat both men laughed heartily Now said Reckitt I promised you an unexpected surprise There it is In half an hour the flame will reach the cord and sever it Then the snake will strike That half hour will give you ample time for reflection You fiends I cried struggling desperately to free myself In doing so I moved my head slightly when the snake again darted at me like a flash only falling short about an inch from my cheek The reptile fell back recoiled itself and with head erect its cruel beady eyes watching me intently sat up ready to strike again The blood froze in my veins I was horrified held there only one single inch from death We wish you a very good night laughed Forbes as both he and his companion walked towards the door You will have made a closer acquaintance with the snake ere we cash your cheque in the morning Yes said Reckitt turning upon me with a grin And Sylvia too will share the same fate as yourself for daring to warn you against us No I cried spare her spare her I implored But the men had already passed out of the room locking the door securely after them I lay back silent motionless listening not daring to move a muscle because of that hideous reptile closely guarding me I suppose ten minutes must have passed ten of the most awful minutes of terror and disgust I have ever experienced in all my life then a sound broke the dead stillness of the night I heard a woman s loud piercing scream a scream of sudden horror Sylvia s voice It seemed to emanate from the room beyond Again it was repeated I heard her shriek distinctly Ah No spare me Not that not that Only a wall divided us yet I was powerless held there face to face with a terrible and revolting death unable to save her unable to raise my hand in self defence She shrieked again in an agony of terror I lay there breathless petrified by horror CHAPTER SEVEN THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE I shuddered at the horrible fate to which those scoundrels had abandoned me Again the cruel flat head of the snake darted forth viciously to within a single inch of my left cheek I tried to draw back but to move was impossible held as I was by that leathern collar made expressly for securing the head immovable My eyes were fixed upon the steady candle flame It was burning lower and lower each moment I watched it in fascination Each second I grew nearer that terrible revolting end What had happened to Sylvia I strained my ears to catch any further sound But there was none The house was now silent as the grave That pair of scoundrels had stolen my cheque and in the morning after my death would cash it and escape with the proceeds I glanced around that weird room How many previous victims had sat in that fatal chair and awaited death as I was waiting I wondered The whole plot betrayed a devilish ingenuity and cunning Its very character showed that the conspirators were no ordinary criminals they were past masters in crime The incidents of the night in London are too often incredible A man can meet with adventures in the metropolis as strange as exciting and as perilous as any in unknown lands Here surely was one in point I remember experiencing a strange dizziness a curious nausea due perhaps to the fact that my head lay lower than my body My thoughts became muddled I regretted deeply that I had not signed the cheque and saved Sylvia Yet were they not absolute blackguards Would they have kept faith with me I was breathless in apprehension What had happened to Sylvia By slow imperceptible degrees the candle burned lower The flame was long and steady Nearer and nearer it approached that thin green cord which alone separated me from death Again the serpent hissed and darted forth angry at being so near its prey and yet prevented from striking angry that its tail was knotted to the cord I saw it writhing and twisting upon the table and noted its peculiar markings of black and yellow Its eyes were bright and searching I had read of the fascination which a snake s gaze exercises over its prey and now I experienced it a fatal fascination I could not keep my eyes off the deadly reptile It watched me intently as though it knew full well that ere long it must be victorious Victorious What did that mean A sharp stinging pain and then an agonizing painful death my head swollen hideously to twice its size my body held there in that mechanical vice suffering all the tortures of the damned The mere contemplation of that awful fate held me transfixed by horror Suddenly I heard Sylvia s shriek repeated I shouted but no words came back to me in return Was she suffering the same fearful agony of mind as myself Had those brutes carried out their threat They knew she had betrayed them it seemed and they had therefore taken their bitter and cowardly revenge Where was Pennington that he did not rescue her I cursed myself for being such an idiot Yet I had no idea that such a cunningly devised trap could be prepared I had never dreamed when I went forth to pull Jack out of a hole that I was deliberately placing my head in such a noose What did it all mean Why had these men formed this plot against me What had I done to merit such deadly vengeance as this a torture of the Middle Ages Vainly I tried to think As far as I knew I had never met either Forbes or Reckitt before in all my life They were complete strangers to me I remembered there had been something about the man servant who admitted me that seemed familiar but what it was I could not decide Perhaps I had seen him before somewhere in the course of my wanderings but where I knew not I recollected that soon after I had entered there I had heard the sound of a motor car receding My waiting taxi had evidently been paid and dismissed How would they dispose of my body I lay wondering There were many ways of doing so I reflected They might burn it or bury it or pack it in a trunk and consign it to some distant address When one remembers how many persons are every year reported to the London police as missing one can only believe that the difficulties in getting rid of the corpse of a victim are not so great as is popularly imagined Speak with any detective officer of the Metropolitan Police and if he is frank he will tell you that a good many people meet with foul play each year in every quarter of London they disappear and are never again heard of Sometimes their disappearance is reported in the newspapers a brief paragraph but in the case of people of the middle class only their immediate relatives know that they are missing Many a London house with deep basement and a flight of steps leading to its front door could if its walls had lips tell a tragic and terrible story For one assassination discovered ten remain unknown or merely vaguely suspected How many thousands of pounds had these men Forbes and Reckitt secured I wondered And how many poor helpless victims had felt the serpent s fang and breathed their last in that fatal chair I now occupied A dog howled dismally somewhere at the back The men had told me that no sound could be heard beyond those walls yet had I not heard Sylvia s shrieks If I had heard them then she could also hear me I shouted her name shouted as loud as I could But my voice in that small room somehow seemed dulled and drowned Sylvia I shouted I am here I Owen Biddulph Where are you But there was no response That horrible snake rose erect looking at me with its never wavering gaze I saw the pointed tongue darting from its mouth There before me soon to be released was Death in reptile form Death the most revolting and most terrible That silence appalled me Sylvia had not replied Was she already dead stricken down by the fatal fang I called again Sylvia Sylvia But there came no answer I set my teeth and struggled to free myself until the veins in my forehead were knotted and my bonds cut into the flesh But alas I was held as in the tentacles of an octopus Every limb was gripped so that already a numbness had overspread them while my senses were frozen with horror Suddenly the lamp failed and died out and the room was plunged in darkness save for the zone of light shed by the unflickering flame of the candle And there lay the weird and horrible reptile coiled awaiting its release It seemed to watch the lessening candle just as I myself watched it That sudden failure of the light caused me anxious reflections A moment later I heard the front door bang That decided me It was as I had feared The pair of scoundrels had departed and left me to my fate The small marble clock upon the mantelshelf opposite struck three I counted the strokes I had been in that room nearly an hour and a half How did they know of Jack Marlowe and his penchant for cards Surely the trap had been well baited and devised with marvellous cunning That cheque of mine would be cashed at my bank in the morning without question I should be dead and they would be free For myself I did not care so very much My chief thought was of Sylvia and of the awful fate which had overtaken her because she had dared to warn me that fate of which she had spoken so strangely on the night when we had talked on the hotel terrace at Gardone That moonlit scene the whole of it passed through my fevered unbalanced brain I lived those moments of ecstasy over again I felt her soft hand in mine I looked again into those wonderful fathomless eyes I heard that sweet musical voice I listened to those solemn words of warning I believed myself to be once more beside the mysterious girl who had come into my life so strangely who had held me in fascination for life or death The candle flame still straight and unflickering seemed like a pillar of fire while beyond lay a cavernous blackness I thought I heard a slight noise as though my enemies were lurking there in the shadow Yet it was a mere chimera of my overwrought brain I recollected the strange bracelet of Sylvia s the serpent with its tail in its mouth the ancient symbol of Eternity And I soon would be launched into Eternity by the poisonous fang of that flat headed little reptile Thoughts of Sylvia that strange sweet faced girl of my dreams filled my senses Those shrieks resounded in my ears She had cried for help and yet I was powerless to rescue her from the hands of that pair of hell fiends I struggled and succeeded in moving slightly But the snake maddened by its bond struck again at me viciously his darting tongue almost touching my shrinking flesh A blood red mist rose suddenly before my eyes My head swam My overwrought brain paralyzed by horror became unbalanced I felt a tightness in the throat In my ears once again I heard the hiss of the loathsome reptile a venomous threatening hiss as its dark shadow darted before me struggling to strike my cheek Through the red mist I saw that the candle burned so low that the edge of the wax was on a level with the green silk cord that slender thread which withheld Death from me I looked again A groan of agony escaped me Again the angry hiss of the serpent sounded Again its dark form shot between my eyes and the unflickering flame of the candle That flame was slowly but surely consuming the cord I shrieked for help in my abject despair The mist grew more red more impenetrable A lump arose in my throat preventing me from breathing And then I lapsed into the blackness of unconsciousness CHAPTER EIGHT PRESENTS ANOTHER PROBLEM When by slow degrees I became aware of things about me I found myself in total darkness save that straight before my eyes some few feet away showed a thin narrow line of light Next second a flood of the most horrible recollections surged through my brain I dare not move a muscle fearing that the reptile was lurking near my face My senses seemed dulled and dazed yet my recollections were quite clear Every detail of those moments of awful terror stood out clear and fearsome in my mind Slowly so slow indeed as to be imperceptible I managed to turn my head aside and glance at the small table But it was in darkness I could distinguish nothing To my surprise I discovered however that though I still remained in that position my legs higher than my head yet the arms of the chair had unclasped and my bonds had been freed What had happened In fear of bringing the watchful reptile upon me I moved slightly But there was no movement from that table in the darkness I waited dreading lest I should be suddenly attacked Then summoning courage I suddenly sprang out of the chair on the side opposite the table and dashed across to where showed that narrow streak of light I saw that it came through the lower crevice of the heavy wooden shutters With frantic haste my hands slid over them I found an iron bar and this unlatched I threw them back and let in the broad light of day For a moment my eyes were dazzled by the sunlight Then on looking behind me I saw that upon the table the candle had burned itself to its socket while on the floor near by lay the small black reptile stretched out motionless I feared at first to approach it To its tail the cord was still attached but it had been severed I crept towards it and bending down realized with great relief that it was dead The leathern collar which had secured my head had been loosened and the mechanism of the chair reversed allowing me my freedom I looked around the room in wonder There stood the littered card table and the empty glasses of the previous night while the air was still heavy with the odour of stale cigars Making quite certain that the reptile was dead I turned my attention to the chair and noted how cleverly the devilish mechanism had been hidden It could as I had suspected be worked from without The victim once seated there had no chance whatever of escape In the light of day the room that fatal apartment wherein more than one innocent man had no doubt met with a horrible end looked very shabby and dingy The furniture was cheap and tawdry and the carpet very dirty There upon the card table stood the ink while the pen used by Reckitt lay upon the floor My wallet lay open near by I took it up quickly to glance through its contents As far as I could discover nothing had been taken except the cheque I had written out believing I was to assist Jack Marlowe Eagerly I glanced at my watch and found it was already a quarter past ten The scoundrels had no doubt already been to the bank cashed my cheque and were by this time clear away Remembering Sylvia I drew my revolver which still remained in my hip pocket and finding the door unlocked went forth to search for her The fact that the door was now unlocked showed that some one had entered there during my unconsciousness and released me From the appearance of the snake it seemed to have been killed by a sharp blow across its back Some one had rescued me just in the nick of time I entered the front room on the same floor the room whence those woman s screams had emanated It was a big bare drawing room furnished in the ugly Early Victorian style musty smelling and moth eaten The dirty holland blinds fitted badly and had holes in them therefore sufficient light was admitted to afford me a good view of the large apartment There was nothing unusual there save upon a small work table lay some embroidery work where apparently it had been put down An open novel lay near while close by was a big bowl filled with yellow roses Yet the apartment seemed to have been long closed and neglected while the atmosphere had a musty odour which was not dispelled by the sweet perfume of the flowers Had Sylvia been in this room when she had shrieked I saw something upon the floor and picked it up It proved to be a narrow band of turquoise blue velvet the ornament from a woman s hair Did it belong to her In vain I looked around for a candle for evidences of the same mediaeval torture to which I had been submitted but there were none In fear and trepidation I entered yet another room on the same floor but it was dusty and neglected a kind of sitting room or perhaps boudoir for there was an old fashioned high backed piano in it Yet there was no sign that anybody had entered there for weeks perhaps for months In the sunlight I saw that there were cobwebs everywhere Surely it was a very strange house It struck me that its owner had perhaps died years ago and since then it had remained untenanted Everywhere the style of furniture was that of sixty years ago and thick dust was covering all On entering the previous night I had not noticed this but now in the broad light of day the place looked very different I saw to my surprise that the windows had not been cleaned for years and that cobwebs hung everywhere Revolver in hand I searched the place to the basement but there was no evidence of occupation The doors of the kitchens had not apparently been opened for years Upstairs the bedrooms were old fashioned with heavy hangings grey with dust and half hidden by festoons of cobwebs In not a single room was a bed that had been slept in Indeed I question if any one had ascended to the second floor for several years As I stood in one of the rooms gazing round in wonder and half suffocated by the dust my footsteps had disturbed it suddenly occurred to me that the pair of assassins believing that I had died would no doubt return and dispose of my body To me it seemed certain that this was not the first occasion that they had played the dastardly and brutal game Yes I felt positive they would return I searched the place to find a telephone but there was none The bogus message sent to me had been sent from elsewhere The only trace of Sylvia I could find was that piece of velvet ribbon the embroidery which had so hastily been flung down and the bowl of fresh roses Why had she been there The book and the embroidery showed that she had waited For what That bowl of roses had been placed there to make the room look fresh for some attempt had been made to clean the apartment just as it had been made in the room wherein I had suffered such torture Why had Sylvia uttered those screams of horror I recollected those words of hers I recognized her voice I would indeed have recognized it among the voices of a thousand women I returned to the drawing room and gazed around it in wonder If as it seemed Reckitt and Forbes had taken unlawful possession of an untenanted house then it was probable they would not return to get rid of my remains The whole affair was incomprehensible It seemed evident that Sylvia had not fallen a victim to the vengeance of the pair as I had feared but that perhaps I had owed my life to her Could it be that she had learned of my peril released me killed the venomous reptile and escaped Suddenly as my eyes wandered about the dingy old room I caught sight of something shining A golden bangle of curious Indian design was lying upon the mantelshelf I took it up and in a moment recognized it as one I had seen upon her wrist one evening while she sat at dinner at Gardone I replaced it stood for a moment deep in thought and then with sudden resolve returned to the chamber of horror obtained my hat and descending the stairs went forth into Porchester Terrace I had to walk as far as Bayswater Road before I could find a taxi The sun was now shining brightly and there were many people about in the streets Finding a cab at last I told the man to drive with all speed to my bank in Oxford Street It was just eleven when I went up to the counter to one of the paying cashiers I knew and asked him breathlessly if a cheque of mine had been paid to a person named Reckitt He saw by my manner that I was in hot haste I ve cashed it not a moment ago mister Biddulph was his reply Why you must have passed the man as you came in He s only this moment gone out Without a word I dashed back to the swing doors and there sure enough only a few yards away I caught sight of Forbes in a smart grey flannel suit entering a taxi I shouted but the taxi man did not hear me He was facing westward and ere I could attract his attention he was slowly moving in the direction of the Marble Arch The quick eyes of Forbes had however detected me and leaning out he said something to his driver Quickly I re entered my cab and told my man to turn and follow pointing out the taxi in front Mine was open while that in which the assassin sat was closed In his pocket the scoundrel carried over a thousand pounds of my money My first impulse was to stop and inform a police constable but if I did so I saw that he must escape I shouted to my driver to try and see the number of the cab but there was a lot of traffic and he was unable to see it clearly I suppose I must have cut a sorry figure dishevelled as I was by my night s weird experience and covered with the dust of that untenanted house What the bank clerk must have thought I know not It was an exciting chase For a moment we were held up by the police at Regent Circus for there was much traffic but only for a brief space then we tore after the receding cab at a pace which made many passers by stare The cab in which Forbes was being closed the driver did not see us but I knew that the assassin was watching us from the tiny window in the back and was giving his driver instructions through the front window My man had entered fully into the spirit of the chase That fellow in yonder taxi has just stolen a thousand pounds I told him All right sir replied my driver as he bent over his wheel we shall catch him presently never fear I m keeping my eye upon him all right There were many taxis coming into the line of traffic from Bond Street and from the other main thoroughfares crossing Oxford Street red taxis just like the one in which Forbes was escaping Yet we both kept our eyes fixed upon that particular one the driver of which presently bent sideways and shot back a glance at us Then he put on speed and with marvellous dexterity threaded in and out of the motor buses and carts in front of him I was compelled to admire his driving I could only suppose that Forbes had offered him something handsome if he got safely away At the Marble Arch he suddenly turned down Park Lane where the traffic was less and there gaining upon us he turned into one of the smaller streets through Upper Grosvenor Street winding in and out the intricate thoroughfares which lay between Grosvenor Square and Regent Street Across Hanover Square and along Hanover Street we sped until passing out on to the opposite side of Regent Street the driver evidently believing that he had outwitted us slowed down and then pulled up suddenly before a shop Ere the fugitive could escape indeed ere the door could be opened we had pulled up a few yards away and I dashed out and up to the door of the cab my revolver gripped in my hand My driver had descended also and gained the other side of the cab almost as soon as I had I opened the door and met the fugitive boldly face to face Next second I fell back as though I had received a blow I stood aghast I could utter no word The mystery had I realized in that second been increased a hundredfold CHAPTER NINE FACE TO FACE On opening the door of the taxi I stood amazed to find that the occupant was not a man but a woman It was Sylvia She started at sight of me Her countenance blanched to the lips as she drew back and sat erect a cry of dismay escaping her lips You I gasped utterly dumbfounded Why mister Biddulph she cried recovering herself in a moment and stretching forth her small gloved hand fancy meeting you like this What words I uttered I scarcely knew This sudden transformation of the scoundrel Forbes into Sylvia Pennington held me bewildered All I could imagine was that Sylvia must have been awaiting the man in another cab close to the bank and that in the course of our chase we had confused the two taxis Forbes had succeeded in turning away into some side street while we had followed the cab of his companion She had actually awaited him in another cab while he had entered the bank and cashed the stolen cheque My taxi driver when he saw that a lady and not a man occupied the fugitive cab drew back returning to his seat Do you know exclaimed the girl with wonderful calmness only yesterday I was thinking of you and wondering whether you were in London And only yesterday too Miss Pennington I also was thinking of you I said meaningly She was dressed very quietly in dead black which increased the fairness of her skin and hair wearing a big black hat and black gloves She was inexpressibly smart from the thin gauzy veil to the tips of her tiny patent leather shoes with a neat waist and a figure that any woman might envy Indeed in her London attire she seemed even smarter than she had appeared on the terrace beside the blue Italian lake Where is your father I managed to ask Oh well he s away just now He was with me in London only the other day she replied But as you know he s always travelling Then she added I m going into this shop a moment Will you wait for me I m so pleased to see you again and looking so well It seems really ages since we were at Gardone doesn t it and she smiled that old sweet smile I so well remembered I ll wait of course I replied and assisting her out I watched her pass into the big drapery establishment Then I idled outside amid the crowd of women who were dawdling before the attractive windows as is the feminine habit If it had been she who had rescued me from death and had released me what a perfect actress she was Her confusion had only lasted for a few seconds Then she had welcomed me and expressed pleasure at our re encounter I recollected the bow of ribbon velvet which reposed in my pocket and the Indian bangle I had found I remembered too those agonized terrified cries in the night and all the mysteries of that weird and silent house When she came forth I would question her I would obtain from her the truth anent those remarkable happenings Was it of that most ingenious and dastardly plot she had warned me Was her own conviction that she must suffer the penalty of death based upon the knowledge of the deadly instrument that venomous reptile used by the assassins Could it be that Pennington himself her own father was implicated in this shameful method of obtaining money and closing the lips of the victims As I stood there amid the morning bustle of Regent Street out in the broad sunshine all the ghastly horrors of the previous night crowded thickly upon me Why had she shrieked Ah not that not that Had she while held prisoner in that old fashioned drawing room been told of the awful fate to which I had been consigned I remembered how I had called to her but received no response And yet she must have been in the adjoining room Perhaps like myself she had fainted I recalled her voice distinctly I certainly had made no mistake She had been actually present in that house of black torture Therefore being my friend there seemed no doubt that to her I owed my mysterious salvation But how Aye that was the question Suddenly as I stood there on the crowded pavement I became conscious that I was attracting attention I recollected my dusty clothes and dirty dishevelled face I must have presented a strange dissipated out all night appearance And further I had lost a thousand pounds Up and down before the long range of shop windows I walked patiently awaiting her reappearance I was anxious to know the truth concerning the previous night s happenings a truth which I intended she should not conceal from me I glanced at my watch It was already past eleven o clock Morning shopping in Regent Street had now commenced in real earnest The thoroughfare was lined with carriages for was it not the height of the London season In and out of the big drapery establishment passed crowds of well dressed women most of them with pet dogs and others with male friends led like lambs to the slaughter The spectacle of a man in silk hat out shopping with a lady friend is always a pitiable one His very look craves the sympathy of the onlooker especially if he be laden with soft paper parcels My brain was awhirl My only thought was of Sylvia and of her strange connection with these undesirable persons who had so ingeniously stolen my money and who had baited such a fatal trap Anxious as I was to get to a telephone and ring up Jack yet I could not leave my post I had promised to await her Nearly an hour went by I entered the shop and searched its labyrinth of departments But I could not distinguish her anywhere Upstairs and downstairs I went inquiring here and there but nobody seemed to have seen the fair young lady in black the great emporium seemed to have swallowed her up It was now noon Even though she might have been through a dress fitting ordeal an hour was certainly ample time Therefore I began to fear that she had missed me There were several other exits higher up the street and also one which I discovered in a side street I returned to her taxi for I had already paid off my man The driver had not seen his fare I was hailed by the lady close to Chapel Street he said and I drove er to Oxford Street not far from Tottenham Court Road We stood at the kerb for about ten minutes Then she ordered me to drive with all speed over ere Did you see her speak with any gentleman She was with a dark youngish gentleman when they hailed me She got in and left im in Chapel Street I heard im say as we went off that he d see er again soon That s all you know of her Yes sir I ve never seen er before replied the driver Then he added with a smile Your man s been tellin me as how you thought I had a bank thief in my cab Yes but I was mistaken I said I must have made a mistake in the cab That s very easy sir We re so much alike us red uns Sylvia s non appearance much puzzled me What could it mean For another half hour an anxious impatient breathless half hour I waited but she did not return Had she too cleverly escaped by entering the shop and passing out by another entrance Another careful tour of the establishment revealed the fact that she certainly was not there And so after a wait of nearly two hours I was compelled to accept the hard and very remarkable fact that she had purposely evaded me and escaped Then she was in league with the men who had stolen my thousand pounds And yet had not that selfsame man declared that she having betrayed him was to meet the same terrible fate as that prepared for me For a final five minutes I waited then annoyed disappointed and dismayed entered the taxi and drove to Wilton Street On entering with my latch key Browning came forward with a puzzled expression surprised no doubt at my dishevelled appearance I ve been very anxious about you mister Owen exclaimed the old man I was always mister Owen to him just as I had been when a lad When I went to your room this morning I found your bed empty I wondered where you had gone I ve had a strange adventure Browning I laughed rather forcedly I fear Has mister Marlowe rung me up No sir But somebody else rang up about an hour ago and asked whether you were in Who was it I couldn t quite catch the name sir It sounded like Shuffle something Shuttleworth I cried Did he leave any message No sir He merely asked if you were in that s all As Sylvia was in London perhaps Shuttleworth was in town also I reflected Yet she had cleverly made her escape in order to avoid being questioned Her secret was a guilty one I called up Jack who answered cheerily as usual You didn t ring me up about one o clock this morning did you I inquired No Why he asked Oh well nothing I said I thought perhaps it might have been you that s all What time shall you be in at White s About four Will you be there Yes Right ho Good bye old man and he rang off I ascended to my room changed my clothes and made myself respectable But during the time I was dressing I reflected whether I should go to Scotland Yard and relate my strange experience Such clever fiends as Reckitt and Forbes deserved punishment What fearful crimes had been committed in that weird neglected house I dreaded to think My only hesitation however was caused by the thought that perhaps Sylvia might be implicated I felt somehow impelled to try and solve the problem for myself I had lost a thousand pounds Yet had I not fallen into that trap in utter disregard of Sylvia s warning Therefore I resolved to keep my own counsel for the present and to make a few inquiries in order to satisfy my curiosity So putting on a different suit a different collar and a soft felt hat which I never wore in a perhaps feeble attempt to transform myself from my usual appearance I went forth again My first visit was to the bank where I saw the manager and explained that the cheque had been stolen from my pocket though I did not expose the real facts Then after he had condoled with me upon my loss and offered to send the description of the thief to the police at once I re entered the taxi and drove back to Porchester Terrace alighting a short distance from Althorp House CHAPTER TEN CONTAINS A FURTHER SURPRISE It was nearly one o clock and the sun was high as I walked beneath the dingy brick walls which separate each short garden from the pavement In some gardens were stunted trees blackened by the London smoke while the houses were mostly large and comfortable for it is still considered a genteel if somewhat decayed neighbourhood Before that house of horror I paused for a moment The dingy blinds of yellow holland were drawn at each of the soot grimed windows blackened by age and dirt The garden was weedy and neglected for the grass grew high on the patch of lawn and the dead leaves of the tulips and daffodils of spring had not been removed The whole place presented a sadly neglected sorry appearance a state of uncared for disorder which in the darkness of night I had of course not noticed As I looked within the garden I saw lying behind the wall an old weather beaten notice board which bore the words To be let Furnished and giving the name of a well known firm of estate agents in Pall Mall The house next door was smart and well kept therefore I resolved to make inquiry there Of the tall thin old man servant who answered my ring I inquired the name of the occupant of Althorp House Well sir he replied there hasn t been an occupant since I ve been in service here and that s ten years last March An old lady lived there I ve heard a rather eccentric old lady They ve tried to let it furnished but nobody has taken it It is said that the old lady left instructions in her will that the furniture was to be left just as it was for twenty years after her death I expect the place must be fine and dirty An old woman goes there once every six weeks or so I believe just to open the doors and let in a little air But it s never cleaned And nobody has been over it with a view to renting it Not to my knowledge sir There s never been anybody going in or out eh Well I ve never seen them sir was the man s reply But there have been people coming and going have there not The man hesitated for a moment apparently slightly puzzled at my question Well sir to tell the truth there s been a very funny story about lately It is said that some of the old woman s relatives have returned and they ve been seen going in and out but always in the middle of the night What sort of people I asked quickly Oh two men and a woman so they say But of course I ve never seen anybody I ve asked the constables on night duty and they ve never seen any one or they would no doubt have reported it Then who has seen them I really don t know I heard the gossip over in the Royal Oak How it originated or whether it had any foundation in fact I can t find out I see the board has fallen down Yes that s been down for a couple of months or more blown down by the wind I suppose You haven t heard cabs stopping outside at night for instance No sir I sleep at the back and should therefore not hear I could see that he was a little uncertain as to the reason of my inquiries therefore I made an excuse that having been struck by the appearance of the house so long neglected my curiosity had been aroused You ve never heard of cabs stopping there at night I asked a few moments later Well this morning the cook who sleeps upstairs in front funnily enough told me a curious story of how in the night a taxi stopped and a gentleman got out and entered the house A few minutes later another man came forth from the house paid the taxi driver and he moved off But laughed the man servant I fancy cook had been dreaming I m going to ask the constable when he comes on duty to night if he saw any strangers here I smiled The man whom the cook saw had evidently been myself Then after a further chat I pressed half a crown into his ready palm and left My next visit was to the estate agents in Pall Mall where presenting myself as a possible tenant the clerk at whose table I had taken a seat said Well sir Althorp House is in such a bad neglected state that we do not now a days send clients to view it Old missus Carpenter died some thirteen years ago and according to her will the place had to be left undisturbed and let furnished The solicitors placed it in our hands but the property until the twenty years have elapsed is quite untenantable The whole place has now gone to rack and ruin We have a number of other furnished houses which I will be most delighted to give you orders to view In pretence that I wanted a house I allowed him to select three for me and while doing so learnt some further particulars regarding the dark house in Porchester Terrace As far as he knew the story of missus Carpenter s relatives taking secret possession was a myth The caretaker had been withdrawn two years ago and the place simply locked up and left If burglars broke in there was nothing of value for them to take he added Thus the result of my inquiries went to confirm my suspicion that the ingenious pair of malefactors had taken possession of the place temporarily in order to pursue their nefarious plans There was a garden at the rear Might it not also be the grave wherein the bodies of their innocent victims were interred That afternoon at four I met Jack Marlowe in White s and as we sat in our big arm chairs gazing through the windows out into the sunshine of saint James s Street I asked him whether he would be prepared to accompany me upon an adventurous visit to a house in Bayswater The long legged clean shaven clean limbed fellow with the fairish hair and merry grey eyes looked askance for a moment and then inquired What s up old man What s the game He was always eager for an adventure I knew Well the fact is I want to look around a house in Porchester Terrace that s all I want to search the garden when nobody s about Why In order to satisfy myself about something Become an amateur detective eh Owen Well my curiosity has certainly been aroused and I intend to go to the house late to night and look round the garden Will you come He was one of the best of good fellows overflowing with good humour and good nature His face seemed to wear a perpetual smile of contentment Of course But tell me more he asked I will afterwards I said Let s dine together somewhere and turn in at the Empire afterwards We don t want to get to Bayswater before midnight as we mustn t be seen Don t dress I ll bring an electric torch I ve got one I ll bring mine also he replied at once entering into the spirit of the adventure Only you might tell me what s in the wind Owen he added I ll tell you afterwards old chap I promised And then we separated agreeing to meet at eight at a well known restaurant which we often patronized That night when the curtain fell at the Empire we both went forth and strolled along to saint James s Street to get a drink at the club The later we went forth on our nocturnal inquiry the better I recollected that look of terror and astonishment on Forbes s countenance when his gaze had met mine outside the bank a look which showed that he had believed me to be safely out of the way He had never dreamed I was still alive Hence it seemed to me certain that the pair of malefactors having secured the money would at once make themselves scarce How I wondered could they have known of Jack Marlowe unless they had watched us both in secret as seemed most likely That they would not return again to that house of horror in Bayswater seemed certain Towards one o clock we took a taxi off the stand outside White s and drove to Porchester Terrace alighting some distance from our destination We passed the constable strolling slowly in the opposite direction and when at last we gained the rusty iron gate we both slipped inside quietly and unobserved The street lamp in the vicinity lit up the front of the dingy house therefore fearing observation from any of the servants next door we moved noiselessly in the shadow of the bushes along the side of the premises past a small conservatory many panes of glass of which were broken and so into the darkness of the small back garden which seemed knee deep in grass and weeds and which from its position hemmed in by blank walls could not be overlooked save from the house itself All was silence The scene was weird in the extreme In the distance could be heard the faint hum of the never ceasing traffic of London Above showed the dark windows of that grim old place wherein I had so nearly lost my life I want to examine this garden thoroughly I whispered to Jack and then I switched on my torch and showed a light around A tangle of weeds and undergrowth was revealed a tangle so great that to penetrate it without the use of a bill hook appeared impossible Still we went forward examining everywhere with our powerful electric lights What will the people say laughed Jack They ll take us for burglars old chap The place is empty I replied Our only fear is of the police To them we would be compelled to make an explanation and that s just what I don t want to do For some time we carefully searched conversing only in whispers My hands were scratched and stung by nettles and Jack had his coat badly torn by thorns The garden had been allowed to run wild for all the years since old missus Carpenter s death and the two ash trees had spread until their thick branches overshadowed a large portion of the ground Beneath one of these trees I suddenly halted as an ejaculation escaped me Near the trunk and in such a position that it would not be seen even from the windows of the house yawned a hole and at its side a mound of newly dug earth Ah I cried This is what I ve been in search of The discovery revealed a ghastly truth I shuddered at the sight of it What that hole asked Jack in a low voice as we approached and peered into it I judged it to be about three feet or so in depth What a funny thing to search for That hole Jack was intended for a man s grave I whispered hoarsely and the man intended was myself You he gasped What do you mean Owen I mean that that grave yonder was dug in order to conceal my dead body was my low meaning answer And I fear fear very much that the remains of others who have met with foul play have been concealed here You mean that murder was actually intended he exclaimed in astonishment When Last night I was entrapped here and narrowly escaped How Tell me all about it he urged Later on Not here I said Let us see if there is any further evidence of recent digging and together we examined the ground beneath the second tree Presently Jack in the course of searching about came to a spot where the ground seemed perceptibly softer My stick sank in while in other parts the ground seemed hard Beneath the trees the weeds and grass grew thinly and I presumed that the miscreants could work there under the canopy of leaves without fear of observation I bent down and carefully examined the surface which for about four feet square bore plain traces of having recently been moved Something had evidently been interred there Yet tiny fresh blades of green were just springing up as though grass seed had been sprinkled over in order to obliterate traces of the recent excavation What do you think of it I inquired of my companion Well perhaps somebody has really been buried here eh he said Don t you think you ought to go and tell the police at once I was silent in bewilderment My own opinion is Owen that if a serious attempt has been made upon you and you really suspect that that hole yonder was prepared to receive you then it is your duty to tell the police Others may fall into the trap Jack added Not here I said The assassins will not return never fear They know of their failure in my case and by this time they are in all probability out of the country But surely we ought to examine this spot and ascertain whether the remains of any one is concealed here exclaimed my old friend Yet I still hesitated hesitated because I feared that any exposure must implicate that sweet little girl who though my friend had so ingeniously escaped me At the same moment however our ears both caught a slight movement among the tangled shrubs under the wall at the extreme end of the garden Instantly we shut off our lamps and stood motionless listening At first I believed it to be only the scrambling of a cat But next second Jack nudged my arm and straining my eyes I saw a dark figure moving stealthily along half crouching so as to be less conspicuous but moving slowly towards that side of the house which was the only exit Fearing discovery there our examination being so thorough the intruder was slowly creeping off endeavouring to escape observation For an instant I remained motionless watching the dark crouching figure Then drawing my revolver I made a dash straight in its direction CHAPTER ELEVEN WHAT THE POLICE KNEW As I pushed my way through the tangle of weeds and undergrowth Jack followed closely at my heels The dark figure leapt away in an instant and dashed round the corner by the ruined conservatory but I was too quick for him I caught him up when he gained the front of the house and there in the light of the street lamp my eyes fell upon a strange looking object He proved to be a ragged hunchbacked youth so deformed as to be extremely ugly both in face and figure His hair long and lank hung about his shoulders while his dark eyes stood out in terror when I ordered him to halt and covered him with my shining weapon His was the most weird figure that I had seen for many a day I judged him to be about eighteen or nineteen though he looked older His legs were short his head seemed far too big for his crooked body while his arms were long and ape like and his fingers thin like talons Now then what are you doing here I demanded in a firm commanding voice But he only quivered and crouched against the wall like a whipped dog Speak I said Who are you He gave vent to a loud harsh laugh almost a screech and then grinned horribly in my face Who are you I repeated Where do you live But though his mouth moved as though he replied no sound escaped him I spoke again but he only laughed wildly his thin fingers twitching Ho ho ho he ejaculated pointing back to the neglected garden I wonder what he means exclaimed Jack Why I believe he s an idiot I remarked He has every appearance of one declared my companion who then addressed him with the same negative result Again the weird repulsive youth pointed back to the garden and laughing hideously uttered some words in gibberish which were quite unintelligible If we remain here chattering the constable will find us I remarked so we all three went forth into the street the ugly hunchback walking at my side quite tractable and quiet Presently unable to gather a single intelligible sentence from him Jack and I resolved to leave him and afterwards follow him and ascertain where he lived Why had he pointed to the garden and laughed so hilariously Had he witnessed any of those nocturnal preparations or interments At last at the corner of Bishop s Road we wished him farewell and turned away Then at a respectable distance we drew into a gateway to watch He remained standing where we had left him for some ten minutes or so until a constable slowly approached and halting began to chat to him Apparently he was a well known figure for we could hear the policeman speaking and could distinguish the poor fellow laughing that queer harsh discordant laugh the laugh of the idiot Presently the constable moved forward again whereupon I said I ll get on and have a chat with the policeman Jack You follow the hunchback if he moves away Right ho replied my friend while I sped off crossing the road and making a detour until I met the constable Having wished him good night I inquired the identity of the deformed youth Oh sir he laughed that s Mad Arry E s quite armless E s out most nights but we never see im in the day poor chap I ve known im ever since he was about nine Does no work I suppose None Ow can e E s as mad as a hatter as the sayin goes replied the constable his thumbs hitched in his belt as he stood A kind of midnight wanderer eh Yes e s always a pryin about at night Not long ago e found burglars in a ouse in Gloucester Terrace and gave us the alarm We copped four of em The magistrate gave im a guinea out o the poor box Ah so he s of use to you Yes sir e s most intelligent where there s any suspicious characters about I ve often put im on the watch myself Then he s not quite insane Not on that point at any rate laughed the officer Where does he live Is father s a hackney carriage driver and e lives with im up in Gloucester Mews just at the back of Porchester Mews I don t know if you know it I was compelled to confess ignorance of the locality but he directed me Are you on night duty in Porchester Terrace constable I asked a few moments later Yes sir sometimes Why You know Althorp House of course Yes the aunted ouse as some people call it Myself I don t believe in ghosts Neither do I I laughed but I ve heard many funny stories about that place Have you ever heard any Lots sir replied the man We re always being told of strange things that ave appened there yet when we ave a look around we never find anything so we ve ceased to trouble Our inspector s given us orders not to make any further inquiries e s been worried too often over idle gossip What s the latest story afloat concerning the place I asked I m always interested in mysteries of that sort Oh I eard yesterday that somebody was seen to get out of a taxi cab and enter And e asn t been seen to come forth again That s curious I said And haven t you looked over the place I m not on duty there Perhaps my mate as I don t know But funnily enough added the officer Mad Arry has been tellin me something about it a moment ago something I can t understand something about the garden I suppose e s been a fancyin something or other Everybody seems to see something in the garden or at the windows Why about a week ago a servant from one of the ouses in the Terrace came up to me at three o clock in the afternoon in broad daylight and said as how she d distinctly seen at the drawin room window the face of a pretty fair haired girl a peerin through the side of the dirty blind She described the girl too and said that as soon as she saw she was noticed the inmate of the place drew back instantly A fair haired girl I exclaimed quickly interested Yes she described her as wearin a black velvet band on her hair And what did you do I asked anxiously Why nothing I ve eard too many o them kind o tales before Yes I said reflectively Of course all kinds of legends and rumours must naturally spring up around a house so long closed Of course It s all in people s imagination I suppose they ll say next that a murder s been committed in the place he laughed I suppose so I said and then putting a shilling in his hand wished him good night and passed along Jack and the idiot had gone but knowing the direction they had taken for the youth was no doubt on his way home I was not long before I caught up my friend and then together we retraced our steps towards the Bayswater Road in search of a taxi I could not forget that curious statement that a girl s face had been seen at the drawing room window a fair headed girl with a band of black velvet in her hair Could it have been Sylvia Pennington It was past three o clock in the morning before I retraced my steps to Wilton Street We were unable to find a cab therefore we walked down Park Lane together On the way Jack had pressed me to tell him the reason of my visit to that weird house and the circumstances in which my life had been attempted For the present however I refused to satisfy his curiosity I promised him I would tell him the whole facts of the case some day But why are you at home now he asked I can t really make you out lately Owen You told me you hated London and preferred life on the Continent yet here you are back again and quite settled down in town Well a fellow must come here for the London season sometimes I said I feel that I ve been away far too long and am a bit out of touch with things Why my tailor hardly knew me and the hall porter at White s had to look twice before he realized who I was But there s some attraction which has brought you to London he declared I m sure there is It was on the tip of my tongue to tell him how cleverly the two scoundrels had used his name wherewith to entrap me on the previous night But I refrained Instead I asked Have you ever met two men named Reckitt and Forbes Jack Not to my knowledge was his prompt reply Who are they What are they like I gave him a minute description of both but he apparently did not recognize them I suppose you ve never met a fellow called Pennington eh A stoutish dark haired man with a baldish head and a reddish face Well he replied thoughtfully I ve met a good many men who might answer to that description What is he I don t exactly know I ve met him on the Continent And I suppose some people one meets at Continental hotels are undesirables aren t they he said I nodded in the affirmative Then I asked You ve never known a person named Shuttleworth Edmund Shuttleworth Lives at a little village close to Andover Shuttleworth he echoed looking straight into my face What do you know of Edmund Shuttleworth he asked quickly Very little Do you know him Er well no not exactly was his faltering reply and I saw in his slight hesitation an intention to conceal the actual knowledge which he possessed I ve heard of him through a friend of mine a lady friend A lady Who s she I inquired quickly Well he laughed a trifle uneasily the fact is old chap perhaps it wouldn t be fair to tell the story You understand I was silent What did he mean In a second the allegation made by that pair of scoundrels recurred to me They had declared that Sylvia had been in a house opposite and that my friend had fallen in love with her Yet he had denied acquaintanceship with Pennington No doubt the assassins had lied to me yet my suspicions had been aroused Jack had admitted his acquaintance with the thin faced village rector he knew of him through a woman Was that woman Sylvia herself From his manner and the great curiosity he evinced I felt assured that he had never known of Althorp House before Reckitt and Forbes had uttered lies when they had shown me that photograph and told me that she was beloved by my best friend It had been done to increase my anger and chagrin Yet might there not after all have been some foundation in truth in what they had said The suggestion gripped my senses Again I asked him to tell me the lady s name But quite contrary to his usual habit of confiding in me all his most private affairs he steadfastly refused No my dear old chap he replied I really can t tell you that Please excuse me but it is a matter I would rather not discuss So at the corner of Piccadilly we parted for it was now broad daylight and while he returned to his rooms I walked down Grosvenor Place to Wilton Street more than ever puzzled and confounded Was I a fool that I loved Sylvia Pennington with such an all absorbing passion It was strangely true as Shuttleworth had declared the grave lay as a gulf between us CHAPTER TWELVE THE WORD OF A WOMAN A week went by a week of keen anxiety and apprehension Jack had spoken the truth when he had declared that it was my duty to go to Scotland Yard and reveal what I had discovered regarding that dark house in Bayswater Yet somehow I felt that any such action on my part must necessarily reflect upon my fair haired divinity that sweet soft spoken girl who had warned me and who moreover was my affinity Had you found yourself in such a position how would you have acted Remember that notwithstanding the veil of mystery which overspread Sylvia Pennington I loved her and tried to conceal the truth from myself a hundred times but it was impossible She had warned me and I unfortunately had not heeded I had fallen into a trap and without a doubt it had been she who had entered and rescued me from a fate most horrible to contemplate I shuddered when I lived that hour of terror over again I longed once more to see that pale sweet wistful face which was now ever in my dreams Had not Shuttleworth told me that the grave lay between my love and myself And he had spoken the truth Jack met me at the club daily but he only once referred to our midnight search and the gruesome discovery in the neglected garden Frequently it crossed my mind that Mad Harry might have watched there unseen and witnessed strange things How many men reported to the police as missing had been interred in that private burying ground of the assassins I dreaded to think of it In vain I waited for mister Shuttleworth to call again He had inquired if I were at home and finding me absent had gone away I therefore a week later made it an excuse to run down to Andover and see him hoping to obtain from him some further information regarding Sylvia The afternoon was bright and warm and the country looked its best with the scent of new mown hay in the air and flowers everywhere as I descended from the station fly and walked up the rectory garden to the house The maid admitted me to the study saying that mister Shuttleworth was only down the paddock and would be back in a few minutes And as I seated myself in the big comfortable arm chair I saw straight before me in its frame the smiling face of the mysterious woman I loved Through the open French windows came the warm sunlight the song of the birds and the drowsy hum of the insects The lawn was marked for tennis and beyond lay the paddock and the dark forest border I had remained there some few minutes when suddenly I heard a quick footstep in the hall outside then next moment the door was opened and there upon the threshold stood Sylvia herself You she gasped starting back I I didn t know you were here she stammered in confusion She was evidently a guest there and was about to pass through the study into the garden Charming in a soft white ninon gown and a big white hat she held a tennis racket in her hand presenting a pretty picture framed by the dark doorway Sylvia I cried springing forward to her in joy and catching her small white trembling hand in mine Fancy you here She held her breath suffering me to lead her into the room and to close the door I had no idea you were here I said I lost you the other day in Regent Street I She made a quick gesture as though she desired me to refrain from referring to that incident I saw that her cheeks were deadly pale and that in her face was an expression of utter confusion This meeting she said slowly in a low voice is certainly an unexpected one mister Shuttleworth doesn t know you are here does he No I replied He s down in the paddock I believe He has been called out suddenly she said He s driven over to Clatford with missus Shuttleworth And you are here alone I exclaimed quickly No There s another guest Elsie Durnford she answered But she added her self possession at once returning but why are you here mister Biddulph I wanted to see mister Shuttleworth Being a friend of yours I believed that he would know where you were But thank Heaven I have found you at last Now I said smiling as I looked straight into her fathomless eyes tell me the truth Miss Pennington I did not lose you the other morning on the contrary you lost me didn t you Her cheeks flushed slightly and she gave vent to a nervous little laugh Well she answered after a moment s hesitation to tell the truth I did I had reasons important ones I was de trop eh She shrugged her well formed shoulders and smiled reproachfully But why I asked When I found you it was under very curious circumstances A man a thief had just cashed a cheque of mine for a thousand pounds and made off with the proceeds and Ah please do not refer to it mister Biddulph she exclaimed quickly laying her slim fingers upon my arm Let us speak of something else anything but that I have no wish to reproach you Miss Pennington I hastened to assure her The past is to me of the past That man has a thousand pounds of mine and he s welcome to it so long as and I hesitated So long as what she asked in a voice of trepidation So long as you are alive and well I replied in slow meaning tones my gaze fixed immovably on hers In Gardone you expressed fear for your own safety but so long as you are still safe I have no care as to what has happened to myself But I know I went on the ingenious attempt upon my life of which you warned me has been made by those two scoundrels and I have narrowly escaped To you Miss Pennington I owe my life She started and lowered her eyes Apparently she could not face me The hand I held trembled within my grasp and I saw that her white lips quivered For a few seconds a silence fell between us Then slowly she raised her eyes to mine again and said mister Biddulph this is an exceedingly painful subject to me May we not drop it Will you not forget it if you really are my friend To secure your further friendship I will do anything you wish I declared You have already proved yourself my friend by rescuing me from death I added How do you know that she asked quickly Because you were alone with me in that house of death in Bayswater It was you who killed the hideous reptile and who severed the bonds which held me They intended that I should die My grave had already been prepared Cannot you tell me the motive of that dastardly attack I begged of her Alas I cannot she said I warned you when at Gardone that I knew what was intended but of the true motive I was and am still entirely ignorant Their motives are always hidden ones They endeavoured to get from me another thousand pounds I exclaimed It is well that you did not give it to them The result would have been just the same They intended that you should die fearing lest you should inform the police And you were outside the bank with Forbes when he cashed my cheque I remarked in slow tones I know she answered hoarsely I know that you must believe me to be their associate perhaps their accomplice Ah well Judge me mister Biddulph as you will I have no defence Only recollect that I warned you to go into hiding to efface yourself and you would not heed You believed that I only spoke wildly perhaps that I was merely an hysterical girl making all sorts of unfounded assertions I believed nay I knew Miss Pennington that you were my friend You admitted in Gardone that you were friendless and I offered you the friendship of one who I hope is an honest man Ah thank you she cried taking my hand warmly in hers You have been so very generous mister Biddulph that I can only thank you from the bottom of my heart It is true an attempt was made upon you but you fortunately escaped even though they secured a thousand pounds of your money Yet had you taken my advice and disappeared they would soon have given up the chase Tell me I urged in deep earnestness others have been entrapped in that dark house have they not That mechanical chair that devilish invention was not constructed for me alone She did not answer but I regarded her silence as an affirmative response Your friends at least seem highly dangerous persons I said smiling I ve been undecided since discovering that my grave was already prepared whether to go to Scotland Yard and reveal the whole game No she cried in quick apprehension No don t do that It could serve no end and would only implicate certain innocent persons myself included But how could you be implicated Was I not at the bank when the cheque was cashed Yes Why were you there I asked But she only excused herself from replying to my question Ah she cried wildly a moment later clutching my arm convulsively you do not know my horrible position you cannot dream what I have suffered or how much I have sacrificed I saw that she was now terribly in earnest and by the quick rising and falling of the lace upon her bodice I knew that she was stirred by a great emotion She had refused to allow me to stand her friend because she feared what the result might be And yet had she not rescued me from the serpent s fang Sylvia I cried Sylvia for I feel that I must call you by your Christian name let us forget it all The trap set by those blackguards was most ingenious and in innocence I fell into it I should have lost my life except for you You were present in that house of death They told me you were there they showed me your picture and to add to my horror said that you their betrayer were to share the same fate as myself Yes yes I know she cried starting Oh it was all too terrible too terrible How can I face you mister Biddulph after that My only desire is to forget it all Sylvia was my low and quiet response It was all my fault my fault for not heeding your warning I never realized the evil machinations of those unknown enemies How should I As far as I know I had never set eyes upon them before You would have done wiser to have gone into hiding as I suggested she remarked quietly Never mind I said cheerily It is all past Let us dismiss it There is surely no more danger now that I am forearmed May they not fear your reprisals she exclaimed They did not intend that you should escape remember No they had already prepared my grave I have seen it That grave was prepared for both of us she said in a calm reflective voice Then how did you escape I inquired with curiosity I do not know I can only guess May I not know I asked eagerly When I have confirmed my belief I will tell you she replied Then let us dismiss the subject It is horrible gruesome Look how lovely and bright the world is outside Let us live in peace and in happiness Let us turn aside these grim shadows which have lately fallen upon us Ah she exclaimed with a sigh you are indeed generous to me mister Biddulph But could you be so generous I wonder if you knew the actual truth Alas I fear you would not Instead of remaining my friend you would hate me just just as I hate myself Sylvia I said placing my hand again tenderly upon her shoulder and trying to calm her and looking earnestly into her blue wide open eyes I shall never hate you On the contrary let me confess now and openly I whispered let me tell you that I I love you She started her lips parted at the suddenness of my impetuous declaration and stood for a moment motionless as a statue pale and rigid Then I felt a convulsive tremor run through her and her breast heaved and fell rapidly She placed her hand to her heart as though to calm the rising tempest of emotion within her Her breath came and went rapidly Love me she echoed in a strange hoarse tone Ah no mister Biddulph no a thousand times no You do not know what you are saying Recall those words I beg of you And I saw by her hard set countenance and the strange look in her eyes that she was deadly in earnest Why should I recall them I cried my hand still upon her shoulder You are not my enemy Sylvia even though you may be the friend of my enemies I love you and I fear nothing nothing Hush Do not say that she protested very quietly Why Because well because even though you have escaped they and she hesitated her lips set as though unable to articulate the truth They what I demanded Because mister Biddulph because alas I know these men only too well You have triumphed but yours is I fear but a short lived victory They still intend that you shall die How do you know that I asked quickly Listen she said hoarsely I will tell you CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE DEATH KISS Sylvia sank into a chair while I stood upon the hearth rug facing her eager to hear her explanation Her hands were clasped as she raised her wonderful blue eyes to mine Yes her beauty was perfect more perfect than any I had ever seen in all my wandering erratic life Why do those men still intend that I shall die I asked Now that I know the truth I shall remain wary Ah yes she responded But they will take you unawares You do not know the devilish cunning and ingenuity of such men as they who live upon their wits and are utterly unscrupulous Well what do they now intend I asked much interested for it seemed that she knew very much more than she would admit You have escaped she said looking straight into my face They naturally fear that you will tell the police I shall not do that not at present at least I replied I am keeping my own counsel Yes But cannot you see that while you live you are a menace to their dastardly plans They dare not return to that deserted house in Bayswater Where are they now Abroad I believe They always take care to have an outlet for escape she answered Ah you don t know what a formidable combination they are They snap their fingers at the police of Europe What Then you really admit that there have been other victims I exclaimed I have no actual knowledge she declared only suspicions Why are you friendly with them I asked What does your father say to such acquaintances I am friendly only under compulsion she answered Ah mister Biddulph you cannot know how I hate the very sight or knowledge of those inhuman fiends Their treatment of you is in itself sufficient proof of their pitiless plans Tell me this Sylvia I said after a second s pause Have you any knowledge of a man a great friend of mine named Jack Marlowe Her face changed It became paler and I saw she was slightly confused I well I believe we met once she said His father lives somewhere down in Devonshire Yes I said quickly What do you know of him Nothing We met only once Where Well our meeting was under rather curious circumstances He is your friend therefore please pardon me if I do not reply to your question was her vague response Then what do you anticipate from those men Reckitt and Forbes I asked Only evil distinct evil she replied They will return and strike when you least expect attack But if I do not go to the police why should they fear me They are quite welcome to the money they have stolen so long as they allow me peace in the future Which I fear they will not do replied the girl shaking her head You speak very apprehensively I said What is there really to fear Perhaps it would be best if I went to the police at once They would then dig over that neglected garden and reveal its secrets No she cried again starting wildly from her chair as though in sudden terror I beg of you not to do that mister Biddulph It would serve no purpose and only create a great sensation But the culprits would never be brought to justice They are far too clever and their conspiracies are too far reaching No remain patient Take the greatest care of your own personal safety and you may yet be able to combat your enemies with their own weapons I shall be able Sylvia providing that you assist me I said She held her breath and remained silent She evidently feared them I tried to obtain from her some details of the occurrences of that night of horror but she refused to satisfy my curiosity Apparently she feared to incriminate herself Could it be possible that she had only learnt at the last moment that it was I who was embraced in the next room by that fatal chair Yet it was all so puzzling so remarkable Surely a girl with such a pure open innocent face could not be the accomplice of dastardly criminals She was their friend That much she had admitted to me But her friendship with them was made under compulsion She urged me not to go to the police Why Did she fear that she herself would be implicated in a series of dark and terrible crimes Where is your father I inquired presently In Scotland was her prompt reply I heard from him at the Caledonian Hotel at Edinburgh last Friday I am staying here with mister Shuttleworth until his return Was it not strange that she should be guest of a quiet mannered country parson if she were actually the accomplice of a pair of criminals I felt convinced that Shuttleworth knew the truth that he could reveal a very remarkable story if he only would Your father is a friend of mister Shuttleworth eh I asked She nodded in the affirmative Then she stood with her gaze fixed thoughtfully upon the sunlit lawn outside Mystery was written upon her fair countenance She held a dread secret which she was determined not to reveal She knew of those awful crimes committed in that dark house in Bayswater but her intention seemed to be to shield at all hazards her dangerous friends Sylvia I said tenderly at last again taking her hand in mine why cannot you be open and frank with me She allowed her hand to lie soft and inert in mine sighing the while her gaze still fixed beyond as though her thoughts were far away I love you I whispered Cannot you see how you puzzle me for you seem to be my friend at one moment and at the next the accomplice of my enemies I have told you that you must never love me mister Biddulph was her low reply as she withdrew her hand slowly but very firmly Ah no I cried Do not take offence at my words I m aware that I m a hopeless blunderer in love All I know Sylvia is that my only thought is of you And I I ve wondered whether you on your part can ever entertain a spark of affection for me She was silent her white lips pressed close together a strange expression crossing her features Again she held her breath as though what I had said had caused her great surprise Then she answered How can you love me Am I not after all a mere stranger I know you sufficiently well I cried to be aware that for me there exists no other woman I fear I m a blunt man It is my nature Forgive me Sylvia for speaking the truth but well as a matter of fact I could not conceal the truth any longer And you tell me this after after all that has happened she faltered in a low tremulous voice as I again took her tiny hand in mine Yes because I truly and honestly love you I said because ever since we have met I have found myself thinking of you recalling you nay dreaming of happiness at your side She raised her splendid eyes and looked into mine for a moment then sighing shook her head sadly Ah mister Biddulph she responded in a curious strained voice passion may be perilously misleading Ask yourself if you are not injudicious in making this declaration to a woman like myself Why I cried Why should it be injudicious I trust you because because I owe my life to you because you have already proved yourself my devoted little friend What I beg and pray is that your friendship may in course of time ripen into love that you may reciprocate my affection that you may really love me A slight hardness showed at the corners of her small mouth Her eyes were downcast and she swallowed the lump that arose in her throat She was silent standing rigid and motionless Suddenly a great and distressing truth occurred to me Did she believe that I pitied her I hoped not Any woman of common sensibility would almost die of shame at the thought of being loved out of pity and what is more she would think none the better of the man who pitied her The belief that pity melts the heart to love is an unfounded one So I at once endeavoured to remove the wrong impression which I feared I had conveyed What mad impetuous words I uttered I can scarcely tell I know that I raised her soft white hand to my lips and kissed it fervently repeating my avowal and craving a word of hope from her lips But she again shook her head and with sadness responded in a low faltering tone It is quite impossible mister Biddulph Leave me let us forget all you have said It will be better thus far better for us both You do not know who or what I am you I do not know neither do I care I cried passionately All I know Sylvia is that my heart is yours that I have loved only once in my life and it is now Her slim fingers played nervously with the ribbon upon her cool summer gown but she made no response I know I have not much to recommend me I went on Perhaps I am too hulking too English You who have lived so much abroad are more used no doubt to the elegant manners and the prettily turned compliments of the foreigner than the straight speech of a fellow like myself Yet I swear that my only thought has been of you that I love you with all my heart with all my soul I caught her hand and again looked into her eyes trying to read what response lay hidden in their depths I felt her tremble For a moment she seemed unable to reply The silence was unbroken save for the drowsy hum of the insects in the summer heat outside while the sweet perfume of the flowers filled our nostrils In the tension of those moments each second seemed an hour You who have experienced the white heat of the love flame can only know my eager breathless apprehension the honest whole heartedness of my declaration Perhaps in your case the flames are all burnt out but even now you can tell of the white core and centre of fire within you Years may have gone but it still remains the sweet memory of your well beloved Tell me Sylvia I whispered once more Tell me will you not break down this strange invisible barrier which you have set up between us Forget the past as I have already forgotten it and be mine my own She burst into tears Ah she cried If I only could if I only dared Will you not dare to do it for my sake I asked very quietly Will you not promise to be mine Let me stand your friend your champion Let me defend you against your enemies Let me place myself beside you and defy them Ah no she gasped not to defy them Defiance would only bring death death to both of us Your love Sylvia would mean life and happiness not death to me to both of us I cried Will you not give me your promise Let our love be in secret if you so desire only let us love each other Promise me I cried my arm stealing around her narrow waist Promise me that you will try and love me and I too will promise to be worthy of your affection For a moment she remained silent her handsome head downcast Then slowly with a sweet love look upon her beautiful countenance she raised her face to mine and then for the first time our lips met in a fierce and passionate caress Thus was our solemn compact sealed CHAPTER FOURTEEN OF THINGS UNMENTIONABLE I remained in that cosy book lined den for perhaps an hour one whole hour of sweet delightful ecstasy With her fair head buried upon my shoulder she shed tears of joy while time after time I smothered her white brow with my kisses Ah yes I loved her I closed my eyes to all I put away all my dark suspicions and lived only for the present in the knowledge that Sylvia was mine mine My hot fevered declarations of affection caused her to cling to me more closely yet she uttered but few words and those half incoherent ones overcome as she was by a flood of emotion She seemed to have utterly broken down beneath the great strain and now welcomed the peace and all absorbing happiness of affection Alone and friendless as she had admitted herself to be she had perhaps longed for the love of an honest man At least that is what I was egotistical enough to believe Possibly I might have been wrong for until that moment I had ever been a confirmed bachelor and had but little experience of the fantastic workings of a woman s mind Like so many other men of my age I had vainly believed myself to be a philosopher Yet are not philosophers merely soured cynics after all And I certainly was neither cynical nor soured Therefore my philosophy was but a mere ridiculous affectation to which so many men and women are prone But in those moments of ecstasy I abandoned myself entirely to love imprinting lingering passionate kisses upon her lips her closed eyes her wide white brow while she returned my caresses smiling through her hot tears Presently when she grew calmer she said in a low sweet voice I hardly know whether this is wise I somehow fear Fear what I asked interrupting her I fear what the future may hold for us she answered Remember I I am poor while you are wealthy and What does that matter pray Thank Heaven I have sufficient for us both sufficient to provide for you the ordinary comforts of life Sylvia I only now long for the day dearest when I may call you wife Ah she said with a wistful smile and I too shall be content when I can call you husband And so we sat together upon the couch holding each other s hand and speaking for the first time not as friends but as lovers You who love or who have loved know well the joyful careless feeling of such moments the great peace which overspreads the mind when the passion of affection burns within Need I say more except to tell you that our great overwhelming love was mutual and that our true hearts beat in unison Thus the afternoon slipped by until of a sudden we heard a girl s voice call Sylvia Sylvia We sprang apart And not a moment too soon for next second there appeared at the French windows the tall figure of a rather pretty dark haired girl in cream I I beg your pardon she stammered on recognizing that Sylvia was not alone This is mister Biddulph exclaimed my well beloved Miss Elsie Durnford I bowed and then we all three went forth upon the lawn I found Sylvia s fellow guest a very quiet young girl and understood that she lived somewhere in the Midlands Her father she told me was very fond of hunting and she rode to hounds a good deal We wandered about the garden awaiting Shuttleworth s return for both girls would not hear of me leaving before tea mister and missus Shuttleworth are certain to be back in time Sylvia declared and I m sure they d be horribly annoyed if you went away without seeing them Do you really wish me to stay I asked with a laugh as we halted beneath the shadow of the great spreading cedar upon the lawn Of course we do declared Elsie laughing You really must remain and keep us company mister Biddulph Sylvia you know is quite a stranger She s always travelling now a days I get letters from her from the four corners of the earth I never know where to write so as to catch her Yes replied my well beloved with a slight sigh When we were at school at Eastbourne I thought it would be so jolly to travel and see the world but now a days alas I confess I m already tired of it I would give anything to settle down quietly in the beautiful country in England the country which is incomparable You will one day I remarked meaningly And as she lifted her eyes to mine she replied Perhaps who knows The village rector returned at last greeting me with some surprise and introducing his wife a rather stout homely woman who bore traces of good looks and who wore a visiting gown of neat black for she had been paying a call I looked in to see you the other day in town mister Biddulph he said But I was unfortunate Your man told me you were out He was not rude to me this time he added humorously with a laugh No I said smiling He was profuse in his apologies Old servants are sometimes a little trying Yes you re right But he seems a good sort I blame myself you know He s not to blame in the least Then we strolled together to a tent set beneath the cedar whither the maid had already taken the tea and strawberries and there we sat around gossiping Afterwards when Shuttleworth rose he said Come across to my study and have a smoke You re not in a great hurry to get back to town Perhaps you ll play a game of tennis presently I followed him through the pretty pergola of roses back into the house and when I had seated myself in the big old arm chair he gave me an excellent cigar Do you know mister Biddulph he said after we had been smoking some minutes I m extremely glad to have this opportunity of a chat with you I called at Wilton Street because I wished to see you Why I asked Well for several reasons was his slow earnest reply His face looked thinner more serious Somehow I had taken a great fancy to him for though a clergyman he struck me as a broad minded man of the world He was keen eyed thoughtful and earnest yet at the same time full of that genuine hearty bonhomie so seldom alas found in religious men The good fellowship of a leader appeals to men more than anything else and yet somehow it seems always more apparent in the Roman Catholic priest than in the Protestant clergyman The reason I called to day was because I thought you might wish to speak to me I said He rose and closed the French windows Then re seating himself he removed his old briar pipe from his lips and bending towards me in his chair said very earnestly I wonder whether I might presume to say something to you strictly in private mister Biddulph I know that I ought not to interfere in your private affairs yet as a minister of religion I perhaps am a slightly privileged person in that respect At least you will I trust believe in my impartiality Most certainly I do mister Shuttleworth I replied somewhat surprised at his manner Well you recollect our conversation on the last occasion you were here he said You remember what I told you I remember that we spoke of Miss Sylvia I exclaimed and that you refused to satisfy my curiosity I refused because I am not permitted was his calm rejoinder Since I saw you I said a dastardly attempt has been made upon my life I was enticed to an untenanted house in Bayswater and after a cheque for a thousand pounds had been obtained from me by a trick I narrowly escaped death by a devilish device My grave I afterwards found was already prepared Is this a fact he gasped It is I was rescued by Sylvia herself He was silent drawing hard at his pipe deep in thought The names of the two men who made the dastardly attempt upon me were Reckitt and Forbes friends of Sylvia Pennington I went on He nodded Then removing his pipe exclaimed Yes I understand But did I not warn you You did But to be frank mister Shuttleworth I really did not follow you then Neither do I now Have I not told you my dear sir that I possess certain knowledge under vow of absolute secrecy knowledge which it is not permitted to me as a servant of God to divulge But surely if you knew that assassination was contemplated it was your duty to warn me I did but you took no heed he declared Sylvia warned you also when you met in Gardone and yet you refused to take her advice and go into hiding But why should an innocent law abiding inoffensive man be compelled to hide himself like a fugitive from justice I protested Who can fathom human enmity or the ingenious cunning of the evil doer asked the grey faced rector quite calmly Have you never stopped to wonder at the marvellous subtlety of human wickedness Those men are veritable fiends I cried Yet why have I aroused their animosity If you know so much concerning them mister Shuttleworth don t you think that it is your duty to protect your fellow creatures to make it your business to inform the police I added Probably it is he said reflectively But there are times when even the performance of one s duty may be injudicious Surely it is not injudicious to expose the methods of such blackguards I cried Pardon me he said I am compelled to differ with that opinion Were you in possession of the same knowledge as myself you too would I feel sure deem it injudicious But what is this secret knowledge I demanded I have narrowly escaped being foully done to death I have been robbed and I feel that it is but right that I should now know the truth Not from me mister Biddulph he answered Have I not already told you the reason why no word of the actual facts may pass my lips I cannot see why you should persist in thus mystifying me as to the sinister motive of that pair of assassins If they wished to rob me they could have done so without seeking to take my life by those horrible means What means did they employ he asked Briefly and vividly I explained their methods as he sat silent listening to me to the end He evinced neither horror nor surprise Perhaps he knew their mode of procedure only too well I warned you was all he vouchsafed Sylvia warned you also It is over of the past mister Shuttleworth I said rising from my chair I feel confident that Sylvia though she possessed knowledge of what was intended had no hand whatever in it Indeed so confident am I of her loyalty to me that to day yes let me confess it to you for I know you are my friend as well as hers to day here only an hour ago I asked Sylvia to become my wife Your wife he gasped starting to his feet his countenance pale and drawn Yes my wife And what was her answer he asked dryly in a changed tone She has consented mister Biddulph he said very gravely looking straight into my face this must never be Have I not already told you the ghastly truth that there is a secret an unmentionable secret A secret concerning her I cried What is it Come mister Shuttleworth you shall tell me I demand to know I can only repeat that between you and Sylvia Pennington there still lies the open gulf and that gulf is indeed the grave In your ignorance of the strange but actual facts you do not realize your own dread peril or you would never ask her to become your wife Abandon all thought of her I beg of you he urged earnestly Take this advice of mine for one day you will assuredly thank me for my counsel I love her with all the strength of my being and for me that is sufficient I declared Ah he cried in despair as he paced the room To think of the irony of it all That you should actually woo her of all women Then halting before me his eye grew suddenly aflame he clenched his hands and cried But you shall not Understand me you shall hate her you shall curse her very name You shall never love her never I Edmund Shuttleworth forbid it It must not be At that instant the frou frou of a woman s skirts fell upon my ears and turning quickly I saw Sylvia herself standing at the open French windows Entering unobserved she had heard those wild words of the rector s and stood pale breathless rigid as a statue There he cried pointing at her with his thin bony finger There she is Ask her yourself now before me the reason why she can never be your wife the reason that her love is forbidden If she really loves you as she pretends she will tell you the truth with her own lips CHAPTER FIFTEEN FORBIDDEN LOVE I stood before Shuttleworth angry and defiant I had crossed to Sylvia and had taken her soft hand I really cannot see sir by what right you interfere between us I cried looking at him narrowly You forbid What do I care why pray should you forbid my actions I forbid repeated the thin faced clergyman because I have a right a right which one day will be made quite plain to you Ah mister Shuttleworth gasped Sylvia now pale as death what are you saying The truth my child You know too well that for you love and marriage are forbidden he exclaimed looking at her meaningly She sighed and her tiny hand trembled within my grasp Her mouth trembled and I saw that tears were welling in her eyes Ah yes she cried hoarsely a moment later I know alas that I am not like other women About me there have been forged bonds of steel bonds which I can never break Only by one means interrupted Shuttleworth terribly calm and composed No no she protested quickly covering her face with her hands as though in shame Not that never that Do not let us speak of it Then you have no right to accept this man s love he said reproachfully no right to allow him to approach nearer the brink of the grave than he has done You know full well that for him your love must prove fatal She hung her head as though not daring to look again into my eyes The strange clergyman s stern rebuke had utterly confused and confounded her Yet I knew she loved me dearly That sweet intense love look of hers an hour ago could never be feigned It spoke far more truly than mere words Perhaps she was annoyed that I had told Shuttleworth the truth Yes I had acted very foolishly My tongue had loosened involuntarily My wild joy had led me into an injudicious confession one that I had never dreamed would be fraught with sorrow mister Shuttleworth I said at last please do not distress yourself on my account I love Sylvia and she has promised to be mine If disaster occurs then I am fully prepared to meet it You seem in close touch with this remarkable association of thieves and assassins or you would hardly be so readily aware of their evil intentions Ah he responded with a slight sigh you are only speaking in ignorance If you were aware of the true facts you would on the contrary thank me for revealing the peril in which love for this young lady will assuredly place you But have I not already told you that I am fearless I am prepared to meet this mysterious peril whatever it is for her sake I protested A curious cynical smile overspread his grey ascetic face You speak without knowledge my dear sir he remarked Could I but reveal the truth you would quickly withdraw that assertion You would indeed flee from this girl as you would from the plague Well I said your words are at least very remarkable sir One would really imagine Miss Pennington to be a hell fiend from your denunciation You mistake me I make no denunciation On the other hand I am trying to impress upon you the utter futility of your love Why should you do that What is your motive I asked quickly trying to discern what could be at the back of this man s mind How strange it was Hitherto I had rather liked the tall quiet kind mannered country rector Yet he had suddenly set himself out in open antagonism to my plans to my love My motive he declared is to protect the best interests of you both I have no ends to serve save those of humanity mister Biddulph You urged Miss Pennington to make confession to me You implied that her avowal of affection was false I said with quick indignation I asked her to confess to tell you the truth because I am unable so to do was his slow reply Ah mister Biddulph he sighed if only the real facts could be exposed to you if only you could be told the ghastly naked truth Why do you say all this mister Shuttleworth protested Sylvia in a low pained voice Why should mister Biddulph be mystified further If you are determined that I should sacrifice myself well I am ready You have been my friend yet now you seem to have suddenly turned against me and treat me as an enemy Only as far as this unfortunate affair is concerned my child he said Remember my position recall all the past and put to yourself the question whether I have not a perfect right to forbid you to sacrifice the life of a good honest man like the one before you he said his clerical drawl becoming more accentuated as he spoke Rubbish my dear sir I laughed derisively Put aside all this cant and hypocrisy It ill becomes you Speak out like a man of the world that you are What specific charge do you bring against this lady Come tell me None he replied Evil is done through her not by her And she stood silent unable to protest But can t you be more explicit I cried my anger rising If you make charges I demand that you shall substantiate them Recollect all that I have at stake in this matter I know your life he responded Well I have already told you what to expect Sylvia I said turning to the pale girl standing trembling at my side will you not speak Will you not tell me what all this means By what right does this man speak thus Has he any right She was silent for a few moments Then slowly she nodded her head in an affirmative What right has he to forbid our affection I demanded I love you and I tell you that no man shall come between us He alone has a right Owen she said addressing me for the first time by my Christian name What right But she would not answer She merely stood with head downcast and said Ask him This I did but the thin faced man refused to reply All he would say was I have forbidden this fatal folly mister Biddulph Please do not let us discuss it further I confess I was both angry and bewildered The mystery was hourly increasing Sylvia had admitted that Shuttleworth had a right to interfere Yet I could not discern by what right a mere friend could forbid a girl to entertain affection I felt that the ever increasing problem was even stranger and more remarkable than I had anticipated and that when I fathomed it it would be found to be utterly astounding Sylvia was unwavering in her attachment to myself Her antagonism towards Shuttleworth s pronouncement was keen and bitter yet with her woman s superior judgment she affected carelessness You asked this lady to confess I said addressing him Confess what The truth Then I turned to my well beloved and asked What is the truth Do you love me Yes Owen I do was her frank and fervent response I did not mean that said Shuttleworth hastily I meant the truth concerning yourself mister Biddulph knows what I am But he does not know who you are Then you may tell him was her hoarse reply Tell him she cried wildly Tear from me all that I hold sacred all that I hold most dear dash me back into degradation and despair if you will I am in your hands Sylvia he said reproachfully I am your friend and your father s friend I am not your enemy I regret if you have ever thought I have lifted a finger against you Are you not standing as a barrier between myself and mister Biddulph she protested her eyes flashing Because I see that only misfortune ah death can arise You know full well the promise I have made You know too what has been told me in confidence because because my profession happens to be what it is a humble servant of God Yes she faltered I know I know Forgive me if I have spoken harshly mister Shuttleworth I know you are my friend and you are Owen s Only only it seems very hard that you should thus put this ban upon us you who preach the gospel of truth and love Shuttleworth drew a deep breath His thin lips were pursed his grey eyebrows contracted slightly and I saw in his countenance a distinctly pained expression I have spoken with all good intention Sylvia he said Your love for mister Biddulph must only bring evil upon both of you Surely you realize that Sylvia has already realized it I declared But we have resolved to risk it The risk is alas too great he declared Already you are a marked man Your only chance of escape is to take Sylvia s advice and to go into hiding Go away into the country and live in some quiet remote village under another name It is your best mode of evading disaster To remain and become the lover of Sylvia Pennington is I tell you the height of folly it is suicide Let it be so I responded in quiet defiance I will never forsake the woman I love Frankly I suspect a hidden motive in this suggestion of yours therefore I refuse to accept it Not to save your own life Not even to save my life This is surely my own affair And hers I shall protect Sylvia never fear I am not afraid Let our enemies betray their presence by sign or word and I will set myself out to combat them They have already those crimes in Bayswater to account for And they will take a good deal of explaining away Then you really intend to reveal the secret of that house in Porchester Terrace he asked not without some apprehension My enemies you say intend to plot and encompass my death Good Then I shall take my own means of vindication Naturally I am a quiet law abiding man But if any enemy rises against me without cause then I strike out with a sledgehammer You are hopeless he declared I am where my love is concerned I admitted Sylvia has promised to day that she will become my wife The future is surely our own affair mister Shuttleworth not yours And if her father forbids he asked quite quietly his eyes fixed straight upon my well beloved Let me meet him face to face I said in defiance He will not interfere after I have spoken I added with confidence I perhaps know more than you believe concerning him Sylvia started staring at me her face blanched in an instant The scene was tragic and painful What do you know she asked breathlessly Nothing dearest which will interfere with our love I reassured her Your father s affairs are not yours and for his doings you cannot be held responsible She exchanged a quick glance with Shuttleworth I noticed Then it seemed as though a great weight were lifted from her mind by my words for turning to me she smiled sweetly saying Ah how can I thank you sufficiently I am helpless and defenceless If I only dared I could tell you a strange story for surely mine is as strange as any ever printed in the pages of fiction But mister Shuttleworth will not permit it You may speak if you deem it wise exclaimed the rector in a strangely altered voice He seemed much annoyed at my open defiance mister Biddulph may as well perhaps know the truth at first as at last The truth I echoed Yes tell me the truth I begged her No she cried wildly again covering her fair face with her hands No forgive me I can t I can t No remarked Shuttleworth in a strange hard reproachful tone and with a cruel cynical smile upon his lips You cannot for it is too hideous too disgraceful too utterly scandalous It is for that reason I forbid you to love CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE MAN IN GOLD PINCE NEZ For a whole month our engagement was kept a profound secret Only Shuttleworth and his wife knew The first named had been compelled to bow to the inevitable and for him it must be said that he behaved splendidly Sylvia remained his guest and on several days each week I travelled down from Waterloo to Andover and spent the warm summer hours with her wandering in the woods or lounging upon the pretty lawn of the old rectory The rector had ceased to utter warnings yet sometimes I noticed a strange apprehensive look upon his grave countenance Elsie Durnford still remained there and she and Sylvia were close friends Through those four happy weeks I had tried to get into communication with mister Pennington I telegraphed to an address in Scotland which Sylvia had given me but received no reply I then telegraphed to the Caledonian Hotel in Edinburgh and then learned with considerable surprise that nobody named Pennington was or had been staying there I told Sylvia this But she merely remarked Father is so erratic in his movements that he probably never went to Edinburgh after all I have not heard from him now for a full week I somehow felt why I cannot well explain that she was rather disinclined to allow me to communicate with Pennington Did she fear that he might forbid our marriage Without seeing him or obtaining his consent I confess I did not feel absolute security The mystery surrounding her was such a curious and complicated one that the deeper I probed into it the more complex did it appear Some few days later in reply to my question she said that she had heard from her father who was at the Midland Grand Hotel in Manchester He would not however be in London for two or three weeks as he was about to leave in two days time by way of Hook of Holland for Berlin where he had business Therefore early the following morning I took train to Manchester and made inquiry at the big hotel We have no gentleman of that name here sir replied the smart reception clerk referring to his list He hasn t arrived yet I expect A lady was asking for a mister Pennington yesterday a French lady You don t know the name then He replied in the negative No doubt he is expected if the lady called to see him No doubt sir Perhaps he ll be here to day And with that I was compelled to turn disappointed away I wandered into the restaurant and there ate my lunch alone The place was crowded as it always is mostly by people interested in cotton and its products for it is perhaps one of the most cosmopolitan hotels in the whole kingdom Sick of the chatter and clatter of the place I paid my bill and passed out into the big smoking lounge to take my coffee and liqueur and idle over the newspaper I was not quite certain whether to remain there the night and watch for Pennington s arrival or to return to London As a matter of fact so certain had I been of finding him that I had not brought a suit case I suppose I had been in the lounge half an hour or so when I looked up and then to my surprise saw Pennington smartly dressed and looking very spruce for his years crossing from the bureau with a number of letters in his hand It was apparent that he had just received them from the mail clerk And yet I had been told that he was not staying there I held my paper in such position as to conceal my face while I watched his movements He halted opened a telegram and read it eagerly Then crushing it in his hand with a gesture of annoyance he thrust it into his jacket pocket He was dressed in a smart dark grey suit which fitted him perfectly a grey soft felt hat while his easy manner and bearing were those of a gentleman of wealth and leisure He held a cigar between his fingers and walking slowly as he opened one of the letters he presently threw himself into one of the big arm chairs near me and became absorbed in his correspondence There was a waste paper basket near and into this he tossed something as valueless One of the letters evidently caused him considerable annoyance for removing his hat he passed his hand slowly over his bald head as he sat staring at it in mystification Then he rang the bell and ordered something from a waiter A liqueur of brandy was brought and tossing it off at a gulp he rose wrote a telegram at the table near him and went quickly out After he had gone I also rose and without attracting attention crossed took up another paper and then seated myself in the chair he had vacated My eye was upon the waste paper basket and when no one was looking I reached out and took therefrom a crumpled blue envelope the paper he had flung away Smoothing it out I found that it was not addressed to him but to Arnold Du Cane esquire Travellers Club Paris and had been re directed to this hotel This surprised me I rose and crossing to the mail clerk asked You gave some letters and a telegram to a rather short gentleman in grey a few minutes ago Was that mister Du Cane Yes sir was the reply He went across yonder into the lounge You know him eh Oh yes sir He s often been here Not lately At one time however he was a frequent visitor And so Sylvia s father was living there under the assumed name of Arnold Du Cane For business purposes names are often assumed of course But Pennington s business was such a mysterious one that even against my will I became filled with suspicion I resolved to wait and catch him on his return He had probably only gone to the telegraph office Had Sylvia wilfully concealed the fact that her father travelled under the name of Du Cane in order that I should not meet him Surely there could be no reason why she should have done so Therefore I returned to a chair near the entrance to the smoking lounge and waited in patience My vigil was not a long one for after ten minutes or so he re entered spruce and gay and cast a quick glance around as though in search of somebody I rose from my chair and as I did so saw that he regarded me strangely as though half conscious of having met me somewhere before Walking straight up to him I said I believe sir that you are mister Pennington He looked at me strangely and I fancied that he started at mention of the name Well sir was his calm reply I have not the pleasure of knowing you I noted that he neither admitted that he was Pennington nor did he deny it We met some little time ago on the Lake of Garda I said I unfortunately did not get the chance of a chat with you then You left suddenly Don t you recollect that I sat alone opposite you in the restaurant of the Grand at Gardone Oh yes he laughed How very foolish of me Forgive me I thought I recognized you and yet couldn t for the life of me recall where we had met How are you and he put out his hand and shook mine warmly Let s sit down Have a drink mister er I haven t the pleasure of your name Biddulph I said Owen Biddulph Well mister Biddulph he said in a cheery way I m very glad you recognized me I m a very bad hand at recollecting people I fear Perhaps I meet so many And then he gave the waiter an order for some refreshment Since I was at Gardone I ve been about a great deal to Cairo Bucharest Odessa and other places I m always travelling you know And your daughter has remained at home with mister Shuttleworth near Andover I remarked He started perceptibly at my words Ah of course The girl was with me at Gardone You met her there perhaps eh I replied in the affirmative It however struck me as strange that he should refer to her as the girl Surely that was the term used by one of his strange motoring friends when he kept that midnight appointment on the Brescia road I had the pleasure of meeting Miss Sylvia I went on And more we have become very firm friends Oh he exclaimed opening his eyes widely I m delighted to hear it Though his manner was so open and breezy I yet somehow detected a curious sinister expression in his glance He did not seem exactly at his ease in my presence The fact is mister Pennington I said after we had been chatting for some time I have been wanting to meet you for some weeks past I have something to say to you Oh What s that he asked regarding me with some surprise I suppose Sylvia told you that I was in Manchester and you came here to see me eh This was not a chance meeting was it Not exactly I admitted I came here from London expressly to have a chat with you a confidential chat His expression altered slightly I thought Well he asked twisting his cigar thoughtfully in his fingers Speak I m listening For a second I hesitated Then in a blundering way blurted forth The fact is mister Pennington I love Sylvia She has promised to become my wife and I am here to beg your consent He half rose from his chair staring at me in blank amazement What he cried Sylvia loves you a perfect stranger She does was my calm response And though I may be a stranger to you mister Pennington I hope it may not be for long I am not without means and I am in a position to maintain your daughter properly as the wife of a country gentleman He was silent for a few moments his brows knit thoughtfully his eyes upon the fine ring upon his well manicured hand What is your income he asked quite bluntly raising his keen eyes to mine I told him giving him a few details concerning my parentage and my possessions And what would you be prepared to settle on my daughter providing I gave my consent Have you thought of that matter I confessed that I had not but that I would be ready if she so desired to settle upon her twenty thousand pounds And that wouldn t cripple you eh No I m pleased to say it would not I have kept my inheritance practically intact I added Well I must first hear what Sylvia has to say he said then he added airily I suppose you would make over the greater part of your estate to her in case of your death And there are life assurances of course One never knows what may happen you know Pardon me for speaking thus frankly As a father however it is my duty to see that my daughter s future is safeguarded I quite understand all that I replied with a smile Of course Sylvia would inherit all I could legally bequeath to her and as for life assurances I would insure myself for what sum you suggest You are young he said Insure for ten thousand The premiums would be not so very heavy As you wish I replied If I carry out your desires I understand that I have your consent to pay my attentions to Sylvia If what you tell me proves on inquiry to be the truth mister Biddulph I shall have the greatest pleasure in welcoming you as my son in law I can t say more he replied Here s my hand and as I took his he gripped me heartily I confess I like you now he added and I feel sure I shall like you more when I know more concerning you Then he added with a laugh Oh by the way I m not known here as Pennington but as Du Cane The fact is I had some unfortunate litigation some time ago which led to bankruptcy and so for business reasons I m Arnold Du Cane You ll understand won t you he laughed Entirely I replied overjoyed at receiving Pennington s consent When shall we meet in London I ll be back on the tenth that s sixteen days from now he replied I have to go to Brussels and on to Riga Tell Sylvia and dear old Shuttleworth you ve seen me Give them both my love We shall meet down at Middleton most certainly And so for a long time we chatted on finishing our cigars I replying to many questions he put to me relative to my financial and social position questions which were most natural in the circumstances of our proposed relationship But while we were talking a rather curious incident arrested my attention Pennington was sitting with his back to the door of the lounge when among those who came and went was a rather stout foreigner of middle age dressed quietly in black wearing a gold pince nez and having the appearance of a French business man He had entered the lounge leisurely when suddenly catching sight of Sylvia s father he drew back and made a hurried exit apparently anxious to escape the observation of us both So occupied was my mind with my own affairs that the occurrence completely passed from me until that same night when at ten o clock on descending the steps of White s and proceeding to walk down saint James s Street in the direction of home I suddenly heard footsteps behind me and turning found to my dismay the Frenchman from Manchester quietly walking in the same direction This greatly mystified me The broad faced foreigner in gold pince nez evidently in ignorance that I had seen him in Manchester must have travelled up to London by the same train as myself and must have remained watching outside White s for an hour or more Why had the stranger so suddenly become interested in me Was yet another attempt to be made upon me as Shuttleworth had so mysteriously predicted I was determined to show a bold front and defy my enemies therefore when I had crossed Pall Mall against saint James s Palace I suddenly faced about and meeting the stranger full tilt addressed him before he could escape Next moment alas I knew that I had acted injudiciously CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE MAN IN THE STREET I had asked the Frenchman rather angrily I fear why he was following me whereat he merely bowed with the exquisite politeness of his race and replied in good English I was not aware of following m sieur I regret extremely if I have caused annoyance I ask a thousand pardons Well your surveillance upon me annoys me I declared abruptly I saw you spying upon me in Manchester this afternoon and you have followed me to London Ah yes he replied with a slight gesticulation it is true that I was in Manchester But our meeting here must be by mere chance I was unaware that monsieur was in Manchester he assured me in a suave manner Well I said in French yours is a very lame story monsieur I saw you and you also saw me talking to mister Pennington in the Midland Hotel Perhaps you ll deny that you know mister Pennington eh I certainly do not deny that he said with a smile I have known Monsieur Penning ton for some years It is true that I saw him at the Midland And you withdrew in order to escape his observation eh Monsieur has quick eyes he said Yes that is quite true Why For reasons of my own And you deny having followed me here He hesitated for a second looking straight into my face in the darkness Come I said you may as well admit that you followed me from Manchester Why should I admit what is not the truth he asked What motive could I have to follow you a perfect stranger Well as a matter of fact I m a bit suspicious I declared still speaking in French Of late there was a desperate attempt upon my life By whom he inquired quickly Please tell me Monsieur Biddulph I am greatly interested in this Then you know my name I exclaimed surprised Certainly Why are you interested in me I may now have a motive was his calm yet mysterious reply Tell me in what manner an attempt has been made upon you At first I hesitated then after a second s reflection I explained the situation in a few words Ah Of course I quite see that monsieur s mind must be filled by suspicion he responded yet I regret if I have been the cause of any annoyance By the way how long have you known Monsieur Penning ton Oh some months I replied The fact is I m engaged to his daughter His daughter echoed the Frenchman looking at me quickly with a searching glance Then he gave vent to a low grunt and stroked his grey pointed beard And it was after this engagement that the attempt was made upon you eh he inquired No before The foreigner remained silent for a few moments He seemed considerably puzzled I could not make him out The fact that he was acquainted with my name showed that he was unduly interested in me even though he had partially denied it Why do you ask this I demanded as we still stood together at the bottom of saint James s Street Ah nothing he laughed But well I really fear I ve aroused your suspicions unduly Perhaps it is not so very extraordinary after all that in these days of rapid communication two men should catch sight of each other in a Manchester hotel and later on meet in a street in London eh I regard the coincidence as a strange one monsieur I replied stiffly if it is really an actual coincidence For aught I knew the fellow might be a friend of Pennington or an accomplice of those rascally assassins Had I not been warned by Shuttleworth and also by Sylvia herself of another secret attempt upon my life I was wary now and full of suspicion Instinctively I did not like this mysterious foreigner The way in which he had first caught sight of my face as I descended the steps of White s and how he had glided after me down saint James s Street was not calculated to inspire confidence He asked permission to walk at my side along the Mall which I rather reluctantly granted It seemed that now I had addressed him I could not shake him off Without doubt his intention was to watch and see where I lived Therefore instead of going in the direction of Buckingham Palace I turned back eastward towards the steps at the foot of the Duke of York s Column As we strolled in the darkness along the front of Carlton House Terrace he chatted affably with me then said suddenly Do you know Monsieur Biddulph we met once before in rather strange circumstances You did not however see me It was in Paris some little time ago You were staying at the Grand Hotel and became acquainted with a certain American named Harriman Harriman I echoed with a start for that man s name brought back to me an episode I would fain forget The fact is I had trusted him and I had believed him to be an honest man engaged in big financial transactions until I discovered the truth My friendship with him cost me nearly one thousand eight hundred pounds Harriman was very smart was he not laughed my friend with a touch of sarcasm Could it be I wondered that this Frenchman was a friend of the shrewd and unscrupulous New Yorker Yes I replied rather faintly Sharp until found out went on the stranger speaking in French His real name is Bell and he Yes I know he was arrested for fraud in my presence as he came down the staircase in the hotel I interrupted He was arrested upon a much more serious charge exclaimed the stranger He was certainly wanted in Berlin and Hanover for frauds in connection with an invention but the most serious charge against him was one of murder Murder I gasped I never knew that Yes the murder of a young English statesman named Ronald Burke at a villa near Nice Surely you read reports of the trial I confessed that I had not done so Well it was proved conclusively that he was a member of a very dangerous gang of criminals who for several years had committed some of the most clever and audacious thefts The organization consisted of over thirty men and women of varying ages all of them expert jewel thieves safe breakers or card sharpers Twice each year this interesting company held meetings at which every member was present and at such meetings certain members were allotted certain districts or certain profitable pieces of business Thus if half a dozen were to day operating in London as thieves or receivers they would change and in a week would be operating in saint Petersburg while those from Russia would be here So cleverly was the band organized that it was practically impossible for the police to make arrests It was a more widespread and wealthy criminal organization than has ever before been unearthed But the arrest of your friend Harriman alias Bell on a charge of murder was the means of exposing the conspiracy and the ultimate breaking up of the gang And what of Bell He narrowly escaped the guillotine and is now imprisoned for life at Devil s Island And you saw him with me at Paris I remarked in wonder at this strange revelation He certainly never struck me as an assassin He was a shrewd man a swindler no doubt but his humorous bearing and his good nature were entirely opposed to the belief that his was a sinister nature Yet it was proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that he and another man killed and robbed a young Englishman named Burke responded the Frenchman Perhaps you yourself had a narrow escape Who knows It was no doubt lucky for you that he was arrested But I understood that the charge was one of fraud I said I intended to go to the trial but I was called to Italy The charge of fraud was made in order not to alarm his accomplice replied the stranger How do you know that I inquired Well he hesitated that came out at the trial There were full accounts of it in the Paris Matin I don t care for reading Assize Court horrors I replied still puzzled regarding my strange companion s intimate knowledge concerning the man whose dramatic and sudden arrest had on that memorable afternoon so startled me When I saw your face just now he said I recognized you as being at the Grand Hotel with Bell Do you know he laughed you were such a close friend of the accused that you were suspected of being a member of the dangerous association Indeed you very narrowly escaped arrest on suspicion It was only because the reception clerk in the hotel knew you well and vouched for your respectability and that Biddulph was your real name Yet for a full week you were watched closely by the surete And I was all unconscious of it I cried realizing how narrowly I had escaped a very unpleasant time How do you know all this I asked But the Frenchman with the gold glasses and the big amethyst ring upon his finger merely laughed and refused to satisfy me From him however I learned that the depredations of the formidable gang had been unequalled in the annals of crime Many of the greatest jewel robberies in the European capitals in recent years had it was now proved been effected by them as well as the theft of the Marchioness of Mottisfont s jewels at Victoria Station which were valued at eighteen thousand pounds and were never recovered the breaking open of the safe of Levi Andrews the well known diamond merchants of Hatton Garden and the theft of a whole vanload of furs before a shop in New Bond Street all of which are no doubt fresh within the memory of the reader of the daily newspapers Every single member of that remarkable association of thieves was an expert in his or her branch of dishonesty while the common fund was a large one hence members could disguise themselves as wealthy persons if need be One when arrested was found occupying a fine old castle in the Tyrol he told me another an expert burglar was a doctor in good practice at Hampstead another kept a fine jeweller s shop in Marseilles while another a lady lived in style in a great chateau near Nevers And who exposed them I asked much interested Somebody must have betrayed them Somebody did betray them by anonymous letters to the police letters which were received at intervals at the Prefecture in Paris and led to the arrest of one after another of the chief members of the gang It seemed to have been done by some one irritated by Bell s arrest But the identity of the informant has never been ascertained He deemed it best to remain hidden for obvious reasons laughed my friend at my side You seem to know a good many facts regarding the affair I said Have you no idea of the identity of the mysterious informant Well he hesitated I have a suspicion that it was some person associated with them some one who became conscience stricken Ah M sieur Biddulph if you only knew the marvellous cunning of that invulnerable gang Had it not been for that informant they would still be operating in open defiance of the police of Europe Criminal methods if expert only fail for want of funds Are not some of our wealthiest financiers mere criminals who by dealing in thousands as other men deal in francs conceal their criminal methods Half your successful financiers are merely successful adventurers The dossiers of some of them preserved in the police bureaux would be astounding reading to those who admire them and proclaim them the successful men of to day kings of finance they call them You are certainly something of a philosopher I laughed compelled to admit the truth of his argument but tell me how is it that you know so much concerning George Harriman alias Bell and his antecedents CHAPTER EIGHTEEN PROOF POSITIVE I was greatly interested even though I was now filled with suspicion Somehow I had become impressed with the idea that the stranger might have been one of the daring and dangerous association and that he had related that strange story for the purpose of misleading me But the stranger who had in the course of our conversation told me that his name was Pierre Delanne only said You could have read it all in the Matin my dear monsieur His attitude was that of a man who knew more than he intended to reveal Surely it was a curious circumstance standing there in the night listening to the dramatic truth concerning the big faced American Harriman whom I had for so long regarded as an enigma Tell me Monsieur Delanne I said for what reason have you followed me to London He laughed as he strode easily along at my side towards the Duke of York s steps Haven t I already told you that I did not purposely follow you he exclaimed Yes but I don t believe it was my very frank reply He had certainly explained that but his manner was not earnest I could see that he was only trifling with me trifling in an easy good natured way Bien he said and if I followed you Monsieur Biddulph I assert that it is with no sinister intent How do I know that I queried You are a stranger I admit that But you are not a stranger to me my dear monsieur Well let us come to the point I said What do you want with me Nothing he laughed Was it not you yourself who addressed me But you followed me I cried You can t deny that Monsieur may hold of me whatever opinion he pleases was Delanne s polite reply I repeat my regrets and I ask pardon He spoke English remarkably well But I recollected that the international thief the man who is a cosmopolitan and who commits theft in one country to night and is across the frontier in the morning is always a perfect linguist Harriman was Though American with all his nasal intonation and quaint Americanisms he spoke half a dozen Continental languages quite fluently My bitter experiences of the past caused considerable doubt to arise within me I had had warnings that my mysterious enemies would attack me secretly by some subtle means Was this Frenchman one of them He saw that I treated him with some suspicion but it evidently amused him His face beamed with good nature At the bottom of the broad flight of stairs which lead up to the United Service Club and Pall Mall I halted Now look here Monsieur Delanne I said much puzzled and mystified by the man s manner and the curious story he had related I have neither desire nor inclination for your company further You understand Ah monsieur a thousand pardons cried the man raising his hat and bowing with the elegance of the true Parisian I have simply spoken the truth Did you not put to me questions which I have answered You have said you are engaged to the daughter of my friend Penning ton That has interested me Why Because the daughter of my friend Penning ton always interests me was his curious reply Is that an intended sarcasm I asked resentfully Not in the least m sieur he said quickly I have every admiration for the young lady Then you know her eh By repute Why Well her father was connected with one of the strangest and most extraordinary incidents in my life he said Even to day the mystery of it all has not been cleared up I have tried times without number to elucidate it but have always failed What part did Sylvia play in the affair may I ask Really he replied I scarcely know It was so utterly extraordinary beyond human credence Tell me explain to me I said instantly interested What could this man know of my well beloved He was silent for some minutes We were still standing by the steps Surely it was scarcely the place for an exchange of confidences I fear that monsieur must really excuse me The matter is purely a personal one purely confidential and concerns myself alone just just as your close acquaintanceship with Mademoiselle Sylvia concerns you It seems that it concerns other persons as well if one may judge by what has recently occurred Ah Then your enemies have arisen because of your engagement to the girl eh The girl How strange Pennington s mysterious friends of the Brescia road had referred to her as the girl So had those two assassins in Porchester Terrace Was it a mere coincidence or had he too betrayed a collusion with those mean blackguards who had put me to that horrible torture Had you met this strange man at night in saint James s Park would you have placed any faith in him I think not I maintain that I was perfectly justified in treating him as an enemy He was rather too intimately acquainted with the doings of Harriman and his gang to suit my liking Even as he stood there beneath the light of the street lamp I saw that his bright eyes twinkled behind those gold pince nez while the big old fashioned amethyst he wore on his finger was a conspicuous object He gave one the appearance of a prosperous merchant or shopkeeper What makes you suggest that the attempt was due to my affection for Sylvia I asked him Well it furnishes a motive does it not No it doesn t I have no enemies as far as I am aware But there exists some person who is highly jealous of mademoiselle and who is therefore working against you in secret Is that your opinion I regret to admit that it is Indeed Monsieur Biddulph you have every need to exercise the greatest care Otherwise misfortune will occur to you Mark what I a stranger tell you I started Here again was a warning uttered The situation was growing quite uncanny What makes you expect this It is more than mere surmise he said slowly and in deep earnestness I happen to know From that last sentence of his I jumped to the conclusion that he was after all one of the malefactors He was warning me with the distinct object of putting me off my guard His next move no doubt would be to try and pose as my friend and adviser I laughed within myself for I was too wary for him Well I said after a few moments silence as together we ascended the broad flight of steps with the high column looming in the darkness the fact is I ve become tired of all these warnings Everybody I meet seems to predict disaster for me Why I can t make out No one has revealed to you the reason eh he asked in a low meaning voice No Ah Then of course you cannot discern the peril It is but natural that you should treat all well meant advice lightly Probably I should mon cher ami if I were in your place Well I exclaimed impatiently halting again now what is it that you really know Don t beat about the bush any longer Tell me frankly and openly The man merely raised his shoulders significantly but made no response In the ray of light which fell upon him his gold rimmed spectacles glinted while his shrewd dark eyes twinkled behind them as though he delighted in mystifying me Surely you can reply I cried in anger What is the reason of all this What have I done Ah it is what monsieur has not done Pray explain Pardon I cannot explain Why not ask mademoiselle She knows everything Everything I echoed Then why does she not tell me She fears most probably Could it be that this strange foreigner was purposely misleading me I gazed upon his stout well dressed figure and the well brushed silk hat which he wore with such jaunty air In Pall Mall a string of taxi cabs was passing westward conveying homeward bound theatre folk while across at the brightly lit entrance of the Carlton cabs and taxis were drawing up and depositing well dressed people about to sup At the corner of the Athenaeum Club we halted again for I wanted to rid myself of him I had acted foolishly in addressing him in the first instance For aught I knew he might be an accomplice of those absconding assassins of Porchester Terrace As we stood there he had the audacity to produce his cigarette case and offer me one But I resentfully declined it Ah he laughed stroking his greyish beard again I fear Monsieur Biddulph that you are displeased with me I have annoyed you by not satisfying your natural curiosity But were I to do so it would be against my own interests Hence my silence Am I not perfectly honest with you That speech of his corroborated all my suspicions His motive in following me whatever it could be was a sinister one He had admitted knowledge of Harriman the man found guilty and sentenced for the murder of the young English member of Parliament Ronald Burke His intimate acquaintance with Harriman s past and with his undesirable friends showed that he must have been an associate of that daring and dangerous gang I was a diligent reader of the English papers but had never seen any mention of the great association of expert criminals His assertion that the Paris Matin had published all the details was in all probability untrue I instinctively mistrusted him because he had kept such a watchful eye upon me ever since I had sat with Sylvia s father in the lounge of that big hotel in Manchester I don t think you are honest with me Monsieur Delanne I said stiffly Therefore I refuse to believe you further As you wish laughed my companion You will believe me however ere long when you have proof Depend upon it And he glanced at his watch closing it quickly with a snap You see he began but as he uttered the words a taxi coming from the direction of Charing Cross suddenly pulled up at the kerb where we were standing so suddenly that for a moment I did not notice that it had come to a standstill Ah he exclaimed when he saw the cab I quite forgot I have an appointment I will wish you bon soir Monsieur Biddulph We may meet again perhaps And he raised his hat in farewell As he turned towards the taxi to enter it I realized that some one was inside that the person in the cab had met the strange foreigner by appointment at that corner A man s face peered out for a second and a voice exclaimed cheerily Hulloa Sorry I m late old chap Then next instant on seeing me the face was withdrawn into the shadow Delanne had entered quickly and slamming the door told the man to drive with all speed to Paddington Station The taxi was well on its way down Pall Mall ere I could recover from my surprise The face of the man in the cab was a countenance the remembrance of which will ever haunt me if I live to be a hundred years the evil pimply dissipated face of Charles Reckitt My surmise had been correct after all Delanne was his friend Another conspiracy was afoot against me CHAPTER NINETEEN THROUGH THE MISTS It was now the end of September All my fears had proved groundless and I had at last learned to laugh at them For me a new vista of life had been opened out for Sylvia had now been my wife for a whole week seven long dreamy days of perfect love and bliss Scarce could we realize the truth that we were actually man and wife Pennington had after all proved quite kind and affable his sole thought being of his daughter s future happiness I had invited them both down to Carrington and he had expressed delight at the provision I had made for Sylvia Old Browning in his brand new suit was at the head of a new staff of servants There were new horses and carriages and a landaulette motor while I had also done all I could to refurnish and renovate some of the rooms for Sylvia s use The old place had been very dark and dreary but it now wore an air of brightness and freshness thanks to the London upholsterers and decorators into whose hands I had given the work Pennington appeared highly pleased with all he saw while Sylvia her arms entwined about my neck kissed me in silent thanks for my efforts on her behalf Then came the wedding a very quiet one at saint Mary Abbot s Kensington Besides Jack Marlowe and a couple of other men who were intimate friends not more than a dozen persons were present Shuttleworth assisted the vicar but Pennington was unfortunately ill in bed at the Hotel Metropole suffering from a bad cold Still we held the wedding luncheon at the Savoy and afterwards went up to Scarborough where we were now living in a pretty suite at the Grand Hotel overlooking the harbour the blue bay and the castle crowned cliffs It was disappointing to Sylvia that her father had not been present at the wedding but Elsie Durnford and her mother were there as well as two or three other of her girl friends The ceremony was very plain At her own request she had been married in her travelling dress while I man like had secretly been glad that there was no fuss Just a visit to the church the brief ceremony the signature in the register and a four line announcement in the Times and Morning Post and Sylvia and I had become man and wife I had resolved on the morning of my marriage to put behind me all thought of the mysteries and gruesomeness of the past Now that I was Sylvia s husband I felt that she would have my protection as well as that of her father I had said nothing to her of her strange apprehensions for we had mutually allowed them to drop We had come to Scarborough in preference to going abroad for my well beloved declared that she had had already too much of Continental life and preferred a quiet time in England So we had chosen the East Coast and now each day we either drove out over the Yorkshire moors or wandered by the rolling seas She was now my own my very own Ah the sweet significance of those words when I uttered them and she clung to me raising her full red lips to mine to kiss I loved her aye loved her with an all consuming love I told myself a thousand times that no man on earth had ever loved a woman more than I loved Sylvia She was my idol and more we were wedded firmly united to one another insunderably joined with each other so that we two were one You satirists cynics misogamists and misogynists may sneer at love and jeer at marriage So melancholy is this our age that even by some women marriage seems to be doubted Yet we may believe that there is not a woman in all Christendom who does not dote upon the name of wife It carries a spell which even the most rebellious suffragette must acknowledge They may speak of the subjection the trammel the slavery and the inferiority to which marriage reduces them but after all wife is a word against which they cannot harden their hearts Ah how fervently we loved each other As Sylvia and I wandered together by the sea on those calm September evenings avoiding the holiday crowd preferring the less frequented walks to the fashionable promenades of the South Cliff or the Spa we linked arm in arm and I often when not observed kissed her upon the brow One evening with the golden sunset in our faces we were walking over the cliffs to Cayton Bay a favourite walk of ours when we halted at a stile and sat together upon it to rest The wide waters deep below bathed in the green and gold of the sinking sun were calm almost unruffled unusual indeed for the North Sea while about us the birds were singing their evening song and the cattle in the fields were lying down in peace There was not a breath of wind The calmness was the same as the perfect calmness of our own hearts How still it is Owen remarked my love after sitting in silence for a few minutes From where we sat we could see that it was high tide and the waves were lazily lapping the base of the cliffs deep below Now and then a gull would circle about us with its shrill plaintive cry while far on the distant horizon lay the trail of smoke from a passing steamer How delightful it is to be here alone with you My arm stole round her slim waist and my lips met hers in a fond passionate caress She looked very dainty in a plain walking costume of cream serge with a boa of ostrich feathers about her throat and a large straw hat trimmed with autumn flowers It was exceptionally warm for the time of year yet at night on the breezy East Coast there is a cold nip in the air even in the height of summer That afternoon we had by favour of its owner mister George Beeforth one of the pioneers of Scarborough wandered through the beautiful private gardens of the Belvedere which with their rose walks lawns and plantations stretched from the promenade down to the sea and had spent some charming hours in what its genial owner called the sun trap In all the north of England there are surely no more beautiful gardens beside the sea than those and happily their good natured owner is never averse to granting a stranger permission to visit them As we now sat upon that stile our hearts were too full for words devoted as we were to each other Owen my wife exclaimed at last her soft little hand upon my shoulder as she looked up into my face are you certain you will never regret marrying me Why of course not dearest I said quickly looking into her great wide open eyes But but somehow Somehow what I asked slowly Well she sighed gazing away towards the far off horizon her wonderful eyes bluer than the sea itself I have a strange indescribable feeling of impending evil a presage of disaster My darling I exclaimed why trouble yourself over what are merely melancholy fancies We are happy in each other s love therefore why should we anticipate evil If it comes then we will unite to resist it Ah yes Owen she replied quickly but this strange feeling came over me yesterday when we were together at Whitby I cannot describe it only it is a weird uncanny feeling a fixed idea that something must happen to mar this perfect happiness of ours What can mar our happiness when we both trust each other when we both love each other and our two hearts beat as one Has not the French poet written a very serious truth in those lines Plaisir d amour ne dure qu un moment chagrin d amour dure toute la vie Yes but we shall experience no chagrin sweetheart I assured her After another week here we will travel where you will If you wish we will go to Carrington There we shall be perfectly happy together away in beautiful Devonshire I know you want to go there for the shooting Owen she said quietly yet regarding me somewhat strangely I thought You have asked mister Marlowe With your permission dearest But her face changed and she sighed slightly In an instant I recollected the admission that they had either met before or at least they knew something concerning each other Perhaps you do not desire to entertain company yet I said quickly Very well I ll ask your father he and I can have some sport together Owen she said at last turning her fair face again to mine would you think it very very strange of me after all that you have done at beautiful old Carrington if I told you that I well that I do not exactly like the place This rather surprised me for she had hitherto been full of admiration of the fine well preserved relic of the Elizabethan age Dearest if you do not care for Carrington we will not go there We can either live at Wilton Street or travel I m tired of travelling dear she declared Ah so tired So if you are content let us live in Wilton Street Carrington is so huge When we were there I always felt lost in those big old rooms and long echoing corridors But your own rooms that I ve had redecorated and furnished are smaller I said I admit that the old part of the house is very dark and weird full of ghosts of other times There are a dozen or more legends concerning it as you know Yes I read them in the guide book to Devon Some are distinctly quaint are they not Some are tragic also especially the story of little Lady Holbrook who was so brutally killed by the Roundheads because she refused to reveal the whereabouts of her husband I said Poor little lady sighed Sylvia But that is not mere legend it is historical fact Well I said if you do not care for Carrington if it is too dull for you we ll live in London Personally I too should soon grow tired of a country life and yet how could I grow tired of life with you my own darling at my side And how could I either Owen she asked kissing me fondly With you no place can ever be dull It is not the dulness I dread but other things What things Catastrophe of what kind I know not But I have been seized with a kind of instinctive dread For a few moments I was silent my arm still about her neat waist This sudden depression of hers was not reassuring Try and rid yourself of the idea dearest I urged presently You have nothing to fear We may both have enemies but they will not now dare to attack us Remember I am now your husband And I your wife Owen she said with a sweet love look Then with a heavy sigh she gazed thoughtfully away with her eyes fixed upon the darkening sea and added I only fear dearest for your sake I was silent again Sylvia I said slowly at last have you learnt anything anything fresh which has awakened these strange apprehensions of yours No she faltered nothing exactly fresh It is only a strange and unaccountable dread which has seized me a dread of impending disaster Forget it I urged endeavouring to laugh All your fears are now without foundation dearest Now we are wedded we will fearlessly face the world together I have no fear when I am at your side Owen she replied looking at me pale and troubled But when we are parted I I always fear The day before yesterday I was full of apprehension all the time you had gone to York I felt that something was to happen to you Really dear I said smiling you make me feel quite creepy Don t allow your mind to run on the subject Try and think of something else But I can t she declared That s just it I only wish I could rid myself of this horrible feeling of insecurity We are perfectly secure I assured her My enemies are now aware that I m quite wide awake And in a few brief sentences I explained my curious meeting with the Frenchman Delanne The instant I described him his stout body his grey pointed beard his gold pince nez his amethyst ring she sat staring at me white to the lips Why she gasped I know The description is exact And and you say he saw my father in Manchester He actually rode away in the same cab as Reckitt Impossible You must have dreamt it all Owen No dearest I said quite calmly It all occurred just as I have repeated it to you And he really entered the taxi with Reckitt He said too that he knew my father eh He did She held her breath Her eyes were staring straight before her her breath came and went quickly and she gripped the wooden post to steady herself for she swayed forward suddenly and I stretched out my hand fearing lest she should fall What I had told her seemed to stagger her It revealed something of intense importance to her something which to me remained hidden It was still a complete enigma CHAPTER TWENTY THE STRANGER IN THE RUE DE RIVOLI From Scarborough we had gone up to the Highlands spending a fortnight at Grantown a week at Blair Atholl returning south through Callander and the Trossachs one of the most glorious autumns I had ever spent Ours was now a peaceful uneventful life careless of the morrow and filled with perfect love and concord I adored my young beautiful wife and I envied no man I had crushed down all feelings of misgivings that had hitherto so often arisen within me for I felt confident in Sylvia s affection She lived only for me possessing me body and soul Not a pair in the whole of England loved each other with a truer or more fervent passion Our ideas were identical and certainly I could not have chosen a wife more fitted for me even though she rested beneath such a dark cloud of suspicion I suppose some who read this plain statement of fact will declare me to have been a fool But to such I would reply that in your hearts the flame of real love has never yet burned You may have experienced what you have fondly believed to have been love a faint flame that has perhaps flickered for a time and dying out has long been forgotten Only if you have really loved a woman loved her with that all consuming passion that arises within a man once in his whole lifetime when he meets his affinity can you understand why I made Sylvia my wife I had the car brought up to meet us in Perth and with it Sylvia and I had explored all the remotest beauties of the Highlands We ran up as far north as Inverness and around to Oban delighting in all the beauties of the heather clad hills the wild moors the autumn tinted glades and the broad unruffled lochs Afterwards we went round the Trossachs and motored back to London through Carlisle the Lakes North Wales and the Valley of the Wye the most charming of all motor runs in England Afterwards Sylvia wanted to do some shopping and we went over to Paris for ten days There while at the Meurice her father who chanced to be passing through Paris on his way from Brussels to Lyons came unexpectedly one evening and dined with us in our private salon Pennington was just as elegant and epicurean as ever He delighted in the dinner set before him the hotel of course being noted for its cooking That evening we were a merry trio I had not seen my father in law since the morning of our marriage when I had called and found him confined to his bed Therefore we had both a lot to relate to him regarding our travels I too have been moving about incessantly he remarked as he poised his wine glass in his hand regarding the colour of its contents I was in Petersburg three weeks ago I m interested in some telegraph construction works there We ve just secured a big Government contract to lay a new line across Siberia I ve written to you half a dozen times remarked his daughter but you never replied I ve never had your letters child he said Where did you address them Two I sent to the Travellers Club here Another I sent to the Hotel de France in Petersburg Ah I was at the Europe he laughed I find their cooking better Their sterlet is even better than the Hermitage at Moscow Jules the chef was at Cubat s in the Nevski for years Pennington always gauged a hotel by the excellence of its chef He told us of tiny obscure places in Italy which he knew where the rooms were carpetless and comfortless but where the cooking could vie with the Savoy or Carlton in London He mentioned the Giaponne in Leghorn the Tazza d Oro in Lucca and the Vapore in Venice of all three of which I had had experience and I fully corroborated what he said He was a man who ate his strawberries with a quarter of a liqueur glass of maraschino thrown over them and a slight addition of pepper and he always mixed his salads himself Perhaps you think me very whimsical he laughed across the table but really good cooking makes so much difference to life I told him that as an Englishman I preferred plainly cooked food Which is usually heavy and indigestible I fear he declared What now could be more indigestible than our English roast beef and plum pudding eh My own thoughts were however running in an entirely different channel and when presently Sylvia who looked a delightful picture in ivory chiffon and wearing the diamond necklet I had given her as one of her wedding presents rose and left us to our cigars I said suddenly I say Pennington do you happen to know a stout grey bearded Frenchman who wears gold rimmed glasses a man named Pierre Delanne Delanne he repeated No I don t recollect the name I saw him in Manchester I exclaimed He was at the Midland and said he knew you and also Sylvia In Manchester Was he at the Midland while I was there Yes He was dressed in black with a silk hat and wore on his finger a great amethyst ring a rather vulgar looking ornament Pennington s lips were instantly pressed together Ah he exclaimed almost with a start I think I know who you mean His beard is pointed and his eyes rather small and shining He has the air of a bon vivant and speaks English extremely well He wears the amethyst on the little finger of his left hand Exactly And to you he called himself Pierre Delanne eh Yes What is his real name then Who knows I ve heard that he uses half a dozen different aliases replied my father in law Then you know him Well not very well was Pennington s response in a rather strange voice I thought Did he say anything regarding myself Only that he had seen you in Manchester When did you see him last Well I said as a matter of fact he met me in London the same night and I fancy I have caught sight of him twice since The first occasion was a fortnight ago in Princes Street Edinburgh when I saw him coming forth from the North British Hotel with another man also a foreigner They turned up Princes Street and then descended the steps to the station before I could approach sufficiently close I was walking with Sylvia so could not well hasten after them The second occasion was yesterday when I believe I saw him in a taxi passing us as we drove out to tea at Armenonville Did he see you asked Pennington quickly I think so I fancy he recognized me Did Sylvia see him he asked almost breathlessly No Ah and he seemed to breathe again more freely Apparently he is not a very great friend of yours I ventured to remark No he isn t and if I were you Biddulph I would avoid him like the plague He is not the kind of person desirable as a friend You understand I gathered from his conversation that he was something of an adventurer I said That s just it Myself I always avoid him he replied Then he turned the conversation into a different channel He congratulated me upon our marriage and told me how Sylvia when they had been alone together for a few moments before dinner had declared herself supremely happy I only hope that nothing may occur to mar your pleasant lives my dear fellow he said slowly knocking the ash from his cigar In the marriage state one never knows whether adversity or prosperity lies before one I hope I shall meet with no adversity I said I hope not for Sylvia s sake he declared What is for Sylvia s sake asked a cheery voice and as we both looked up in surprise we found that she had re entered noiselessly and was standing laughing mischievously by the open door It is so dull being alone that I ve ventured to come back I don t mind the smoke in the least Why of course darling I cried jumping from my chair and pulling forward an arm chair for her I saw that it was a bright night outside and that the autos with their sparkling lights like shooting stars were passing and repassing with honking horns up and down the Rue de Rivoli For a moment she stood at my side by the window looking down into the broad thoroughfare below Then a second later she suddenly cried Why look Owen Do you see that man with the short dark overcoat standing under the lamp over there I ve seen him several times to day Do you know he seems to be watching us Watching you cried her father starting to his feet and joining us The long wooden sun shutters were closed so on opening the windows which led to the balcony we could see between the slats without being observed from outside I looked at the spot indicated by my wife and then saw on the other side of the way a youngish looking man idly smoking a cigarette and gazing in the direction of the Place de la Concorde as though expecting some one I could not distinguish his features yet I saw that he wore brown boots and that the cut of his clothes and the shape of his hat were English Where have you seen him before I asked of her I first met him when I came out of Lentheric s this morning Then again when we lunched at the Volnay he was standing at the corner of the Rue de la Paix and the Rue Daunou He followed us in the Rue Royale later on And now he seems to have mounted guard outside eh I remarked somewhat puzzled Why did you not tell me this before I did not wish to cause you any anxiety Owen was her simple reply while her father asked Do you know the fellow Ever seen him before Sylvia Never in my life she declared It s rather curious isn t it Very I said And as we all three watched we saw him move away a short distance and join a taller man who came from the direction he had been looking For a few moments they conversed Then the new comer crossed the road towards us and was lost to sight In a few seconds a ragged old man a cripple approached the mysterious watcher with difficulty and said something to him as he passed That cripple is in the business cried Pennington who had been narrowly watching He s keeping observation and has told him something Some deep game is being played here Biddulph I wonder why they are watching I asked somewhat apprehensive of the coming evil that had been so long predicted Father and daughter exchanged curious glances It seemed to me as though a startling truth had dawned upon them both I stood by in silence It is certainly distinctly unpleasant to be watched like this providing of course that Sylvia has not made a mistake Pennington said I have made no mistake she declared quickly I ve been much worried about it all day but did not like to arouse Owen s suspicions and I saw by her face that she was in dead earnest At the same moment however a light tap was heard upon the door and a waiter opened it bowing as he announced Monsieur Pierre Delanne to see Monsieur Biddulph Great Heavens Sylvia cried Pennington standing pale faced and open mouthed It s Guertin He must not discover that I am in Paris Then turning to me in fear he implored Save me from this meeting Biddulph Save me if you value your wife s honour I beg of you I ll explain all afterwards Only save me CHAPTER TWENTY ONE DESCRIBES AN UNWELCOME VISIT Pennington s sudden fear held me in blank surprise Ere I could reply to him he had slipped through the door which led into my bedroom closing it after him just as Delanne s stout figure and broad good humoured face appeared in the doorway Ah he exclaimed Meester Biddulph and he bowed politely over my hand Then turning to Sylvia who stood pale and rigid he put forth his hand and also bowed low over hers saying in English My respects and heartiest congratulations to madame His quick eyes wandered around the room then he added Meester Pennington is here where is he I am here to speak with him Pennington was here I replied but he has gone Then he only went out this moment I must see him He is in the hotel my visitor exclaimed quickly I suppose he is I replied rather faintly we had better ask the waiter He is not stopping here He merely came to night to dine with us Of course said Delanne He arrived by the two point thirty seven train from Bruxelles went to the Hotel Dominici near the Place Vendome sent you a petit bleu and arrived here at six point thirty I am here because I wish to see him most particularly I was in Orleans when the news of my friend s arrival in Paris was telephoned to me I have only just arrived I opened the door leading to my bedroom and called my father in law but there was no response In an instant Delanne dashed past me and in a few seconds had searched the suite Ah of course he cried noticing that the door of my wife s room led back to the main corridor my friend has avoided me He has passed out by this way Still he must be in the hotel He hurried back to the salon and opening the shutters took off his hat Was it some signal to the watchers outside Ere I could reach his side however he had replaced his hat and was re entering the room Phew this place is stifling hot my dear friend he said I wonder you do not have the windows open for a little Sylvia had stood by in silence I saw by her face that the Frenchman s sudden appearance had caused her the greatest alarm and dismay If Delanne was her father s friend why did the latter flee in such fear Why had he implored me to save him From what The Frenchman seemed highly disappointed for finding the waiter in the corridor he asked him in French which way the Englishman had fled The waiter however declared that he had seen nobody in the corridor a reply which sorely puzzled Delanne Where is he he demanded of Sylvia I have no idea was her faltering reply He simply went into the next room a few moments ago And slipped out in an endeavour to make his exit eh asked the man with a short harsh laugh I quite expected as much That is why I intended to have a straight business talk with him He is in no mood to talk business just now said my wife and then and only then did I recollect that this man was the associate of the assassin Reckitt This fact alone aroused my antagonism towards him Surely I was glad that Pennington had got away if as it seemed he did not wish to meet his unwelcome visitor He shall talk business cried the Frenchman and very serious business Then turning he hurried along the corridor in the direction of the main staircase and disappeared What does all this mean I asked Sylvia who still stood there pale and panting I I don t know Owen she gasped Then rushing across to the window she looked out That man has gone she cried I I knew he was watching but had no idea of the reason He was evidently watching for your father I said He was watching us you and I not him We heard two men pass the door quickly One of them exclaimed in French See The window at the end It would be easy to get from there to the roof of the next house Yes cried his companion He has evidently gone that way We must follow Hark I said Listen to what they are saying Delanne is following your father He is his worst enemy she said simply Do you not remember that he was watching him in Manchester The fact that he was an associate of Reckitt puzzled me I felt highly resentful that the fellow should have thus intruded upon my privacy and broken up my very pleasant evening He had intruded himself upon me once before causing me both annoyance and chagrin I looked forth into the corridor and there saw the figures of two men in the act of getting through the window at the end while a waiter and a femme de chambre stood looking on in surprise Who is that man I asked of Sylvia as I turned back into our salon His real name is Guertin she replied He told me that he knew you Perhaps she laughed just a trifle uneasily I thought I only know that he is my father s enemy He is evidently here to hunt him down and to denounce him As what But she only shrugged her shoulders Next instant I saw that I had acted wrongly in asking Sylvia to expose her own father whatever his faults might have been Again somebody rushed past the door and then back again to the head of the staircase The whole of the quiet aristocratic hotel seemed to have suddenly awakened from its lethargy Indeed a hue and cry seemed to have been started after the man who had until a few moments before been my guest What could this mean Had it not been for the fact that Guertin or Delanne as he called himself was a friend of the assassin Reckitt I would have believed him to have been an agent of the surete We heard shouting outside the window at the end of the corridor It seemed as though a fierce chase had begun after the fugitive Englishman for yet another man a thin respectably dressed mechanic had run along and slipped out of the window with ease as though acquired by long practice I too ran to the window and looked out But all I could see in the night was a bewildering waste of roofs and chimneys extending along the Rue de Rivoli towards the Louvre I could only distinguish one of the pursuers outlined against the sky Then I returned to where Sylvia was standing pale and breathless Her face was haggard and drawn and I knew of the great tension her nerves must be undergoing Her father was certainly no coward Fearing that he could not escape by either the front or back door of the hotel his mind had been quickly made up and he had made his exit by that window taking his chance to hide and avoid detection on those many roofs in the vicinity The position was to me extremely puzzling I could not well press Sylvia to tell me the truth concerning her father for I had noticed that she always had shielded him as was natural for a daughter after all Was he an associate of Reckitt and Forbes as I had once suspected Yet if he were why should Delanne be his enemy for he certainly was Reckitt s intimate friend Sylvia was filled with suppressed excitement She also ran along the corridor and peered out of the window at the end Then apparently satisfied that her father had avoided meeting Delanne she returned and stood again silent her eyes staring straight before her as though dreading each second to hear shouts of triumph at the fugitive s detection I saw the manager and remonstrated with him I was angry that my privacy should thus be disturbed by outsiders Monsieur told the clerk that he was a friend he replied politely Therefore he gave permission for him to be shown upstairs I had no idea of such a contretemps or such a regrettable scene as this I saw he was full of regret for the whole hotel seemed startled and guests were asking each other what had occurred to create all that hubbub For an hour we waited but Delanne did not return He and the others had gone away over the roofs on what seemed to be an entirely fruitless errand Were they the police I heard a lady ask anxiously of a waiter No madame we think not They are strangers and entirely unknown Sylvia also heard the man s reply and exclaimed I hope my father has successfully escaped his enemies It was however a very narrow shave If they had seen him they would have shot him dead and afterwards declared it to have been an accident Surely not I cried That would have been murder Of course But they are desperate and they would have wriggled out of it somehow That was why I feared for him But thank Heaven he is evidently safe And she turned from the window that looked forth into the Rue de Rivoli and then made an excuse to go to her room I saw that she was greatly perturbed Her heart beat quickly and her face once pale as death was now flushed crimson How your father got away so rapidly was simply marvellous I declared Why scarcely ten seconds elapsed from the time he closed that door to Delanne s appearance on the threshold Yes But he instantly realized his peril and did not hesitate I am sorry dearest that this exciting incident should have so upset our evening I said kissing her upon the brow for she now declared herself much fatigued When you have gone to your room I shall go downstairs and learn what I can about the curious affair Your father s enemies evidently knew of his arrival from Brussels for Delanne admitted that word of it was telephoned to Orleans and he came to Paris at once Yes he admitted that she said hurriedly But do not let us speak of it My father has got away in safety For me that is all sufficient Good night Owen dear And she kissed me fondly Good night darling I said returning her sweet caress and then when she had passed from the room I seized my hat and descended the big flight of red carpeted stairs bent on obtaining some solution of the mystery of that most exciting and curious episode CHAPTER TWENTY TWO MORE MYSTERY Nothing definite however could I gather from the hotel people They knew nothing and seemed highly annoyed that such an incident should occur in their quiet and highly aristocratic house Next day Sylvia waited for news of her father but none came Delanne called about eleven o clock in the morning and had a brief interview with her in private What passed between them I know not save that the man whose real name was Guertin met me rather coldly and afterwards bade me adieu I hated the fellow He was always extremely polite always just a little sarcastic and yet was he not the associate of the man Reckitt I wished to leave Paris and return to London but Sylvia appeared a little anxious to remain She seemed to expect some secret communication from her father Thank Heaven she said on the day following Delanne s call father has escaped them That was surely a daring dash he made He knew that they intended to kill him But I don t understand I said Do you mean they would kill him openly Of course They have no fear Their only fear is while he remains alive But the law would punish them No it would not she responded shaking her head gravely They would contrive an accident Well I said he has evaded them and we must be thankful for that Do you expect to hear from him Yes she replied I shall probably receive a message to night That is why I wish to remain Owen I wonder she added rather hesitatingly I wonder whether you would consider it very strange of me if I asked you to let me go out to night at ten o clock alone Well I rather fear your going out alone and unprotected at that hour darling I responded Ah have no fear whatever for me I shall be safe enough They will not attempt anything just now I am quite confident of that I I want to go forth alone for an hour or so Oh well if it is your distinct wish how can I refuse dear Ah she cried putting her arm fondly about my neck I knew you would not refuse me I shall go out just before ten and I will be back long before midnight You will excuse my absence won t you Certainly I said And thus it was arranged Her request I admit puzzled me greatly and also caused me considerable fear My past experience had aroused within me a constant phantom of suspicion We lunched at the Ritz and in the afternoon took a taxi into the Bois where we spent an hour upon a seat in one of the by paths of that beautiful wood of the Parisians On our return to the hotel Sylvia was all eagerness for a message but there was none Ah he is discreet she exclaimed to me when the concierge had given her a negative reply He fears to send me word openly At ten o clock that night however she had exchanged her dinner gown for a dark stuff dress and with a small black hat and a boa about her neck she came to kiss me I won t be very long dearest she said cheerily I ll get back the instant I can Don t worry after me I shall be perfectly safe I assure you But recollections of Reckitt and his dastardly accomplice arose within me and I hardly accepted her assurance even though I made pretence of so doing For a few moments I held her in my arms tenderly then releasing her she bade me au revoir merrily and we descended into the hall together A taxi was called and I heard her direct the driver to go to the Boulevard Pereire Then waving her hand from the cab window she drove away Should I follow To spy upon her would be a mean action It would show a lack of confidence and would certainly irritate and annoy her Yet was she not in peril Had she not long ago admitted herself to be in some grave and mysterious danger I had only a single moment in which to decide Somehow I felt impelled to follow and watch that she came to no harm yet at the same time I knew that it was not right She was my wife and I dearly loved her and trusted her If discovered my action would show her that I was suspicious Still I felt distinctly apprehensive and it was that apprehension which caused me a second later to seize my hat and walking out of the hotel hail a passing taxi and drive quickly to the quiet highly respectable boulevard to which she had directed her driver I suppose it was perhaps a quarter of an hour later when we turned into the thoroughfare down the centre of which runs the railway in a deep cutting The houses were large ones let out in fine flats the residences mostly of the professional and wealthier tradesman classes We went along until presently I caught sight of another taxi standing at the kerb Therefore I dismissed mine and keeping well in the shadow sauntered along the boulevard now quiet and deserted With great precaution I approached the standing taxi on the opposite side of the way There was nobody within It was evidently awaiting some one and as it was the only one in sight I concluded that it must be the same which Sylvia had taken from the hotel Some distance further on I walked when before me I recognized her neat figure and almost a moment afterwards saw her disappear into a large doorway which was in complete darkness the doorway of what seemed to be an untenanted house I halted quickly and waited yet almost ashamed of myself for spying thus A moment later I saw that having believed herself unobserved she struck a match but for what reason did not seem apparent She appeared to be examining the wall She certainly was not endeavouring to open the door From the distance however I was unable to distinguish very plainly The vesta burned out and she threw it upon the ground Then she hurriedly retraced her steps to where she had left her cab and I was compelled to bolt into a doorway in order to evade her She passed quite close to me and when she had driven away I emerged and walking to the doorway also struck a light and examined the same stone wall At first I could discover nothing but after considerable searching my eyes at last detected a dark smudge as though something had been obliterated It was a cryptic sign in lead pencil and apparently she had drawn her hand over it to remove it but had not been altogether successful Examining it closely I saw that the sign as originally scrawled upon the smooth stone was like two crescents placed back to back while both above and below rough circles had been drawn The marks had evidently some prearranged meaning one which she understood It was a secret message from her father without a doubt At risk of detection by some agent of police I made a further close examination of the wall and came upon two other signs which had also been hurriedly obliterated one of three double triangles and another of two oblongs and a circle placed in conjunction But there was no writing nothing indeed to convey any meaning to the uninitiated The wall of that dark entry however was no doubt the means of an exchange of secret messages between certain unknown persons The house was a large one and had been let out in flats as were its neighbours but for some unaccountable reason perhaps owing to a law dispute it now remained closed I was puzzled as to which of the three half obliterated signs Sylvia had sought But I took notice of each and then walked back in the direction whence I had come I returned at once to the hotel but my wife had not yet come back This surprised me And I was still further surprised when she did not arrive until nearly one o clock in the morning Yet she seemed very happy unusually so Where had she been after receiving that secret message I wondered Yet I could not question her lest I should betray my watchfulness I m so sorry to have left you alone all this long time Owen she said as she entered the room and came across to kiss me But it was quite unavoidable Is all well I inquired Quite was her reply My father is already out of France That was all she would vouchsafe to me Still I saw that she was greatly gratified at the knowledge of his escape from his mysterious enemies The whole situation was extraordinary Why should this man Delanne the friend of Reckitt and no doubt a member of a gang of blackmailers and assassins openly pursue him to the death It was an entire enigma I could discern no light through the veil of mystery which had all along so completely enshrouded Pennington and his daughter Still I resolved to put aside all apprehensions Why should I trouble I loved Sylvia with all my heart and with all my soul She was mine What more could I desire Next evening we returned to Wilton Street She had suddenly expressed a desire to leave Paris perhaps because she did not wish to again meet her father s enemy that fat Frenchman Guertin For nearly a month we lived in perfect happiness frequently visiting the Shuttleworths for the day and going about a good deal in town She urged me to go to Carrington to shoot but knowing that she did not like the old place I made excuses and remained in London Father is in Roumania she remarked to me one morning when she had been reading her letters at the breakfast table He sends his remembrances to you from Bucharest You have never been there I suppose I m extremely fond of the place There is lots of life and the Roumanians are always so very hospitable No I said I ve never been to Bucharest unfortunately though I ve been in Constanza which is also in Roumania Remember me to your father when you write won t you Certainly He wonders whether you and I would care to go out there for a month or two In winter Winter is the most pleasant time It is the season in Bucharest As you please dearest I replied I am entirely in your hands as you know I laughed That s awfully sweet of you Owen she declared You are always indulging me just like the spoilt child I am Because I love you I replied softly placing my hand upon hers and looking into her wonderful eyes She smiled contentedly and I saw in those eyes the genuine love look the expression which a woman can never feign Thus the autumn days went past happy days of peace and joy Sylvia delighted in the theatre and we went very often while on days when it was dry and the sun shone I took her motoring to Brighton to Guildford to Tunbridge Wells or other places on the well known roads out of London The clouds which had first marred our happiness had now happily been dispelled and the sun of life and love shone upon us perpetually Sometimes I wondered whether that ideal happiness was not too complete to last In the years I had lived I had become a pessimist I feared a too complete ideal The realization of our hopes is always followed by a poignant despair In this world there is no cup of sweetness without dregs of bitterness The man who troubles after the to morrow creates trouble for himself while he who is regardless of the future is like an ostrich burying its head in the sand at sign of disaster Still each of us who marry fondly believe ourselves to be the one exception to the rule And perhaps it is only human that it should be so I like you my reader believed that my troubles were over and that all the lowering clouds had drifted away They were however only low over the horizon and were soon to reappear Ah how differently would I have acted had I but known what the future the future of which I was now so careless held in store for me One night we had gone in the car to the Coliseum Theatre for Sylvia was fond of variety performances as a change from the legitimate theatre As we sat in the box I thought though I could not be certain that she made some secret signal with her fan to somebody seated below amid the crowded audience My back had been turned for a moment and on looking round I felt convinced that she had signalled It was on the tip of my tongue to refer to it yet I hesitated fearing lest she might be annoyed I trusted her implicitly and after all I might easily have mistaken a perfectly natural movement for a sign of recognition Therefore I laughed at my own foolish fancy and turned my attention again to the performance At last the curtain fell and as we stood together amid the crush in the vestibule the night having turned out wet I left her to go in search of our carriage I suppose I was absent about two or three minutes but on my return I could not find her She had vanished as completely as though the earth had swallowed her up I waited until the theatre was entirely empty I described her to the attendants and I had a chat with the smart and highly popular manager but no one had seen her She had simply disappeared I was frantic full of the wildest dread as to what had occurred How madly I acted I scarcely knew At last seeing to remain longer was useless now that the theatre had closed I jumped into the brougham and drove with all haste to Wilton Street No mister Owen replied Browning to my breathless inquiry madam has not yet returned I brushed past him and entered the study Upon my writing table there lay a note addressed to me I recognized the handwriting in an instant and with trembling fingers tore open the envelope What I read there staggered me CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IN FULL CRY The amazing letter which I held in my nerveless fingers had been hurriedly scribbled on a piece of my wife s own notepaper and read DEAR OWEN I feel that our marriage was an entire mistake I have grossly deceived you and I dare not hope ever for your forgiveness nor dare I face you to answer your questions I know that you love me dearly as I too have loved you yet for your own sake and perhaps for mine also it is far best that we should keep apart I deeply regret that I have been the means of bringing misfortune and unhappiness and sorrow upon you but I have been the tool of another In shame and deepest humiliation I leave you and if you will grant one favour to an unhappy and penitent woman you will never seek to discover my whereabouts It would be quite useless To night I leave you in secret never to meet you again Accept my deepest regret and do not let my action trouble you I am not worthy of your love Good bye Your unhappy SYLVIA I stood staring at the uneven scribbled lines blurred as they were by the tears of the writer What had happened Why had she so purposely left me Why had she made that signal from the theatre box to her accomplice She admitted having grossly deceived me and that she was unworthy What did she mean In what manner had she deceived me Had she a secret lover That idea struck me suddenly and staggered me In some of her recent actions I read secrecy and suspicion On several occasions lately she had been out shopping alone and one afternoon about a week before she had not returned to dress for dinner until nearly eight o clock Her excuse had been a thin one but unsuspicious I had passed it by Had I really been a fool to marry her after all I knew Marlowe s opinion of our marriage though he had never expressed it That she had been associated with a shady lot had all along been apparent The terrors of that silent house in Porchester Terrace remained only too fresh within my memory That night I spent in a wild fever of excitement No sleep came to my eyes and I think Browning to whom I said nothing believed that I had taken leave of my senses The faithful old servant did not retire for at five in the morning I found him seated dozing in a chair outside in the hall tired out by the watchful vigil he had kept over me I tried in vain to decide what to do I wanted to find Sylvia to induce her to reveal the truth to me and to allay her fear of my reproaches I loved her aye no man in all the world ever loved a woman better Yet she had of her own accord because of her own shame at her deception bade farewell and slipped away into the great ocean of London life Morning dawned at last cold grey and foggy one of those dispiriting mornings of late autumn which the Londoner knows so well Still I knew not how to act I wanted to discover her to bring her back and to demand of her finally the actual truth All the mystery of those past months had sent my brain awhirl I had an impulse to go to the police and reveal the secret of that closed house in Porchester Terrace Yet had she not implored me not to do so Why There was only one reason She feared exposure herself No Ten thousand times no I would not believe ill of her Can any man who really loves a woman believe ill of her Love is blind it is true and the scales never fall from the eyes while true affection lasts And so I put suspicion from my mind and swallowed the cup of coffee Browning put before me The old man the friend of my youth knew that his mistress had not returned and saw how greatly I was distressed Yet he was far too discreet a servant to refer to it I entered the drawing room and there in the grey light facing me stood the fine portrait of my well beloved in a silver frame the one she had had taken at Scarborough a week after our marriage I drew it from its frame and gazed for a long time upon it Then I put it into an envelope and placed it in my pocket Soon after ten o clock I returned to the Coliseum and showed the portrait to a number of the attendants as that of a lady who was missing All of them both male and female gazed upon the picture but nobody recognized her as having been seen before The manager whom I had seen on the previous night sympathized with me and lent me every assistance One after another of the staff he called into his big office on the first floor but the reply was always the same At length a smart page boy entered and on being shown the portrait at once said to the manager Why sir that s the lady who went away with the gentleman who spoke to me Who was he I demanded eagerly What did he say What was he like Well sir it was like this replied the boy About a quarter of an hour before the curtain fell last night I was out in the vestibule when a tall dark gentleman with his hair slightly grey and no moustache came up to me with a lady s cloak in his hand a dark blue one He told me that when the audience came out a fair young lady would come up to me for the cloak as she wanted to get away very quickly and did not want to wait her turn at the cloak room There was a car a big grey car waiting for her outside Then her flight was all prepared I exclaimed What was the man like He struck me as being a gentleman yet his clothes seemed shabby and ill fitting Indeed he had a shabby genteel look as though he were a bit down on his luck He was in evening clothes No sir In a suit of brown tweeds Well what happened then I waited till the curtain fell and then I stood close to the box office with the cloak over my arm There was a big crush as it was then raining hard Suddenly a young lady wearing a cream theatre wrap came up to me hastily and asked me to help her on with the cloak This I did and next moment the man in tweeds joined her I heard him say Come along dear we haven t a moment to lose and then they went out to the car That s all I know sir I was silent for a few moments Who was this secret lover I wondered The lad s statement had come as an amazing revelation to me What kind of car was it I asked A hired car sir replied the intelligent boy I ve seen it here before It comes I think from a garage in Wardour Street You would know the driver I think so sir It was therefore instantly arranged that the lad should go with me round to the garage and there try to find the man who drove the grey car on the previous night In this we were quickly successful On entering the garage there stood muddy and dirty a big grey landaulette which the boy at once identified as the one in which Sylvia had escaped The driver was soon found and he explained that it was true he had been engaged on the previous night by a tall clean shaven gentleman to pick up at the Coliseum He did so and the gentleman entered with a lady Where did you drive them I asked quickly Up the Great North Road to the George Hotel at Stamford about a hundred miles from London I ve only been back about a couple of hours sir The George at Stamford I echoed for I knew the hotel a quiet old fashioned comfortable place much patronized by motorists to and fro on the north road You didn t stay there Only just to get a drink and fill up with petrol I wanted to get back The lady and gentleman were evidently expected and seemed in a great hurry Why Well near Alconbury the engine was misfiring a little and I stopped to open the bonnet When I did so the lady put her head out of the window highly excited and asked how long we were likely to be delayed I told her then I heard her say to the gentleman If they are away before we reach there what shall we do Then they were on their way to meet somebody or other eh Ah that I don t know sir I drew up in the yard of the hotel and they both got out The lady hurried in while the gentleman paid me and gave me something for myself It was then nearly four o clock in the morning I should have been back earlier only I had a puncture the other side of Hatfield and had to put on the Stepney I must go to Stamford I said decisively Then I put something into his palm as well as into that of the page boy and entering a taxi drove back home An hour later I sat beside my own chauffeur as we drove through the steadily falling rain across Hampstead Heath on our hundred mile journey into Lincolnshire We both knew every inch of the road having been over it many times As it was wet police traps were unlikely so having negotiated the narrow road as far as Hatfield we began to let her out past Hitchin and we buzzed on over the broad open road through Stilton village We were hung up at the level crossing at Wansford but about half past three in the afternoon we swept over the brow of the hill beneath the high wall of Burghley Park and saw beneath us the roofs and many spires of quiet old Stamford Ten minutes later we swung into the yard of the ancient George and alighting entered the broad hall with its splendid old oak staircase in search of the manageress She related a rather curious story On the previous night about eleven o clock there arrived by car two well dressed gentlemen who though English conversed together in French They took rooms but did not retire to bed saying that they expected two friends who were motoring and who would arrive in the night They sat over the fire in the lounge while the staff of the hotel all retired save the night boots an old retainer The latter stated that during the night as he passed the door of the lounge he saw through the crack of the door the younger of the two men examining something which shone and sparkled in the light and he thought to be diamonds This struck him as somewhat curious therefore he kept a watchful eye upon the pair One he described as rather stout dark and bald headed the exact description of Pennington and the other description the man afterwards gave to me caused me to feel confident that the second man was none other than the scoundrel Reckitt What further piece of chicanery had they been guilty of I wondered About four in the morning a grey car drove up sir went on the boots and a lady with a dark cloak over her evening dress dashed in and they both rose quickly and welcomed her Then in order that I should not understand they again started talking in some foreign language French I expect it was A few moments later the gentleman came in They welcomed him warmly addressing him by the name of Lewis I saw the bald headed man wring his hand heartily and heard him exclaim By Jove old man you can t think how glad we are to see you back again You must have had a narrow squeak Not another single living man would have acted with the determination and bravery with which you ve acted Only you must be careful Lewis old man deuced careful There are enemies about you know Then the gentleman said I know I m quite aware of my peril Arnold You too had a narrow shave in Paris a short time ago I hear from Sonia Yes laughed the other she acted splendidly But as you say it was a very close thing Have you seen Shuttleworth yet he asked The other said He met me in the Ditches at Southampton two nights ago and told me all that s happened Ah And Sonia has told you the rest I suppose he asked to which the other man replied in the affirmative adding It s a bad job I fear for Owen Biddulph a very bad job for the fellow That was all the conversation that I overheard at that time for they then rang the bell and ordered whisky and sodas And what else did you see or hear I asked eagerly much puzzled by his statement They struck me as rather a suspicious lot sir the man said After I had taken them in their drinks they closed the door and seemed to hold some sort of a consultation While this was going on two men drove up in another car and asked if a mister Winton was here I told him he was for the bald headed gentleman had given the name of Douglas Winton They were at once welcomed and admitted to the conference Rather curious to hold a conference in such a manner and at such an hour I remarked Yes sir It was a secret meeting evidently They all spoke in another language The two men who last arrived were no doubt foreigners Was one of them stout and wore gold rimmed glasses I inquired quickly CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR AN UNFORTUNATE SLIP No sir the boots replied both were youngish men with dark moustaches They wore heavy coats and were in an open car They came from York way and had evidently driven some distance You saw nothing of what went on at their mysterious meeting Well sir the fact is when I had had my suspicions aroused I crept out into the yard and found that I could see into the lounge through the chink between the blind and the window They were all seated round the table the head of which had been taken by the gentleman who had arrived from London with the lady He seemed to be chairman and he talked in a low deliberate and very earnest tone being listened to with greatest interest He evidently related something which amazed them Then a map or plan was placed upon the table and each examined it in turn Afterwards two photographs were produced by mister Winton and handed around the assembly Each man looked long and steadily at the pictures both were of women The young lady present refused to take any part in the discussion and I noticed that she passed on the photographs without comment without even glancing at them Did she appear to be present there against her will I asked breathlessly No not exactly She seemed very friendly with all the gentlemen The two foreigners were strangers to her for she was introduced to them By name Yes sir Miss Sonia Poland I bit my lip Had she already dropped my name and was now passing under an alias Sonia Poland I echoed Was it for the purpose of concealing her identity from the foreigners do you think I asked No sir Because Winton and his companion addressed her as Sonia Poland when she arrived And you believed it to be her real name I suppose it is sir was the man s reply for I fear my manner somewhat mystified him Well and what further did you see at this early morning consultation I asked mindful that his curiosity had no doubt been aroused by sight of something sparkling in the strange visitor s hand The gentleman called mister Lewis wrote out a paper very carefully and handed it round Every one signed it except the lady They asked her to do so but she protested vigorously and the matter was not pressed Then the photograph of a man was shown to the two foreigners and the lady tried to prevent it Curiously enough sir I caught a good sight of it just a head and shoulders and the picture very much resembled you yourself sir Me I cried And they showed it to the two young foreigners eh Yes sir One of them took it and put it into his pocket Then the mysterious mister Lewis as chairman of the meeting seemed to raise a protest The two foreigners gesticulated jabbered away and raised their shoulders a lot I dearly wish I could have made out a word they said Unfortunately I couldn t Only I saw that in mister Lewis s face was a look of fierce determination They at first defied him But at last with great reluctance they handed back the photograph which mister Lewis himself burned on the fire He burned my photograph Yes sir I think it was yours sir but of course I can t be quite positive And what else mister Winton said something whereupon all of them glanced at the door and then at the window One of the foreigners came to the window but did not notice that there was a slight crack through which I could see Then he turned the key in the door After he had returned to his chair the man who had arrived with mister Winton took from his pocket something that shone My heart beat quickly It was a diamond necklet the object I had seen in his hand earlier He passed it round for the admiration of the others who each took it and closely examined it beneath the light all but the young lady She was standing aside near the fireplace watching Now and then she placed her hand to her forehead as though her brain were weary And after that After the necklet had been passed round the elder of the two foreigners wrapped it carefully in his handkerchief and placed it in his pocket Then mister Lewis gave them a long address emphasizing his words with his hand and they listened to him without uttering a word Suddenly mister Winton sprang up and wrung his hand afterwards making what appeared to be some highly complimentary remarks for mister Lewis smiled and bowed to the assembly who afterwards rose Then the young lady rushed up to mister Lewis and implored him to do something but he refused She stood before him pale faced and determined Her eyes seemed starting from her head She seemed like one horrified But he placed his hand tenderly upon her shoulder and uttered some quick low words which instantly calmed her Very shortly after that the party broke up and the door was re opened The two foreigners hurriedly swallowed a liqueur glass of brandy each and then passing into the yard wished their companions adieu and drove away in their car in the direction of London Carrying with them the diamond necklet which the other man had brought there Yes sir And what became of the young lady I inquired very anxiously She first had a long and private conversation with the gentleman named Winton the bald headed man This it will be remembered was the person whose description tallied exactly with that of her father They went outside together said the boots out into the yard and there conversed alone in half whispers Afterwards they rejoined the others mister Lewis seemed very annoyed with her nevertheless after a cup of tea each about half past five the four of them got into the car in which Winton had arrived and drove away in the direction of Grantham Winton gave me a sovereign for myself an unusually generous gift I can assure you sir he laughed And now what is your own opinion concerning them I asked Why there can only be one opinion sir that they are wrong uns I felt half a mind to tell mister Pearson the police constable who lives across in Water Lane but I didn t like to without consulting somebody And I didn t want to wake up the manageress Ah and it may now be too late Cross said the lady in question who had been standing by all the time Then addressing me she said The whole affair seemed most mysterious sir therefore I went round and saw the inspector of police this morning and told him briefly of our strange visitors I m rather glad they re gone for one never likes unpleasantness in a hotel Yet of course the fault cannot be that of the hotel keeper if he takes in an undesirable Of course not But what view did the inspector hold Inspector Deane merely expressed the opinion that they were suspicious persons that s all So they seem to have been I remarked without satisfying her as to who I really was My story there was that I had business relations with mister Lewis and had followed him there in the hope of catching him up We were in the manageress s room a cosy apartment in the back of the quaint old hostelry when a waitress came and announced Inspector Deane The official was at once shown in whereupon he said abruptly The truth is out Miss Hammond regarding your strange visitors of last night And he glanced inquiringly at myself You can speak openly before this gentleman she said noticing his hesitation The fact is a circular telegram has just been sent out from Scotland Yard saying that by the express from Edinburgh due at King s Cross at ten point forty five last night the Archduchess Marie Louise niece of the Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria was a passenger She had been staying at Balmoral and travelled south in a special saloon When the luggage came to be collected a dressing case was missing it evidently having been stolen in transit by somebody who had obtained access to the saloon while on the journey The corridor was open between York and London so that the restaurant could be reached and it is believed that the thief or thieves managed to pass in unobserved and throw the bag out upon the line to some confederate awaiting it The bag contained a magnificent diamond necklet a historic heirloom of the Imperial family of the Hapsburgs and is valued at fifty thousand pounds And those people who met here were the thieves gasped the manageress turning instantly pale Without a doubt You see the Great Northern main line runs close by us at Essendine It may be that the thieves were waiting for it near there waiting for it to be dropped out in the darkness All the platelayers along the line are now searching for the bag but we here are certain that the thieves spent the night in Stamford Not the thieves I said The receivers Exactly But the young foreigner has it cried the boots He and his friend set off for London with it Yes They would reach London in time to catch one of the boat trains from Victoria or Charing Cross this morning and by this time they re safely out of the country carrying the necklet with them Ah Scotland Yard is terribly slow But the delay seems to have been caused by the uncertainty of Her Highness as to whether she had actually brought the dressing case with her and she had to telegraph to Balmoral before she could really state that it had been stolen The two men Douglas Winton and his friend came here in a motor car I remarked They had evidently been waiting somewhere near the line in order to pick up the stolen bag Without a doubt sir exclaimed the inspector Their actions here according to what Miss Hammond told me this morning were most suspicious It s a pity that the boots did not communicate with us Yes mister Deane said the man referred to I m very sorry now that I didn t But I felt loath to disturb people at that hour of the morning You took no note of the number of either of the three cars which came I suppose No We have so many cars here that I hardly noticed even what colour they were Ah That s unfortunate Still we shall probably pick up some clue to them along the road Somebody is certain to have seen them or know something about them This gentleman here knows something about them remarked the manageress indicating myself The inspector turned to me in quick surprise and no doubt saw the surprise in my face I I know nothing I managed to exclaim blankly at once realizing the terrible pitfall into which I had fallen But you said you knew mister Lewis the gentleman who acted as president of that mysterious conference Miss Hammond declared in all innocence I think sir added the inspector that the matter is such a grave one that you should at once reveal all you do know You probably overlook the fact that if you persist in silence you may be arrested as an accessory But I know nothing I protested nothing whatever concerning the robbery But you know one of the men said Cross the boots And the lady also without a doubt added the inspector I refuse to be cross examined in this manner by you I retorted in anger yet full of apprehension now that I saw myself suspected of friendship with the gang Well sir then I regret that I must ask you to walk over the bridge with me to the police station I must take you before the superintendent he said firmly But I know nothing I again protested Come with me he said with a grim smile of disbelief That you ll be compelled to prove CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE MORE STRANGE FACTS Compelled against my will to accompany the inspector to the police head quarters in the High Street 
3488-65654-0000	train-other-500	I made a statement a rather lame one I fear I concealed the fact that the lady of the previous night s conference was my wife and explained my visit to Stamford and my inquiries at the George by the fact that I had met the man Lewis abroad
3488-65654-0001	train-other-500	and had had some financial dealings with him which I now suspected were not altogether square So hearing that he had motored to the north
none	none	 I had followed and had inquired at several of the well known motoring hotels for news of him being unsuccessful until I had arrived at Stamford This story would of course not have held water had Miss Hammond the manageress been present 
3488-65654-0002	train-other-500	Happily however she had not accompanied me hence I was able to concoct a somewhat plausible excuse to the local superintendent Then you actually know nothing concerning these people he asked
3488-65654-0003	train-other-500	regarding me shrewdly Nothing beyond the fact of meeting Lewis abroad and very foolishly trusting in his honesty The superintendent smiled I think he regarded me as a bit of a fool Probably I had been
none	none	 They are a clever gang no doubt he declared 
3488-65654-0004	train-other-500	The Archduchess s necklace must have been stolen by some one travelling in the train I ve been on to Scotland Yard by telephone and there seems a suspicion because at Grantham the last stopping place before London a ticket collector boarded the train
none	none	 He was a stranger to the others but they believed that he had been transferred from one or other of the branches to the main line and being in the company s uniform they of course accepted him He collected the tickets en route 
3488-65654-0005	train-other-500	as is sometimes done and at Finsbury Park descended and was lost sight of Here again the busy collectors came and demanded tickets much to the surprise of the passengers and the curious incident was much commented upon
3488-65654-0006	train-other-500	Then the bogus collector was the thief I suppose No doubt He somehow secured the dressing bag and dropped it out at a point between Grantham and Essendine
3488-65654-0007	train-other-500	a spot where he knew his accomplices would be waiting a very neatly planned robbery And by persons who are evidently experts I said Of course replied the grey haired superintendent
3488-65654-0008	train-other-500	The manner in which the diamonds have been quickly transferred from hand to hand and carried out of the country is sufficient evidence of that The gang have now scattered and for aught we know have all crossed the Channel by this time Well I assured him
3488-65654-0009	train-other-500	I know nothing more of the affair than what I have told you If I were an accomplice I should hardly be here making inquiries concerning them I don t know so much about that he replied rather incredulously
3488-65654-0010	train-other-500	Such an action has been known before in order to place the police upon a wrong scent I fear I must ask you to remain here in Stamford until this evening while I make some inquiry into your bona fides sir
none	none	 What I cried You intend to detain me There is no indignity he declared You may go about the town where you will 
3488-65654-0011	train-other-500	providing you do not attempt to leave it
none	none	 I regret but it is my duty to ascertain who and what you are mister Biddulph I had given him my card and he seeing the look of annoyance upon my face added 
3488-65654-0012	train-other-500	I can only express apologies sir But you will see it is my duty You have admitted knowledge of at least one of the mysterious gang Very well I replied reluctantly make what inquiries you will
3488-65654-0013	train-other-500	And I gave him the address of my solicitors and my bankers
3488-65654-0014	train-other-500	Then walking out of the office I strolled down the quiet old High Street into the market place full of evil forebodings Who was this man Lewis or Louis with whom my wife had escaped He was a blackguardly adventurer anyhow
3488-65654-0015	train-other-500	He had addressed her as dear and had been solicitous of her welfare throughout To him she had signalled from her box in the theatre
none	none	 well knowing that he was making secret preparations for her elopement 
3488-65654-0016	train-other-500	Indeed she had written that note and placed it upon my blotting pad before we had gone forth together she well knowing that she would never again re cross my threshold Ah The poignant bitterness of it all had gripped my heart
3488-65654-0017	train-other-500	My cup of unhappiness was now assuredly full How brief had been my joy how quickly my worst fears had been realized About the quiet old world decaying town I wandered hardly knowing whither I went
3488-65654-0018	train-other-500	When every now and then in the fading light I found myself going into the country I turned back mindful of my promise not to leave the place without permission
none	none	 About six I returned to the George and sat beside the fire in the lounge in that selfsame chair where my fugitive wife had sat 
3488-65654-0019	train-other-500	I was eager to renew the chase yet until I received word from the police I was compelled to remain helpless Old Cross the boots became inquisitive
3488-65654-0020	train-other-500	but I evaded his questions and ate my dinner alone in the small cosy coffee room awaiting the reappearance of Inspector Deane I had given my chauffeur liberty till eight o clock but I was all anxiety to drive back to London
3488-65654-0021	train-other-500	Still if I returned what could I do Sylvia and her companions had driven away whither was a mystery The Criminal Investigation Department had already issued an official description of the persons wanted
3488-65654-0022	train-other-500	for while I had been at the police office the inspector had been closely questioning the man Cross and Miss Hammond Already the police drag net was out and the combined police forces of Europe would in an hour or two
3488-65654-0023	train-other-500	be on the watch for Sylvia and her mysterious companions So far as the United Kingdom was concerned sixty thousand officers detectives and constables would be furnished with a complete description
3488-65654-0024	train-other-500	of those who had held that secret consultation The tightest of tight cordons would be drawn Every passenger who embarked at English ports for abroad would be carefully scrutinized by plain clothes men
3488-65654-0025	train-other-500	Every hotel keeper not only in London but in the remote villages and hamlets would be closely questioned as to the identity and recent movements of his guests
3488-65654-0026	train-other-500	Full descriptions of Sylvia and her friends would be cabled to America and the American police would be asked to keep a sharp look out on passengers arriving on all boats from Europe
none	none	 Descriptions would also be sent to the police head quarters in every European capital 
3488-65654-0027	train-other-500	In face of that what more could I do The situation had become unbearable Sylvia s unaccountable action had plunged me into a veritable sea of despair The future seemed blank and hopeless
none	none	 Just before eight o clock I strolled back to the police office and reported myself as it were The superintendent expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the replies he had received from London 
3488-65654-0028	train-other-500	and with apologies gave me leave to depart Inquiry is being made along the roads in every direction from here he said We hear that the three men and the woman called at the Bell at Barnby Moor and had some breakfast
3488-65654-0029	train-other-500	Afterwards they continued northward Barnby Moor I echoed Why that s near Doncaster Yes sir Motorists patronize the place a good deal And is that all that is known I inquired eagerly All at present he said
3488-65654-0030	train-other-500	Therefore I left and returning to the garage mounted the car and with head lamps alight drove out into the pitch darkness in the direction of Grantham
3488-65654-0031	train-other-500	We sped along the broad old coach road for nearly three hours until at last we pulled up before an ancient wayside inn which had been modernized and adapted to twentieth century requirements The manager in reply to my eager questions said it was true that the Doncaster police had been there making inquiries regarding four motorists
3488-65654-0032	train-other-500	three gentlemen and a lady who had called there that morning and had had breakfast in the coffee room The head waiter who had attended them was called and I questioned him I think the manager believed me to be a detective for he was most courteous
3488-65654-0033	train-other-500	and ready to give me all information Yes sir replied the tall slim head waiter They came here in a great hurry and seemed to have come a long distance judging from the way the car was plastered with mud
3488-65654-0034	train-other-500	The lady was very cold for they had an open car and she wore a gentleman s overcoat and a shawl tied around her head The tallest of the gentlemen drove the car They called him Lewis Did you hear them address the lady I asked eagerly
3488-65654-0035	train-other-500	They called her Sonia sir And you say she seemed very fatigued Very She went upstairs and changed her evening gown for a stuff dress which was brought out of the car
3488-65654-0036	train-other-500	Then she came down and joined the others at breakfast They gave you no indication as to their destination I suppose Well sir I think they were returning to London for I heard one of the gentlemen say something about catching the boat train
3488-65654-0037	train-other-500	They may have meant the Harwich boat train from the north I remarked Very likely sir One portion of that train comes through Doncaster in the afternoon to Peterborough and March
3488-65654-0038	train-other-500	while the other comes down to Rugby on the North Western and then goes across to Peterborough by way of Market Harborough Then they may have joined that
none	none	 and if so they would just about be leaving Parkeston Quay by now 
3488-65654-0039	train-other-500	If so the police are certain to spot them laughed the waiter They re wanted for the theft of a princess s jewels they say What should I do It was now long past ten o clock and I could not possibly arrive at Parkeston before early morning
3488-65654-0040	train-other-500	Besides if they had really gone there they would no doubt be arrested The man with the pimply face whose description so closely tallied with that of Reckitt
none	none	 was surely too clever a criminal to run his neck into a noose by going to any port of embarkation 
3488-65654-0041	train-other-500	Therefore I concluded that whatever had been said at table had been said with the distinct object of misleading the waiter The very manner in which the diamonds had been stolen showed a cunning and a daring unsurpassed
none	none	 Such men were certainly not easily trapped My sole thought was of Sylvia I could not bring myself to believe that she had wilfully forsaken her home and her husband Upon her I felt confident some species of blackmail had been levied and she had been forced away from me by reasons beyond her control That incident of the photograph the picture believed to have been of myself which the foreigner tried to secure but which the man Lewis had himself destroyed was incomprehensible What had been intended by the foreigner I gathered all the information I could in the hotel and then after a hasty meal re entered the car and set out upon the dark cold return journey to London Where was Sylvia Who were her mysterious friends And chief of all who was that man Lewis who addressed her in such endearing terms What could possibly be the solution of the mystery CHAPTER TWENTY SIX SOME SENSATIONAL REVELATIONS The days dragged by The papers were full of the robbery declaring that it had been executed so neatly as to betray the hand of experts A gang of Continental thieves was suspected because as a matter of fact a robbery similar in detail had six months before taken place on the night express between Cologne and Berlin In that case also a strange ticket inspector had been seen The stolen property had no doubt been thrown from the train to accomplices Such method was perfectly safe for the thief because unless actually detected in the act of tossing out a bag or parcel no evidence could very well be brought against him Therefore the police and through them the newspapers decided that the same gang was responsible for the theft of the Archduchess s necklace as for the robbery in Germany Myself I read eagerly every line of what appeared in the morning and evening press Many ridiculous theories were put forward by some journalists in working up the story and more than once I found cruel and unfounded reflections cast upon the sole female member of the party my dear wife This was all extremely painful to me all so utterly incomprehensible that as I sat alone in the silence of my deserted home I felt that no further misfortune could fall upon me The iron of despair had entered my very soul Marlowe called one afternoon and I was compelled to make excuse for Sylvia s absence telling him she was down at missus Shuttleworth s You don t look quite yourself old man he had said What s up Oh nothing I laughed faintly I m a bit run down that s all Want a change I suppose I think I shall go abroad I thought your wife had had sufficient of the Continent he remarked Curiously enough he added as he sat back and blew a cloud of cigarette smoke from his lips I thought I saw her the day before yesterday standing on the railway platform at Banbury I was coming down from Birmingham to Oxford and the train slowed down in passing Banbury I happened to be looking out at the time and I could have sworn that I saw her At Banbury I ejaculated leaning forward Yes She was wearing a dark blue dress with a jacket to match and a small dark blue hat She was with an elderly lady and was evidently waiting for a train She gave me the impression that she was starting on a journey How old was her companion Oh she was about forty I should think neatly dressed in black It couldn t have been she I said reflectively My dear Owen missus Biddulph s beauty is too marked for one to be mistaken especially a friend like myself Then you are quite certain it was she eh Jack My tall friend stretched his long legs out on the carpet and replied Well I d have bet a hundred to a penny that it was she She wasn t at home with you on that day was she I was compelled to make a negative reply Then I m certain I saw her old man he declared as he rose and tossed his cigarette end away It was upon my tongue to ask him what he had known of her but I refrained She was my wife and to ask such a question would only expose to him my suspicions and misgivings So presently he went and I was left there wretched in my loneliness and completely mystified The house seemed full of grim shadows now that she the sun of my life had gone out of it Old Browning moved about silent as a ghost watching me I knew and wondering So Sylvia had been seen at Banbury According to Jack she was dressed as though travelling therefore it seemed apparent that she had hidden in that quiet little town until compelled to flee owing to police inquiries Her dress as described by Jack was different to any I had ever seen her wear hence it seemed as though she had disguised herself as much as was possible Her companionship with the elder woman was also somewhat strange My only fear was that the police might recognize her While she remained in one place she would no doubt be safe from detection But if she commenced to travel then most certainly the police would arrest her Fortunately they were not in possession of her photograph yet all along I remained in fear that the manager of the Coliseum might make a statement and this would again connect me with the gang Yes I suppose the reader will dub me a fool to have married Sylvia Well he or she may do so My only plea in extenuation is that I loved her dearly and devotedly My love might have been misplaced of course yet I still felt that in face of all the black circumstances she was nevertheless true to those promises made before the altar I was hers and she was mine Even then with the papers raising a hue and cry after her as well as what I had discovered regarding her elopement I steadfastly refused to believe in her guilt Those well remembered words of affection which had fallen from her lips from time to time I knew had been genuine and the truth That same night I read in the evening paper a paragraph as follows It is understood that the police have obtained an important clue to the perpetrators of the daring theft of the diamond necklet belonging to the Archduchess Marie Louise and that an arrest is shortly expected Some highly sensational revelations are likely I read and re read those significant lines What were the sensational revelations promised Had they any connection with the weird mystery of that closed house in Porchester Terrace I felt that perhaps I was not doing right in refraining from laying before the Criminal Investigation Department the facts of my strange experience in that long closed house In that neglected garden my own grave lay open What bodies of other previous victims lay there interred I recollected that in the metropolis many bodies of murdered persons had been found buried in cellars and in gardens A recent case of the discovery of an unfortunate woman s body beneath the front doorsteps of a certain house in North London was fresh within my mind Truly the night mysteries of London are many and gruesome The public never dream of half the brutal crimes that are committed and never detected Only the police if they are frank will tell you of the many cases in which persons missing are suspected of having been victims of foul play Yet they are mysteries never solved I went across to White s and dined alone I was in no mood for the companionship of friends No one save myself knew that my wife had disappeared Jack suspected something wrong but was not aware of what it exactly was I went down to Andover next day and called upon the Shuttleworths missus Shuttleworth was kind and affable as usual but whether my suspicions were ungrounded or not I thought the rector a trifle brusque in manner as though annoyed by my presence there I recollected what the man Lewis had told his friends that he had seen Shuttleworth down in the Ditches one of the lowest neighbourhoods of Southampton The rector had told him all that had transpired Why was this worthy country rector living the quiet life of a remote Hampshire village in such constant communication with a band of thieves I sat with him in his well remembered study for perhaps an hour But he was a complete enigma Casually I referred to the great jewel theft which was more or less upon every one s tongue I seldom read newspaper horrors he replied puffing at his familiar pipe I saw something in the head lines of the paper but I did not read the details I ve been writing some articles for the Guardian lately and my time has been so fully occupied Was this the truth Or was he merely evading the necessity of discussing the matter He had inquired after Sylvia and I had been compelled to admit that she was away But I did so in such a manner that I implied she was visiting friends Outside the lawn so bright and pleasant in summer now looked damp and dreary littered by the brown drifting leaves of autumn Somehow I read in his grey face a strange expression and detected an eagerness to get rid of me For the first time I found myself an unwelcome visitor at the rectory Have you seen mister Pennington of late I asked presently No not for some time He wrote me from Brussels about a month ago and said that business was calling him to Spain Have you seen him he asked Not very recently I replied vaguely Then again I referred to the great robbery whereat he said Why mister Biddulph you appear as though you can t resist the fascination that mysterious crime has for you I suppose you are an ardent novel reader eh People fond of novels always devour newspaper mysteries I admitted a fondness for healthy and exciting fiction when he laughed saying Well I myself find that nearly half one reads in some of the newspapers now a days may be classed as fiction Even party politics are full of fictions more or less Surely the public must find it very difficult to winnow the truth from all the political lies both spoken and written To me elections are all mere campaigns of untruth And so he again cleverly turned the drift of our conversation About five o clock I left driving back to Andover Junction and arriving at Waterloo in time for dinner I took a taxi at once to Wilton Street but there was no letter from Sylvia She gave no sign And indeed why should she in face of her letter of farewell I dressed and sat down alone to my dinner for the first time in my own dining room since my wife s disappearance Lonely and sad yet filled with fierce hatred of those blackguardly adventurers of whom her own father was evidently one I sat silent while old Browning served the meal with that quiet stateliness which was one of his chief characteristics The old man had never once mentioned his missing mistress yet I saw by the gravity of his pale furrowed face that he was anxious and puzzled As I ate without appetite he chatted to me as had been his habit in my bachelor days for through long years of service ever since I was a lad he had become more a friend than a mere servant From many a boyish scrape he had shielded me and much good advice had he given me in those reckless days of my rather wild youth His utter devotion to my father had always endeared him to me for to him there was no family respected so much as ours and his faithfulness was surely unequalled Perhaps he did not approve of my marriage I held a strong suspicion that he had not Yet old servants are generally apt to be resentful at the advent of a new mistress I was finishing my coffee and thinking deeply Browning having left me alone when suddenly he returned and bending said in his quiet way A gentleman has called mister Owen He wishes to see you very particularly And he handed me a card upon which I saw the name Henri Guertin I sprang to my feet my mind made up in an instant Here was one actually of the gang and I would entrap him in my own house I would compel him to speak the truth under pain of arrest Where is he I asked breathlessly I have shown him into the study He s a foreign gentleman mister Owen Yes I know I said But now don t be alarmed Browning just stay outside in the hall If I ring the bell go straight to the telephone ring up the police station and tell them to send a constable here at once My study door will be locked until the constable arrives You understand Perfectly mister Owen but And the old man hesitated looking at me apprehensively There is nothing whatever to fear I laughed rather harshly perhaps Carry out my orders that s all And then in fierce determination I went along the hall and opening the study door entered closing it behind me and as I stood with my back to it I turned the key and removed it Well M sieur Guertin I exclaimed addressing the stout man in gold pince nez in rather a severe tone and what pray do you want with me CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN A CONTRETEMPS The stout round faced Frenchman rose and bowing with his irritating politeness answered I wish to consult you Monsieur Biddulph upon a confidential matter concerning your wife What does my wife concern you pray sir I asked angrily Ah calm yourself m sieur he said suddenly dropping into French I am here as your friend I hardly believe that I replied incredulously My friend cannot be the accomplice of my enemies You are acquainted with Reckitt and with Pennington the men implicated in the recent theft of the diamonds of the Archduchess Marie Louise He started and looked at me quickly What do you know of that he inquired with rather undue eagerness I know more concerning you than you think was my firm reply And I give you an alternative Monsieur Guertin Either you will reveal to me the whole truth concerning those men Reckitt and Forbes and my wife s connection with them or I shall telephone to the police and have you arrested as a member of the gang My dear monsieur he replied with a good humoured smile I can t tell you facts of which I possess no knowledge I am here to make inquiry of you to To mislead me further I cried angrily You and your friends may be extremely clever you have succeeded in enticing my wife away from her home and you expect to befool me further Remember that I nearly lost my life in that grim house in Bayswater Therefore at least I can secure the arrest of one member of the gang And you would arrest me eh he asked looking me straight in the face suddenly growing serious Yes I intend to I replied whipping out my revolver from my hip pocket Put that thing away he urged Be reasonable What would you profit by arresting me You shall either speak tell me the truth or I will hand you over to the police I have only to touch this bell and I raised my hand to the electric button beside the fireplace and a telephone message will call a constable And you really would give me in charge eh laughed my visitor I certainly intend doing so I answered angrily Well before this is done let us speak frankly for a few moments suggested the Frenchman You tell me that you nearly lost your life in some house in Bayswater Where was that In Porchester Terrace What is the use of affecting ignorance I do not affect ignorance he said and I saw that a change had completely overspread his countenance I only wish to know the extent of your knowledge of Reckitt and Forbes I have but little knowledge of your friends I m pleased to say was my quick rejoinder Let us leave them out of the question What I desire to know is the whereabouts of my wife He shrugged his broad shoulders I regret that I have no knowledge of where madame may be But you have I cried facing him angrily She is probably with Pennington her father who seems to be one of your undesirable fraternity No she is not with him most certainly my visitor declared I know that for a fact She is probably with Lewis And who is this fellow Lewis I demanded For a moment he was silent I think you had better ask madame your wife he replied at last Do you intend to cast a slur upon her I cried facing him resentfully Not in the least was his cool answer I have merely replied to your question And have given me most impertinent advice Will you or will you not tell me who the fellow is At present monsieur I must refuse Then I shall press the bell and give you into custody Ah he laughed that will be distinctly amusing For me perhaps not for you Monsieur is at liberty to act as he deems best said my visitor Therefore irritated by the fellow s manner and in the hope that he would at the eleventh hour relent I pressed the bell It rang loudly and I heard old Browning go to the telephone beneath the stairs In a few minutes the constable would arrive and at least one member of the dangerous gang would be secured Perhaps you will let me pass he said crossing towards the door immediately after I had rung the bell But I placed myself against it revolver in hand preventing him and holding him at bay Very well he laughed I fear mister Biddulph that you are not acting judiciously You refuse to accept my statement that I am here as your friend Because you on your part refuse to reply to my questions But he only shrugged his shoulders again without replying You know quite well where my wife is Alas I do not the fellow declared emphatically It was to obtain information that I called You cannot deny that you know that pair of criminals Reckitt and Forbes I have surely not denied knowledge of them Yet you refuse to tell me who this man is who enticed my wife from my side the man who presided over that secret council at the George Hotel at Stamford I am prepared to be frank with you in return for your frankness monsieur he answered But I saw in his evasive replies an intention to mislead me into a belief that he was actuated towards me by friendly motives Therefore my antagonism increased He had defied me and I would give him into custody Presently there came a loud knocking at the door and upon my opening it a police sergeant stood upon the threshold I give this man into custody I said addressing him and pointing to the Frenchman Upon what charge sir asked the burly officer whose broad shoulders filled the doorway while I saw a constable standing behind him On suspicion of being associated with the theft of the diamonds of the Archduchess Marie Louise I replied Come monsieur laughed my visitor speaking again in English I think we have carried this sufficiently far And placing his hand in his breast pocket he produced a small folded yellow card bearing his photograph which he handed to me Read that he added with a laugh of triumph I saw that the printed card was headed Prefecture de Police Ville de Paris and that it was signed countersigned and bore a large red official seal Quickly I scanned it and to my abject dismay realized that Henri Guertin was chief of the first section of the surete he was one of the greatest detectives of France I stammered something and then turning to the sergeant red and ashamed I admitted that I had made a mistake in attempting to arrest so distinguished an official The two metropolitan officers held the card in their hands and unable to read French asked me to translate it for them which I did Why cried the sergeant Monsieur Guertin is well known His name figures in the papers only this morning as arresting two Englishmen in Paris for a mysterious murder alleged to have been committed in some house in Bayswater In Bayswater I gasped In Porchester Terrace Yes replied the famous French detective It is true that I know Reckitt and Forbes But I only knew them in order to get at the truth They never suspected me and early yesterday morning I went to the snug little apartments they have in the Rue de Rouen and arrested them together with two young Frenchmen named Terassier and Brault Concealed beneath a loose board in the bedroom of the last named man I found the missing gems Then Terassier and Brault were the two men who met the others in Stamford and carried the diamonds across to the Continent intending to dispose of them Exactly There was a hitch in disposing of them in Amsterdam as had been intended and though the diamonds had been knocked from their settings I found them intact He told me that Forbes was the actual thief who had so daringly travelled to Finsbury Park and collected the tickets en route He had practically confessed to having thrown the bag out to Reckitt and Pennington who were waiting at a point eight miles north of Peterborough They had used an electric flash lamp as they stood in the darkness near the line and the thief on the look out for the light tossed the bag out on to the embankment Then my father in law is a thief I remarked with chagrin when the sergeant and constable had been dismissed It was for that reason my wife dare not face me and make explanation You apparently believe Arnold Du Cane alias Winton alias Pennington to be Sylvia s father but such is not the case remarked the great detective slowly To his career attaches a very remarkable story one which in my long experience in the unravelling of mysteries of crime has never been equalled Tell me it I implored him eagerly Where is my poor wife CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT THE FRENCHMAN MAKES A STATEMENT Ah I regret m sieur that I do not know replied the Frenchman And yet he added after a second s hesitation I do not exactly regret Perhaps it is best after all that I should remain in ignorance But Monsieur Biddulph I would make one request on your wife s behalf On her behalf I gasped What is it That you do not prejudge her She has left you because well because she had good reason But one day when you know the truth you will certainly not judge her too harshly I do not judge her harshly I protested How can I when I love her as devotedly as I do I feel confident that the misfortunes she has brought upon me were not of her own seeking She very narrowly escaped the vengeance of those two assassins Guertin said how narrowly neither you nor she will ever know For months I have watched them closely both here and in France and Germany in order to catch them red handed but they have been too clever for me and we must rely upon the evidence which that back garden in Porchester Terrace will now yield up The gang is part of a great criminal association that society of international thieves of which one member was the man you knew as Harriman and whose real name was Bell now at Devil s Island for the murder of the rising young English parliamentary Under Secretary Ronald Burke The murder was believed to have been committed with a political motive and through certain false evidence furnished by the man Pennington a person named Louis Lessar chief of the band was first arrested and condemned by the Assize Court of the Seine Both were sent to Devil s Island for life but recently Lessar escaped and was daring enough to come to England as mister Lewis Lewis I gasped That was the fellow with whom my wife escaped the man who presided over the secret deliberations of the gang at their assembly at Stamford Yes Once a British officer he had been leader of the great criminal organization before his arrest They were the most formidable in Europe for they always acted on scientific principles and always well provided with funds Some of their coups were utterly amazing But on his arrest and imprisonment the society dwindled under the leadership of Pennington a low bred blackguard who could not even be loyal to his associates Excuse me sir remarked the sergeant again shown into the room by Browning Our C I D men have been at work all day in the garden behind that house in Porchester Terrace A big hole was found dug there and already they ve turned up the remains of two persons a man and a woman I ought to have told you that we had it over the telegraph at the station about an hour ago Superintendent Mayhew and Professor Salt have been there to examine the remains recovered Two victims I exclaimed The open grave found there was prepared for me No doubt exclaimed Guertin When I first communicated with your Scotland Yard they refused to believe my allegations against Reckitt and Forbes But I had had my suspicions aroused by their actions in Paris and I was positive But oh your police methods are so very painfully slow Then the sergeant again withdrew But of Pennington Tell me more of him I urged He was your worst enemy and Sylvia s enemy also even though he posed as her father He wished her to marry Forbes and thus on account of her great beauty remain the decoy of the gang But she met you and loved you Her love for you was the cause of their hatred Because of her affection she risked her life by revealing to me certain things concerning her associates whom she knew were plotting to kill you The very man who was posing as her father and who afterwards affected friendship for you told that pair of unscrupulous assassins Reckitt and Forbes a fictitious story of how Sonia for that is her real name had denounced them This aroused their hatred and they decided to kill you both From what I heard afterwards they entrapped you and placed you in that fatal chair beside the venomous reptile while they also tortured the poor girl with all the horrors of the serpent until her brain became deranged Suddenly however they became alarmed by discovering a half witted lad wandering in the garden where the bodies of previous victims lay concealed and making a quick escape left you and her without ascertaining that you were dead Eventually she escaped and rescued you hence their fear that you would inform the police and their frantic efforts to secure the death of both of you Indeed you would probably have been dead ere this had I not taken upon myself the self imposed duty of being your protector and had not Louis Lessar most fortunately escaped from Devil s Island to protect his daughter from their relentless hands His daughter I gasped staring at him Yes Sonia is the daughter of Phil Poland alias Louis Lessar the man who was falsely denounced by Pennington as an accomplice in the assassination of the young Under Secretary mister Burke on the Riviera After I had arrested her father one night at the house where he lived down near Andover Pennington compelled the girl to pass as his daughter for a twofold reason First because he believed that her great beauty would render her a useful decoy for the purpose of attracting young men into their fatal net and secondly in order that Forbes should secure her as his wife for it was realized how by her marriage to him her lips would be sealed But they all along intended to kill me Of course Your life was you recollect heavily insured at Pennington s suggestion and you had made over a large sum of money to Sonia in case of your demise Therefore it was to the interests of the whole gang that you should meet with some accident which should prove fatal The theft of the jewels of the Archduchess delayed the conspiracy from being put into execution and by that means your life was undoubtedly spared Ah monsieur the gang recently led by Arnold Du Cane was once one of the most daring the most unscrupulous and the most formidable in the whole of Europe And my dear wife is actually the daughter of the previous leader of that criminal band I exclaimed apprehensively Yes She escaped with him because she was in fear of her life because she knew that if she were again beneath her own father s protection you the man she loved would also be safe from injury For Phil Poland is a strong man a perfect past master of the criminal arts and a leader whose word was the command of every member of that great international organization the wide ramifications of which I have so long tried in vain to ascertain Then Poland is a noteworthy man in the world of crime He is a very prince of thieves Yet at the same time one must regard him with some admiration for his daring and audacity his wonderful resourcefulness and his strict adhesion to fair play For years he lived in France Italy and Spain constantly changing his place of abode his identity his very face and always evading us yet nobody has ever said that he did a mean action towards a poor man He certainly suffered an unjust punishment by that false accusation made against him by the man who was apparently jealous of his leadership and who desired to become his successor Then you are of opinion that my wife left me in order to secure my protection from harm I am quite certain of it You recollect my meeting with her at the Hotel Meurice in Paris She told me several things on that occasion And Pennington very nearly fell into your hands Yes but with his usual cleverness he escaped me Where is he now Have you any idea I asked I have no exact knowledge but with the arrest of four of his accomplices it will not be difficult to find out where he is in hiding he laughed And the same may be said of Poland eh No on the contrary while the man Pennington alias Du Cane is hated and it will be believed by those arrested that he has betrayed them in order to save himself yet Poland is beloved They know it was Du Cane who made the false charge connecting Poland with Harriman and they will never forgive him The hatred of the international thief is the worst and most unrelenting hatred existing in the whole world Before Poland came to live in retirement here in England at Middleton near Andover his association consisted only of the most expert criminals of both sexes and he controlled their actions with an iron hand Once every six months the members from all over Europe held a secret conference in one capital or another when various tasks were allotted to various persons The precautions taken to prevent blunders were amazing and we were baffled always because of the widespread field of their operations and the large number of experts engaged The band broken up into small and independent gangs worked in unison with receivers always ready and as soon as our suspicions were aroused by one party they disappeared and another complete strangers came in their place Premises likely to yield good results from burglary were watched for months by a constant succession of clever watchers and people in possession of valuables sometimes engaged servants of irreproachable character who were actually members of the gang Were their exploits chronicled they would fill many volumes of remarkable fact only some of which have appeared in recent years in the columns of the newspapers Every European nationality and every phase of life were represented in that extraordinary assembly which while under Poland s control never as far as is known committed a single murder It was only when the great leader was condemned and exiled and the band fell away that Pennington Reckitt and Forbes conceived the idea of extorting money by means of the serpent allowing the reptile to strike fatally and so prevent exposure By that horrible torture of the innocent and helpless they must have netted many thousands of pounds It was you you say who arrested Poland down in Hampshire Yes nearly three years ago Prior to Harriman s arrest I went there with my friend Watts of Scotland Yard and on that evening a strange affair happened an affair which is still a mystery I ll tell you all about it later he added At present I must go to Porchester Terrace and see what is in progress I only arrived in London from Paris two hours ago I begged him to take me along with him and with some reluctance he consented On the way Guertin told me a strange story of a dead man exactly resembling himself at Middleton village on the night of Poland s arrest Arrived at the house of grim shadows we found a constable idling outside the gate but apparently nobody yet knew of what was transpiring in the garden behind the closed house At first the man declined to allow us to enter but on Guertin declaring who he was we passed through into the tangled weedy place where the lights of lanterns were shining weirdly and we could see men in their shirt sleeves working with shovel and pick while others were clearing away the dead rank herbage of autumn In the uncertain light I saw that a long trench some four feet in depth had been dug and into this the men were flinging the soil they carefully removed in their progress in a line backwards Beneath a tree close to where was an open trench the one prepared for the reception of my body lay something covered with a black cloth From beneath there stuck out a hideous object a man s muddy patent leather shoe Even while I stood amid that weird never to be forgotten scene one of the excavators gave an ejaculation of surprise and a lantern quickly brought revealed a human arm in a dark coat sleeve embedded in the soil With a will half a dozen eager hands were at work and soon a third body that of a tall grey haired man whose face alas was awful to gaze upon was quickly exhumed I could not bear to witness more and left gratified to know that the two fiends were already safely confined in a French prison Justice would no doubt be done and they would meet with their well merited punishment CHAPTER TWENTY NINE FURTHER REVELATIONS If you are a constant reader of the newspapers as probably you are you will no doubt recollect the great sensation caused next day on the publication of the news of the gruesome find in that one of the most aristocratic thoroughfares of Bayswater The metropolitan police were very reticent regarding the affair but many of the papers published photographs of the scene of the exhumations the exterior of the long closed house and photographs of the various police officials That of Guertin however was not included The famous investigator of crime had no wish for the picture of his face with its eyes beaming benignly through his gold glasses to be disseminated broadcast The police refused to make any statement hence the wildest conjectures were afloat concerning the series of tragedies which must have taken place within that dark house with its secluded tangled garden As the days went by the public excitement did not abate for yet more remains were found the body of a young fair haired man who had been identified as mister Cyril Wilson a member of the Travellers Club who had been missing for nearly nine months The police impelled by this fresh discovery cut down the trees in the garden and laid the whole place waste while crowds of the curious waited about in the neighbourhood trying to catch a glimpse of the operations And as time wore on I waited in daily expectation of some sign from the woman I so dearly loved Guertin who still remained in London assured me that she was safe in hiding with her father Phil Poland And you will of course arrest him when you can discover him I remarked as I sat with the famous detective in his room at the Grand Hotel in Trafalgar Square I do not wish to discover him my dear Monsieur Biddulph was his kind reply I happen to know that he has deeply repented of his wrongdoing and even on his sudden reappearance at Stamford with the remaining portion of his once invulnerable gang he urged them to turn aside from evil and become honest citizens He has by his wrongful conviction of murder expiated his crimes and hence I feel that he may be allowed a certain leniency providing he does not offend in future But a warrant is out for him of course Certainly His arrest is demanded for breaking from prison His escape is one of the most daring on record He swam for five miles in the sea on a dark night and met with most extraordinary adventures before a Dutch captain allowed him to work his passage to Rotterdam But he will not dare to put foot in London I suppose He would be liable to extradition to France Who knows He is one of the most fearless and ingenious men I have ever known He can so alter his appearance as to deceive even me But the metropolitan police knowing that Sylvia I mean Sonia is his daughter may be watching my house I exclaimed in alarm That is more than likely he admitted Hence if you want to allow madame your wife an opportunity to approach you you should go abroad somewhere to some quiet place where you would not be suspected Let me know where you go and perhaps I can manage to convey to them the fact that you are waiting there The hotel at Gardone that fine lake side hotel where I had first seen Sonia occurred to me And I told him Very well he said cheerfully I shall return to Paris to morrow and if I can obtain any information from either of the prisoners I will manage to let Poland know that his son in law awaits him Then I thanked the great detective and shaking hands warmly we parted What Guertin had told me regarding the strange discovery of a man who closely resembled him outside Poland s house on the night of the latter s arrest held me much puzzled Even he the all powerful chief of the surete had failed to solve the enigma Next afternoon Shuttleworth called upon me in Wilton Street and for a long time sat chatting At last he looked at me gravely and said I dare say you have been much puzzled mister Biddulph to know why I a clergyman of the Church of England have apparently been mixed up with persons of shady character But now that four of them are under arrest and a fifth we hope will shortly be apprehended I will explain As you perhaps know Sonia was the daughter of the Honourable Philip Poland who came to live at the Elms which is close to the rectory at Middleton We became great friends until one evening he made a strange confession to me He told me who he was Louis Lessar who had been the leader of a dangerous band of international thieves and he asked my advice in my capacity of spiritual guide He had repented and had gone into retirement there believing that his sins would not find him out But they had done and he knew he must shortly be arrested Well I advised him to act the man and put aside the thoughts of suicide What he had revealed to me had I regret to confess it aroused my hatred against the man who had betrayed him a man named Du Cane This man Du Cane I had only met once at the Elms and then I did not realize the amazing truth that this was the selfsame man who had stolen from me twenty years before the woman I had so dearly loved He had betrayed her and left her to starve and die in a back street in Marseilles I concealed my outburst of feeling yet the very next evening Poland was arrested and Sonia ignorant of the truth was with a motive already explained by Monsieur Guertin taken under the guardianship of this man whom I had such just cause to hate the man who subsequently passed as her father Pennington It was because of that I felt all along such a tender interest in the unhappy young lady and I was so delighted to know when she had at last become your wife You certainly concealed your feelings towards Pennington I believed you to be his friend I said I was Sonia s friend not his for what poor Poland had told me revealed the truth that the fellow was an absolute scoundrel And you of course know about the incident of a man closely resembling the French detective Guertin being found dead outside the door of the Elms Certainly was his reply that is still a complete mystery which can only be solved by Poland himself He must know or else have a shrewd idea of what occurred As we chatted on for a long time he told me frankly many things of which I had not the least suspicion at the same time assuring me of Sonia s deep devotion towards me and of his confidence that she had left me because she believed being at her father s side would ensure my own safety And now that I knew so much of the truth I longed hourly to meet her and to obtain from her and perhaps from the lips of Philip Poland himself the remaining links in that remarkable chain of facts CHAPTER THIRTY CONCLUSION About ten days afterwards I one morning received by post a brief note from Guertin written from the Prefecture in Paris urging me to go at once to the Victoria Hotel at Varenna on the Lake of Como where if I waited in the name of Brown my patience would be rewarded And there sure enough six days later as I sat one evening in my private sitting room the door suddenly opened and my well beloved in a dark travelling gown sprang forward and embraced me sobbing for very joy Can I adequately describe the happiness of that reunion Of what I uttered I have no recollection for I held her closely in my arms as I kissed her hot tears away A man stood by a tall silent gentlemanly man whose hair was grey and whose face as he advanced beneath the strong light showed traces of disguise I am Philip Poland Sonia s father he exclaimed in a low voice Whereupon I took the hand of the escaped prisoner and expressed the utmost satisfaction at that meeting for he had risked his liberty to come there to me Sonia has told me everything he said and I can only regret that those blackguards have treated you and her as they have But Guertin who is a humane man even though he be a detective has tracked them down and only yesterday I heard Du Cane the man who made that false charge against myself and stepped into my shoes the man who intended that my poor girl should marry that young scoundrel Forbes has been discovered in Breslau and is being extradited to England On the night of your arrest mister Poland a mystery occurred I said presently as we sat together exchanging many confidences as I held my dear wife s soft little hand in mine Yes he replied It was only while I was out at Devil s Island that I learnt the truth Du Cane intending to get me out of the way hit upon a very ingenious plan of sending a man made up as Guertin whom I only knew by sight to see me and suggest suicide rather than arrest This man a person named Lefevre came and made the suggestion He did not know that Du Cane had written anonymously to the Prefecture and never dreamed that Guertin himself would follow him so quickly On leaving he apparently hung about watching the result of his dastardly mission when Harriman or Bell as we knew him walked up the drive in order to call in secret upon me He espied a man whom he recognized as Guertin peering in at the window and creeping up behind him struck him down before he could utter a word Afterwards he slipped away believing that he had killed our arch enemy the chief of the surete Presently however the body of the unfortunate Lefevre was found by Guertin himself who had come to arrest me And Harriman admitted this I exclaimed Yes He admitted it to me upon his death bed He died of fever a week before I made my dash for liberty But he added Sonia has told me of that dastardly attempt which those hell fiends Reckitt and Forbes made upon you in Porchester Terrace and how they also tortured her But they were fortunately alarmed and fled precipitately leaving Sonia unconscious Yes declared my sweet wife When I came to myself I recollected in horror what they had told me concerning the fate to which they had abandoned you in the adjoining room and with a great effort managed to free myself and seek you I cut the straps which bound you and succeeded in killing the snake just in time to save you Then I stole away and left fearing that you might suspect me of having had some hand in the affair And you saved my life darling I exclaimed kissing her fondly on the lips Then turning to Poland I said The police are hunting for you everywhere Cannot you get to some place where you are not liable to be taken back to France To morrow if I am fortunate he said with a faint smile I return to the modest little villa I have rented on the hill side outside Athens In Greece one is still immune from arrest for offences abroad And I shall return to London with you Owen Father and I have travelled to Trieste and thence here in order that I should rejoin you now that the danger is past Ah darling I cried I never for one moment doubted you Yet I admit that the circumstances once or twice looked very black and suspicious Alas I could not prevent it she declared I left you and joined Dad at the Coliseum because I went in fear of some further attempt being made upon us and I felt you and I would be safe if I were with him He had no idea when he met the others at Stamford that Forbes and Reckitt and Du Cane had effected that coup with the Archduchess s jewels No I had no idea of it said Poland My meeting with them was one of farewell I had already severed my connection with them three years ago before my arrest And then after some further explanations I clasped my loved one in my arms and openly repeated my declaration of fervent love and fond affection Of the rest what need be said Sonia is now very happy either down at Carrington or at Wilton Street for the black clouds which overshadowed the earlier days of our marriage have rent asunder and given place to all the sunshine and brightness of life and hope No pair could be happier than we Twice we have been to Athens as the guest of the tall grey haired Englishman who is such a thorough going cosmopolitan and who lives in Greece for the sake of the even climate and the study of its antiquities No one in the Greek capital recognizes mister Wilfrid Marsh as the once famous Louis Lessar And dear old Jack Marlowe still our firm and devoted friend is as full of good humoured philosophy as ever and frequently our visitor He still leads his careless existence and is often to be seen idling in the window of White s smoking and watching the passers by in saint James s Street You who read the newspapers probably know how Arnold Du Cane alias Pennington alias Winton was recently sentenced at the Old Bailey to fifteen years and the two young Frenchmen Terassier and Brault to seven years each for complicity in the robbery on the Scotch express And probably you also read the account of how two mysterious Englishmen named Reckitt and Forbes who had been arrested in Paris had somehow prior to their extradition to England managed to obtain possession of blades of safety razors and with them had both committed suicide In consequence of this there was no trial of the perpetrators of those brutal crimes in Porchester Terrace The whole affair was but a nine days horror and as the authorities saw that no good could accrue from alarming the public by further publicity or inquiry it was quickly Hushed up THE END Richard Clay Sons Limited London and Bungay THE MASTER OF MYSTERY WILLIAM LE QUEUX S
