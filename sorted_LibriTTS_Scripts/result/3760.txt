by David G Johnson SYBIL OR THE TWO NATIONS By Benjamin Disraeli I would inscribe these volumes to one whose noble spirit and gentle nature ever prompt her to sympathise with the suffering to one whose sweet voice has often encouraged and whose taste and judgment have ever guided their pages the most severe of critics but a perfect Wife Advertisement The general reader whose attention has not been specially drawn to the subject which these volumes aim to illustrate the Condition of the People might suspect that the Writer had been tempted to some exaggeration in the scenes which he has drawn and the impressions which he has wished to convey He thinks it therefore due to himself to state that he believes there is not a trait in this work for which he has not the authority of his own observation or the authentic evidence which has been received by Royal Commissions and Parliamentary Committees But while he hopes he has alleged nothing which is not true he has found the absolute necessity of suppressing much that is genuine For so little do we know of the state of our own country that the air of improbability that the whole truth would inevitably throw over these pages might deter many from their perusal Grosvenor Gate May Day eighteen forty five BOOK I Book one Chapter one I ll take the odds against Caravan In poneys Done And Lord Milford a young noble entered in his book the bet which he had just made with mister Latour a grey headed member of the Jockey Club It was the eve of the Derby of eighteen thirty seven In a vast and golden saloon that in its decorations would have become and in its splendour would not have disgraced Versailles in the days of the grand monarch were assembled many whose hearts beat at the thought of the morrow and whose brains still laboured to control its fortunes to their advantage They say that Caravan looks puffy lisped in a low voice a young man lounging on the edge of a buhl table that had once belonged to a Mortemart and dangling a rich cane with affected indifference in order to conceal his anxiety from all except the person whom he addressed They are taking seven to two against him freely over the way was the reply I believe it s all right Do you know I dreamed last night something about Mango continued the gentleman with the cane and with a look of uneasy superstition His companion shook his head Well continued the gentleman with the cane I have no opinion of him I gave Charles Egremont the odds against Mango this morning he goes with us you know By the bye who is our fourth I thought of Milford was the reply in an under tone What say you Milford is going with saint James and Punch Hughes Well let us come into supper and we shall see some fellow we like So saying the companions taking their course through more than one chamber entered an apartment of less dimensions than the principal saloon but not less sumptuous in its general appearance The gleaming lustres poured a flood of soft yet brilliant light over a plateau glittering with gold plate and fragrant with exotics embedded in vases of rare porcelain The seats on each side of the table were occupied by persons consuming with a heedless air delicacies for which they had no appetite while the conversation in general consisted of flying phrases referring to the impending event of the great day that had already dawned Come from Lady saint Julian s Fitz said a youth of very tender years and whose fair visage was as downy and as blooming as the peach from which with a languid air he withdrew his lips to make this inquiry of the gentleman with the cane Yes why were not you there I never go anywhere replied the melancholy Cupid everything bores me so Well will you go to Epsom with us to morrow Alfred said Lord Fitzheron I take Berners and Charles Egremont and with you our party will be perfect I feel so cursed blase exclaimed the boy in a tone of elegant anguish It will give you a fillip Alfred said mister Berners do you all the good in the world Nothing can do me good said Alfred throwing away his almost untasted peach I should be quite content if anything could do me harm Waiter bring me a tumbler of Badminton And bring me one too sighed out Lord Eugene De Vere who was a year older than Alfred Mountchesney his companion and brother in listlessness Both had exhausted life in their teens and all that remained for them was to mourn amid the ruins of their reminiscences over the extinction of excitement Well Eugene suppose you come with us said Lord Fitzheron I think I shall go down to Hampton Court and play tennis said Lord Eugene As it is the Derby nobody will be there And I will go with you Eugene said Alfred Mountchesney and we will dine together afterwards at the Toy Anything is better than dining in this infernal London Well for my part said mister Berners I do not like your suburban dinners You always get something you can t eat and cursed bad wine I rather like bad wine said mister Mountchesney one gets so bored with good wine Do you want the odds against Hybiscus Berners said a guardsman looking up from his book which he had been very intently studying All I want is some supper and as you are not using your place You shall have it Oh here s Milford he will give them me And at this moment entered the room the young nobleman whom we have before mentioned accompanied by an individual who was approaching perhaps the termination of his fifth lustre but whose general air rather betokened even a less experienced time of life Tall with a well proportioned figure and a graceful carriage his countenance touched with a sensibility that at once engages the affections Charles Egremont was not only admired by that sex whose approval generally secures men enemies among their fellows but was at the same time the favourite of his own Ah Egremont come and sit here exclaimed more than one banqueter I saw you waltzing with the little Bertie old fellow said Lord Fitzheron and therefore did not stay to speak to you as I thought we should meet here I am to call for you mind How shall we all feel this time to morrow said Egremont smiling The happiest fellow at this moment must be Cockie Graves said Lord Milford He can have no suspense I have been looking over his book and I defy him whatever happens not to lose Poor Cockie said mister Berners he has asked me to dine with him at the Clarendon on Saturday Cockie is a very good Cockie said Lord Milford and Caravan is a very good horse and if any gentleman sportsman present wishes to give seven to two I will take him to any amount My book is made up said Egremont and I stand or fall by Caravan And I And I And I Well mark my words said a fourth rather solemnly Rat trap wins There is not a horse except Caravan said Lord Milford fit for a borough stake You used to be all for Phosphorus Egremont said Lord Eugene de Vere Yes but fortunately I have got out of that scrape I owe Phip Dormer a good turn for that I was the third man who knew he had gone lame And what are the odds against him now Oh nominal forty to one what you please He won t run said mister Berners John Day told me he had refused to ride him I believe Cockie Graves might win something if Phosphorus came in first said Lord Milford laughing How close it is to night said Egremont Waiter give me some Seltzer water and open another window open them all At this moment an influx of guests intimated that the assembly at Lady saint Julian s was broken up Many at the table rose and yielded their places clustering round the chimney piece or forming in various groups and discussing the great question Several of those who had recently entered were votaries of Rat trap the favourite and quite prepared from all the information that had reached them to back their opinions valiantly The conversation had now become general and animated or rather there was a medley of voices in which little was distinguished except the names of horses and the amount of odds In the midst of all this waiters glided about handing incomprehensible mixtures bearing aristocratic names mystical combinations of French wines and German waters flavoured with slices of Portugal fruits and cooled with lumps of American ice compositions which immortalized the creative genius of some high patrician name By Jove that s a flash exclaimed Lord Milford as a blaze of lightning seemed to suffuse the chamber and the beaming lustres turned white and ghastly in the glare The thunder rolled over the building There was a dead silence Was it going to rain Was it going to pour Was the storm confined to the metropolis Would it reach Epsom A deluge and the course would be a quagmire and strength might baffle speed Another flash another explosion the hissing noise of rain Lord Milford moved aside and jealous of the eye of another read a letter from Chifney and in a few minutes afterwards offered to take the odds against Pocket Hercules mister Latour walked to the window surveyed the heavens sighed that there was not time to send his tiger from the door to Epsom and get information whether the storm had reached the Surrey hills for to night s operations It was too late So he took a rusk and a glass of lemonade and retired to rest with a cool head and a cooler heart The storm raged the incessant flash played as it were round the burnished cornice of the chamber and threw a lurid hue on the scenes of Watteau and Boucher that sparkled in the medallions over the lofty doors The thunderbolts seemed to descend in clattering confusion upon the roof Sometimes there was a moment of dead silence broken only by the pattering of the rain in the street without or the pattering of the dice in a chamber at hand Then horses were backed bets made and there were loud and frequent calls for brimming goblets from hurrying waiters distracted by the lightning and deafened by the peal It seemed a scene and a supper where the marble guest of Juan might have been expected and had he arrived he would have found probably hearts as bold and spirits as reckless as he encountered in Andalusia Book one Chapter two Will any one do anything about Hybiscus sang out a gentleman in the ring at Epsom It was full of eager groups round the betting post a swarming cluster while the magic circle itself was surrounded by a host of horsemen shouting from their saddles the odds they were ready to receive or give and the names of the horses they were prepared to back or to oppose Will any one do anything about Hybiscus I ll give you five to one said a tall stiff Saxon peer in a white great coat No I ll take six The tall stiff peer in the white great coat mused for a moment with his pencil at his lip and then said Well I ll give you six What do you say about Mango Eleven to two against Mango called out a little humpbacked man in a shrill voice but with the air of one who was master of his work I should like to do a little business with you mister Chippendale said Lord Milford in a coaxing tone but I must have six to one Eleven to two and no mistake said this keeper of a second rate gaming house who known by the flattering appellation of Hump Chippendale now turned with malignant abruptness from the heir apparent of an English earldom You shall have six to one my Lord said Captain Spruce a debonair personage with a well turned silk hat arranged a little aside his coloured cravat tied with precision his whiskers trimmed like a quickset hedge Spruce who had earned his title of Captain on the plains of Newmarket which had witnessed for many a year his successful exploits had a weakness for the aristocracy who knowing his graceful infirmity patronized him with condescending dexterity acknowledged his existence in Pall Mall as well as at Tattersalls and thus occasionally got a point more than the betting out of him Hump Chippendale had none of these gentle failings he was a democratic leg who loved to fleece a noble and thought all men were born equal a consoling creed that was a hedge for his hump Seven to four against the favourite seven to two against Caravan eleven to two against Mango What about Benedict Will any one do anything about Pocket Hercules Thirty to one against Dardanelles Done Five and thirty ponies to one against Phosphorus shouted a little man vociferously and repeatedly I will give forty said Lord Milford No answer nothing done Forty to one murmured Egremont who stood against Phosphorus A little nervous he said to the peer in the white great coat Don t you think that Phosphorus may after all have some chance I should be cursed sorry to be deep against him said the peer Egremont with a quivering lip walked away He consulted his book he meditated anxiously Should he hedge It was scarcely worth while to mar the symmetry of his winnings he stood so well by all the favourites and for a horse at forty to one No he would trust his star he would not hedge mister Chippendale whispered the peer in the white great coat go and press mister Egremont about Phosphorus I should not be surprised if you got a good thing At this moment a huge broad faced rosy gilled fellow with one of those good humoured yet cunning countenances that we meet occasionally on the northern side of the Trent rode up to the ring on a square cob and dismounting entered the circle He was a carcase butcher famous in Carnaby market and the prime councillor of a distinguished nobleman for whom privately he betted on commission His secret service to day was to bet against his noble employer s own horse and so he at once sung out Twenty to one against Man trap A young gentleman just launched into the world and who proud of his ancient and spreading acres was now making his first book seeing Man trap marked eighteen to one on the cards jumped eagerly at this bargain while Lord Fitzheron and mister Berners who were at hand and who in their days had found their names in the book of the carcase butcher and grown wise by it interchanged a smile mister Egremont will not take said Hump Chippendale to the peer in the white great coat You must have been too eager said his noble friend The ring is up the last odds declared all gallop away to the Warren A few minutes only a few minutes and the event that for twelve months has been the pivot of so much calculation of such subtile combinations of such deep conspiracies round which the thought and passion of the sporting world have hung like eagles will be recorded in the fleeting tablets of the past But what minutes Count them by sensation and not by calendars and each moment is a day and the race a life Hogarth in a coarse and yet animated sketch has painted Before and After A creative spirit of a higher vein might develope the simplicity of the idea with sublimer accessories Pompeius before Pharsalia Harold before Hastings Napoleon before Waterloo might afford some striking contrasts to the immediate catastrophe of their fortunes Finer still the inspired mariner who has just discovered a new world the sage who has revealed a new planet and yet the Before and After of a first rate English race in the degree of its excitement and sometimes in the tragic emotions of its close may vie even with these They are saddling the horses Caravan looks in great condition and a scornful smile seems to play upon the handsome features of Pavis as in the becoming colours of his employer he gracefully gallops his horse before his admiring supporters Egremont in the delight of an English patrician scarcely saw Mango and never even thought of Phosphorus Phosphorus who by the bye was the first horse that showed with both his forelegs bandaged They are off As soon as they are well away Chifney makes the running with Pocket Hercules Up to the Rubbing House he is leading this is the only point the eye can select Higher up the hill Caravan Hybiscus Benedict Mahometan Phosphorus Michel Fell and Rat trap are with the grey forming a front rank and at the new ground the pace has told its tale for half a dozen are already out of the race The summit is gained the tactics alter here Pavis brings up Caravan with extraordinary severity the pace round Tattenham corner terrific Caravan leading then Phosphorus a little above him Mahometan next Hybiscus fourth Rat trap looking badly Wisdom Benedict and another handy By this time Pocket Hercules has enough and at the road the tailing grows at every stride Here the favourite himself is hors de combat as well as Dardanelles and a crowd of lesser celebrities There are now but four left in the race and of these two Hybiscus and Mahometan are some lengths behind Now it is neck and neck between Caravan and Phosphorus At the stand Caravan has decidedly the best but just at the post Edwards on Phosphorus lifts the gallant little horse and with an extraordinary effort contrives to shove him in by half a length You look a little low Charley said Lord Fitzheron as taking their lunch in their drag he poured the champagne into the glass of Egremont By Jove said Lord Milford Only think of Cockie Graves having gone and done it Book one Chapter three Egremont was the younger brother of an English earl whose nobility being of nearly three centuries date ranked him among our high and ancient peers although its origin was more memorable than illustrious The founder of the family had been a confidential domestic of one of the favourites of Henry the Eighth and had contrived to be appointed one of the commissioners for visiting and taking the surrenders of divers religious houses It came to pass that divers of these religious houses surrendered themselves eventually to the use and benefit of honest Baldwin Greymount The king was touched with the activity and zeal of his commissioner Not one of them whose reports were so ample and satisfactory who could baffle a wily prior with more dexterity or control a proud abbot with more firmness Nor were they well digested reports alone that were transmitted to the sovereign they came accompanied with many rare and curious articles grateful to the taste of one who was not only a religious reformer but a dilettante golden candlesticks and costly chalices sometimes a jewelled pix fantastic spoons and patens rings for the fingers and the ear occasionally a fair written and blazoned manuscript suitable offering to the royal scholar Greymount was noticed sent for promoted in the household knighted might doubtless have been sworn of the council and in due time have become a minister but his was a discreet ambition of an accumulative rather than an aspiring character He served the king faithfully in all domestic matters that required an unimpassioned unscrupulous agent fashioned his creed and conscience according to the royal model in all its freaks seized the right moment to get sundry grants of abbey lands and contrived in that dangerous age to save both his head and his estate The Greymount family having planted themselves in the land faithful to the policy of the founder avoided the public gaze during the troubled period that followed the reformation and even during the more orderly reign of Elizabeth rather sought their increase in alliances than in court favour But at the commencement of the seventeenth century their abbey lands infinitely advanced in value and their rental swollen by the prudent accumulation of more than seventy years a Greymount who was then a county member was elevated to the peerage as Baron Marney The heralds furnished his pedigree and assured the world that although the exalted rank and extensive possessions enjoyed at present by the Greymounts had their origin immediately in great territorial revolutions of a recent reign it was not for a moment to be supposed that the remote ancestors of the Ecclesiastical Commissioner of fifteen thirty were by any means obscure On the contrary it appeared that they were both Norman and baronial their real name Egremont which in their patent of peerage the family now resumed In the civil wars the Egremonts pricked by their Norman blood were cavaliers and fought pretty well But in sixteen eighty eight alarmed at the prevalent impression that King James intended to insist on the restitution of the church estates to their original purposes to wit the education of the people and the maintenance of the poor the Lord of Marney Abbey became a warm adherent of civil and religious liberty the cause for which Hampden had died in the field and Russell on the scaffold and joined the other whig lords and great lay impropriators in calling over the Prince of Orange and a Dutch army to vindicate those popular principles which somehow or other the people would never support Profiting by this last pregnant circumstance the lay Abbot of Marney also in this instance like the other whig lords was careful to maintain while he vindicated the cause of civil and religious liberty a very loyal and dutiful though secret correspondence with the court of saint Germains The great deliverer King William the Third to whom Lord Marney was a systematic traitor made the descendant of the Ecclesiastical Commissioner of Henry the Eighth an English earl and from that time until the period of our history though the Marney family had never produced one individual eminent for civil or military abilities though the country was not indebted to them for a single statesman orator successful warrior great lawyer learned divine eminent author illustrious man of science they had contrived if not to engross any great share of public admiration and love at least to monopolise no contemptible portion of public money and public dignities During the seventy years of almost unbroken whig rule from the accession of the House of Hanover to the fall of mister Fox Marney Abbey had furnished a never failing crop of lord privy seals lord presidents and lord lieutenants The family had had their due quota of garters and governments and bishoprics admirals without fleets and generals who fought only in America They had glittered in great embassies with clever secretaries at their elbow and had once governed Ireland when to govern Ireland was only to apportion the public plunder to a corrupt senate Notwithstanding however this prolonged enjoyment of undeserved prosperity the lay abbots of Marney were not content Not that it was satiety that induced dissatisfaction The Egremonts could feed on They wanted something more Not to be prime ministers or secretaries of state for they were a shrewd race who knew the length of their tether and notwithstanding the encouraging example of his grace of Newcastle they could not resist the persuasion that some knowledge of the interests and resources of nations some power of expressing opinions with propriety some degree of respect for the public and for himself were not altogether indispensable qualifications even under a Venetian constitution in an individual who aspired to a post so eminent and responsible Satisfied with the stars and mitres and official seals which were periodically apportioned to them the Marney family did not aspire to the somewhat graceless office of being their distributor What they aimed at was promotion in their order and promotion to the highest class They observed that more than one of the other great civil and religious liberty families the families who in one century plundered the church to gain the property of the people and in another century changed the dynasty to gain the power of the crown had their brows circled with the strawberry leaf And why should not this distinction be the high lot also of the descendants of the old gentleman usher of one of King Henry s plundering vicar generals Why not True it is that a grateful sovereign in our days has deemed such distinction the only reward for half a hundred victories True it is that Nelson after conquering the Mediterranean died only a Viscount But the house of Marney had risen to high rank counted themselves ancient nobility and turned up their noses at the Pratts and the Smiths the Jenkinsons and the Robinsons of our degenerate days and never had done anything for the nation or for their honours And why should they now It was unreasonable to expect it Civil and religious liberty that had given them a broad estate and a glittering coronet to say nothing of half a dozen close seats in parliament ought clearly to make them dukes But the other great whig families who had obtained this honour and who had done something more for it than spoliate their church and betray their king set up their backs against this claim of the Egremonts The Egremonts had done none of the work of the last hundred years of political mystification during which a people without power or education had been induced to believe themselves the freest and most enlightened nation in the world and had submitted to lavish their blood and treasure to see their industry crippled and their labour mortgaged in order to maintain an oligarchy that had neither ancient memories to soften nor present services to justify their unprecedented usurpation How had the Egremonts contributed to this prodigious result Their family had furnished none of those artful orators whose bewildering phrase had fascinated the public intelligence none of those toilsome patricians whose assiduity in affairs had convinced their unprivileged fellow subjects that government was a science and administration an art which demanded the devotion of a peculiar class in the state for their fulfilment and pursuit The Egremonts had never said anything that was remembered or done anything that could be recalled It was decided by the Great Revolution families that they should not be dukes Infinite was the indignation of the lay Abbot of Marney He counted his boroughs consulted his cousins and muttered revenge The opportunity soon offered for the gratification of his passion The situation of the Venetian party in the wane of the eighteenth century had become extremely critical A young king was making often fruitless but always energetic struggles to emancipate his national royalty from the trammels of the factious dogeship More than sixty years of a government of singular corruption had alienated all hearts from the oligarchy never indeed much affected by the great body of the people It could no longer be concealed that by virtue of a plausible phrase power had been transferred from the crown to a parliament the members of which were appointed by an extremely limited and exclusive class who owned no responsibility to the country who debated and voted in secret and who were regularly paid by the small knot of great families that by this machinery had secured the permanent possession of the king s treasury Whiggism was putrescent in the nostrils of the nation we were probably on the eve of a bloodless yet important revolution when Rockingham a virtuous magnifico alarmed and disgusted resolved to revive something of the pristine purity and high toned energy of the old whig connection appealed to his new generation from a degenerate age arrayed under his banner the generous youth of the whig families and was fortunate to enlist in the service the supreme genius of Edmund Burke Burke effected for the whigs what Bolingbroke in a preceding age had done for the tories he restored the moral existence of the party He taught them to recur to the ancient principles of their connection and suffused those principles with all the delusive splendour of his imagination He raised the tone of their public discourse he breathed a high spirit into their public acts It was in his power to do more for the whigs than saint John could do for his party The oligarchy who had found it convenient to attaint Bolingbroke for being the avowed minister of the English Prince with whom they were always in secret communication when opinion forced them to consent to his restitution had tacked to the amnesty a clause as cowardly as it was unconstitutional and declared his incompetence to sit in the parliament of his country Burke on the contrary fought the whig fight with a two edged weapon he was a great writer as an orator he was transcendent In a dearth of that public talent for the possession of which the whigs have generally been distinguished Burke came forward and established them alike in the parliament and the country And what was his reward No sooner had a young and dissolute noble who with some of the aspirations of a Caesar oftener realised the conduct of a Catiline appeared on the stage and after some inglorious tergiversation adopted their colours than they transferred to him the command which had been won by wisdom and genius vindicated by unrivalled knowledge and adorned by accomplished eloquence When the hour arrived for the triumph which he had prepared he was not even admitted into the Cabinet virtually presided over by his graceless pupil and who in the profuse suggestions of his teeming converse had found the principles and the information which were among the chief claims to public confidence of mister Fox Hard necessity made mister Burke submit to the yoke but the humiliation could never be forgotten Nemesis favours genius the inevitable hour at length arrived A voice like the Apocalypse sounded over England and even echoed in all the courts of Europe Burke poured forth the vials of his hoarded vengeance into the agitated heart of Christendom he stimulated the panic of a world by the wild pictures of his inspired imagination he dashed to the ground the rival who had robbed him of his hard earned greatness rended in twain the proud oligarchy that had dared to use and to insult him and followed with servility by the haughtiest and the most timid of its members amid the frantic exultation of his country he placed his heel upon the neck of the ancient serpent Among the whig followers of mister Burke in this memorable defection among the Devonshires and the Portlands the Spencers and the Fitzwilliams was the Earl of Marney whom the whigs would not make a duke What was his chance of success from mister Pitt If the history of England be ever written by one who has the knowledge and the courage and both qualities are equally requisite for the undertaking the world would be more astonished than when reading the Roman annals by Niebuhr Generally speaking all the great events have been distorted most of the important causes concealed some of the principal characters never appear and all who figure are so misunderstood and misrepresented that the result is a complete mystification and the perusal of the narrative about as profitable to an Englishman as reading the Republic of Plato or the Utopia of More the pages of Gaudentio di Lucca or the adventures of Peter Wilkins The influence of races in our early ages of the church in our middle and of parties in our modern history are three great moving and modifying powers that must be pursued and analyzed with an untiring profound and unimpassioned spirit before a guiding ray can be secured A remarkable feature of our written history is the absence in its pages of some of the most influential personages Not one man in a thousand for instance has ever heard of Major Wildman yet he was the soul of English politics in the most eventful period of this kingdom and one most interesting to this age from sixteen forty to sixteen eighty eight and seemed more than once to hold the balance which was to decide the permanent form of our government But he was the leader of an unsuccessful party Even comparatively speaking in our own times the same mysterious oblivion is sometimes encouraged to creep over personages of great social distinction as well as political importance The name of the second Pitt remains fresh after forty years of great events a parliamentary beacon He was the Chatterton of politics the marvellous boy Some have a vague impression that he was mysteriously moulded by his great father that he inherited the genius the eloquence the state craft of Chatham His genius was of a different bent his eloquence of a different class his state craft of a different school To understand mister Pitt one must understand one of the suppressed characters of English history and that is Lord Shelburne When the fine genius of the injured Bolingbroke the only peer of his century who was educated and proscribed by the oligarchy because they were afraid of his eloquence the glory of his order and the shame shut out from Parliament found vent in those writings which recalled to the English people the inherent blessings of their old free monarchy and painted in immortal hues his picture of a patriot king the spirit that he raised at length touched the heart of Carteret born a whig yet sceptical of the advantages of that patrician constitution which made the Duke of Newcastle the most incompetent of men but the chosen leader of the Venetian party virtually sovereign of England Lord Carteret had many brilliant qualities he was undaunted enterprising eloquent had considerable knowledge of continental politics was a great linguist a master of public law and though he failed in his premature effort to terminate the dogeship of George the Second he succeeded in maintaining a considerable though secondary position in public life The young Shelburne married his daughter Of him it is singular we know less than of his father in law yet from the scattered traits some idea may be formed of the ablest and most accomplished minister of the eighteenth century Lord Shelburne influenced probably by the example and the traditionary precepts of his eminent father in law appears early to have held himself aloof from the patrician connection and entered public life as the follower of Bute in the first great effort of George the Third to rescue the sovereignty from what Lord Chatham called the Great Revolution families He became in time a member of Lord Chatham s last administration one of the strangest and most unsuccessful efforts to aid the grandson of George the Second in his struggle for political emancipation Lord Shelburne adopted from the first the Bolingbroke system a real royalty in lieu of the chief magistracy a permanent alliance with France instead of the whig scheme of viewing in that power the natural enemy of England and above all a plan of commercial freedom the germ of which may be found in the long maligned negotiations of Utrecht but which in the instance of Lord Shelburne were soon in time matured by all the economical science of Europe in which he was a proficient Lord Shelburne seems to have been of a reserved and somewhat astute disposition deep and adroit he was however brave and firm His knowledge was extensive and even profound He was a great linguist he pursued both literary and scientific investigations his house was frequented by men of letters especially those distinguished by their political abilities or economical attainments He maintained the most extensive private correspondence of any public man of his time The earliest and most authentic information reached him from all courts and quarters of Europe and it was a common phrase that the minister of the day sent to him often for the important information which the cabinet could not itself command Lord Shelburne was the first great minister who comprehended the rising importance of the middle class and foresaw in its future power a bulwark for the throne against the Great Revolution families Of his qualities in council we have no record there is reason to believe that his administrative ability was conspicuous his speeches prove that if not supreme he was eminent in the art of parliamentary disputation while they show on all the questions discussed a richness and variety of information with which the speeches of no statesman of that age except mister Burke can compare Such was the man selected by George the Third as his champion against the Venetian party after the termination of the American war The prosecution of that war they had violently opposed though it had originated in their own policy First minister in the House of Lords Shelburne entrusted the lead in the House of Commons to his Chancellor of the Exchequer the youthful Pitt The administration was brief but it was not inglorious It obtained peace and for the first time since the Revolution introduced into modern debate the legitimate principles on which commerce should be conducted It fell before the famous Coalition with which the Great Revolution families commenced their fiercest and their last contention for the patrician government of royal England In the heat of that great strife the king in the second hazardous exercise of his prerogative entrusted the perilous command to Pitt Why Lord Shelburne on that occasion was set aside will perhaps always remain a mysterious passage of our political history nor have we space on the present occasion to attempt to penetrate its motives Perhaps the monarch with a sense of the rising sympathies of his people was prescient of the magic power of youth in touching the heart of a nation Yet it would not be an unprofitable speculation if for a moment we paused to consider what might have been the consequences to our country if mister Pitt had been content for a season again to lead the Commons under Lord Shelburne and have secured for England the unrivalled knowledge and dexterity of that statesman in the conduct of our affairs during the confounding fortunes of the French revolution Lord Shelburne was the only English minister competent to the task he was the only public man who had the previous knowledge requisite to form accurate conclusions on such a conjuncture his remaining speeches on the subject attest the amplitude of his knowledge and the accuracy of his views and in the rout of Jena or the agony of Austerlitz one cannot refrain from picturing the shade of Shelburne haunting the cabinet of Pitt as the ghost of Canning is said occasionally to linger about the speaker s chair and smile sarcastically on the conscientious mediocrities who pilfered his hard earned honours But during the happier years of mister Pitt the influence of the mind of Shelburne may be traced throughout his policy It was Lansdowne House that made Pitt acquainted with doctor Price a dissenting minister whom Lord Shelburne when at the head of affairs courageously offered to make his private secretary and who furnished mister Pitt among many other important suggestions with his original plan of the sinking fund The commercial treaties of eighty seven were struck in the same mint and are notable as the first effort made by the English government to emancipate the country from the restrictive policy which had been introduced by the glorious revolution memorable epoch that presented England at the same time with a corn law and a public debt But on no subject was the magnetic influence of the descendant of Sir William Petty more decided than in the resolution of his pupil to curb the power of the patrician party by an infusion from the middle classes into the government of the country Hence the origin of mister Pitt s famous and long misconceived plans of parliamentary reform Was he sincere is often asked by those who neither seek to discover the causes nor are capable of calculating the effects of public transactions Sincere Why he was struggling for his existence And when baffled first by the Venetian party and afterwards by the panic of Jacobinism he was forced to forego his direct purpose he still endeavoured partially to effect it by a circuitous process He created a plebeian aristocracy and blended it with the patrician oligarchy He made peers of second rate squires and fat graziers He caught them in the alleys of Lombard Street and clutched them from the counting houses of Cornhill When mister Pitt in an age of bank restriction declared that every man with an estate of ten thousand a year had a right to be a peer he sounded the knell of the cause for which Hampden had died on the field and Sydney on the scaffold In ordinary times the pupil of Shelburne would have raised this country to a state of great material prosperity and removed or avoided many of those anomalies which now perplex us but he was not destined for ordinary times and though his capacity was vast and his spirit lofty he had not that passionate and creative genius required by an age of revolution The French outbreak was his evil daemon he had not the means of calculating its effects upon Europe He had but a meagre knowledge himself of continental politics he was assisted by a very inefficient diplomacy His mind was lost in a convulsion of which he neither could comprehend the causes nor calculate the consequences and forced to act he acted not only violently but in exact opposition to the very system he was called into political existence to combat he appealed to the fears the prejudices and the passions of a privileged class revived the old policy of the oligarchy he had extinguished and plunged into all the ruinous excesses of French war and Dutch finance If it be a salutary principle in the investigation of historical transactions to be careful in discriminating the cause from the pretext there is scarcely any instance in which the application of this principle is more fertile in results than in that of the Dutch invasion of sixteen eighty eight The real cause of this invasion was financial The Prince of Orange had found that the resources of Holland however considerable were inadequate to sustain him in his internecine rivalry with the great sovereign of France In an authentic conversation which has descended to us held by William at the Hague with one of the prime abettors of the invasion the prince did not disguise his motives he said nothing but such a constitution as you have in England can have the credit that is necessary to raise such sums as a great war requires The prince came and used our constitution for his purpose he introduced into England the system of Dutch finance The principle of that system was to mortgage industry in order to protect property abstractedly nothing can be conceived more unjust its practice in England has been equally injurious In Holland with a small population engaged in the same pursuits in fact a nation of bankers the system was adapted to the circumstances which had created it All shared in the present spoil and therefore could endure the future burthen And so to this day Holland is sustained almost solely sustained by the vast capital thus created which still lingers amongst its dykes But applied to a country in which the circumstances were entirely different to a considerable and rapidly increasing population where there was a numerous peasantry a trading middle class struggling into existence the system of Dutch finance pursued more or less for nearly a century and a half has ended in the degradation of a fettered and burthened multitude Nor have the demoralizing consequences of the funding system on the more favoured classes been less decided It has made debt a national habit it has made credit the ruling power not the exceptional auxiliary of all transactions it has introduced a loose inexact haphazard and dishonest spirit in the conduct of both public and private life a spirit dazzling and yet dastardly reckless of consequences and yet shrinking from responsibility And in the end it has so overstimulated the energies of the population to maintain the material engagements of the state and of society at large that the moral condition of the people has been entirely lost sight of A mortgaged aristocracy a gambling foreign commerce a home trade founded on a morbid competition and a degraded people these are great evils but ought perhaps cheerfully to be encountered for the greater blessings of civil and religious liberty Yet the first would seem in some degree to depend upon our Saxon mode of trial by our peers upon the stipulations of the great Norman charters upon the practice and the statute of Habeas Corpus a principle native to our common law but established by the Stuarts nor in a careful perusal of the Bill of Rights or in an impartial scrutiny of the subsequent legislation of those times though some diminution of our political franchises must be confessed is it easy to discover any increase of our civil privileges To those indeed who believe that the English nation at all times a religious and Catholic people but who even in the days of the Plantagenets were anti papal were in any danger of again falling under the yoke of the Pope of Rome in the reign of James the Second religious liberty was perhaps acceptable though it took the shape of a discipline which at once anathematized a great portion of the nation and virtually establishing Puritanism in Ireland laid the foundation of those mischiefs which are now endangering the empire That the last of the Stuarts had any other object in his impolitic manoeuvres than an impracticable scheme to blend the two churches there is now authority to disbelieve He certainly was guilty of the offence of sending an envoy openly to Rome who by the bye was received by the Pope with great discourtesy and her Majesty Queen Victoria whose Protestantism cannot be doubted for it is one of her chief titles to our homage has at this time a secret envoy at the same court and that is the difference between them both ministers doubtless working however fruitlessly for the same object the termination of those terrible misconceptions political and religious that have occasioned so many martyrdoms and so many crimes alike to sovereigns and to subjects If James the Second had really attempted to re establish Popery in this country the English people who had no hand in his overthrow would doubtless soon have stirred and secured their Catholic and Apostolic church independent of any foreign dictation the church to which they still regularly profess their adherence and being a practical people it is possible that they might have achieved their object and yet retained their native princes under which circumstances we might have been saved from the triple blessings of Venetian politics Dutch finance and French wars against which in their happiest days and with their happiest powers struggled the three greatest of English statesmen Bolingbroke Shelburne and lastly the son of Chatham We have endeavoured in another work not we hope without something of the impartiality of the future to sketch the character and career of his successors From his death to eighteen twenty five the political history of England is a history of great events and little men The rise of mister Canning long kept down by the plebeian aristocracy of mister Pitt as an adventurer had shaken parties to their centre His rapid disappearance from the scene left both whigs and tories in a state of disorganization The distinctive principles of these connexions were now difficult to trace That period of public languor which intervenes between the breaking up of parties and the formation of factions now transpired in England An exhausted sensualist on the throne who only demanded from his ministers repose a voluptuous aristocracy and a listless people were content in the absence of all public conviction and national passion to consign the government of the country to a great man whose decision relieved the sovereign whose prejudices pleased the nobles and whose achievements dazzled the multitude The DUKE OF WELLINGTON brought to the post of first minister immortal fame a quality of success which would almost seem to include all others His public knowledge was such as might be expected from one whose conduct already formed an important portion of the history of his country He had a personal and intimate acquaintance with the sovereigns and chief statesmen of Europe a kind of information in which English ministers have generally been deficient but without which the management of our external affairs must at the best be haphazard He possessed administrative talents of the highest order The tone of the age the temper of the country the great qualities and the high character of the minister indicated a long and prosperous administration The only individual in his cabinet who from a combination of circumstances rather than from any intellectual supremacy over his colleagues was competent to be his rival was content to be his successor In his most aspiring moments mister Peel in all probability aimed at no higher reach and with youth and the leadership of the House of Commons one has no reason to be surprised at his moderation The conviction that the duke s government would only cease with the termination of his public career was so general that the moment he was installed in office the whigs smiled on him political conciliation became the slang of the day and the fusion of parties the babble of clubs and the tattle of boudoirs How comes it then that so great a man in so great a position should have so signally failed Should have broken up his government wrecked his party and so completely annihilated his political position that even with his historical reputation to sustain him he can since only re appear in the councils of his sovereign in a subordinate not to say equivocal character With all those great qualities which will secure him a place in our history not perhaps inferior even to Marlborough the Duke of Wellington has one deficiency which has been the stumbling block of his civil career Bishop Burnet in speculating on the extraordinary influence of Lord Shaftesbury and accounting how a statesman so inconsistent in his conduct and so false to his confederates should have so powerfully controlled his country observes HIS STRENGTH LAY IN HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLAND Now that is exactly the kind of knowledge which the Duke of Wellington never possessed When the king finding that in Lord Goderich he had a minister who instead of deciding asked his royal master for advice sent for the Duke of Wellington to undertake the government a change in the carriage of his grace was perceived by some who had the opportunity to form an opinion on such a subject If one might venture to use such a word in reference to such a man we might remark that the duke had been somewhat daunted by the selection of mister Canning It disappointed great hopes it baffled great plans and dispelled for a season the conviction that it is believed had been long maturing in his grace s mind that he was the man of the age that his military career had been only a preparation for a civil course not less illustrious and that it was reserved for him to control for the rest of his life undisputed the destinies of a country which was indebted to him in no slight degree for its European pre eminence The death of mister Canning revived the rout of Lord Goderich restored these views Napoleon at saint Helena speculating in conversation on the future career of his conqueror asked What will Wellington do After all he has done he will not be content to be quiet He will change the dynasty Had the great exile been better acquainted with the real character of our Venetian constitution he would have known that to govern England in eighteen twenty it was not necessary to change its dynasty But the Emperor though wrong in the main was right by the bye It was clear that the energies that had twice entered Paris as a conqueror and had made kings and mediatised princes at Vienna would not be content to subside into ermined insignificance The duke commenced his political tactics early The cabinet of Lord Liverpool especially during its latter term was the hot bed of many intrigues but the obstacles were numerous though the appointing fate in which his grace believed removed them The disappearance of Lord Castlereagh and mister Canning from the scene was alike unexpected The Duke of Wellington was at length prime minister and no individual ever occupied that post more conscious of its power and more determined to exercise it This is not the occasion on which we shall attempt to do justice to a theme so instructive as the administration of his grace Treated with impartiality and sufficient information it would be an invaluable contribution to the stores of our political knowledge and national experience Throughout its brief but eccentric and tumultuous annals we see continual proof how important is that knowledge in which lay Lord Shaftesbury s strength In twenty four months we find an aristocracy estranged without a people being conciliated while on two several occasions first the prejudices and then the pretensions of the middle class were alike treated with contumely The public was astonished at hearing of statesmen of long parliamentary fame men round whom the intelligence of the nation had gathered for years with confidence or at least with interest being expelled from the cabinet in a manner not unworthy of Colonel Joyce while their places were filled by second rate soldiers whose very names were unknown to the great body of the people and who under no circumstances should have aspired beyond the government of a colony This administration which commenced in arrogance ended in panic There was an interval of perplexity when occurred the most ludicrous instance extant of an attempt at coalition subordinates were promoted while negotiations were still pending with their chiefs and these negotiations undertaken so crudely were terminated in pique in a manner which added to political disappointment personal offence When even his parasites began to look gloomy the duke had a specific that was to restore all and having allowed every element of power to escape his grasp he believed he could balance everything by a beer bill The growl of reform was heard but it was not very fierce There was yet time to save himself His grace precipitated a revolution which might have been delayed for half a century and never need have occurred in so aggravated a form He rather fled than retired He commenced his ministry like Brennus and finished it like the tall Gaul sent to murder the rival of Sylla but who dropped his weapon before the undaunted gaze of his intended victim Lord Marney was spared the pang of the catastrophe Promoted to a high office in the household and still hoping that by the aid of his party it was yet destined for him to achieve the hereditary purpose of his family he died in the full faith of dukism worshipping the duke and believing that ultimately he should himself become a duke It was under all the circumstances an euthanasia he expired leaning as it were on his white wand and babbling of strawberry leaves Book one Chapter four My dear Charles said Lady Marney to Egremont the morning after the Derby as breakfasting with her in her boudoir he detailed some of the circumstances of the race we must forget your naughty horse I sent you a little note this morning because I wished to see you most particularly before you went out Affairs continued Lady Marney first looking round the chamber to see whether there were any fairy listening to her state secrets affairs are critical No doubt of that thought Egremont the horrid phantom of settling day seeming to obtrude itself between his mother and himself but not knowing precisely at what she was driving he merely sipped his tea and innocently replied Why There will be a dissolution said Lady Marney What are we coming in Lady Marney shook her head The present men will not better their majority said Egremont I hope not said Lady Marney Why you always said that with another general election we must come in whoever dissolved But that was with the court in our favour rejoined Lady Marney mournfully What has the king changed said Egremont I thought it was all right All was right said Lady Marney These men would have been turned out again had he only lived three months more Lived exclaimed Egremont Yes said Lady Marney the king is dying Slowly delivering himself of an ejaculation Egremont leant back in his chair He may live a month said Lady Marnev he cannot live two It is the greatest of secrets known at this moment only to four individuals and I communicate it to you my dear Charles in that absolute confidence which I hope will always subsist between us because it is an event that may greatly affect your career How so my dear mother Marbury I have settled with mister Tadpole that you shall stand for the old borough With the government in our hands as I had anticipated at the general election success I think was certain under the circumstances which we must encounter the struggle will be more severe but I think we shall do it and it will be a happy day for me to have our own again and to see you in Parliament my dear child Well my dear mother I should like very much to be in Parliament and particularly to sit for the old borough but I fear the contest will be very expensive said Egremont inquiringly Oh I have no doubt said Lady Marney that we shall have some monster of the middle class some tinker or tailor or candlestick maker with his long purse preaching reform and practising corruption exactly as the liberals did under Walpole bribery was unknown in the time of the Stuarts but we have a capital registration mister Tadpole tells me And a young candidate with the old name will tell said Lady Marney with a smile and I shall go down and canvass and we must do what we can I have great faith in your canvassing said Egremont but still at the same time the powder and shot Are essential said Lady Marney I know it in these corrupt days but Marney will of course supply those It is the least he can do regaining the family influence and letting us hold up our heads again I shall write to him the moment I am justified said Lady Marney perhaps you will do so yourself Charles Why considering I have not seen my brother for two years and we did not part on the best possible terms But that is all forgotten By your good offices dear mother who are always doing good and yet continued Egremont after a moment s pause I am not disposed to write to Marney especially to ask a favour Well I will write said Lady Marney though I cannot admit it is any favour Perhaps it would be better that you should see him first I cannot understand why he keeps so at the Abbey I am sure I found it a melancholy place enough in my time I wish you had gone down there Charles if it had been only for a few days Well I did not my dear mother and I cannot go now I shall trust to you But are you quite sure that the king is going to die I repeat to you it is certain replied Lady Marney in a lowered voice but a decided tone certain certain certain My authority cannot be mistaken but no consideration in the world must throw you off your guard at this moment breathe not the shadow of what you know At this moment a servant entered and delivered a note to Lady Marney who read it with an ironical smile It was from Lady saint Julians and ran thus Most confidential My dearest Lady Marney It is a false report he is ill but not dangerously the hay fever he always has it nothing more I will tell my authority when we meet I dare not write it It will satisfy you I am going on with my quadrille Most affectionately yours A saint J Poor woman she is always wrong said Lady Marney throwing the note to Egremont Her quadrille will never take place which is a pity as it is to consist only of beauties and eldest sons I suppose I must send her a line and she wrote My dearest Lady saint Julians How good of you to write to me and send me such cheering news I have no doubt you are right you always are I know he had the hay fever last year How fortunate for your quadrille and how charming it will be Let me know if you hear anything further from your unmentionable quarter Ever your affectionate C M Book one Chapter five Lord Marney left several children his heir was five years older than the next son Charles who at the period of his father s death was at Christchurch and had just entered the last year of his minority Attaining that age he received the sum of fifteen thousand pounds his portion a third of which amount his expenditure had then already anticipated Egremont had been brought up in the enjoyment of every comfort and every luxury that refinement could devise and wealth furnish He was a favourite child His parents emulated each other in pampering and indulging him Every freak was pardoned every whim was gratified He might ride what horses he liked and if he broke their knees what in another would have been deemed a flagrant sin was in him held only a proof of reckless spirit If he were not a thoroughly selfish and altogether wilful person but very much the reverse it was not the fault of his parents but rather the operation of a benignant nature that had bestowed on him a generous spirit and a tender heart though accompanied with a dangerous susceptibility that made him the child and creature of impulse and seemed to set at defiance even the course of time to engraft on his nature any quality of prudence The tone of Eton during the days of Charles Egremont was not of the high character which at present distinguishes that community It was the unforeseen eve of the great change that whatever was its purpose or have been its immediate results at least gave the first shock to the pseudo aristocracy of this country Then all was blooming sunshine and odour not a breeze disturbing the meridian splendour Then the world was not only made for a few but a very few One could almost tell upon one s fingers the happy families who could do anything and might have everything A school boy s ideas of the Church then were fat livings and of the State rotten boroughs To do nothing and get something formed a boy s ideal of a manly career There was nothing in the lot little in the temperament of Charles Egremont to make him an exception to the multitude Gaily and securely he floated on the brilliant stream Popular at school idolized at home the present had no cares and the future secured him a family seat in Parliament the moment he entered life and the inheritance of a glittering post at court in due time as its legitimate consequence Enjoyment not ambition seemed the principle of his existence The contingency of a mitre the certainty of rich preferment would not reconcile him to the self sacrifice which to a certain degree was required from a priest even in those days of rampant Erastianism He left the colonies as the spoil of his younger brothers his own ideas of a profession being limited to a barrack in a London park varied by visits to Windsor But there was time enough to think of these things He had to enjoy Oxford as he had enjoyed Eton Here his allowance from his father was extravagant though greatly increased by tithes from his mother s pin money While he was pursuing his studies hunting and boating driving tandems riding matches tempering his energies in the crapulence of boyish banquets and anticipating life at the risk of expulsion in a miserable mimicry of metropolitan dissipation Dukism that was supposed to be eternal suddenly crashed The Reform Act has not placed the administration of our affairs in abler hands than conducted them previously to the passing of the measure for the most efficient members of the present cabinet with some very few exceptions and those attended by peculiar circumstances were ministers before the Reform Act was contemplated Nor has that memorable statute created a Parliament of a higher reputation for public qualities such as politic ability and popular eloquence and national consideration than was furnished by the old scheme On the contrary one house of Parliament has been irremediably degraded into the decaying position of a mere court of registry possessing great privileges on condition that it never exercises them while the other chamber that at the first blush and to the superficial exhibits symptoms of almost unnatural vitality engrossing in its orbit all the business of the country assumes on a more studious inspection somewhat of the character of a select vestry fulfilling municipal rather than imperial offices and beleaguered by critical and clamorous millions who cannot comprehend why a privileged and exclusive senate is required to perform functions which immediately concern all which most personally comprehend and which many in their civic spheres believe they could accomplish in a manner not less satisfactory though certainly less ostentatious But if it have not furnished us with abler administrators or a more illustrious senate the Reform Act may have exercised on the country at large a beneficial influence Has it Has it elevated the tone of the public mind Has it cultured the popular sensibilities to noble and ennobling ends Has it proposed to the people of England a higher test of national respect and confidence than the debasing qualification universally prevalent in this country since the fatal introduction of the system of Dutch finance Who will pretend it If a spirit of rapacious coveteousness desecrating all the humanities of life has been the besetting sin of England for the last century and a half since the passing of the Reform Act the altar of Mammon has blazed with triple worship To acquire to accumulate to plunder each other by virtue of philosophic phrases to propose an Utopia to consist only of WEALTH and TOIL this has been the breathless business of enfranchised England for the last twelve years until we are startled from our voracious strife by the wail of intolerable serfage Are we then to conclude that the only effect of the Reform Act has been to create in this country another of those class interests which we now so loudly accuse as the obstacles to general amelioration Not exactly that The indirect influence of the Reform Act has been not inconsiderable and may eventually lead to vast consequences It set men a thinking it enlarged the horizon of political experience it led the public mind to ponder somewhat on the circumstances of our national history to pry into the beginnings of some social anomalies which they found were not so ancient as they had been led to believe and which had their origin in causes very different to what they had been educated to credit and insensibly it created and prepared a popular intelligence to which one can appeal no longer hopelessly in an attempt to dispel the mysteries with which for nearly three centuries it has been the labour of party writers to involve a national history and without the dispersion of which no political position can be understood and no social evil remedied The events of eighteen thirty did not produce any change in the modes of thought and life of Charles Egremont He took his political cue from his mother who was his constant correspondent Lady Marney was a distinguished stateswoman as they called Lady Carlisle in Charles the First s time a great friend of Lady saint Julians and one of the most eminent and impassioned votaries of Dukism Her first impression on the overthrow of her hero was astonishment at the impertinence of his adversaries mingled with some lofty pity for their silly ambition and short lived career She existed for a week in the delightful expectation of his grace being sent for again and informed every one in confidence that these people could not form a cabinet When the tocsin of peace reform and retrenchment sounded she smiled bitterly was sorry for poor Lord Grey of whom she had thought better and gave them a year adding with consoling malice that it would be another Canning affair At length came the Reform Bill itself and no one laughed more heartily than Lady Marney not even the House of Commons to whom it was presented The bill was thrown out and Lady Marney gave a grand ball to celebrate the event and to compensate the London shopkeepers for the loss of their projected franchise Lady Marney was preparing to resume her duties at court when to her great surprise the firing of cannon announced the dissolution of Parliament She turned pale she was too much in the secrets of Tadpole and Taper to be deceived as to the consequences she sank into her chair and denounced Lord Grey as a traitor to his order Lady Marney who for six months had been writing to her son at Oxford the most charming letters full of fun quizzing the whole Cabinet now announced to Egremont that a revolution was inevitable that all property would be instantly confiscated the poor deluded king led to the block or sent over to Hanover at the best and the whole of the nobility and principal gentry and indeed every one who possessed anything guillotined without remorse Whether his friends were immediately to resume power or whether their estates ultimately were to be confiscated the practical conclusion to Charles Egremont appeared to be the same Carpe diem He therefore pursued his career at Oxford unchanged and entered life in the year eighteen thirty three a younger son with extravagant tastes and expensive habits with a reputation for lively talents though uncultivated for his acquisitions at Eton had been quite puerile and subsequently he had not become a student with many manly accomplishments and with a mien and visage that at once took the fancy and enlisted the affections Indeed a physiologist would hardly have inferred from the countenance and structure of Egremont the career he had pursued or the character which attached to him The general cast and expression of his features when in repose was pensive an air of refinement distinguished his well moulded brow his mouth breathed sympathy and his rich brown eye gleamed with tenderness The sweetness of his voice in speaking was in harmony with this organization Two years passed in the most refined circles of our society exercised a beneficial influence on the general tone of Egremont and may be said to have finished his education He had the good sense and the good taste not to permit his predilection for sports to degenerate into slang he yielded himself to the delicate and profitable authority of woman and as ever happens it softened his manners and brightened his wit He was fortunate in having a clever mother and he appreciated this inestimable possession Lady Marney had great knowledge of society and some acquaintance with human nature which she fancied she had fathomed to its centre she piqued herself upon her tact and indeed she was very quick but she was so energetic that her art did not always conceal itself very worldly she was nevertheless not devoid of impulse she was animated and would have been extremely agreeable if she had not restlessly aspired to wit and would certainly have exercised much more influence in society if she had not been so anxious to show it Nevertheless still with many personal charms a frank and yet if need be a finished manner a quick brain a lively tongue a buoyant spirit and a great social position Lady Marney was universally and extremely popular and adored by her children for indeed she was a mother most affectionate and true When Egremont was four and twenty he fell in love a real passion He had fluttered like others from flower to flower and like others had often fancied the last perfume the sweetest and then had flown away But now he was entirely captivated The divinity was a new beauty the whole world raving of her Egremont also advanced The Lady Arabella was not only beautiful she was clever fascinating Her presence was inspiration at least for Egremont She condescended to be pleased by him she signalized him by her notice their names were mentioned together Egremont indulged in flattering dreams He regretted he had not pursued a profession he regretted he had impaired his slender patrimony thought of love in a cottage and renting a manor thought of living a good deal with his mother and a little with his brother thought of the law and the church thought once of New Zealand The favourite of nature and of fashion this was the first time in the life of Egremont that he had been made conscious that there was something in his position which with all its superficial brilliancy might prepare for him when youth had fled and the blaze of society grown dim a drear and bitter lot He was roused from his reveries by a painful change in the demeanour of his adored The mother of the Lady Arabella was alarmed She liked her daughter to be admired even by younger sons when they were distinguished but only at a distance mister Egremont s name had been mentioned too often It had appeared coupled with her daughters even in a Sunday paper The most decisive measures were requisite and they were taken Still smiling when they met still kind when they conversed it seemed by some magic dexterity which even baffled Egremont that their meetings every day grew rarer and their opportunities for conversation less frequent At the end of the season the Lady Arabella selected from a crowd of admirers equally qualified a young peer of great estate and of the old nobility a circumstance which as her grandfather had only been an East India director was very gratifying to the bride This unfortunate passion of Charles Egremont and its mortifying circumstances and consequences was just that earliest shock in one s life which occurs to all of us which first makes us think We have all experienced that disheartening catastrophe when the illusions first vanish and our balked imagination or our mortified vanity first intimates to us that we are neither infallible nor irresistible Happily tis the season of youth for which the first lessons of experience are destined and bitter and intolerable as is the first blight of our fresh feelings the sanguine impulse of early life bears us along Our first scrape generally leads to our first travel Disappointment requires change of air desperation change of scene Egremont quitted his country never to return to it again and returned to it after a year and a half s absence a much wiser man Having left England in a serious mood and having already tasted with tolerable freedom of the pleasures and frivolities of life he was not in an inapt humour to observe to enquire and to reflect The new objects that surrounded him excited his intelligence he met which indeed is the principal advantage of travel remarkable men whose conversation opened his mind His mind was worth opening Energies began to stir of which he had not been conscious awakened curiosity led him to investigate and to read he discovered that when he imagined his education was completed it had in fact not commenced and that although he had been at a public school and a university he in fact knew nothing To be conscious that you are ignorant is a great step to knowledge Before an emancipated intellect and an expanding intelligence the great system of exclusive manners and exclusive feelings in which he had been born and nurtured began to tremble the native generosity of his heart recoiled at a recurrence to that arrogant and frigid life alike devoid of sympathy and real grandeur In the early spring of eighteen thirty seven Egremont re entered the world where he had once sparkled and which he had once conceived to comprise within its circle all that could interest or occupy man His mother delighted at finding him again under her roof had removed some long standing coolness between him and his elder brother his former acquaintance greeted him with cordiality and introduced him to the new heroes who had sprung up during the season of his absence Apparently Egremont was not disinclined to pursue though without eagerness the same career that had originally engaged him He frequented assemblies and lingered in clubs rode in the park and lounged at the opera But there was this difference in his existence before and since his travels he was now conscious he wanted an object and was ever musing over action though as yet ignorant how to act Perhaps it was this want of being roused that led him it may be for distraction again to the turf It was a pursuit that seemed to him more real than the life of saloons full of affectation perverted ideas and factitious passions Whatever might be the impulse Egremont however was certainly not slightly interested in the Derby and though by no means uninstructed in the mysteries of the turf had felt such confidence in his information that with his usual ardour he had backed to a considerable amount the horse that ought to have won but which nevertheless only ran a second Book one Chapter six Notwithstanding the confidence of Lady saint Julians and her unrivalled information the health of the king did not improve but still it was the hay fever only the hay fever An admission had been allowed to creep into the Court Circular that his majesty has been slightly indisposed within the last few days but then it was soon followed by a very positive assurance that his majesty s favourite and long matured resolution to give a state banquet to the knights of the four orders was immediately to be carried into effect Lady saint Julians had the first information of this important circumstance it confirmed her original conviction she determined to go on with her quadrille Egremont with something interesting at stake himself was staggered by this announcement and by Lady saint Julians unshaken faith He consulted his mother Lady Marney shook her head Poor woman said Lady Marney she is always wrong I know continued her ladyship placing her finger to her lip that Prince Esterhazy has been pressing his long postponed investiture as a Grand Cross in order that he may dine at this very banquet and it has been announced to him that it is impossible the king s health will not admit of it When a simple investiture is impossible a state banquet to the four orders is very probable No said Lady Marney with a sigh it is a great blow for all of us but it is no use shutting our eyes to the fact The poor dear king will never show again And about a week after this there appeared the first bulletin From that instant though the gullish multitude studied the daily reports with grave interest their hopes and speculations and arrangements changing with each phrase for the initiated there was no suspense All knew that it was over and Lady saint Julians giving up her quadrille began to look about for seats in parliament for her sons What a happiness it is to have a clever mother exclaimed Egremont as he pondered over the returns of his election agent Lady Marney duly warned of the impending catastrophe was experiencing all the advantages of prior information It delighted her to meet Lady saint Julians driving distractedly about town calling at clubs closeted with red tapers making ingenious combinations that would not work by means of which some one of her sons was to stand in coalition with some rich parvenu to pay none of the expenses and yet to come in first And all this time Lady Marney serene and smiling had the daily pleasure of assuring Lady saint Julians what a relief it was to her that Charles had fixed on his place It had been arranged indeed these weeks past but then you know concluded Lady Marney in the sweetest voice and with a blandishing glance I never did believe in that hay fever In the meantime the impending event changed the whole aspect of the political world The king dying before the new registration was the greatest blow to pseudo toryism since his majesty calling for a hackney coach went down and dissolved parliament in eighteen thirty one It was calculated by the Tadpoles and Tapers that a dissolution by Sir Robert after the registration of eighteen thirty seven would give him a clear majority not too great a one but large enough a manageable majority some five and twenty or thirty men who with a probable peerage or two dangling in the distance half a dozen positive baronetcies the Customs for their constituents and Court balls for their wives might be induced to save the state zero England glorious and ancient realm the fortunes of thy polity are indeed strange The wisdom of the Saxons Norman valour the state craft of the Tudors the national sympathies of the Stuarts the spirit of the latter Guelphs struggling against their enslaved sovereignty these are the high qualities that for a thousand years have secured thy national developement And now all thy memorial dynasties end in the huckstering rule of some thirty unknown and anonymous jobbers The Thirty at Athens were at least tyrants They were marked men But the obscure majority who under our present constitution are destined to govern England are as secret as a Venetian conclave Yet on their dark voices all depends Would you promote or prevent some great measure that may affect the destinies of unborn millions and the future character of the people take for example a system of national education the minister must apportion the plunder to the illiterate clan the scum that floats on the surface of a party or hold out the prospect of honours which are only honourable when in their transmission they impart and receive lustre when they are the meed of public virtue and public services and the distinction of worth and of genius It is impossible that the system of the thirty can long endure in an age of inquiry and agitated spirit like the present Such a system may suit the balanced interests and the periodical and alternate command of rival oligarchical connections but it can subsist only by the subordination of the sovereign and the degradation of the multitude and cannot accord with an age whose genius will soon confess that Power and the People are both divine He can t last ten days said a whig secretary of the treasury with a triumphant glance at mister Taper as they met in Pall Mall You re out for our lives Don t you make too sure for yourselves rejoined in despair the dismayed Taper It does not follow that because we are out that you are in How do you mean There is such a person as Lord Durham in the world said mister Taper very solemnly Pish said the secretary You may pish said mister Taper but if we have a radical government as I believe and hope they will not be able to get up the steam as they did in thirty one and what with church and corn together and the Queen Dowager we may go to the country with as good a cry as some other persons I will back Melbourne against the field now said the secretary Lord Durham dined at Kensington on Thursday said Taper and not a whig present Ay Durham talks very fine at dinner said the secretary but he has no real go in him When there is a Prince of Wales Lord Melbourne means to make Durham governor to the heir apparent and that will keep him quiet What do you hear said mister Tadpole joining them I am told he has quite rallied Don t you flatter yourself said the secretary Well we shall hear what they say on the hustings said Tadpole looking boldly Who s afraid said the secretary No no my dear fellow you are dead beat the stake is worth playing for and don t suppose we are such flats as to lose the race for want of jockeying Your humbugging registration will never do against a new reign Our great men mean to shell out I tell you we have got Croucher we will denounce the Carlton and corruption all over the kingdom and if that won t do we will swear till we are black in the face that the King of Hanover is engaged in a plot to dethrone our young Queen and the triumphant secretary wished the worthy pair good morning They certainly have a very good cry said Taper mournfully After all the registration might be better said Tadpole but still it is a very good one The daily bulletins became more significant the crisis was evidently at hand A dissolution of parliament at any time must occasion great excitement combined with a new reign it inflames the passions of every class of the community Even the poor begin to hope the old wholesome superstition still lingers that the sovereign can exercise power and the suffering multitude are fain to believe that its remedial character may be about to be revealed in their instance As for the aristocracy in a new reign they are all in a flutter A bewildering vision of coronets stars and ribbons smiles and places at court haunts their noontide speculations and their midnight dreams Then we must not forget the numberless instances in which the coming event is deemed to supply the long sought opportunity of distinction or the long dreaded cause of utter discomfiture the hundreds the thousands who mean to get into parliament the units who dread getting out What a crashing change from lounging in saint James s street to sauntering on Boulogne pier or after dining at Brookes and supping at Crockford s to be saved from destruction by the friendly interposition that sends you in an official capacity to the marsupial sympathies of Sydney or Swan River Now is the time for the men to come forward who have claims claims for spending their money which nobody asked them to do but which of course they only did for the sake of the party They never wrote for their party or spoke for their party or gave their party any other vote than their own but they urge their claims to something a commissionership of anything or a consulship anywhere if no place to be had they are ready to take it out in dignities They once looked to the privy council but would now be content with an hereditary honour if they can have neither they will take a clerkship in the Treasury for a younger son Perhaps they may get that in time at present they go away growling with a gaugership or having with desperate dexterity at length contrived to transform a tidewaiter into a landwaiter But there is nothing like asking except refusing Hark it tolls All is over The great bell of the metropolitan cathedral announces the death of the last son of George the Third who probably will ever reign in England He was a good man with feelings and sympathies deficient in culture rather than ability with a sense of duty and with something of the conception of what should be the character of an English monarch Peace to his manes We are summoned to a different scene In a palace in a garden not in a haughty keep proud with the fame but dark with the violence of ages not in a regal pile bright with the splendour but soiled with the intrigues of courts and factions in a palace in a garden meet scene for youth and innocence and beauty came the voice that told the maiden she must ascend her throne The council of England is summoned for the first time within her bowers There are assembled the prelates and captains and chief men of her realm the priests of the religion that consoles the heroes of the sword that has conquered the votaries of the craft that has decided the fate of empires men grey with thought and fame and age who are the stewards of divine mysteries who have encountered in battle the hosts of Europe who have toiled in secret cabinets who have struggled in the less merciful strife of aspiring senates men too some of them lords of a thousand vassals and chief proprietors of provinces yet not one of them whose heart does not at this moment tremble as he awaits the first presence of the maiden who must now ascend her throne A hum of half suppressed conversation which would attempt to conceal the excitement which some of the greatest of them have since acknowledged fills that brilliant assemblage that sea of plumes and glittering stars and gorgeous dresses Hush the portals open She comes The silence is as deep as that of a noontide forest Attended for a moment by her royal mother and the ladies of her court who bow and then retire VICTORIA ascends her throne a girl alone and for the first time amid an assemblage of men In a sweet and thrilling voice and with a composed mien which indicates rather the absorbing sense of august duty than an absence of emotion THE QUEEN announces her accession to the throne of her ancestors and her humble hope that divine providence will guard over the fulfilment of her lofty trust The prelates and captains and chief men of her realm then advance to the throne and kneeling before her pledge their troth and take the sacred oaths of allegiance and supremacy Allegiance to one who rules over the land that the great Macedonian could not conquer and over a continent of which even Columbus never dreamed to the Queen of every sea and of nations in every zone It is not of these that I would speak but of a nation nearer her foot stool and which at this moment looks to her with anxiety with affection perhaps with hope Fair and serene she has the blood and beauty of the Saxon Will it be her proud destiny at length to bear relief to suffering millions and with that soft hand which might inspire troubadours and guerdon knights break the last links in the chain of Saxon thraldom END OF THE FIRST BOOK BOOK II Book two Chapter one The building which was still called MARNEY ABBEY though remote from the site of the ancient monastery was an extensive structure raised at the latter end of the reign of James the First and in the stately and picturesque style of that age Placed on a noble elevation in the centre of an extensive and well wooded park it presented a front with two projecting wings of equal dimensions with the centre so that the form of the building was that of a quadrangle less one of its sides Its ancient lattices had been removed and the present windows though convenient accorded little with the structure the old entrance door in the centre of the building however still remained a wondrous specimen of fantastic carving Ionic columns of black oak with a profusion of fruits and flowers and heads of stags and sylvans The whole of the building was crowned with a considerable pediment of what seemed at the first glance fanciful open work but which examined more nearly offered in gigantic letters the motto of the house of Marney The portal opened to a hall such as is now rarely found with the dais the screen the gallery and the buttery hatch all perfect and all of carved black oak Modern luxury and the refined taste of the lady of the late lord had made Marney Abbey as remarkable for its comfort and pleasantness of accommodation as for its ancient state and splendour The apartments were in general furnished with all the cheerful ease and brilliancy of the modern mansion of a noble but the grand gallery of the seventeenth century was still preserved and was used on great occasions as the chief reception room You ascended the principal staircase to reach it through a long corridor It occupied the whole length of one of the wings was one hundred feet long and forty five feet broad its walls hung with a collection of choice pictures rich in history while the Axminster carpets the cabinets carved tables and variety of easy chairs ingeniously grouped imparted even to this palatian chamber a lively and habitable air Lord Marney was several years the senior of Charles Egremont yet still a young man He was handsome there was indeed a general resemblance between the brothers though the expression of their countenances was entirely different of the same height and air and throughout the features a certain family cast but here the likeness ceased The countenance of Lord Marney bespoke the character of his mind cynical devoid of sentiment arrogant literal hard He had no imagination had exhausted his slight native feeling but he was acute disputatious and firm even to obstinacy Though his early education had been very imperfect he had subsequently read a good deal especially in French literature He had formed his mind by Helvetius whose system he deemed irrefutable and in whom alone he had faith Armed with the principles of his great master he believed he could pass through existence in adamantine armour and always gave you in the business of life the idea of a man who was conscious you were trying to take him in and rather respected you for it but the working of whose cold unkind eye defied you There never had been excessive cordiality between the brothers even in their boyish days and shortly after Egremont s entrance into life they had become estranged They were to meet now for the first time since Egremont s return from the continent Their mother had arranged their reconciliation They were to meet as if no misunderstanding had ever existed between them it was specially stipulated by Lord Marney that there was to be no scene Apprised of Egremont s impending arrival Lord Marney was careful to be detained late that day at petty sessions and entered the room only a few minutes before dinner was announced where he found Egremont not only with the countess and a young lady who was staying with her but with additional bail against any ebullition of sentiment in the shape of the Vicar of Marney and a certain Captain Grouse who was a kind of aide de camp of the earl killed birds and carved them played billiards with him and lost had indeed every accomplishment that could please woman or ease man could sing dance draw make artificial flies break horses exercise a supervision over stewards and bailiffs and make every body comfortable by taking everything on his own shoulders Lady Marney had received Egremont in a manner which expressed the extreme satisfaction she experienced at finding him once more beneath his brother s roof When he arrived indeed he would have preferred to have been shown at once to his rooms but a message immediately delivered expressed the wish of his sister in law at once to see him She received him alone and with great warmth She was beautiful and soft as May a glowing yet delicate face rich brown hair and large blue eyes not yet a mother but with something of the dignity of the matron blending with the lingering timidity of the girl Egremont was glad to join his sister in law again in the drawing room before dinner He seated himself by her side and in answer to her enquiries was giving her some narrative of his travels the Vicar who was very low church was shaking his head at Lady Marney s young friend who was enlarging on the excellence of mister Paget s tales while Captain Grouse in a very stiff white neck cloth very tight pantaloons to show his very celebrated legs transparent stockings and polished shoes was throwing himself into attitudes in the back ground and with a zeal amounting almost to enthusiasm teaching Lady Marney s spaniel to beg when the door opened and Lord Marney entered but as if to make security doubly sure not alone He was accompanied by a neighbour and brother magistrate Sir Vavasour Firebrace a baronet of the earliest batch and a gentleman of great family and great estate Well Charles How are you George And the brothers shook hands Tis the English way and if they had been inclined to fall into each other s arms they would not probably have done more In a few minutes it was announced that dinner was served and so secured from a scene having a fair appetite and surrounded by dishes that could agreeably satisfy it a kind of vague fraternal sentiment began to stir the breast of Lord Marney he really was glad to see his brother again remembered the days when they rode their poneys and played cricket his voice softened his eyes sparkled and he at length exclaimed Do you know old fellow it makes me quite happy to see you here again Suppose we take a glass of wine The softer heart and more susceptible spirit of Egremont were well calculated to respond to this ebullition of feeling however slight and truly it was for many reasons not without considerable emotion that he found himself once more at Marney He sate by the side of his gentle sister in law who seemed pleased by the unwonted cordiality of her husband and anxious by many kind offices to second every indication of good feeling on his part Captain Grouse was extremely assiduous the vicar was of the deferential breed agreed with Lady Marney on the importance of infant schools but recalled his opinion when Lord Marney expressed his imperious hope that no infant schools would ever be found in his neighbourhood Sir Vavasour was more than middle aged comely very gentlemanlike but with an air occasionally of absence which hardly agreed with his frank and somewhat hearty idiosyncracy his clear brow florid complexion and blue eye But Lord Marney talked a good deal though chiefly dogmatical or argumentative It was rather difficult for him to find a sufficient stock of opposition but he laid in wait and seized every opening with wonderful alacrity Even Captain Grouse could not escape him if driven to extremity Lord Marney would even question his principles on fly making Captain Grouse gave up but not too soon he was well aware that his noble friend s passion for controversy was equal to his love of conquest As for Lady Marney it was evident that with no inconsiderable talents and with an intelligence richly cultivated the controversial genius of her husband had completely cowed her conversational charms She never advanced a proposition that he did not immediately bristle up and she could only evade the encounter by a graceful submission As for the vicar a frequent guest he would fain have taken refuge in silence but the earl especially when alone would what he called draw him out and the game once unearthed with so skilled a pack there was but little fear of a bad run When all were reduced to silence Lord Marney relinquishing controversy assumed the positive He eulogized the new poor law which he declared would be the salvation of the country provided it was carried out in the spirit in which it was developed in the Marney Union but then he would add that there was no district except their union in which it was properly observed He was tremendously fierce against allotments and analysed the system with merciless sarcasm Indeed he had no inconsiderable acquaintance with the doctrines of the economists and was rather inclined to carry them into practice in every instance except that of the landed proprietary which he clearly proved stood upon different grounds to that of any other interest There was nothing he hated so much as a poacher except a lease though perhaps in the catalogue of his aversions we ought to give the preference to his anti ecclesiastical prejudice this amounted even to acrimony Though there was no man breathing who was possessed with such a strong repugnance to subscriptions of any kind it delighted Lord Marney to see his name among the contributors to all sectarian institutions The vicar of Marney who had been presented by himself was his model of a priest he left every body alone Under the influence of Lady Marney the worthy vicar had once warmed up into some ebullition of very low church zeal there was some talk of an evening lecture the schools were to be remodelled certain tracts were actually distributed But Lord Marney soon stopped all this No priestcraft at Marney said this gentle proprietor of abbey lands I wanted very much to come and canvass for you said Lady Marney to Egremont but George did not like it The less the family interfered the better said Lord Marney and for my part I was very much alarmed when I heard my mother had gone down Oh my mother did wonders said Egremont we should have been beat without her Indeed to tell the truth I quite gave up the thing the moment they started their man Before that we were on velvet but the instant he appeared everything was changed and I found some of my warmest supporters members of his committee You had a formidable opponent Lord Marney told me said Sir Vavasour Who was he Oh a dreadful man A Scotchman richer than Croesus one McDruggy fresh from Canton with a million of opium in each pocket denouncing corruption and bellowing free trade But they do not care much for free trade in the old borough said Lord Marney No it was a mistake said Egremont and the cry was changed the moment my opponent was on the ground Then all the town was placarded with Vote for McDruggy and our young Queen as if he had coalesced with her Majesty My mother must have been in despair said Lord Marney We issued our placard instantly of Vote for our young Queen and Egremont which was at least more modest and turned out more popular That I am sure was my mother said Lord Marney No said Egremont it was the effusion of a far more experienced mind My mother was in hourly communication with head quarters and mister Taper sent down the cry by express Peel in or out will support the Poor Law said Lord Marney rather audaciously as he reseated himself after the ladies had retired He must and he looked at his brother whose return had in a great degree been secured by crying that Poor Law down It is impossible said Charles fresh from the hustings and speaking from the card of Taper for the condition of the people was a subject of which he knew nothing He will carry it out said Lord Marney you ll see or the land will not support him I wish said Sir Vavasour we could manage some modification about out door relief Modification said Lord Marney why there has been nothing but modification What we want is stringency The people will never bear it said Egremont there must be some change You cannot go back to the abuses of the old system said Captain Grouse making as he thought a safe observation Better go back to the old system than modify the new said Lord Marney I wish the people would take to it a little more said Sir Vavasour they certainly do not like it in our parish The people are very contented here eh Slimsey said Lord Marney Very said the vicar Hereupon a conversation took place principally sustained by the earl and the baronet which developed all the resources of the great parochial mind Dietaries bastardy gaol regulations game laws were amply discussed and Lord Marney wound up with a declaration of the means by which the country might be saved and which seemed principally to consist of high prices and low church If the sovereign could only know her best friends said Sir Vavasour with a sigh Lord Marney seemed to get uneasy And avoid the fatal mistakes of her predecessor continued the baronet Charles another glass of claret said the earl She might yet rally round the throne a body of men Then we will go to the ladies said the earl abruptly disturbing his guest Book two Chapter two There was music as they re entered the drawing room Sir Vavasour attached himself to Egremont It is a great pleasure for me to see you again mister Egremont said the worthy baronet Your father was my earliest and kindest friend I remember you at Firebrace a very little boy Happy to see you again Sir in so eminent a position a legislator one of our legislators It gave me a sincere satisfaction to observe your return You are very kind Sir Vavasour But it is a responsible position continued the baronet Think you they ll stand A majority I suppose they have but I conclude in time Sir Robert will have it in time We must not be in a hurry the more haste you know the rest The country is decidedly conservative All that we want now is a strong government that will put all things to rights If the poor king had lived He would have sent these men to the right abouts said Egremont a young politician proud of his secret intelligence Ah the poor king said Sir Vavasour shaking his head He was entirely with us said Egremont Poor man said Sir Vavasour You think it was too late then said his companion You are a young man entering political life said the baronet taking Egremont kindly by the arm and leading him to a sofa everything depends on the first step You have a great opportunity Nothing can be done by a mere individual The most powerful body in this country wants a champion But you can depend on Peel said Egremont He is one of us we ought to be able to depend on him But I have spoken to him for an hour and could get nothing out of him He is cautious but depend upon it he will stand or fall by the land I am not thinking of the land said Sir Vavasour of something much more important with all the influence of the land and a great deal more besides of an order of men who are ready to rally round the throne and are indeed if justice were done to them its natural and hereditary champions Egremont looked perplexity I am speaking added Sir Vavasour in a solemn voice I am speaking of the baronets The baronets And what do they want Their rights their long withheld rights The poor king was with us He has frequently expressed to me and other deputies his determination to do us justice but he was not a strong minded man said Sir Vavasour with a sigh and in these revolutionary and levelling times he had a hard task perhaps And the peers who are our brethren they were I fear against us But in spite of the ministers and in spite of the peers had the poor king lived we should at least have had the badge added Sir Vavasour mournfully The badge It would have satisfied Sir Grosvenor le Draughte said Sir Vavasour and he had a strong party with him he was for compromise but d him his father was only an accoucheur And you wanted more inquired Egremont with a demure look All or nothing said Sir Vavasour principle is ever my motto no expediency I made a speech to the order at the Clarendon there were four hundred of us the feeling was very strong A powerful party said Egremont And a military order sir if properly understood What could stand against us The Reform Bill could never have passed if the baronets had been organized I have no doubt you could bring us in now said Egremont That is exactly what I told Sir Robert I want him to be brought in by his own order It would be a grand thing There is nothing like esprit de corps said Egremont And such a body exclaimed Sir Vavasour with animation Picture us for a moment to yourself going down in procession to Westminster for example to hold a chapter Five or six hundred baronets in dark green costume the appropriate dress of equites aurati each not only with his badge but with his collar of S S belted and scarfed his star glittering his pennon flying his hat white with a plume of white feathers of course the sword and the gilt spurs In our hand the thumb ring and signet not forgotten we hold our coronet of two balls Egremont stared with irrepressible astonishment at the excited being who unconsciously pressed his companion s arm as he drew this rapid sketch of the glories so unconstitutionally withheld from him A magnificent spectacle said Egremont Evidently the body destined to save this country eagerly continued Sir Vavasour Blending all sympathies the crown of which they are the peculiar champions the nobles of whom they are the popular branch the people who recognize in them their natural leaders But the picture is not complete We should be accompanied by an equal number of gallant knights our elder sons who the moment they come of age have the right to claim knighthood of their sovereign while their mothers and wives no longer degraded to the nomenclature of a sheriff s lady but resuming their legal or analogical dignities and styled the honourable baronetess with her coronet and robe or the honourable knightess with her golden collar of S S and chaplet or cap of dignity may either accompany the procession or ranged in galleries in a becoming situation rain influence from above I am all for their going in the procession said Egremont The point is not so clear said Sir Vavasour solemnly and indeed although we have been firm in defining our rightful claims in our petitions as for honorary epithets secondary titles personal decorations and augmented heraldic bearings I am not clear if the government evinced a disposition for a liberal settlement of the question I would not urge a too stringent adherence to every point For instance I am prepared myself great as would be the sacrifice even to renounce the claim of secondary titles for our eldest sons if for instance they would secure us our coronet Fie fie Sir Vavasour said Egremont very seriously remember principle no expediency no compromise You are right said the baronet colouring a little and do you know mister Egremont you are the only individual I have yet met out of the Order who has taken a sensible view of this great question which after all is the question of the day Book two Chapter three The situation of the rural town of Marney was one of the most delightful easily to be imagined In a spreading dale contiguous to the margin of a clear and lively stream surrounded by meadows and gardens and backed by lofty hills undulating and richly wooded the traveller on the opposite heights of the dale would often stop to admire the merry prospect that recalled to him the traditional epithet of his country Beautiful illusion For behind that laughing landscape penury and disease fed upon the vitals of a miserable population The contrast between the interior of the town and its external aspect was as striking as it was full of pain With the exception of the dull high street which had the usual characteristics of a small agricultural market town some sombre mansions a dingy inn and a petty bourse Marney mainly consisted of a variety of narrow and crowded lanes formed by cottages built of rubble or unhewn stones without cement and from age or badness of the material looking as if they could scarcely hold together The gaping chinks admitted every blast the leaning chimneys had lost half their original height the rotten rafters were evidently misplaced while in many instances the thatch yawning in some parts to admit the wind and wet and in all utterly unfit for its original purpose of giving protection from the weather looked more like the top of a dunghill than a cottage Before the doors of these dwellings and often surrounding them ran open drains full of animal and vegetable refuse decomposing into disease or sometimes in their imperfect course filling foul pits or spreading into stagnant pools while a concentrated solution of every species of dissolving filth was allowed to soak through and thoroughly impregnate the walls and ground adjoining These wretched tenements seldom consisted of more than two rooms in one of which the whole family however numerous were obliged to sleep without distinction of age or sex or suffering With the water streaming down the walls the light distinguished through the roof with no hearth even in winter the virtuous mother in the sacred pangs of childbirth gives forth another victim to our thoughtless civilization surrounded by three generations whose inevitable presence is more painful than her sufferings in that hour of travail while the father of her coming child in another corner of the sordid chamber lies stricken by that typhus which his contaminating dwelling has breathed into his veins and for whose next prey is perhaps destined his new born child These swarming walls had neither windows nor doors sufficient to keep out the weather or admit the sun or supply the means of ventilation the humid and putrid roof of thatch exhaling malaria like all other decaying vegetable matter The dwelling rooms were neither boarded nor paved and whether it were that some were situate in low and damp places occasionally flooded by the river and usually much below the level of the road or that the springs as was often the case would burst through the mud floor the ground was at no time better than so much clay while sometimes you might see little channels cut from the centre under the doorways to carry off the water the door itself removed from its hinges a resting place for infancy in its deluged home These hovels were in many instances not provided with the commonest conveniences of the rudest police contiguous to every door might be observed the dung heap on which every kind of filth was accumulated for the purpose of being disposed of for manure so that when the poor man opened his narrow habitation in the hope of refreshing it with the breeze of summer he was met with a mixture of gases from reeking dunghills This town of Marney was a metropolis of agricultural labour for the proprietors of the neighbourhood having for the last half century acted on the system of destroying the cottages on their estates in order to become exempted from the maintenance of the population the expelled people had flocked to Marney where during the war a manufactory had afforded them some relief though its wheels had long ceased to disturb the waters of the Mar Deprived of this resource they had again gradually spread themselves over that land which had as it were rejected them and obtained from its churlish breast a niggardly subsistence Their re entrance into the surrounding parishes was viewed with great suspicion their renewed settlement opposed by every ingenious contrivance those who availed themselves of their labour were careful that they should not become dwellers on the soil and though from the excessive competition there were few districts in the kingdom where the rate of wages was more depressed those who were fortunate enough to obtain the scant remuneration had in addition to their toil to endure each morn and even a weary journey before they could reach the scene of their labour or return to the squalid hovel which profaned the name of home To that home over which Malaria hovered and round whose shivering hearth were clustered other guests besides the exhausted family of toil Fever in every form pale Consumption exhausting Synochus and trembling Ague returned after cultivating the broad fields of merry England the bold British peasant returned to encounter the worst of diseases with a frame the least qualified to oppose them a frame that subdued by toil was never sustained by animal food drenched by the tempest could not change its dripping rags and was indebted for its scanty fuel to the windfalls of the woods The eyes of this unhappy race might have been raised to the solitary spire that sprang up in the midst of them the bearer of present consolation the harbinger of future equality but Holy Church at Marney had forgotten her sacred mission We have introduced the reader to the vicar an orderly man who deemed he did his duty if he preached each week two sermons and enforced humility on his congregation and gratitude for the blessings of this life The high Street and some neighbouring gentry were the staple of his hearers Lord and Lady Marney came attended by Captain Grouse every Sunday morning with commendable regularity and were ushered into the invisible interior of a vast pew that occupied half of the gallery was lined with crimson damask and furnished with easy chairs and for those who chose them well padded stools of prayer The people of Marney took refuge in conventicles which abounded little plain buildings of pale brick with the names painted on them of Sion Bethel Bethesda names of a distant land and the language of a persecuted and ancient race yet such is the mysterious power of their divine quality breathing consolation in the nineteenth century to the harassed forms and the harrowed souls of a Saxon peasantry But however devoted to his flock might have been the Vicar of Marney his exertions for their well being under any circumstances must have been mainly limited to spiritual consolation Married and a father he received for his labours the small tithes of the parish which secured to him an income by no means equal to that of a superior banker s clerk or the cook of a great loanmonger The great tithes of Marney which might be counted by thousands swelled the vast rental which was drawn from this district by the fortunate earls that bore its name The morning after the arrival of Egremont at the Abbey an unusual stir might have been observed in the high Street of the town Round the portico of the Green Dragon hotel and commercial inn a knot of principal personages the chief lawyer the brewer the vicar himself and several of those easy quidnuncs who abound in country towns and who rank under the designation of retired gentlemen were in close and very earnest converse In a short time a servant on horseback in the Abbey livery galloped up to the portico and delivered a letter to the vicar The excitement apparently had now greatly increased On the opposite side of the way to the important group a knot larger in numbers but very deficient in quality had formed themselves and remained transfixed with gaping mouths and a Curious not to say alarmed air The head constable walked up to the door of the Green Dragon and though he did not presume to join the principal group was evidently in attendance if required The clock struck eleven a cart had stopped to watch events and a gentleman s coachman riding home with a led horse Here they are said the brewer Lord Marney himself said the lawyer And Sir Vavasour Firebrace I declare I wonder how he came here said a retired gentleman who had been a tallow chandler on Holborn Hill The vicar took off his hat and all uncovered Lord Marney and his brother magistrate rode briskly up to the inn and rapidly dismounted Well Snigford said his lordship in a peremptory tone this is a pretty business I ll have this stopped directly Fortunate man if he succeed in doing so The torch of the incendiary had for the first time been introduced into the parish of Marney and last night the primest stacks of the Abbey farm had blazed a beacon to the agitated neighbourhood Book two Chapter four It is not so much the fire sir said mister Bingley of the Abbey farm to Egremont but the temper of the people that alarms me Do you know sir there were two or three score of them here and except my own farm servants not one of them would lend a helping hand to put out the flames though with water so near they might have been of great service You told my brother Lord Marney this Oh it s mister Charles I m speaking to My service to you sir I m glad to see you in these parts again It s a long time that we have had that pleasure sir Travelling in foreign parts as I have heard say Something of that but very glad to find myself at home once more mister Bingley though very sorry to have such a welcome as a blazing rick at the Abbey farm Well do you know mister Charles between ourselves and mister Bingley lowered his tone and looked around him Things is very bad here I can t make out for my part what has become of the country Tayn t the same land to live in as it was when you used to come to our moor coursing with the old lord you remember that I be sure mister Charles Tis not easy to forget good sport mister Bingley With your permission I will put my horse up here for half an hour I have a fancy to stroll to the ruins You wunna find them much changed said the farmer smiling They have seen a deal of different things in their time But you will taste our ale mister Charles When I return But the hospitable Bingley would take no denial and as his companion waived on the present occasion entering his house for the sun had been some time declining the farmer calling one of his labourers to take Egremont s horse hastened into the house to fill the brimming cup And what do you think of this fire said Egremont to the hind I think tis hard times for the poor sir But rick burning will not make the times easier my good man The man made no reply but with a dogged look led away the horse to his stable About half a mile from Marney the dale narrowed and the river took a winding course It ran through meads soft and vivid with luxuriant vegetation bounded on either side by rich hanging woods save where occasionally a quarry broke the verdant bosom of the heights with its rugged and tawny form Fair stone and plenteous timber and the current of fresh waters combined with the silent and secluded scene screened from every harsh and angry wind to form the sacred spot that in old days Holy Church loved to hallow with its beauteous and enduring structures Even the stranger therefore when he had left the town about two miles behind him and had heard the farm and mill which he had since passed called the Abbey farm and the Abbey mill might have been prepared for the grateful vision of some monastic remains As for Egremont he had been almost born amid the ruins of Marney Abbey its solemn relics were associated with his first and freshest fancies every footstep was as familiar to him as it could have been to one of the old monks yet never without emotion could he behold these unrivalled remains of one of the greatest of the great religious houses of the North Over a space of not less than ten acres might still be observed the fragments of the great abbey these were towards their limit in general moss grown and mouldering memorials that told where once rose the offices and spread the terraced gardens of the old proprietors here might still be traced the dwelling of the lord abbot and there still more distinctly because built on a greater scale and of materials still more intended for perpetuity the capacious hospital a name that did not then denote the dwelling of disease but a place where all the rights of hospitality were practised where the traveller from the proud baron to the lonely pilgrim asked the shelter and the succour that never were denied and at whose gate called the Portal of the Poor the peasants on the Abbey lands if in want might appeal each morn and night for raiment and for food But it was in the centre of this tract of ruins occupying a space of not less than two acres that with a strength that had defied time and with a beauty that had at last turned away the wrath of man still rose if not in perfect yet admirable form and state one of the noblest achievements of Christian art the Abbey church The summer vault was now its only roof and all that remained of its gorgeous windows was the vastness of their arched symmetry and some wreathed relics of their fantastic frame work but the rest was uninjured From the west window looking over the transept chapel of the Virgin still adorned with pillars of marble and alabaster the eye wandered down the nave to the great orient light a length of nearly three hundred feet through a gorgeous avenue of unshaken walls and columns that clustered to the skies On each side of the Lady s chapel rose a tower One which was of great antiquity being of that style which is commonly called Norman short and very thick and square did not mount much above the height of the western front but the other tower was of a character very different It was tall and light and of a Gothic style most pure and graceful the stone of which it was built of a bright and even sparkling colour and looking as if it were hewn but yesterday At first its turretted crest seemed injured but the truth is it was unfinished the workmen were busied on this very tower the day that old Baldwin Greymount came as the king s commissioner to inquire into the conduct of this religious house The abbots loved to memorise their reigns by some public work which should add to the beauty of their buildings or the convenience of their subjects and the last of the ecclesiastical lords of Marney a man of fine taste and a skilful architect was raising this new belfry for his brethren when the stern decree arrived that the bells should no more sound And the hymn was no more to be chaunted in the Lady s chapel and the candles were no more to be lit on the high altar and the gate of the poor was to be closed for ever and the wanderer was no more to find a home The body of the church was in many parts overgrown with brambles and in all covered with a rank vegetation It had been a very sultry day and the blaze of the meridian heat still inflamed the air the kine for shelter rather than for sustenance had wandered through some broken arches and were lying in the shadow of the nave This desecration of a spot once sacred still beautiful and solemn jarred on the feelings of Egremont He sighed and turning away followed a path that after a few paces led him into the cloister garden This was a considerable quadrangle once surrounding the garden of the monks but all that remained of that fair pleasaunce was a solitary yew in its centre that seemed the oldest tree that could well live and was according to tradition more ancient than the most venerable walls of the Abbey Round this quadrangle was the refectory the library and the kitchen and above them the cells and dormitory of the brethren An imperfect staircase not without danger led to these unroofed chambers but Egremont familiar with the way did not hesitate to pursue it so that he soon found himself on an elevation overlooking the garden while further on extended the vast cloisters of the monks and adjoining was a cemetery that had once been enclosed and communicated with the cloister garden It was one of those summer days that are so still that they seem as it were a holiday of nature The weary wind was sleeping in some grateful cavern and the sunbeams basking on some fervent knoll the river floated with a drowsy unconscious course there was no wave in the grass no stir in the branches A silence so profound amid these solemn ruins offered the perfection of solitude and there was that stirring in the mind of Egremont which rendered him far from indisposed for this loneliness The slight words that he had exchanged with the farmer and the hind had left him musing Why was England not the same land as in the days of his light hearted youth Why were these hard times for the poor He stood among the ruins that as the farmer had well observed had seen many changes changes of creeds of dynasties of laws of manners New orders of men had arisen in the country new sources of wealth had opened new dispositions of power to which that wealth had necessarily led His own house his own order had established themselves on the ruins of that great body the emblems of whose ancient magnificence and strength surrounded him And now his order was in turn menaced And the People the millions of Toil on whose unconscious energies during these changeful centuries all rested what changes had these centuries brought to them Had their advance in the national scale borne a due relation to that progress of their rulers which had accumulated in the treasuries of a limited class the riches of the world and made their possessors boast that they were the first of nations the most powerful and the most free the most enlightened the most moral and the most religious Were there any rick burners in the times of the lord abbots And if not why not And why should the stacks of the Earls of Marney be destroyed and those of the Abbots of Marney spared Brooding over these suggestions some voices disturbed him and looking round he observed in the cemetery two men one was standing beside a tomb which his companion was apparently examining The first was of lofty stature and though dressed with simplicity had nothing sordid in his appearance His garments gave no clue to his position in life they might have been worn by a squire or by his gamekeeper a dark velveteen dress and leathern gaiters As Egremont caught his form he threw his broad brimmed country hat upon the ground and showed a frank and manly countenance His complexion might in youth have been ruddy but time and time s attendants thought and passion had paled it his chesnut hair faded but not grey still clustered over a noble brow his features were regular and handsome a well formed nose the square mouth and its white teeth and the clear grey eye which befitted such an idiosyncracy His time of vigorous manhood for he was much nearer forty than fifty years of age perhaps better suited his athletic form than the more supple and graceful season of youth Stretching his powerful arms in the air and delivering himself of an exclamation which denoted his weariness and which had broken the silence he expressed to his companion his determination to rest himself under the shade of the yew in the contiguous garden and inviting his friend to follow him he took up his hat and moved away There was something in the appearance of the stranger that interested Egremont and waiting till he had established himself in his pleasant resting place Egremont descended into the cloister garden and determined to address him Book two Chapter five You lean against an ancient trunk said Egremont carelessly advancing to the stranger who looked up at him without any expression of surprise and then replied They say tis the trunk beneath whose branches the monks encamped when they came to this valley to raise their building It was their house till with the wood and stone around them their labour and their fine art they piled up their abbey And then they were driven out of it and it came to this Poor men poor men They would hardly have forfeited their resting place had they deserved to retain it said Egremont They were rich I thought it was poverty that was a crime replied the stranger in a tone of simplicity But they had committed other crimes It may be so we are very frail But their history has been written by their enemies they were condemned without a hearing the people rose oftentimes in their behalf and their property was divided with those on whose reports it was forfeited At any rate it was a forfeiture which gave life to the community said Egremont the lands are held by active men and not by drones A drone is one who does not labour said the stranger whether he wear a cowl or a coronet tis the same to me Somebody I suppose must own the land though I have heard say that this individual tenure is not a necessity but however this may be I am not one who would object to the lord provided he were a gentle one All agree the Monastics were easy landlords their rents were low they granted leases in those days Their tenants too might renew their term before their tenure ran out so they were men of spirit and property There were yeomen then sir the country was not divided into two classes masters and slaves there was some resting place between luxury and misery Comfort was an English habit then not merely an English word And do you really think they were easier landlords than our present ones said Egremont inquiringly Human nature would tell us that even if history did not confess it The Monastics could possess no private property they could save no money they could bequeath nothing They lived received and expended in common The monastery too was a proprietor that never died and never wasted The farmer had a deathless landlord then not a harsh guardian or a grinding mortgagee or a dilatory master in chancery all was certain the manor had not to dread a change of lords or the oaks to tremble at the axe of the squandering heir How proud we are still in England of an old family though God knows tis rare to see one now Yet the people like to say We held under him and his father and his grandfather before him they know that such a tenure is a benefit The abbot was ever the same The monks were in short in every district a point of refuge for all who needed succour counsel and protection a body of individuals having no cares of their own with wisdom to guide the inexperienced with wealth to relieve the suffering and often with power to protect the oppressed You plead their cause with feeling said Egremont not unmoved It is my own they were the sons of the People like myself I had thought rather these monasteries were the resort of the younger branches of the aristocracy said Egremont Instead of the pension list replied his companion smiling but not with bitterness Well if we must have an aristocracy I would sooner that its younger branches should be monks and nuns than colonels without regiments or housekeepers of royal palaces that exist only in name Besides see what advantage to a minister if the unendowed aristocracy were thus provided for now He need not like a minister in these days entrust the conduct of public affairs to individuals notoriously incompetent appoint to the command of expeditions generals who never saw a field make governors of colonies out of men who never could govern themselves or find an ambassador in a broken dandy or a blasted favourite It is true that many of the monks and nuns were persons of noble birth Why should they not have been The aristocracy had their share no more They like all other classes were benefitted by the monasteries but the list of the mitred abbots when they were suppressed shows that the great majority of the heads of houses were of the people Well whatever difference of opinion may exist on these points said Egremont there is one on which there can be no controversy the monks were great architects Ah there it is said the stranger in a tone of plaintiveness if the world but only knew what they had lost I am sure that not the faintest idea is generally prevalent of the appearance of England before and since the dissolution Why sir in England and Wales alone there were of these institutions of different sizes I mean monasteries and chantries and chapels and great hospitals considerably upwards of three thousand all of them fair buildings many of them of exquisite beauty There were on an average in every shire at least twenty structures such as this was in this great county double that number establishments that were as vast and as magnificent and as beautiful as your Belvoirs and your Chatsworths your Wentworths and your Stowes Try to imagine the effect of thirty or forty Chatsworths in this county the proprietors of which were never absent You complain enough now of absentees The monks were never non resident They expended their revenue among those whose labour had produced it These holy men too built and planted as they did everything else for posterity their churches were cathedrals their schools colleges their halls and libraries the muniment rooms of kingdoms their woods and waters their farms and gardens were laid out and disposed on a scale and in a spirit that are now extinct they made the country beautiful and the people proud of their country Yet if the monks were such public benefactors why did not the people rise in their favour They did but too late They struggled for a century but they struggled against property and they were beat As long as the monks existed the people when aggrieved had property on their side And now tis all over said the stranger and travellers come and stare at these ruins and think themselves very wise to moralize over time They are the children of violence not of time It is war that created these ruins civil war of all our civil wars the most inhuman for it was waged with the unresisting The monasteries were taken by storm they were sacked gutted battered with warlike instruments blown up with gunpowder you may see the marks of the blast against the new tower here Never was such a plunder The whole face of the country for a century was that of a land recently invaded by a ruthless enemy it was worse than the Norman conquest nor has England ever lost this character of ravage I don t know whether the union workhouses will remove it They are building something for the people at last After an experiment of three centuries your gaols being full and your treadmills losing something of their virtue you have given us a substitute for the monasteries You lament the old faith said Egremont in a tone of respect I am not viewing the question as one of faith said the stranger It is not as a matter of religion but as a matter of right that I am considering it as a matter I should say of private right and public happiness You might have changed if you thought fit the religion of the abbots as you changed the religion of the bishops but you had no right to deprive men of their property and property moreover which under their administration so mainly contributed to the welfare of the community As for community said a voice which proceeded neither from Egremont nor the stranger with the monasteries expired the only type that we ever had in England of such an intercourse There is no community in England there is aggregation but aggregation under circumstances which make it rather a dissociating than an uniting principle It was a still voice that uttered these words yet one of a peculiar character one of those voices that instantly arrest attention gentle and yet solemn earnest yet unimpassioned With a step as whispering as his tone the man who had been kneeling by the tomb had unobserved joined his associate and Egremont He hardly reached the middle height his form slender but well proportioned his pale countenance slightly marked with the small pox was redeemed from absolute ugliness by a highly intellectual brow and large dark eyes that indicated deep sensibility and great quickness of apprehension Though young he was already a little bald he was dressed entirely in black the fairness of his linen the neatness of his beard his gloves much worn yet carefully mended intimated that his very faded garments were the result of necessity rather than of negligence You also lament the dissolution of these bodies said Egremont There is so much to lament in the world in which we live said the younger of the strangers that I can spare no pang for the past Yet you approve of the principle of their society you prefer it you say to our existing life Yes I prefer association to gregariousness That is a distinction said Egremont musingly It is a community of purpose that constitutes society continued the younger stranger without that men may be drawn into contiguity but they still continue virtually isolated And is that their condition in cities It is their condition everywhere but in cities that condition is aggravated A density of population implies a severer struggle for existence and a consequent repulsion of elements brought into too close contact In great cities men are brought together by the desire of gain They are not in a state of company operation but of isolation as to the making of fortunes and for all the rest they are careless of neighbours Christianity teaches us to love our neighbour as ourself modern society acknowledges no neighbour Well we live in strange times said Egremont struck by the observation of his companion and relieving a perplexed spirit by an ordinary exclamation which often denotes that the mind is more stirring than it cares to acknowledge or at the moment is capable to express When the infant begins to walk it also thinks that it lives in strange times said his companion Your inference asked Egremont That society still in its infancy is beginning to feel its way This is a new reign said Egremont perhaps it is a new era I think so said the younger stranger I hope so said the elder one Well society may be in its infancy said Egremont slightly smiling but say what you like our Queen reigns over the greatest nation that ever existed Which nation asked the younger stranger for she reigns over two The stranger paused Egremont was silent but looked inquiringly Yes resumed the younger stranger after a moment s interval Two nations between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy who are as ignorant of each other s habits thoughts and feelings as if they were dwellers in different zones or inhabitants of different planets who are formed by a different breeding are fed by a different food are ordered by different manners and are not governed by the same laws You speak of said Egremont hesitatingly THE RICH AND THE POOR At this moment a sudden flush of rosy light suffusing the grey ruins indicated that the sun had just fallen and through a vacant arch that overlooked them alone in the resplendent sky glittered the twilight star The hour the scene the solemn stillness and the softening beauty repressed controversy induced even silence The last words of the stranger lingered in the ear of Egremont his musing spirit was teeming with many thoughts many emotions when from the Lady Chapel there rose the evening hymn to the Virgin A single voice but tones of almost supernatural sweetness tender and solemn yet flexible and thrilling Egremont started from his reverie He would have spoken but he perceived that the elder of the strangers had risen from his resting place and with downcast eyes and crossed arms was on his knees The other remained standing in his former posture The divine melody ceased the elder stranger rose the words were on the lips of Egremont that would have asked some explanation of this sweet and holy mystery when in the vacant and star lit arch on which his glance was fixed he beheld a female form She was apparently in the habit of a Religious yet scarcely could be a nun for her veil if indeed it were a veil had fallen on her shoulders and revealed her thick tresses of long fair hair The blush of deep emotion lingered on a countenance which though extremely young was impressed with a character of almost divine majesty while her dark eyes and long dark lashes contrasting with the brightness of her complexion and the luxuriance of her radiant locks combined to produce a beauty as rare as it is choice and so strange that Egremont might for a moment have been pardoned for believing her a seraph that had lighted on this sphere or the fair phantom of some saint haunting the sacred ruins of her desecrated fane Book two Chapter six I understand then said Lord Marney to his brother as on the evening of the same day they were seated together in the drawing room in close converse I understand then that you have in fact paid nothing and that my mother will give you a thousand pounds That won t go very far It will hardly pay for the chairing said Egremont the restoration of the family influence was celebrated on so great a scale The family influence must be supported said Lord Marney and my mother will give you a thousand pounds as I said that will not do much for you but I like her spirit Contests are very expensive things yet I quite approve of what you have done especially as you won It is a great thing in these ten pound days to win your first contest and shows powers of calculation which I respect Everything in this world is calculation there is no such thing as luck depend upon it and if you go on calculating with equal exactness you must succeed in life Now the question is what is to be done with your election bills Exactly You want to know what I will do for you or rather what I can do for you that is the point My inclination of course is to do everything for you but when I calculate my resources I may find that they are not equal to my inclination I am sure George you will do everything and more than everything you ought I am extremely pleased about this thousand pounds of my mother Charles Most admirable of her But she always is so generous Her jointure has been most regularly paid continued Lord Marney Always be exact in your payments Charles There is no end to the good it produces Now if I had not been so regular in paying my mother her jointure she would not in all probability have been able to have given you this thousand pounds and therefore to a certain extent you are indebted for this thousand pounds to me Egremont drew up a little but said nothing I am obliged to pay my mother her jointure whether ricks are burnt or not said Lord Marney It s very hard don t you think so But these ricks were Bingley s But he was not insured and he will want some reduction in his rent and if I do not see fit to allow it him which I probably shall not for he ought to have calculated on these things I have ricks of my own and they may be burnt any night But you of course are insured No I am not I calculate tis better to run the risk I wonder why ricks are burnt now and were not in old days said Egremont Because there is a surplus population in the kingdom said Lord Marney and no rural police in the county You were speaking of the election George said Egremont not without reluctance yet anxious as the ice had been broken to bring the matter to a result Lord Marney before the election had written in reply to his mother consulting him on the step a letter with which she was delighted but which Egremont at the time could have wished to have been more explicit However in the excitement attendant on a first contest and influenced by the person whose judgment always swayed and in the present case was peculiarly entitled to sway him he stifled his scruples and persuaded himself that he was a candidate not only with the sanction but at the instance of his brother You were speaking of the election George said Egremont About the election Charles Well the long and short of it is this that I wish to see you comfortable To be harassed about money is one of the most disagreeable incidents of life It ruffles the temper lowers the spirits disturbs the rest and finally breaks up one s health Always if you possibly can keep square And if by any chance you do find yourself in a scrape come to me There is nothing under those circumstances like the advice of a cool headed friend As valuable as the assistance of a cold hearted one thought Egremont who did not fancy too much the tone of this conversation But there is one thing of which you must particularly beware continued Lord Marney there is one thing worse even than getting into difficulties patching them up The patching up system is fatal it is sure to break down you never get clear Now what I want to do for you Charles is to put you right altogether I want to see you square and more than square in a position which will for ever guarantee you from any annoyance of this kind He is a good fellow after all thought Egremont That thousand pounds of my mother was very a propos said Lord Marney I suppose it was a sop that will keep them all right till we have made our arrangements Oh there is no pressure of that kind said Egremont if I see my way and write to them of course they will be quite satisfied Excellent said Lord Marney and nothing could be more convenient to me for between ourselves my balances are very low at this moment The awful expenditure of keeping up this place And then such terrible incumbrances as I came to Incumbrances George Why I thought you had not any There was not a single mortgage No mortgages they are nothing you find them you get used to them and you calculate accordingly You quite forget the portions for younger children Yes but you had plenty of ready money for them I had to pay them though said Lord Marney Had I not I might have bought Grimblethorpe with the money such an opportunity will never occur again But you talked of incumbrances said Egremont Ah my dear fellow said Lord Marney you don t know what it is to have to keep up an estate like this and very lucky for you It is not the easy life you dream of There s buildings I am ruined in buildings our poor dear father thought he left me Marney without an incumbrance why there was not a barn on the whole estate that was weather proof not a farm house that was not half in ruins What I have spent in buildings And draining Though I make my own tiles draining my dear fellow is a something of which you have not the least idea Well said Egremont anxious to bring his brother back to the point you think then I had better write to them and say Ah now for your business said Lord Marney Now I will tell you what I can do for you I was speaking to Arabella about it last night she quite approves my idea You remember the De Mowbrays Well we are going to stay at Mowbray Castle and you are to go with us It is the first time they have received company since their great loss Ah you were abroad at the time and so you are behind hand Lord Mowbray s only son Fitz Warene you remember him a deuced clever fellow he died about a year ago in Greece of a fever Never was such a blow His two sisters Lady Joan and Lady Maud are looked upon as the greatest heiresses in the kingdom but I know Mowbray well he will make an eldest son of his eldest daughter She will have it all she is one of Arabella s dearest friends and you are to marry her Egremont stared at his brother who patted him on the back with an expression of unusual kindness and adding You have no idea what a load this has taken off my mind my dear Charles so great has my anxiety always been about you particularly of late To see you lord of Mowbray Castle will realize my fondest hopes That is a position fit for a man and I know none more worthy of it than yourself though I am your brother who say so Now let us come and speak to Arabella about it So saying Lord Marney followed somewhat reluctantly by his brother advanced to the other end of the drawing room where his wife was employed with her embroidery frame and seated next to her young friend Miss Poinsett who was playing chess with Captain Grouse a member of the chess club and one of the most capital performers extant Well Arabella said Lord Marney it is all settled Charles agrees with me about going to Mowbray Castle and I think the sooner we go the better What do you think of the day after to morrow That will suit me exactly and therefore I think we had better fix on it We will consider it settled Lady Marney looked embarrassed and a little distressed Nothing could be more unexpected by her than this proposition nothing more inconvenient than the arrangement It was very true that Lady Joan Fitz Warene had invited them to Mowbray and she had some vague intention some day or other of deliberating whether they should avail themselves of this kindness but to decide upon going and upon going instantly without the least consultation the least inquiry as to the suitableness of the arrangement the visit of Miss Poinsett abruptly and ungraciously terminated for example all this was vexatious distressing a mode of management which out of the simplest incidents of domestic life contrived to extract some degree of perplexity and annoyance Do not you think George said Lady Marney that we had better talk it over a little Not at all said Lord Marney Charles will go and it quite suits me and therefore what necessity for any consultation Oh if you and Charles like to go certainly said Lady Marney in a hesitating tone only I shall be very sorry to lose your society How do you mean lose our society Arabella Of course you must go with us I particularly want you to go You are Lady Joan s most intimate friend I believe there is no one she likes so much I cannot go the day after to morrow said Lady Marney speaking in a whisper and looking volumes of deprecation I cannot help it said Lord Marney you should have told me this before I wrote to Mowbray to day that we should be with him the day after to morrow and stay a week But you never mentioned it to me said Lady Marney slightly blushing and speaking in a tone of gentle reproach I should like to know when I am to find time to mention the contents of every letter I write said Lord Marney particularly with all the vexatious business I have had on my hands to day But so it is the more one tries to save you trouble the more discontented you get No not discontented George I do not know what you call discontented but when a man has made every possible arrangement to please you and every body and all his plans are to be set aside merely because the day he has fixed on does not exactly suit your fancy if that be not discontent I should like very much to know what is Arabella Lady Marney did not reply Always sacrificed always yielding the moment she attempted to express an opinion she ever seemed to assume the position not of the injured but the injurer Arabella was a woman of abilities which she had cultivated She had excellent sense and possessed many admirable qualities she was far from being devoid of sensibility but her sweet temper shrank from controversy and Nature had not endowed her with a spirit which could direct and control She yielded without a struggle to the arbitrary will and unreasonable caprice of a husband who was scarcely her equal in intellect and far her inferior in all the genial qualities of our nature but who governed her by his iron selfishness Lady Marney absolutely had no will of her own A hard exact literal bustling acute being environed her existence directed planned settled everything Her life was a series of petty sacrifices and baulked enjoyments If her carriage were at the door she was never certain that she would not have to send it away if she had asked some friends to her house the chances were she would have to put them off if she were reading a novel Lord Marney asked her to copy a letter if she were going to the opera she found that Lord Marney had got seats for her and some friend in the House of Lords and seemed expecting the strongest expressions of delight and gratitude from her for his unasked and inconvenient kindness Lady Marney had struggled against this tyranny in the earlier days of their union Innocent inexperienced Lady Marney As if it were possible for a wife to contend against a selfish husband at once sharp witted and blunt hearted She had appealed to him she had even reproached him she had wept once she had knelt But Lord Marney looked upon these demonstrations as the disordered sensibility of a girl unused to the marriage state and ignorant of the wise authority of husbands of which he deemed himself a model And so after a due course of initiation Lady Marney invisible for days plunged in remorseful reveries in the mysteries of her boudoir and her lord dining at his club and going to the minor theatres the countess was broken in and became the perfect wife of a perfect husband Lord Marney who was fond of chess turned out Captain Grouse and very gallantly proposed to finish his game with Miss Poinsett which Miss Poinsett who understood Lord Marney as well as he understood chess took care speedily to lose so that his lordship might encounter a champion worthy of him Egremont seated by his sister in law and anxious by kind words to soothe the irritation which he had observed with pain his brother create entered into easy talk and after some time said I find you have been good enough to mould my destiny Lady Marney looked a little surprised and then said How so You have decided on I hear the most important step of my life Indeed you perplex me Lady Joan Fitz Warene your friend The countess blushed the name was a clue which she could follow but Egremont nevertheless suspected that the idea had never previously occurred to her Lady Joan she described as not beautiful certainly not beautiful nobody would consider her beautiful many would indeed think her quite the reverse and yet she had a look one particular look when according to Lady Marney she was more than beautiful But she was very clever very indeed something quite extraordinary Accomplished Oh far beyond that I have heard even men say that no one knew so much A regular blue Oh no not at all a blue not that kind of knowledge But languages and learned books Arabic and Hebrew and old manuscripts And then she has an observatory and was the first person who discovered the comet doctor Buckland swears by her and she corresponds with Arago And her sister is she the same Lady Maud she is very religious I do not know her so well Is she pretty Some people admire her very much I never was at Mowbray What sort of a place is it Oh it is very grand said Lady Marney but like all places in the manufacturing districts very disagreeable You never have a clear sky Your toilette table is covered with blacks the deer in the park seem as if they had bathed in a lake of Indian ink and as for the sheep you expect to see chimney sweeps for the shepherds And do you really mean to go on Thursday said Egremont I think we had better put it off We must go said Lady Marney with a sort of sigh and shaking her head Let me speak to Marney Oh no We must go I am annoyed about this dear little Poinsett she has been to stay with me so very often and she has only been here three days When she comes in again I wish you would ask her to sing Charles Soon the dear little Poinsett was singing much gratified by being invited to the instrument by mister Egremont who for a few minutes hung over her and then evidently under the influence of her tones walked up and down the room and only speaking to beg that she would continue her charming performances Lady Marney was engrossed with her embroidery her lord and the captain with their game And what was Egremont thinking of Of Mowbray be you sure And of Lady Joan or Lady Maud Not exactly Mowbray was the name of the town to which the strangers he had met with in the Abbey were bound It was the only piece of information that he had been able to obtain of them and that casually When the fair vision of the starlit arch about to descend to her two companions perceived that they were in conversation with a stranger she hesitated and in a moment withdrew Then the elder of the travellers exchanging a glance with his friend bid good even to Egremont Our way perhaps lies the same said Egremont I should deem not said the stranger nor are we alone And we must be stirring for we have far to go said he who was dressed in black My journey is very brief said Egremont making a desperate effort to invite communication and I am on horseback And we on foot said the elder nor shall we stop till we reach Mowbray and with a slight salute they left Egremont alone There was something in the manner of the elder stranger which repressed the possibility of Egremont following him Leaving then the cloister garden in another direction he speculated on meeting them outside the abbey He passed through the Lady s chapel The beautiful Religious was not there He gained the west front no one was visible He took a rapid survey of each side of the abbey not a being to be recognized He fancied they must have advanced towards the Abbey Farm yet they might have proceeded further on in the dale Perplexed he lost time Finally he proceeded towards the farm but did not overtake them reached it but learned nothing of them and arrived at his brother s full of a strange yet sweet perplexity Book two Chapter seven In a commercial country like England every half century developes some new and vast source of public wealth which brings into national notice a new and powerful class A couple of centuries ago a Turkey merchant was the great creator of wealth the West Indian Planter followed him In the middle of the last century appeared the Nabob These characters in their zenith in turn merged in the land and became English aristocrats while the Levant decaying the West Indies exhausted and Hindostan plundered the breeds died away and now exist only in our English comedies from Wycherly and Congreve to Cumberland and Morton The expenditure of the revolutionary war produced the Loanmonger who succeeded the Nabob and the application of science to industry developed the Manufacturer who in turn aspires to be large acred and always will as long as we have a territorial constitution a better security for the preponderance of the landed interest than any corn law fixed or fluctuating Of all these characters the one that on the whole made the largest fortunes in the most rapid manner and we do not forget the marvels of the Waterloo loan or the miracles of Manchester during the continental blockade was the Anglo East Indian about the time that Hastings was first appointed to the great viceroyalty It was not unusual for men in positions so obscure that their names had never reached the public in this country and who yet had not been absent from their native land for a longer period than the siege of Troy to return with their million One of the most fortunate of this class of obscure adventurers was a certain John Warren A very few years before the breaking out of the American war he was a waiter at a celebrated club in saint James s Street a quick yet steady young fellow assiduous discreet and very civil In this capacity he pleased a gentleman who was just appointed to the government of Madras and who wanted a valet Warren though prudent was adventurous and accepted the opening which he believed fortune offered him He was prescient The voyage in those days was an affair of six months During this period Warren still more ingratiated himself with his master He wrote a good hand and his master a very bad one He had a natural talent for accounts a kind of information which was useful to his employer He arrived at Madras no longer a valet but a private secretary His master went out to make a fortune but he was indolent and had indeed none of the qualities for success except his great position Warren had every quality but that The basis of the confederacy therefore was intelligible it was founded on mutual interests and cemented by reciprocal assistance The governor granted monopolies to the secretary who apportioned a due share to his sleeping partner There appeared one of those dearths not unusual in Hindostan the population of the famished province cried out for rice the stores of which diminished by nature had for months mysteriously disappeared A provident administration it seems had invested the public revenue in its benevolent purchase the misery was so excessive that even pestilence was anticipated when the great forestallers came to the rescue of the people over whose destinies they presided and at the same time fed and pocketed millions This was the great stroke of the financial genius of Warren He was satisfied He longed once more to see saint James s Street and to become a member of the club where he had once been a waiter But he was the spoiled child of fortune who would not so easily spare him The governor died and had appointed his secretary his sole executor Not that his excellency particularly trusted his agent but he dared not confide the knowledge of his affairs to any other individual The estate was so complicated that Warren offered the heirs a good round sum for his quittance and to take the settlement upon himself India so distant and Chancery so near the heirs accepted the proposition Winding up this estate Warren avenged the cause of plundered provinces and the House of Commons itself with Burke and Francis at its head could scarcely have mulcted the late governor more severely A mister Warren of whom no one had ever heard except that he was a nabob had recently returned from India and purchased a large estate in the north of England was returned to Parliament one of the representatives of a close borough which he had purchased a quiet gentlemanlike middle aged man with no decided political opinions and as parties were then getting very equal of course very much courted The throes of Lord North s administration were commencing The minister asked the new member to dine with him and found the new member singularly free from all party prejudices mister Warren was one of those members who announced their determination to listen to the debates and to be governed by the arguments All complimented him all spoke to him mister Fox declared that he was a most superior man mister Burke said that these were the men who could alone save the country missus Crewe asked him to supper he was caressed by the most brilliant of duchesses At length there arrived one of those fierce trials of strength which precede the fall of a minister but which sometimes from peculiar circumstances as in the instances of Walpole and Lord North are not immediate in their results How would Warren vote was the great question He would listen to the arguments Burke was full of confidence that he should catch Warren The day before the debate there was a levee which mister Warren attended The sovereign stopped him spoke to him smiled on him asked him many questions about himself the House of Commons how he liked it how he liked England There was a flutter in the circle a new favourite at court The debate came off the division took place mister Warren voted for the minister Burke denounced him the king made him a baronet Sir John Warren made a great alliance at least for him he married the daughter of an Irish earl became one of the king s friends supported Lord Shelburne threw over Lord Shelburne had the tact early to discover that mister Pitt was the man to stick to stuck to him Sir John Warren bought another estate and picked up another borough He was fast becoming a personage Throughout the Indian debates he kept himself extremely quiet once indeed in vindication of mister Hastings whom he greatly admired he ventured to correct mister Francis on a point of fact with which he was personally acquainted He thought that it was safe but he never spoke again He knew not the resources of vindictive genius or the powers of a malignant imagination Burke owed the Nabob a turn for the vote which had gained him a baronetcy The orator seized the opportunity and alarmed the secret conscience of the Indian adventurer by his dark allusions and his fatal familiarity with the subject Another estate however and another borough were some consolation for this little misadventure and in time the French Revolution to Sir John s great relief turned the public attention for ever from Indian affairs The Nabob from the faithful adherent of mister Pitt had become even his personal friend The wits indeed had discovered that he had been a waiter and endless were the epigrams of Fitzpatrick and the jokes of Hare but mister Pitt cared nothing about the origin of his supporters On the contrary Sir John was exactly the individual from whom the minister meant to carve out his plebeian aristocracy and using his friend as a feeler before he ventured on his greater operations the Nabob one morning was transformed into an Irish baron The new Baron figured in his patent as Lord Fitz Warene his Norman origin and descent from the old barons of this name having been discovered at Herald s college This was a rich harvest for Fitzpatrick and Hare but the public gets accustomed to everything and has an easy habit of faith The new Baron cared nothing for ridicule for he was working for posterity He was compensated for every annoyance by the remembrance that the saint James s Street waiter was ennobled and by his determination that his children should rank still higher in the proud peerage of his country So he obtained the royal permission to resume the surname and arms of his ancestors as well as their title There was an ill natured story set afloat that Sir John owed this promotion to having lent money to the minister but this was a calumny mister Pitt never borrowed money of his friends Once indeed to save his library he took a thousand pounds from an individual on whom he had conferred high rank and immense promotion and this individual who had the minister s bond when mister Pitt died insisted on his right and actually extracted the one thousand l from the insolvent estate of his magnificent patron But mister Pitt always preferred an usurer to a friend and to the last day of his life borrowed money at fifty per cent The Nabob departed this life before the Minister but he lived long enough to realize his most aspiring dream Two years before his death the Irish baron was quietly converted into an English peer and without exciting any attention all the squibs of Fitzpatrick all the jokes of Hare quite forgotten the waiter of the saint James s Street club took his seat in the most natural manner possible in the House of Lords The great estate of the late Lord Fitz Warene was situated at Mowbray a village which principally belonged to him and near which he had raised a gothic castle worthy of his Norman name and ancestry Mowbray was one of those places which during the long war had expanded from an almost unknown village to a large and flourishing manufacturing town a circumstance which as Lady Marney observed might have somewhat deteriorated the atmosphere of the splendid castle but which had nevertheless doubled the vast rental of its lord He who had succeeded to his father was Altamont Belvidere named after his mother s family Fitz Warene Lord Fitz Warene He was not deficient in abilities though he had not his father s talents but he was over educated for his intellect a common misfortune The new Lord Fitz Warene was the most aristocratic of breathing beings He most fully entirely and absolutely believed in his pedigree his coat of arms was emblazoned on every window embroidered on every chair carved in every corner Shortly after his father s death he was united to the daughter of a ducal house by whom he had a son and two daughters chrisened by names which the ancient records of the Fitz Warenes authorised His son who gave promise of abilities which might have rendered the family really distinguished was Valence his daughters Joan and Maud All that seemed wanting to the glory of the house was a great distinction of which a rich peer with six seats in the House of Commons could not ultimately despair Lord Fitz Warene aspired to rank among the earls of England But the successors of mister Pitt were strong they thought the Fitz Warenes had already been too rapidly advanced it was whispered that the king did not like the new man that his majesty thought him pompous full of pretence in short a fool But though the successors of mister Pitt managed to govern the country for twenty years and were generally very strong in such an interval of time however good their management or great their luck there were inevitably occasions when they found themselves in difficulties when it was necessary to conciliate the lukewarm or to reward the devoted Lord Fitz Warene well understood how to avail himself of these occasions it was astonishing how conscientious and scrupulous he became during Walcheren expeditions Manchester massacres Queen s trials Every scrape of the government was a step in the ladder to the great borough monger The old king too had disappeared from the stage and the tawdry grandeur of the great Norman peer rather suited George the Fourth He was rather a favourite at the Cottage they wanted his six votes for Canning he made his terms and one of the means by which we got a man of genius for a minister was elevating Lord Fitz Warene in the peerage by the style and title of Earl de Mowbray of Mowbray Castle Book two Chapter eight We must now for a while return to the strangers of the Abbey ruins When the two men had joined the beautiful Religious whose apparition had so startled Egremont they all three quitted the Abbey by a way which led them by the back of the cloister garden and so on by the bank of the river for about a hundred yards when they turned up the winding glen of a dried up tributary stream At the head of the glen at which they soon arrived was a beer shop screened by some huge elms from the winds that blew over the vast moor which except in the direction of Mardale now extended as far as the eye could reach Here the companions stopped the beautiful Religious seated herself on a stone bench beneath the trees while the elder stranger calling out to the inmate of the house to apprise him of his return himself proceeded to a neighbouring shed whence he brought forth a very small rough pony with a rude saddle but one evidently intended for a female rider It is well said the taller of the men that I am not a member of a temperance society like you Stephen or it would be difficult to reward this good man for his care of our steed I will take a cup of the drink of Saxon kings Then leading up the pony to the Religious he placed her on its back with gentleness and much natural grace saying at the same time in a subdued tone And you shall I bring you a glass of nature s wine I have drank of the spring of the Holy Abbey said the Religious and none other must touch my lips this eve Come our course must be brisk said the elder of the men as he gave up his glass to their host and led off the pony Stephen walking on its other side Though the sun had fallen the twilight was still glowing and even on this wide expanse the air was still The vast and undulating surface of the brown and purple moor varied occasionally by some fantastic rocks gleamed in the shifting light Hesperus was the only star that yet was visible and seemed to move before them and lead them on their journey I hope said the Religious turning to the elder stranger that if ever we regain our right my father and that we ever can save by the interposition of divine will seems to me clearly impossible that you will never forget how bitter it is to be driven from the soil and that you will bring back the people to the land I would pursue our right for no other cause said the father After centuries of sorrow and degradation it should never be said that we had no sympathy with the sad and the oppressed After centuries of sorrow and degradation said Stephen let it not be said that you acquired your right only to create a baron or a squire Nay thou shalt have thy way Stephen said his companion smiling if ever the good hour come As many acres as thou choosest for thy new Jerusalem Call it what you will Walter replied Stephen but if I ever gain the opportunity of fully carrying the principle of association into practice I will sing Nunc me dimittas Nunc me dimittas burst forth the Religious in a voice of thrilling melody and she pursued for some minutes the divine canticle Her companions gazed on her with an air of affectionate reverence as she sang each instant the stars becoming brighter the wide moor assuming a darker hue Now tell me Stephen said the Religious turning her head and looking round with a smile think you not it would be a fairer lot to bide this night at some kind monastery than to be hastening now to that least picturesque of all creations a railway station The railways will do as much for mankind as the monasteries did said Stephen Had it not been for the railway we should never have made our visit to Marney Abbey said the elder of the travellers Nor seen its last abbot s tomb said the Religious When I marked your name upon the stone my father woe is me but I felt sad indeed that it was reserved for our blood to surrender to ruthless men that holy trust He never surrendered said her father He was tortured and hanged He is with the communion of saints said the Religious I would I could see a communion of Men said Stephen and then there would be no more violence for there would be no more plunder You must regain our lands for us Stephen said the Religious promise me my father that I shall raise a holy house for pious women if that ever hap We will not forget our ancient faith said her father the only old thing that has not left us I cannot understand said Stephen why you should ever have lost sight of these papers Walter You see friend they were never in my possession they were never mine when I saw them They were my father s and he was jealous of all interference He was a small yeoman who had risen in the war time well to do in the world but always hankering after the old tradition that the lands were ours This Hatton got hold of him he did his work well I have heard certain it is my father spared nothing It is twenty five years come Martinmas since he brought his writ of right and though baffled he was not beaten But then he died his affairs were in great confusion he had mortgaged his land for his writ and the war prices were gone There were debts that could not be paid I had no capital for a farm I would not sink to be a labourer on the soil that had once been our own I had just married it was needful to make a great exertion I had heard much of the high wages of this new industry I left the land And the papers I never thought of them or thought of them with disgust as the cause of my ruin Then when you came the other day and showed me in the book that the last abbot of Marney was a Walter Gerard the old feeling stirred again and I could not help telling you that my fathers fought at Azincourt though I was only the overlooker at mister Trafford s mill A good old name of the good old faith said the Religious and a blessing be on it We have cause to bless it said Gerard I thought it then something to serve a gentleman and as for my daughter she by their goodness was brought up in holy walls which have made her what she is Nature made her what she is said Stephen in a low voice and speaking not without emotion Then he continued in a louder and brisker tone But this Hatton you know nothing of his whereabouts Never heard of him since I had indeed about a year after my father s death cause to enquire after him but he had quitted Mowbray and none could give me tidings of him He had lived I believe on our law suit and vanished with our hopes After this there was silence each was occupied with his thoughts while the influence of the soft night and starry hour induced to contemplation I hear the murmur of the train said the Religious Tis the up train said her father We have yet a quarter of an hour we shall be in good time So saying he guided the pony to where some lights indicated the station of the railway which here crossed the moor There was just time to return the pony to the person at the station from whom it had been borrowed and obtain their tickets when the bell of the down train sounded and in a few minutes the Religious and her companions were on their way to Mowbray whither a course of two hours carried them It was two hours to midnight when they arrived at Mowbray station which was about a quarter of a mile from the town Labour had long ceased a beautiful heaven clear and serene canopied the city of smoke and toil in all directions rose the columns of the factories dark and defined in the purple sky a glittering star sometimes hovering by the crest of their tall and tapering forms The travellers proceeded in the direction of a suburb and approached the very high wall of an extensive garden The moon rose as they reached it tipped the trees with light and revealed a lofty and centre portal by the side of it a wicket at which Gerard rang The wicket was quickly opened I fear holy sister said the Religious that I am even later than I promised Those that come in our lady s name are ever welcome was the reply Sister Marion said Gerard to the porteress we have been to visit a holy place All places are holy with holy thoughts my brother Dear father good night said the Religious the blessings of all the saints be on thee and on thee Stephen though thou dost not kneel to them Good night mine own child said Gerard I could believe in saints when I am with thee murmured Stephen Good night SYBIL Book two Chapter nine When Gerard and his friend quitted the convent they proceeded at a brisk pace into the heart of the town 
4018_107312_000008_000001	train-clean-100	The streets were nearly empty and with the exception of some occasional burst of brawl or merriment from a beer shop all was still 
none	none	The chief street of Mowbray called Castle Street after the ruins of the old baronial stronghold in its neighbourhood was as significant of the present civilization of this community as the haughty keep had been of its ancient dependence The dimensions of Castle Street were not unworthy of the metropolis it traversed a great portion of the town and was proportionately wide its broad pavements and its blazing gas lights indicated its modern order and prosperity while on each side of the street rose huge warehouses not as beautiful as the palaces of Venice but in their way not less remarkable magnificent shops and here and there though rarely some ancient factory built among the fields in the infancy of Mowbray by some mill owner not sufficiently prophetic of the future or sufficiently confident in the energy and enterprise of his fellow citizens to foresee that the scene of his labours would be the future eye sore of a flourishing posterity Pursuing their course along Castle Street for about a quarter of a mile Gerard and Stephen turned down a street which intersected it and so on through a variety of ways and winding lanes till they arrived at an open portion of the town a district where streets and squares and even rows disappeared and where the tall chimneys and bulky barrack looking buildings that rose in all directions clustering yet isolated announced that they were in the principal scene of the industry of Mowbray 
4018_107312_000009_000001	train-clean-100	Crossing this open ground they gained a suburb but one of a very different description to that in which was situate the convent where they had parted with Sybil 
4018_107312_000009_000002	train-clean-100	This one was populous noisy and lighted 
none	none	It was Saturday night the streets were thronged an infinite population kept swarming to and fro the close courts and pestilential cul de sacs that continually communicated with the streets by narrow archways like the entrance of hives so low that you were obliged to stoop for admission while ascending to these same streets from their dank and dismal dwellings by narrow flights of steps the subterraneous nation of the cellars poured forth to enjoy the coolness of the summer night and market for the day of rest 
4018_107312_000009_000004	train-clean-100	The bright and lively shops were crowded and groups of purchasers were gathered round the stalls that by the aid of glaring lamps and flaunting lanthorns displayed their wares 
4018_107312_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 Come come it s a prime piece said a jolly looking woman who was presiding at a stall which though considerably thinned by previous purchasers still offered many temptations to many who could not purchase

4018_107312_000021_000001	train-clean-100	His long loose white trousers gave him height he had no waistcoat but a pink silk handkerchief was twisted carelessly round his neck and fastened with a very large pin which whatever were its materials had unquestionably a very gorgeous appearance 
none	none	A loose frock coat of a coarse white cloth and fastened by one button round his waist completed his habiliments with the addition of the covering to his head a high crowned dark brown hat which relieved his complexion and heightened the effect of his mischievous blue eye
4018_107312_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Well you need not be so fierce Mother Carey said the youth with an affected air of deprecation 
none	none	Don t mother me said the jolly widow with a kindling eye go to your own mother who is dying in a back cellar without a winder while you ve got lodgings in a two pair
4018_107312_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Dying she s only drunk said the youth 
none	none	And if she is only drunk rejoined missus Carey in a passion what makes her drink but toil working from five o clock in the morning to seven o clock at night and for the like of such as you That s a good one said the youth I should like to know what my mother ever did for me but give me treacle and laudanum when I was a babby to stop my tongue and fill my stomach by the token of which as my gal says she stunted the growth of the prettiest figure in all Mowbray And here the youth drew himself up and thrust his hands in the side pockets of his pea jacket
4018_107312_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I never said missus Carey 
4018_107312_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 No I never heard a thing like that 
4018_107312_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 What not when you cut up the jackass and sold it for veal cutlets mother 
4018_107312_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Hold your tongue mister Imperence said the widow 
none	none	It s very well known you re no Christian and who ll believe what you say It s very well known that I m a man what pays his way said the boy and don t keep a huckster s stall to sell carrion by star light but live in a two pair if you please and has a wife and family or as good O you aggravating imp exclaimed the widow in despair unable to wreak her vengeance on one who kept in a secure position and whose movements were as nimble as his words
4018_107312_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Why Madam Carey what has Dandy Mick done to thee said a good humoured voice it came from one of two factory girls who were passing her stall and stopped 
4018_107312_000032_000001	train-clean-100	They were gaily dressed a light handkerchief tied under the chin their hair scrupulously arranged they wore coral neck laces and earrings of gold 
none	none	Ah is it you my child said the widow who was a good hearted creature The dandy has been giving me some of his imperence But I meant nothing dame said Mick It was a joke only a joke
4018_107312_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 Well let it pass said missus Carey 
4018_107312_000035_000001	train-clean-100	 And where have you been this long time my child and who s your friend she added in a lower tone 
4018_107312_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I have left mister Trafford s mill said the girl 
4018_107312_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 That s a bad job said missus Carey for those Traffords are kind to their people 
none	none	It s a great thing for a young person to be in their mill So it is said the girl but then it was so dull

4018_107312_000040_000001	train-clean-100	And those Traffords had so many schools

4018_107312_000054_000003	train-clean-100	 I think the world is turned upside downwards in these parts 
none	none	A brat like Mick Radley to live in a two pair with a wife and family or as good as he says and this girl asks me to take a dish of tea with her and keeps house Fathers and mothers goes for nothing continued missus Carey as she took a very long pinch of snuff and deeply mused tis the children gets the wages she added after a profound pause and there it is Book two Chapter ten In the meantime Gerard and Stephen stopped before a tall thin stuccoed house ballustraded and friezed very much lighted both within and without and from the sounds that issued from it and the persons who retired and entered evidently a locality of great resort and bustle A sign bearing the title of the Cat and Fiddle indicated that it was a place of public entertainment and kept by one who owned the legal name of John Trottman though that was but a vulgar appellation lost in his well earned and far famed title of Chaffing Jack The companions entered the spacious premises and making their way to the crowded bar Stephen with a glance serious but which indicated intimacy caught the eye of a comely lady who presided over the mysteries and said in a low voice Is he here In the Temple mister Morley asking for you and your friend more than once I think you had better go up I know he wishes to see you Stephen whispered to Gerard and after a moment s pause he asked the fair president for a couple of tickets for each of which he paid threepence a sum however according to the printed declaration of the voucher convertible into potential liquid refreshments no great compensation to a very strict member of the Temperance Society of Mowbray A handsome staircase with bright brass bannisters led them to an ample landing place on which opened a door now closed and by which sate a boy who collected the tickets of those who would enter it The portal was of considerable dimensions and of architectural pretension it was painted of a bright green colour the panels gilt Within the pediment described in letters of flaming gas you read THE TEMPLE OF THE MUSES Gerard and Morley entered an apartment very long and sufficiently lofty though rather narrow for such proportions The ceiling was even richly decorated the walls were painted and by a brush of considerable power Each panel represented some well known scene from Shakespeare Byron or Scott King Richard Mazeppa the Lady of the Lake were easily recognized in one panel Hubert menaced Arthur here Haidee rescued Juan and there Jeanie Deans curtsied before the Queen The room was very full some three or four hundred persons were seated in different groups at different tables eating drinking talking laughing and even smoking for notwithstanding the pictures and the gilding it was found impossible to forbid though there were efforts to discourage this practice in the Temple of the Muses Nothing however could be more decorous than the general conduct of the company though they consisted principally of factory people The waiters flew about with as much agility as if they were serving nobles In general the noise was great though not disagreeable sometimes a bell rang and there was comparative silence while a curtain drew up at the further end of the room opposite to the entrance and where there was a theatre the stage raised at a due elevation and adorned with side scenes from which issued a lady in a fancy dress who sang a favourite ballad or a gentleman elaborately habited in a farmer s costume of the old comedy a bob wig silver buttons and buckles and blue stockings and who favoured the company with that melancholy effusion called a comic song Some nights there was music on the stage a young lady in a white robe with a golden harp and attended by a gentleman in black mustachios This was when the principal harpiste of the King of Saxony and his first fiddler happened to be passing through Mowbray merely by accident or on a tour of pleasure and instruction to witness the famous scenes of British industry Otherwise the audience of the Cat and Fiddle we mean the Temple of the Muses were fain to be content with four Bohemian brothers or an equal number of Swiss sisters The most popular amusements however were the Thespian recitations by amateurs or novices who wished to become professional They tried their metal on an audience which could be critical A sharp waiter with a keen eye on the entering guests immediately saluted Gerard and his friend with profuse offers of hospitality insisting that they wanted much refreshment that they were both very hungry and very thirsty that if not hungry they should order something to drink that would give them an appetite if not inclined to quaff something to eat that would make them athirst In the midst of these embarrassing attentions he was pushed aside by his master with There go hands wanted at the upper end two American gentlemen from Lowell singing out for Sherry Cobler don t know what it is give them our bar mixture if they complain say it s the Mowbray slap bang and no mistake Must have a name mister Morley name s everything made the fortune of the Temple if I had called it the Saloon it never would have filled and perhaps the magistrates never have granted a licence The speaker was a very portly man who had passed the maturity of manhood but active as Harlequin He had a well favoured countenance fair good humoured but very sly He was dressed like the head butler of the London Tavern and was particular as to his white waistcoats and black silk stockings punctilious as to his knee buckles proud of his diamond pin that is to say when he officiated at the Temple Your mistress told us we should find you here said Stephen and that you wished to see us Plenty to tell you said their host putting his finger to his nose If information is wanted in this part of the world I flatter myself Come Master Gerard here s a table what shall I call for glass of the Mowbray slap bang No better the receipt has been in our family these fifty years mister Morley I know won t join us Did you say a cup of tea mister Morley Water only water well that s strange Boy alive there do you hear me call Water wanted glass of water for the Secretary of the Mowbray Temperance and Teatotal Sing it out I like titled company Brush And so you can give us some information about this Be back directly exclaimed their host and darting off with a swift precision that carried him through a labyrinth of tables without the slightest inconvenience to their occupiers Beg pardon mister Morley he said sliding again into his chair but saw one of the American gentlemen brandishing his bowie knife against one of my waiters called him Colonel quieted him directly a man of his rank brawling with a help oh no not to be thought of no squabbling here licence in danger You were saying resumed Morley Ah yes about that man Hatton remember him perfectly well a matter of twenty or it may be nineteen years since he bolted Queer fellow lived upon nothing only drank water no temperance and teetotal then so no excuse Beg pardon mister Morley no offence I hope can t bear whims but respectable societies if they don t drink they make speeches hire your rooms leads to business And this Hatton said Gerard Ah a queer fellow lent him a one pound note never saw it again always remember it last one pound note I had He offered me an old book instead not in my way took a china jar for my wife He kept a curiosity shop always prowling about the country picking up old books and hunting after old monuments called himself an antiquarian queer fellow that Hatton And you have heard of him since said Gerard rather impatiently Not a word said their host never knew any one who had I thought you had something to tell us about him said Stephen So I have I can put you in the way of getting hold of him and anything else I havn t lived in Mowbray man and boy for fifty years seen it a village and now a great town full of first rate institutions and establishments like this added their host surveying the Temple with a glance of admiring complacency I say I havn t lived here all this time and talked to the people for nothing Well we are all attention said Gerard with a smile Hush said their host as a bell sounded and he jumped up Now ladies now gentlemen if you please silence if you please for a song from a Polish lady The Signora sings English like a new born babe and the curtain drew up amid the hushed voices of the company and the restrained clatter of their knives and forks and glasses The Polish lady sang Cherry Ripe to the infinite satisfaction of her audience Young Mowbray indeed in the shape of Dandy Mick and some of his followers and admirers insisted on an encore The lady as she retired curtseyed like a Prima Donna but the host continued on his legs for some time throwing open his coat and bowing to his guests who expressed by their applause how much they approved his enterprise At length he resumed his seat It s almost too much he exclaimed the enthusiasm of these people I believe they look upon me as a father And you think you have some clue to this Hatton resumed Stephen They say he has no relations said their host I have heard as much Another glass of the bar mixture Master Gerard What did we call it Oh the bricks and beans the Mowbray bricks and beans known by that name in the time of my grandfather No more No use asking mister Morley I know Water well I must say and yet in an official capacity drinking water is not so unnatural And Hatton said Gerard they say he has no relations eh They do and they say wrong He has a relation he has a brother and I can put you in the way of finding him Well that looks like business said Gerard and where may he be Not here said their host he never put his foot in the Temple to my knowledge and lives in a place where they have as much idea of popular institutions as any Turks or heathen you ever heard of And where might we find him said Stephen What s that said their host jumping up and looking around him Here boys brush about The American gentleman is a whittling his name on that new mahogany table Take him the printed list of rules stuck up in a public place under a great coat and fine him five shillings for damaging the furniture If he resists he has paid for his liquor call in the police X Z No five is in the bar taking tea with your mistress Now brush And this place is In the land of mines and minerals said their host about ten miles from He works in metals on his own account You have heard of a place called Hell house Yard well he lives there and his name is Simon And does he keep up any communication with his brother think you said Gerard Nay I know no more at least at present said their host The secretary asked me about a person absent without leave for twenty years and who was said to have no relations I found you one and a very near one You are at the station and you have got your ticket The American gentleman s wiolent Here s the police I must take a high tone And with these words Chaffing Jack quitted them In the meantime we must not forget Dandy Mick and his two young friends whom he had so generously offered to treat to the Temple Well what do you think of it asked Caroline of Harriet in a whisper as they entered the splendid apartment It s just what I thought the Queen lived in said Harriet but indeed I m all of a flutter Well don t look as if you were said her friend Come along gals said Mick who s afraid Here we ll sit down at this table Now what shall we have Here waiter I say waiter Yes sir yes sir Well why don t you come when I call said Mick with a consequential air I have been hallooing these ten minutes Couple of glasses of bar mixture for these ladies and go of gin for myself And I say waiter stop stop don t be in such a deuced hurry do you think folks can drink without eating sausages for three and damme take care they are not burnt Yes sir directly directly That s the way to talk to these fellows said Mick with a self satisfied air and perfectly repaid by the admiring gaze of his companions It s pretty Miss Harriet said Mick looking up at the ceiling with a careless nil admirari glance Oh it is beautiful said Harriet You never were here before it s the only place That s the Lady of the Lake he added pointing to a picture I ve seen her at the Circus with real water The hissing sausages crowning a pile of mashed potatoes were placed before them the delicate rummers of the Mowbray slap bang for the girls the more masculine pewter measure for their friend Are the plates very hot said Mick Very sir Hot plates half the battle said Mick Now Caroline here Miss Harriet don t take away your plate wait for the mash they mash their taters here very elegant It was a very happy and very merry party Mick delighted to help his guests and to drink their healths Well said he when the waiter had cleared away their plates and left them to their less substantial luxuries Well said Mick sipping a renewed glass of gin twist and leaning back in his chair say what they please there s nothing like life At the Traffords said Caroline the greatest fun we ever had was a singing class I pity them poor devils in the country said Mick we got some of them at Collinson s come from Suffolk they say what they call hagricultural labourers a very queer lot indeed Ah them s the himmigrants said Caroline they re sold out of slavery and sent down by Pickford s van into the labour market to bring down our wages We ll teach them a trick or two before they do that urged Mick Where are you Miss Harriet I m at Wiggins and Webster s sir Where they clean machinery during meal time that won t do said Mick I see one of your partners coming in said Mick making many signals to a person who very soon joined them Well Devilsdust how are you This was the familiar appellation of a young gentleman who really had no other baptismal or patrimonial About a fortnight after his mother had introduced him into the world she returned to her factory and put her infant out to nurse that is to say paid threepence a week to an old woman who takes charge of these new born babes for the day and gives them back at night to their mothers as they hurriedly return from the scene of their labour to the dungeon or the den which is still by courtesy called home The expense is not great laudanum and treacle administered in the shape of some popular elixir affords these innocents a brief taste of the sweets of existence and keeping them quiet prepares them for the silence of their impending grave Infanticide is practised as extensively and as legally in England as it is on the banks of the Ganges a circumstance which apparently has not yet engaged the attention of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts But the vital principle is an impulse from an immortal artist and sometimes baffles even in its tenderest phasis the machinations of society for its extinction There are infants that will defy even starvation and poison unnatural mothers and demon nurses Such was the nameless one of whom we speak We cannot say he thrived but he would not die So at two years of age his mother being lost sight of and the weekly payment having ceased he was sent out in the street to play in order to be run over Even this expedient failed The youngest and the feeblest of the band of victims Juggernaut spared him to Moloch All his companions were disposed of Three months play in the streets got rid of this tender company shoeless half naked and uncombed whose age varied from two to five years Some were crushed some were lost some caught cold and fevers crept back to their garret or their cellars were dosed with Godfrey s cordial and died in peace The nameless one would not disappear He always got out of the way of the carts and horses and never lost his own They gave him no food he foraged for himself and shared with the dogs the garbage of the streets But still he lived stunted and pale he defied even the fatal fever which was the only habitant of his cellar that never quitted it And slumbering at night on a bed of mouldering straw his only protection against the plashy surface of his den with a dungheap at his head and a cesspool at his feet he still clung to the only roof which shielded him from the tempest At length when the nameless one had completed his fifth year the pest which never quitted the nest of cellars of which he was a citizen raged in the quarter with such intensity that the extinction of its swarming population was menaced The haunt of this child was peculiarly visited All the children gradually sickened except himself and one night when he returned home he found the old woman herself dead and surrounded only by corpses The child before this had slept on the same bed of straw with a corpse but then there were also breathing beings for his companions A night passed only with corpses seemed to him in itself a kind of death He stole out of the cellar quitted the quarter of pestilence and after much wandering laid down near the door of a factory Fortune had guided him Soon after break of day he was woke by the sound of the factory bell and found assembled a crowd of men women and children The door opened they entered the child accompanied them The roll was called his unauthorized appearance noticed he was questioned his acuteness excited attention A child was wanted in the Wadding Hole a place for the manufacture of waste and damaged cotton the refuse of the mills which is here worked up into counterpanes and coverlids The nameless one was prefered to the vacant post received even a salary more than that a name for as he had none he was christened on the spot DEVILSDUST Devilsdust had entered life so early that at seventeen he combined the experience of manhood with the divine energy of youth He was a first rate workman and received high wages he had availed himself of the advantages of the factory school he soon learnt to read and write with facility and at the moment of our history was the leading spirit of the Shoddy Court Literary and Scientific Institute His great friend his only intimate was Dandy Mick The apparent contrariety of their qualities and structure perhaps led to this It is indeed the most assured basis of friendship Devilsdust was dark and melancholy ambitious and discontented full of thought and with powers of patience and perseverance that alone amounted to genius Mick was as brilliant as his complexion gay irritable evanescent and unstable Mick enjoyed life his friend only endured it yet Mick was always complaining of the lowness of his wages and the greatness of his toil while Devilsdust never murmured but read and pondered on the rights of labour and sighed to vindicate his order I have some thoughts of joining the Total Abstinence said Devilsdust ever since I read Stephen Morley s address it has been in my mind We shall never get our rights till we leave off consuming exciseable articles and the best thing to begin with is liquors Well I could do without liquors myself said Caroline If I was a lady I would never drink anything except fresh milk from the cow Tea for my money said Harriet I must say there s nothing I grudge for good tea Now I keep house I mean always to drink the best Well you have not yet taken the pledge Dusty said Mick and so suppose we order a go of gin and talk this matter of temperance over Devilsdust was manageable in little things especially by Mick he acceded and seated himself at their table I suppose you have heard this last dodge of Shuffle and Screw Dusty said Mick What s that Every man had his key given him this evening half a crown a week round deducted from wages for rent Jim Plastow told them he lodged with his father and didn t want a house upon which they said he must let it Their day will come said Devilsdust thoughtfully I really think that those Shuffle and Screws are worse even than Truck and Trett You knew where you were with those fellows it was five and twenty per cent off wages and very bad stuff for your money But as for Shuffle and Screw what with their fines and their keys a man never knows what he has to spend Come he added filling his glass let s have a toast Confusion to Capital That s your sort said Mick Come Caroline drink to your partner s toast Miss Harriet Money s the root of all evil which nobody can deny We ll have the rights of labour yet the ten hour bill no fines and no individuals admitted to any work who have not completed their sixteenth year No fifteen said Caroline eagerly The people won t bear their grievances much longer said Devilsdust I think one of the greatest grievances the people have said Caroline is the beaks serving notice on Chaffing Jack to shut up the Temple on Sunday nights It is infamous said Mick aynt we to have no recreation One might as well live in Suffolk where the immigrants come from and where they are obliged to burn ricks to pass the time As for the rights of labour said Harriet the people goes for nothing with this machinery And you have opened your mouth to say a very sensible thing Miss Harriet said Mick but if I were Lord Paramount for eight and forty hours I d soon settle that question Wouldn t I fire a broadside into their double deckers The battle of Navarino at Mowbray fair with fourteen squibs from the admiral s ship going off at the same time should be nothing to it Labour may be weak but Capital is weaker said Devilsdust Their capital is all paper I tell you what said Mick with a knowing look and in a lowered tone The only thing my hearties that can save this here nation is a good strike Book two Chapter eleven Your lordship s dinner is served announced the groom of the chambers to Lord de Mowbray and the noble lord led out Lady Marney The rest followed Egremont found himself seated next to Lady Maud Fitz Warene the younger daughter of the earl Nearly opposite to him was Lady Joan The ladies Fitz Warene were sandy girls somewhat tall with rather good figures and a grand air the eldest very ugly the second rather pretty and yet both very much alike They had both great conversational powers though in different ways Lady Joan was doctrinal Lady Maud inquisitive the first often imparted information which you did not previously possess the other suggested ideas which were often before in your own mind but lay tranquil and unobserved till called into life and notice by her fanciful and vivacious tongue Both of them were endowed with a very remarkable self possession but Lady Joan wanted softness and Lady Maud repose This was the result of the rapid observation of Egremont who was however experienced in the world and quick in his detection of manner and of character The dinner was stately as becomes the high nobility There were many guests yet the table seemed only a gorgeous spot in the capacious chamber The side tables were laden with silver vases and golden shields arranged on shelves of crimson velvet The walls were covered with Fitz Warenes De Mowbrays and De Veres The attendants glided about without noise and with the precision of military discipline They watched your wants they anticipated your wishes and they supplied all you desired with a lofty air of pompous devotion You came by the railroad enquired Lord de Mowbray mournfully of Lady Marney From Marham about ten miles from us replied her ladyship A great revolution Isn t it I fear it has a very dangerous tendency to equality said his lordship shaking his head I suppose Lord Marney gives them all the opposition in his power There is nobody so violent against railroads as George said Lady Marney I cannot tell you what he does not do He organized the whole of our division against the Marham line I rather counted on him said Lord de Mowbray to assist me in resisting this joint branch here but I was surprised to learn he had consented Not until the compensation was settled innocently remarked Lady Marney George never opposes them after that He gave up all opposition to the Marham line when they agreed to his terms And yet said Lord de Mowbray I think if Lord Marney would take a different view of the case and look to the moral consequences he would hesitate Equality Lady Marney equality is not our metier If we nobles do not make a stand against the levelling spirit of the age I am at a loss to know who will fight the battle You many depend upon it that these railroads are very dangerous things I have no doubt of it I suppose you have heard of Lady Vanilla s trip from Birmingham Have you not indeed She came up with Lady Laura and two of the most gentlemanlike men sitting opposite her never met she says two more intelligent men She begged one of them at Wolverhampton to change seats with her and he was most politely willing to comply with her wishes only it was necessary that his companion should move at the same time for they were chained together Two of the swell mob sent to town for picking a pocket at Shrewsbury races A countess and a felon So much for public conveyances said Lord Mowbray But Lady Vanilla is one of those who will talk with everybody She is very amusing though said Lady Marney I dare say she is said Lord de Mowbray but believe me my dear Lady Marney in these times especially a countess has something else to do than be amusing You think as property has its duties as well as its rights rank has its bores as well as its pleasures Lord Mowbray mused How do you do mister Jermyn said a lively little lady with sparkling beady black eyes and a very yellow complexion though with good features when did you arrive in the North I have been fighting your battles finely since I saw you she added shaking her head rather with an expression of admonition than of sympathy You are always fighting one s battles Lady Firebrace it is very kind of you If it were not for you we should none of us know how much we are all abused replied mister Jermyn a young M P They say you gave the most radical pledges said Lady Firebrace eagerly and not without malice I heard Lord Muddlebrains say that if he had had the least idea of your principles you would not have had his influence Muddlebrains can t command a single vote said mister Jermyn He is a political humbug the greatest of all humbugs a man who swaggers about London clubs and consults solemnly about his influence and in the country is a nonentity Well that can t be said of Lord Clarinel rejoined Lady Firebrace And have you been defending me against Lord Clarinel s attacks inquired mister Jermyn No but I am going to Wemsbury and then I have no doubt I shall have the opportunity I am going to Wemsbury myself said mister Jermyn And what does Lord Clarinel think of your pledge about the pension list said Lady Firebrace daunted but malignant He never told me said mister Jermyn I believe you did not pledge yourself to the ballot inquired Lady Firebrace with an affected air of inquisitiveness It is a subject that requires some reflection said mister Jermyn I must consult some profound politician like Lady Firebrace By the bye you told my mother that the conservatives would have a majority of fifteen Do you think they will have as much said mister Jermyn with an innocent air it now being notorious that the whig administration had a majority of double that amount I said mister Tadpole gave us a majority of fifteen said Lady Firebrace I knew he was in error because I had happened to see Lord Melbourne s own list made up to the last hour and which gave the government a majority of sixty It was only shown to three members of the cabinet she added in a tone of triumphant mystery Lady Firebrace a great stateswoman among the tories was proud of an admirer who was a member of the whig cabinet She was rather an agreeable guest in a country house with her extensive correspondence and her bulletins from both sides Tadpole flattered by her notice and charmed with female society that talked his own slang and entered with affected enthusiasm into all his dirty plots and barren machinations was vigilant in his communications while her whig cavalier an easy individual who always made love by talking or writing politics abandoned himself without reserve and instructed Lady Firebrace regularly after every council Taper looked grave at this connection between Tadpole and Lady Firebrace and whenever an election was lost or a division stuck in the mud he gave the cue with a nod and a monosyllable and the conservative pack that infests clubs chattering on subjects of which it is impossible they can know anything instantly began barking and yelping denouncing traitors and wondering how the leaders could be so led by the nose and not see that which was flagrant to the whole world If on the other hand the advantage seemed to go with the Canton Club or the opposition benches then it was the whig and liberal hounds who howled and moaned explaining everything by the indiscretion infatuation treason of Lord Viscount Masque and appealing to the initiated world of idiots around them whether any party could ever succeed hampered by such men and influenced by such means The best of the joke was that all this time Lord Masque and Tadpole were two old foxes neither of whom conveyed to Lady Firebrace a single circumstance but with the wish intention and malice aforethought that it should be communicated to his rival I must get you to interest Lord de Mowbray in our cause said Sir Vavasour Firebrace in an insinuating voice to his neighbour Lady Joan I have sent him a large packet of documents You know he is one of us still one of us Once a baronet always a baronet The dignity merges but does not cease and happy as I am to see one covered with high honours who is in every way so worthy of them still I confess to you it is not so much as Earl de Mowbray that your worthy father interests me as in his undoubted character and capacity of Sir Altamont Fitz Warene baronet You have the data on which you move I suppose well digested said Lady Joan attentive but not interested The case is clear as far as equity is concerned irresistible indeed the late king pledged himself to a certain point But if you would do me the favour of reading our memorial The proposition is not one adapted to our present civilisation said Lady Joan A baronetcy has become the distinction of the middle class a physician our physician for example is a baronet and I dare say some of our tradesmen brewers of people of that class An attempt to elevate them into an order of nobility however inferior would partake in some degree of the ridiculous And has the duke escaped his gout this year enquired Lord Marney of Lady de Mowbray A very slight touch I never knew my father so well I expect you will meet him here We look for him daily I shall be delighted I hope he will come to Marney in October I keep the blue ribbon cover for him What you suggest is very just said Egremont to Lady Maud If we only in our own spheres made the exertion the general effect would be great Marney Abbey for instance I believe one of the finest of our monastic remains that indeed is not disputed diminished yearly to repair barns the cattle browsing in the nave all this might be prevented If my brother would not consent to preserve or to restore still any member of the family even I without expense only with a little zeal as you say might prevent mischief might stop at least demolition If this movement in the church had only revived a taste for Christian architecture said Lady Maud it would not have been barren and it has done so much more But I am surprised that old families can be so dead to our national art so full of our ancestors their exploits their mind Indeed you and I have no excuse for such indifference mister Egremont And I do not think I shall ever again be justly accused of it replied Egremont you plead its cause so effectively But to tell you the truth I have been thinking of late about these things monasteries and so on the influence of the old church system on the happiness and comfort of the People And on the tone of the Nobles do not you think so said Lady Maud I know it is the fashion to deride the crusades but do not you think they had their origin in a great impulse and in a certain sense led to great results Pardon me if I speak with emphasis but I never can forget I am a daughter of the first crusaders The tone of society is certainly lower than of yore said Egremont It is easy to say we view the past through a fallacious medium We have however ample evidence that men feel less deeply than of old and act with less devotion But how far is this occasioned by the modern position of our church That is the question You must speak to mister saint Lys about that said Lady Maud Do you know him she added in a lowered tone No is he here Next to mamma And looking in that direction on the left hand of Lady Mowbray Egremont beheld a gentleman in the last year of his youth if youth according to the scale of Hippocrates cease at thirty five He was distinguished by that beauty of the noble English blood of which in these days few types remain the Norman tempered by the Saxon the fire of conquest softened by integrity and a serene though inflexible habit of mind The chains of convention an external life grown out of all proportion with that of the heart and mind have destroyed this dignified beauty There is no longer in fact an aristocracy in England for the superiority of the animal man is an essential quality of aristocracy But that it once existed any collection of portraits from the sixteenth century will show Aubrey saint Lys was a younger son of the most ancient Norman family in England The Conqueror had given them the moderate estate on which they now lived and which in spite of so many civil conflicts and religious changes they had handed down to each other from generation to generation for eight centuries Aubrey saint Lys was the vicar of Mowbray He had been the college tutor of the late Lord Fitz Warene whose mind he had formed whose bright abilities he had cultivated who adored him To that connection he owed the slight preferment which he possessed but which was all he desired A bishopric would not have tempted him from his peculiar charge In the centre of the town of Mowbray teeming with its toiling thousands there rose a building which might vie with many of the cathedrals of our land Beautiful its solemn towers its sculptured western front beautiful its columned aisles and lofty nave its sparkling shrine and delicate chantry most beautiful the streaming glories of its vast orient light This magnificent temple built by the monks of Mowbray and once connected with their famous house of which not a trace now remained had in time become the parish church of an obscure village whose population could not have filled one of its side chapels These strange vicissitudes of ecclesiastical buildings are not singular in the north of England Mowbray Church remained for centuries the wonder of passing peasants and the glory of county histories But there is a magic in beautiful buildings which exercises an irresistible influence over the mind of man One of the reasons urged for the destruction of the monasteries after the dispersion of their inhabitants was the pernicious influence of their solemn and stately forms on the memories and imagination of those that beheld them It was impossible to connect systematic crime with the creators of such divine fabrics And so it was with Mowbray Church When manufactures were introduced into this district which abounded with all the qualities which were necessary for their successful pursuit Mowbray offering equal though not superior advantages to other positions was accorded the preference because it possessed such a beautiful church The lingering genius of the monks of Mowbray hovered round the spot which they had adorned and sanctified and loved and thus they had indirectly become the authors of its present greatness and prosperity Unhappily for a long season the vicars of Mowbray had been little conscious of their mission An immense population gathered round the sacred citadel and gradually spread on all sides of it for miles But the parish church for a long time remained the only one at Mowbray when the population of the town exceeded that of some European capitals And even in the parish church the frigid spell of Erastian self complacency fatally prevailed A scanty congregation gathered together for form and as much influenced by party as higher sentiments Going to church was held more genteel than going to meeting The principal tradesmen of the neighbouring great houses deemed it more aristocratic using a favourite and hackneyed epithet which only expressed their own servility About the time the Church Commission issued the congregation of Mowbray was approaching zero There was an idea afloat for a time of making it the seat of a new bishopric the cathedral was ready another instance of the influence of fine art But there was no residence for the projected prelate and a jobbing bishop on the commission was afraid that he might have to contribute to building one So the idea died away and the living having become vacant at this moment instead of a bishop Mowbray received a humble vicar in the shape of Aubrey saint Lys who came among a hundred thousand heathens to preach the Unknown God Book two Chapter twelve And how do you find the people about you Marney said Lord de Mowbray seating himself on a sofa by his guest All very well my lord replied the earl who ever treated Lord de Mowbray with a certain degree of ceremony especially when the descendant of the crusaders affected the familiar There was something of a Puck like malignity in the temperament of Lord Marney which exhibited itself in a remarkable talent for mortifying persons in a small way by a gesture an expression a look cloaked too very often with all the character of profound deference The old nobility of Spain delighted to address each other only by their names when in the presence of a spick and span grandee calling each other Infantado Sidonia Ossuna and then turning round with the most distinguished consideration and appealing to the Most Noble Marquis of Ensenada They begin to get a little uneasy here said Lord de Mowbray We have nothing to complain of said Lord Marney We continue reducing the rates and as long as we do that the country must improve The workhouse test tells We had the other day a case of incendiarism which frightened some people but I inquired into it and am quite satisfied it originated in purely accidental circumstances at least nothing to do with wages I ought to be a judge for it was on my own property And what is the rate of wages in your part of the world Lord Marney inquired mister saint Lys who was standing by Oh good enough not like your manufacturing districts but people who work in the open air instead of a furnace can t expect and don t require such They get their eight shillings a week at least generally Eight shillings a week said mister saint Lys Can a labouring man with a family perhaps of eight children live on eight shillings a week Oh as for that said Lord Marney they get more than that because there is beer money allowed at least to a great extent among us though I for one do not approve of the practice and that makes nearly a shilling per week additional and then some of them have potatoe grounds though I am entirely opposed to that system And yet said mister saint Lys how they contrive to live is to me marvellous Oh as for that said Lord Marney I have generally found the higher the wages the worse the workman They only spend their money in the beer shops They are the curse of this country But what is a poor man to do said mister saint Lys after his day s work if he returns to his own roof and finds no home his fire extinguished his food unprepared the partner of his life wearied with labour in the field or the factory still absent or perhaps in bed from exhaustion or because she has returned wet to the skin and has no change of raiment for her relief We have removed woman from her sphere we may have reduced wages by her introduction into the market of labour but under these circumstances what we call domestic life is a condition impossible to be realized for the people of this country and we must not therefore be surprised that they seek solace or rather refuge in the beer shop Lord Marney looked up at mister saint Lys with a stare of high bred impertinence and then carelessly observed without directing his words to him They may say what they like but it is all an affair of population I would rather believe that it is an affair of resources said mister saint Lys not what is the amount of our population but what is the amount of our resources for their maintenance It comes to the same thing said Lord Marney Nothing can put this country right but emigration on a great scale and as the government do not choose to undertake it I have commenced it for my own defence on a small scale I will take care that the population of my parishes is not increased I build no cottages and I destroy all I can and I am not ashamed or afraid to say so You have declared war to the cottage then said mister saint Lys smiling It is not at the first sound so startling a cry as war to the castle But you think it may lead to it said Lord Mowbray I love not to be a prophet of evil said mister saint Lys Lord Marney rose from his seat and addressed Lady Firebrace whose husband in another part of the room had caught mister Jermyn and was opening his mind on the question of the day Lady Maud followed by Egremont approached mister saint Lys and said mister Egremont has a great feeling for Christian architecture mister saint Lys and wishes particularly to visit our church of which we are so proud And in a few moments they were seated together and engaged in conversation Lord Mowbray placed himself by the side of Lady Marney who was seated by his countess Oh how I envy you at Marney he exclaimed No manufactures no smoke living in the midst of a beautiful park and surrounded by a contented peasantry It is very delightful said Lady Marney but then we are so very dull we have really no neighbourhood I think that such a great advantage said Lady Mowbray I must say I like my friends from London I never know what to say to the people here Excellent people the very best people in the world the way they behaved to poor dear Fitz Warene when they wanted him to stand for the county I never can forget but then they do not know the people we know or do the things we do and when you have gone through the routine of county questions and exhausted the weather and all the winds I am positively my dear Lady Marney aux abois and then they think you are proud when really one is only stupid I am very fond of work said Lady Marney and I talk to them always about it Ah you are fortunate I never could work and Joan and Maud they neither of them work Maud did embroider a banner once for her brother it is in the hail I think it beautiful but somehow or other she never cultivated her talent For all that has occurred or may occur said mister saint Lys to Egremont I blame only the Church The church deserted the people and from that moment the church has been in danger and the people degraded Formerly religion undertook to satisfy the noble wants of human nature and by its festivals relieved the painful weariness of toil The day of rest was consecrated if not always to elevated thought at least to sweet and noble sentiments The church convened to its solemnities under its splendid and almost celestial roofs amid the finest monuments of art that human hands have raised the whole Christian population for there in the presence of God all were brethren It shared equally among all its prayer its incense and its music its sacred instructions and the highest enjoyments that the arts could afford You believe then in the efficacy of forms and ceremonies What you call forms and ceremonies represent the divinest instincts of our nature Push your aversion to forms and ceremonies to a legitimate conclusion and you would prefer kneeling in a barn rather than in a cathedral Your tenets would strike at the very existence of all art which is essentially spiritual I am not speaking abstractedly said Egremont but rather with reference to the indirect connection of these forms and ceremonies with another church The people of this country associate them with an enthralling superstition and a foreign dominion With Rome said mister saint Lys yet forms and ceremonies existed before Rome But practically said Egremont has not their revival in our service at the present day a tendency to restore the Romish system in this country It is difficult to ascertain what may be the practical effect of certain circumstances among the uninformed said mister saint Lys The church of Rome is to be respected as the only Hebraeo christian church extant all other churches established by the Hebrew apostles have disappeared but Rome remains and we must never permit the exaggerated position which it assumed in the middle centuries to make us forget its early and apostolical character when it was fresh from Palestine and as it were fragrant from Paradise The church of Rome is sustained by apostolical succession but apostolical succession is not an institution complete in itself it is a part of a whole if it be not part of a whole it has no foundation The apostles succeeded the prophets Our Master announced himself as the last of the prophets They in their turn were the heirs of the patriarchs men who were in direct communication with the Most High To men not less favoured than the apostles the revelation of the priestly character was made and those forms and ceremonies ordained which the church of Rome has never relinquished But Rome did not invent them upon their practice the duty of all congregations we cannot consent to her founding a claim to supremacy For would you maintain then that the church did not exist in the time of the prophets Was Moses then not a churchman And Aaron was he not a high priest Ay greater than any pope or prelate whether he be at Rome or at Lambeth In all these church discussions we are apt to forget that the second Testament is avowedly only a supplement Jehovah Jesus came to complete the law and the prophets Christianity is completed Judaism or it is nothing Christianity is incomprehensible without Judaism as Judaism is incomplete without Christianity What has Rome to do with its completion what with its commencement The law was not thundered forth from the Capitolian mount the divine atonement was not fulfilled upon Mons Sacer No the order of our priesthood comes directly from Jehovah and the forms and ceremonies of His church are the regulations of His supreme intelligence Rome indeed boasts that the authenticity of the second Testament depends upon the recognition of her infallibility The authenticity of the second Testament depends upon its congruity with the first Did Rome preserve that I recognize in the church an institution thoroughly sincerely catholic adapted to all climes and to all ages I do not bow to the necessity of a visible head in a defined locality but were I to seek for such it would not be at Rome I cannot discover in its history however memorable any testimony of a mission so sublime When Omnipotence deigned to be incarnate the Ineffable Word did not select a Roman frame The prophets were not Romans the apostles were not Romans she who was blessed above all women I never heard she was a Roman maiden No I should look to a land more distant than Italy to a city more sacred even than Rome Book two Chapter thirteen It was a cloudy glimmering dawn A cold withering east wind blew through the silent streets of Mowbray The sounds of the night had died away the voices of the day had not commenced There reigned a stillness complete and absorbing Suddenly there is a voice there is movement The first footstep of the new week of toil is heard A man muffled up in a thick coat and bearing in his hand what would seem at the first glance to be a shepherd s crook only its handle is much longer appears upon the pavement He touches a number of windows with great quickness as he moves rapidly along A rattling noise sounds upon each pane The use of the long handle of his instrument becomes apparent as he proceeds enabling him as it does to reach the upper windows of the dwellings whose inmates he has to rouse Those inmates are the factory girls who subscribe in districts to engage these heralds of the dawn and by a strict observance of whose citation they can alone escape the dreaded fine that awaits those who have not arrived at the door of the factory before the bell ceases to sound The sentry in question quitting the streets and stooping through one of the small archways that we have before noticed entered a court Here lodged a multitude of his employers and the long crook as it were by some sleight of hand seemed sounding on both sides and at many windows at the same moment Arrived at the end of the court he was about to touch the window of the upper story of the last tenement when that window opened and a man pale and care worn and in a melancholy voice spoke to him Simmons said the man you need not rouse this story any more my daughter has left us Has she left Webster s No but she has left us She has long murmured at her hard lot working like a slave and not for herself And she has gone as they all go to keep house for herself That s a bad business said the watchman in a tone not devoid of sympathy Almost as bad as for parents to live on their childrens wages replied the man mournfully And how is your good woman As poorly as needs be Harriet has never been home since Friday night She owes you nothing Not a halfpenny She was as regular as a little bee and always paid every Monday morning I am sorry she has left you neighbour The Lord s will be done It s hard times for such as us said the man and leaving the window open he retired into his room It was a single chamber of which he was the tenant In the centre placed so as to gain the best light which the gloomy situation could afford was a loom In two corners of the room were mattresses placed on the floor a check curtain hung upon a string if necessary concealing them In one was his sick wife in the other three young children two girls the eldest about eight years of age between them their baby brother An iron kettle was by the hearth and on the mantel piece some candles a few lucifer matches two tin mugs a paper of salt and an iron spoon In a farther part close to the wall was a heavy table or dresser this was a fixture as well as the form which was fastened by it The man seated himself at his loom he commenced his daily task Twelve hours of daily labour at the rate of one penny each hour and even this labour is mortgaged How is this to end Is it rather not ended And he looked around him at his chamber without resources no food no fuel no furniture and four human beings dependent on him and lying in their wretched beds because they had no clothes I cannot sell my loom he continued at the price of old firewood and it cost me gold It is not vice that has brought me to this nor indolence nor imprudence I was born to labour and I was ready to labour I loved my loom and my loom loved me It gave me a cottage in my native village surrounded by a garden of whose claims on my solicitude it was not jealous There was time for both It gave me for a wife the maiden that I had ever loved and it gathered my children round my hearth with plenteousness and peace I was content I sought no other lot It is not adversity that makes me look back upon the past with tenderness Then why am I here Why am I and six hundred thousand subjects of the Queen honest loyal and industrious why are we after manfully struggling for years and each year sinking lower in the scale why are we driven from our innocent and happy homes our country cottages that we loved first to bide in close towns without comforts and gradually to crouch into cellars or find a squalid lair like this without even the common necessaries of existence first the ordinary conveniences of life then raiment and at length food vanishing from us It is that the Capitalist has found a slave that has supplanted the labour and ingenuity of man Once he was an artizan at the best he now only watches machines and even that occupation slips from his grasp to the woman and the child The capitalist flourishes he amasses immense wealth we sink lower and lower lower than the beasts of burthen for they are fed better than we are cared for more And it is just for according to the present system they are more precious And yet they tell us that the interests of Capital and of Labour are identical If a society that has been created by labour suddenly becomes independent of it that society is bound to maintain the race whose only property is labour from the proceeds of that property which has not ceased to be productive When the class of the Nobility were supplanted in France they did not amount in number to one third of us Hand Loom weavers yet all Europe went to war to avenge their wrongs every state subscribed to maintain them in their adversity and when they were restored to their own country their own land supplied them with an immense indemnity Who cares for us Yet we have lost our estates Who raises a voice for us Yet we are at least as innocent as the nobility of France We sink among no sighs except our own And if they give us sympathy what then Sympathy is the solace of the Poor but for the Rich there is Compensation Is that Harriet said his wife moving in her bed The Hand Loom weaver was recalled from his reverie to the urgent misery that surrounded him No he replied in a quick hoarse voice it is not Harriet Why does not Harriet come She will come no more replied the weaver I told you so last night she can bear this place no longer and I am not surprised How are we to get food then rejoined his wife you ought not to have let her leave us You do nothing Warner You get no wages yourself and you have let the girl escape I will escape myself if you say that again said the weaver I have been up these three hours finishing this piece which ought to have been taken home on Saturday night But you have been paid for it beforehand You get nothing for your work A penny an hour What sort of work is it that brings a penny an hour Work that you have often admired Mary and has before this gained a prize But if you don t like the work said the man quitting his loom let it alone There was enough yet owing on this piece to have allowed us to break our fast However no matter we must starve sooner or later Let us begin at once No no Philip work Let us break our fast come what may Twit me no more then said the weaver resuming his seat or I throw the shuttle for the last time I will not taunt you said his wife in a kinder tone I was wrong I am sorry but I am very ill It is not for myself I speak I want not to eat I have no appetite my lips are so very parched But the children the children went supperless to bed and they will wake soon Mother we ayn t asleep said the elder girl No we aynt asleep mother said her sister we heard all that you said to father And baby He sleeps still I shiver very much said the mother It s a cold day Pray shut the window Warner I see the drops upon the pane it is raining I wonder if the persons below would lend us one block of coal We have borrowed too often said Warner I wish there were no such thing as coal in the land said his wife and then the engines would not be able to work and we should have our rights again Amen said Warner Don t you think Warner said his wife that you could sell that piece to some other person and owe Barber for the money he advanced No said her husband shaking his head I ll go straight And let your children starve said his wife when you could get five or six shillings at once But so it always was with you Why did not you go to the machines years ago like other men and so get used to them I should have been supplanted by this time said Warner by a girl or a woman It would have been just as bad Why there was your friend Walter Gerard he was the same as you and yet now he gets two pound a week at least I have often heard you say so Walter Gerard is a man of great parts said Warner and might have been a master himself by this time had he cared And why did he not He had no wife and children said Warner he was not so blessed The baby woke and began to cry Ah my child exclaimed the mother That wicked Harriet Here Amelia I have a morsel of crust here I saved it yesterday for baby moisten it in water and tie it up in this piece of calico he will suck it it will keep him quiet I can bear anything but his cry I shall have finished my job by noon said Warner and then please God we shall break our fast It is yet two hours to noon said his wife And Barber always keeps you so long I cannot bear that Barber I dare say he will not advance you money again as you did not bring the job home on Saturday night If I were you Philip I would go and sell the piece unfinished at once to one of the cheap shops I have gone straight all my life said Warner And much good it has done you said his wife My poor Amelia How she shivers I think the sun never touches this house It is indeed a most wretched place It will not annoy you long Mary said her husband I can pay no more rent and I only wonder they have not been here already to take the week And where are we to go said the wife To a place which certainly the sun never touches said her husband with a kind of malice in his misery to a cellar Oh why was I ever born exclaimed his wife And yet I was so happy once And it is not our fault I cannot make it out Warner why you should not get two pounds a week like Walter Gerard Bah said the husband You said he had no family continued his wife I thought he had a daughter But she is no burthen to him The sister of mister Trafford is the Superior of the convent here and she took Sybil when her mother died and brought her up Oh then she is a nun Not yet but I dare say it will end in it Well I think I would even sooner starve said his wife than my children should be nuns At this moment there was a knocking at the door Warner descended from his loom and opened it Lives Philip Warner here enquired a clear voice of peculiar sweetness My name is Warner I come from Walter Gerard continued the voice Your letter reached him only last night The girl at whose house your daughter left it has quitted this week past mister Trafford s factory Pray enter And there entered SYBIL Book two Chapter fourteen Your wife is ill said Sybil Very replied Warner s wife Our daughter has behaved infamously to us She has quitted us without saying by your leave or with your leave And her wages were almost the only thing left to us for Philip is not like Walter Gerard you see he cannot earn two pounds a week though why he cannot I never could understand Hush hush wife said Warner I speak I apprehend to Gerard s daughter Just so Ah this is good and kind this is like old times for Walter Gerard was my friend when I was not exactly as I am now He tells me so he sent a messenger to me last night to visit you this morning Your letter reached him only yesterday Harriet was to give it to Caroline said the wife That s the girl who has done all the mischief and inveigled her away And she has left Trafford s works has she Then I will be bound she and Harriet are keeping house together You suffer said Sybil moving to the bed side of the woman give me your hand she added in a soft sweet tone Tis hot I feel very cold said the woman Warner would have the window open till the rain came in And you I fear are wet said Warner addressing Sybil and interrupting his wife Very slightly And you have no fire Ah I have brought some things for you but not fuel If he would only ask the person down stairs said his wife for a block of coal I tell him neighbours could hardly refuse but he never will do anything he says he has asked too often I will ask said Sybil But first I have a companion without she added who bears a basket for you Come in Harold The baby began to cry the moment a large dog entered the room a young bloodhound of the ancient breed such as are now found but in a few old halls and granges in the north of England Sybil untied the basket and gave a piece of sugar to the screaming infant Her glance was sweeter even than her remedy the infant stared at her with his large blue eyes for an instant astonished and then he smiled Oh beautiful child exclaimed Sybil and she took the babe up from the mattress and embraced it You are an angel from heaven exclaimed the mother and you may well say beautiful And only to think of that infamous girl Harriet to desert us all in this way Sybil drew forth the contents of the convent basket and called Warner s attention to them Now she said arrange all this as I tell you and I will go down stairs and speak to them below as you wish Harold rest there and the dog laid himself down in the remotest corner And is that Gerard s daughter said the weaver s wife Only think what it is to gain two pounds a week and bring up your daughters in that way instead of such shameless husseys as our Harriet But with such wages one can do anything What have you there Warner Is that tea Oh I should like some tea I do think tea would do me some good I have quite a longing for it Run down Warner and ask them to let us have a kettle of hot water It is better than all the fire in the world Amelia my dear do you see what they have sent us Plenty to eat Tell Maria all about it You are good girls you will never be like that infamous Harriet When you earn wages you will give them to your poor mother and baby won t you Yes mother said Amelia And father too said Maria And father too said the wife He has been a very good father to you all and I never can understand why one who works so hard should earn so little but I believe it is the fault of those machines The police ought to put them down and then every body would be comfortable Sybil and Warner re entered the fire was lit the tea made the meal partaken An air of comfort even of enjoyment was diffused over this chamber but a few minutes back so desolate and unhappy Well said the wife raising herself a little up in her bed I feel as if that dish of tea had saved my life Amelia have you had any tea And Maria You see what it is to be good girls the Lord will never desert you The day is fast coming when that Harriet will know what the want of a dish of tea is with all her fine wages And I am sure she added addressing Sybil what we all owe to you is not to be told Your father well deserves his good fortune with such a daughter My father s fortunes are not much better than his neighbours said Sybil but his wants are few and who should sympathise with the poor but the poor Alas none else can Besides it is the Superior of our convent that has sent you this meal What my father can do for you I have told your husband Tis little but with the favour of heaven it may avail When the people support the people the divine blessing will not be wanting I am sure the divine blessing will never be wanting to you said Warner in a voice of great emotion There was silence the querulous spirit of the wife was subdued by the tone of Sybil she revolved in her mind the present and the past the children pursued their ungrudged and unusual meal the daughter of Gerard that she might not interfere with their occupation walked to the window and surveyed the chink of troubled sky which was visible in the court The wind blew in gusts the rain beat against the glass Soon after this there was another knock at the door Harold started from his repose and growled Warner rose and saying they have come for the rent Thank God I am ready advanced and opened the door Two men offered with courtesy to enter We are strangers said he who took the lead but would not be such I speak to Warner My name And I am your spiritual pastor if to be the vicar of Mowbray entitles me to that description mister saint Lys The same One of the most valued of my flock and the most influential person in this district has been speaking much of you to me this morning You are working for him He did not hear of you on Saturday night he feared you were ill mister Barber spoke to me of your distress as well as of your good character I came to express to you my respect and my sympathy and to offer you my assistance You are most good sir and mister Barber too and indeed an hour ago we were in as great straits And are now sir exclaimed his wife interrupting him I have been in this bed a week and may never rise from it again the children have no clothes they are pawned everything is pawned this morning we had neither fuel nor food And we thought you had come for the rent which we cannot pay If it had not been for a dish of tea which was charitably given me this morning by a person almost as poor as ourselves that is to say they live by labour though their wages are much higher as high as two pounds a week though how that can be I never shall understand when my husband is working twelve hours a day and gaining only a penny an hour if it had not been for this I should have been a corpse and yet he says we were in straits merely because Walter Gerard s daughter who I willingly grant is an angel from heaven for all the good she has done us has stepped into our aid But the poor supporting the poor as she well says what good can come from that During this ebullition mister saint Lys had surveyed the apartment and recognised Sybil Sister he said when the wife of Warner had ceased this is not the first time we have met under the roof of sorrow Sybil bent in silence and moved as if she were about to retire the wind and rain came dashing against the window The companion of mister saint Lys who was clad in a rough great coat and was shaking the wet off an oilskin hat known by the name of a south wester advanced and said to her It is but a squall but a very severe one I would recommend you to stay for a few minutes She received this remark with courtesy but did not reply I think continued the companion of mister saint Lys that this is not the first time also that we have met I cannot recall our meeting before said Sybil And yet it was not many days past though the sky was so very different that it would almost make one believe it was in another land and another clime Sybil looked at him as if for explanation It was at Marney Abbey said the companion of mister saint Lys I was there and I remember when about to rejoin my companions they were not alone And you disappeared very suddenly I thought for I left the ruins almost at the same moment as your friends yet I never saw any of you again We took our course a very rugged one you perhaps pursued a more even way Was it your first visit to Marney My first and my last There was no place I more desired to see no place of which the vision made me so sad The glory has departed said Egremont mournfully It is not that said Sybil I was prepared for decay but not for such absolute desecration The Abbey seems a quarry for materials to repair farm houses and the nave a cattle gate What people they must be that family of sacrilege who hold these lands Hem said Egremont They certainly do not appear to have much feeling for ecclesiastical art And for little else as we were told said Sybil There was a fire at the Abbey farm the day we were there and from all that reached us it would appear the people were as little tendered as the Abbey walls They have some difficulty perhaps in employing their population in those parts You know the country Not at all I was travelling in the neighbourhood and made a diversion for the sake of seeing an abbey of which I had heard so much Yes it was the greatest of the Northern Houses But they told me the people were most wretched round the Abbey nor do I think there is any other cause for their misery than the hard hearts of the family that have got the lands You feel deeply for the people said Egremont looking at her earnestly Sybil returned him a glance expressive of some astonishment and then said And do not you Your presence here assures me of it I humbly follow one who would comfort the unhappy The charity of mister saint Lys is known to all And you you too are a ministering angel There is no merit in my conduct for there is no sacrifice When I remember what this English people once was the truest the freest and the bravest the best natured and the best looking the happiest and most religious race upon the surface of this globe and think of them now with all their crimes and all their slavish sufferings their soured spirits and their stunted forms their lives without enjoyment and their deaths without hope I may well feel for them even if I were not the daughter of their blood And that blood mantled to her cheek as she ceased to speak and her dark eye gleamed with emotion and an expression of pride and courage hovered on her brow Egremont caught her glance and withdrew his own his heart was troubled saint Lys who had been in conference with the weaver left him and went to the bedside of his wife Warner advanced to Sybil and expressed his feelings for her father his sense of her goodness She observing that the squall seemed to have ceased bade him farewell and calling Harold quitted the chamber Book two Chapter fifteen Where have you been all the morning Charles said Lord Marney coming into his brother s dressing room a few minutes before dinner Arabella had made the nicest little riding party for you and Lady Joan and you were to be found nowhere If you go on in this way there is no use of having affectionate relations or anything else I have been walking about Mowbray One should see a factory once in one s life I don t see the necessity said Lord Marney I never saw one and never intend Though to be sure when I hear the rents that Mowbray gets for his land in their neighbourhood I must say I wish the worsted works had answered at Marney And if it had not been for our poor dear father they would Our family have always been against manufactories railroads everything said Egremont Railroads are very good things with high compensation said Lord Marney and manufactories not so bad with high rents but after all these are enterprises for the canaille and I hate them in my heart But they employ the people George The people do not want employment it is the greatest mistake in the world all this employment is a stimulus to population Never mind that what I came in for is to tell you that both Arabella and myself think you talk too much to Lady Maud I like her the best What has that to do with it my dear fellow Business is business Old Mowbray will make an elder son out of his elder daughter The affair is settled I know it from the best authority Talking to Lady Maud is insanity It is all the same for her as if Fitz Warene had never died And then that great event which ought to be the foundation of your fortune would be perfectly thrown away Lady Maud at the best is nothing more than twenty thousand pounds and a fat living Besides she is engaged to that parson fellow saint Lys saint Lys told me to day that nothing would ever induce him to marry He would practise celibacy though he would not enjoin it Enjoin fiddle stick How came you to be talking to such a sanctified imposter and I believe with all his fine phrases a complete radical I tell you what Charles you must really make way with Lady Joan The grandfather has come to day the old Duke Quite a family party It looks so well Never was such a golden opportunity And you must be sharp too That little Jermyn with his brown eyes and his white hands has not come down here in the month of August with no sport of any kind for nothing I shall set Lady Firebrace at him She is quite your friend and a very sensible woman too Charles and an ally not to be despised Lady Joan has a very high opinion of her There s the bell Well I shall tell Arabella that you mean to put up the steam and Lady Firebrace shall keep Jermyn off And perhaps it is as well you did not seem too eager at first Mowbray Castle my dear fellow in spite of its manufactories is not to be despised And with a little firmness you could keep the people out of your park Mowbray could do it only he has no pluck He is afraid people would say he was the son of a footman The Duke who was the father of the Countess de Mowbray was also lord lieutenant of the county Although advanced in years he was still extremely handsome with the most winning manners full of amenity and grace He had been a roue in his youth but seemed now the perfect representative of a benignant and virtuous old age He was universally popular admired by young men adored by young ladies Lord de Mowbray paid him the most distinguished consideration It was genuine However maliciously the origin of his own father might be represented nobody could deprive him of that great fact his father in law a duke a duke of a great house who had intermarried for generations with great houses one of the old nobility and something even loftier The county of which his grace was Lord Lieutenant was very proud of its nobility and certainly with Marney Abbey at one end and Mowbray Castle at the other it had just cause but both these illustrious houses yielded in importance though not in possessions to the great peer who was the governor of the province A French actress clever as French actresses always are had persuaded once upon a time an easy tempered monarch of this realm that the paternity of her coming babe was a distinction of which his majesty might be proud His majesty did not much believe her but he was a sensible man and never disputed a point with a woman so when the babe was born and proved a boy he christened him with his name and elevated him to the peerage in his cradle by the title of Duke of Fitz Aquitaine and Marquis of Gascony An estate the royal father could not endow him with for he had spent all his money mortgaged all his resources and was obliged to run in debt himself for the jewels of the rest of his mistresses but he did his best for the young peer as became an affectionate father or a fond lover His majesty made him when he arrived at man s estate the hereditary keeper of a palace which he possessed in the north of England and this secured his grace a castle and a park He could wave his flag and kill his deer and if he had only possessed an estate he would have been as well off as if he had helped conquer the realm with King William or plundered the church for King Harry A revenue must however be found for the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine and it was furnished without the interference of Parliament but with a financial dexterity worthy of that assembly to whom and not to our sovereigns we are obliged for the public debt The king granted the duke and his heirs for ever a pension on the post office a light tax upon coals shipped to London and a tithe of all the shrimps caught on the southern coast This last source of revenue became in time with the development of watering places extremely prolific And so what with the foreign courts and colonies for the younger sons it was thus contrived very respectably to maintain the hereditary dignity of this great peer The present Duke of Fitz Aquitaine had supported the Reform Bill but had been shocked by the Appropriation clause very much admired Lord Stanley and was apt to observe that if that nobleman had been the leader of the conservative party he hardly knew what he might not have done himself But the duke was an old whig had lived with old whigs all his life feared revolution but still more the necessity of taking his name out of Brookes where he had looked in every day or night since he came of age So not approving of what was going on yet not caring to desert his friends he withdrew as the phrase runs from public life that is to say was rarely in his seat did not continue to Lord Melbourne the proxy that had been entrusted to Lord Grey and made tory magistrates in his county though a whig lord lieutenant When forces were numbered and speculations on the future indulged in by the Tadpoles and Tapers the name of the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine was mentioned with a knowing look and in a mysterious tone Nothing more was necessary between Tadpole and Taper but if some hack in statu pupillari happened to be present at the conference and the gentle novice greedy for party tattle and full of admiring reverence for the two great hierophants of petty mysteries before him ventured to intimate his anxiety for initiation the secret was entrusted to him that all was right there that his grace only watched his opportunity that he was heartily sick of the present men indeed would have gone over with Lord Stanley in eighteen thirty five had he not had a fit of the gout which prevented him from coming up from the north and though to be sure his son and brother did vote against the speaker still that was a mistake if a letter had been sent which was not written they would have voted the other way and perhaps Sir Robert might have been in at the present moment The Duke of Fitz Aquitaine was the great staple of Lady Firebrace s correspondence with mister Tadpole Woman s mission took the shape to her intelligence of getting over his grace to the conservatives She was much assisted in these endeavours by the information which she so dexterously acquired from the innocent and incautious Lord Masque Egremont was seated at dinner to day by the side of Lady Joan Unconsciously to himself this had been arranged by Lady Marney The action of woman on our destiny is unceasing Egremont was scarcely in a happy mood for conversation He was pensive inclined to be absent his thoughts indeed were of other things and persons than those around him Lady Joan however only required a listener She did not make enquiries like Lady Maud or impart her own impressions by suggesting them as your own Lady Joan gave Egremont an account of the Aztec cities of which she had been reading that morning and of the several historical theories which their discovery had suggested then she imparted her own which differed from all but which seemed clearly the right one Mexico led to Egypt Lady Joan was as familiar with the Pharaohs as with the Caciques of the new world The phonetic system was despatched by the way Then came Champollion then Paris then all its celebrities literary and especially scientific then came the letter from Arago received that morning and the letter from doctor Buckland expected to morrow She was delighted that one had written wondered why the other had not Finally before the ladies had retired she had invited Egremont to join Lady Marney in a visit to her observatory where they were to behold a comet which she had been the first to detect Lady Firebrace next to the duke indulged in mysterious fiddle fadde as to the state of parties She too had her correspondents and her letters received or awaited Tadpole said this Lord Masque on the contrary said that the truth lay perhaps between them some result developed by the clear intelligence of Lady Firebrace acting on the data with which they supplied her The duke listened with calm excitement to the transcendental revelations of his Egeria Nothing appeared to be concealed from her the inmost mind of the sovereign there was not a royal prejudice that was not mapped in her secret inventory the cabinets of the whigs and the clubs of the tories she had the open sesame to all of them Sir Somebody did not want office though he pretended to and Lord Nobody did want office though he pretended he did not One great man thought the pear was not ripe another that it was quite rotten but then the first was coming on the stage and the other was going off In estimating the accuracy of a political opinion one should take into consideration the standing of the opinionist At the right moment and when she was sure she was not overheard Lady Firebrace played her trump card the pack having been previously cut by mister Tadpole And who do you think Sir Robert would send to Ireland and she looked up in the face of the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine I suppose the person he sent before said his grace Lady Firebrace shook her head Lord Haddington will not go to Ireland again replied her ladyship mysteriously mark me And Lord De Grey does not like to go and if he did there are objections And the Duke of Northumberland he will not go And who else is there We must have a nobleman of the highest rank for Ireland one who has not mixed himself up with Irish questions who has always been in old days for emancipation a conservative not an orangeman You understand That is the person Sir Robert will send and whom Sir Robert wants He will have some difficulty in finding such a person said the duke If indeed the blundering affair of eighteen thirty four had not occurred and things had taken their legitimate course and we had seen a man like Lord Stanley for instance at the head of affairs or leading a great party why then indeed your friends the conservatives for every sensible man must be a conservative in the right sense of the word would have stood in a very different position but now and his grace shook his head Sir Robert will never consent to form a government again without Lord Stanley said Lady Firebrace Perhaps not said the duke Do you know whose name I have heard mentioned in a certain quarter as the person Sir Robert would wish to see in Ireland continued Lady Firebrace His grace leant his ear The Duke of Fitz Aquitaine said Lady Firebrace Quite impossible said the duke I am no party man if I be anything I am a supporter of the government True it is I do not like the way they are going on and I disapprove of all their measures but we must stand by our friends Lady Firebrace To be sure if the country were in danger and the Queen personally appealed to one and the conservative party were really a conservative party and not an old crazy faction vamped up and whitewashed into decency one might pause and consider But I am free to confess I must see things in a very different condition to what they are at present before I could be called upon to take that step I must see men like Lord Stanley I know what you are going to say my dear Duke of Fitz Aquitaine I tell you again Lord Stanley is with us heart and soul and before long I feel persuaded I shall see your grace in the Castle of Dublin I am too old at least I am afraid so said the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine with a relenting smile Book two Chapter sixteen About three miles before it reaches the town the river Mowe undulates through a plain The scene though not very picturesque has a glad and sparkling character A stone bridge unites the opposite banks by three arches of good proportion the land about consists of meads of a vivid colour or vegetable gardens to supply the neighbouring population and whose various hues give life and lightness to the level ground The immediate boundaries of the plain on either side are chiefly woods above the crest of which in one direction expands the brown bosom of a moor The few cottages which are sprinkled about this scene being built of stone and on an ample scale contribute to the idea of comfort and plenty which with a serene sky and on a soft summer day the traveller willingly associates with it Such was the sky and season in which Egremont emerged on this scene a few days after the incidents recorded in our last chapter He had been fishing in the park of Mowbray and had followed the rivulet through many windings until quitting the enclosed domain it had forced its way through some craggy underwood at the bottom of the hilly moors we have noticed and finally entering the plain lost itself in the waters of the greater stream Good sport had not awaited Egremont Truth to say his rod had played in a very careless hand He had taken it though an adept in the craft when in the mood rather as an excuse to be alone than a means to be amused There are seasons in life when solitude is a necessity and such a one had now descended on the spirit of the brother of Lord Marney The form of Sybil Gerard was stamped upon his brain It blended with all thoughts it haunted every object Who was this girl unlike all women whom he had yet encountered who spoke with such sweet seriousness of things of such vast import but which had never crossed his mind and with a kind of mournful majesty bewailed the degradation of her race The daughter of the lowly yet proud of her birth Not a noble lady in the land who could boast a mien more complete and none of them thus gifted who possessed withal the fascinating simplicity that pervaded every gesture and accent of the daughter of Gerard Yes the daughter of Gerard the daughter of a workman at a manufactory It had not been difficult after the departure of Sybil to extract this information from the garrulous wife of the weaver And that father he was not unknown to Egremont His proud form and generous countenance were still fresh in the mind s eye of our friend Not less so his thoughtful speech full of knowledge and meditation and earnest feeling How much that he had spoken still echoed in the heart and rung in the brooding ear of Egremont And his friend too that pale man with those glittering eyes who without affectation without pedantry with artlessness on the contrary and a degree of earnest singleness had glanced like a master of philosophy at the loftiest principles of political science was he too a workman And are these then THE PEOPLE If so thought Egremont would that I lived more among them Compared with their converse the tattle of our saloons has in it something humiliating It is not merely that it is deficient in warmth and depth and breadth that it is always discussing persons instead of principles and cloaking its want of thought in mimetic dogmas and its want of feeling in superficial raillery it is not merely that it has neither imagination nor fancy nor sentiment nor feeling nor knowledge to recommend it but it appears to me even as regards manner and expression inferior in refinement and phraseology in short trivial uninteresting stupid really vulgar It seemed to Egremont that from the day he met these persons in the Abbey ruins the horizon of his experience had insensibly expanded more than that there were streaks of light breaking in the distance which already gave a new aspect to much that was known and which perhaps was ultimately destined to reveal much that was now utterly obscure He could not resist the conviction that from the time in question his sympathies had become more lively and more extended that a masculine impulse had been given to his mind that he was inclined to view public questions in a tone very different to that in which he had surveyed them a few weeks back when on the hustings of his borough Revolving these things he emerged as we have stated into the plain of the Mowe and guiding his path by the course of the river he arrived at the bridge which a fancy tempted him to cross In its centre was a man gazing on the waters below and leaning over the parapet His footstep roused the loiterer who looked round and Egremont saw that it was Walter Gerard Gerard returned his salute and said Early hours on Saturday afternoon make us all saunterers and then as their way was the same they walked on together It seemed that Gerard s cottage was near at hand and having inquired after Egremont s sport and receiving for a reply a present of a brace of trout the only one by the bye that was in Egremont s basket he could scarcely do less than invite his companion to rest himself There is my home said Gerard pointing to a cottage recently built and in a pleasing style Its materials were of a fawn coloured stone common in the Mowbray quarries A scarlet creeper clustered round one side of its ample porch its windows were large mullioned and neatly latticed it stood in the midst of a garden of no mean dimensions but every bed and nook of which teemed with cultivation flowers and vegetables both abounded while an orchard rich with promise of many fruits ripe pears and famous pippins of the north and plums of every shape and hue screened the dwelling from that wind against which the woods that formed its back ground were no protection And you are well lodged Your garden does you honour I ll be honest enough to own I have no claim to the credit said Gerard I am but a lazy chiel They entered the cottage where a hale old woman greeted them She is too old to be my wife and too young to be my mother said Gerard smiling but she is a good creature and has looked after me many a long day Come dame he said thou lieutenant bring us a cup of tea tis a good evening beverage he added turning to Egremont and what I ever take at this time And if you care to light a pipe you will find a companion I have renounced tobacco said Egremont tobacco is the tomb of love and they entered a neatly furnished chamber that had that habitable look which the best room of a farmhouse too often wants Instead of the cast off furniture of other establishments at the same time dingy and tawdry mock rosewood chairs and tarnished mahogany tables there was an oaken table some cottage chairs made of beech wood and a Dutch clock But what surprised Egremont was the appearance of several shelves well lined with volumes Their contents too on closer inspection were very remarkable They indicated a student of a high order Egremont read the titles of works which he only knew by fame but which treated of the loftiest and most subtle questions of social and political philosophy As he was throwing his eye over them his companion said Ah I see you think me as great a scholar as I am a gardener but with as little justice these hooks are not mine To whomsoever they belong said Egremont if we are to judge from his collection he has a tolerably strong head Ay ay said Gerard the world will hear of him yet though he was only a workman and the son of a workman He has not been at your schools and your colleges but he can write his mother tongue as Shakespeare and Cobbett wrote it and you must do that if you wish to influence the people And might I ask his name said Egremont Stephen Morley my friend The person I saw with you at Marney Abbey The same And he lives with you Why we kept house together if you could call it so Stephen does not give much trouble in that way He only drinks water and only eats herbs and fruits He is the gardener added Gerard smiling I don t know how we shall fare when he leaves me And is he going to leave you Why in a manner he has gone He has taken a cottage about a quarter of a mile up the dale and only left his books here because he is going into shire in a day or two on some business that may be will take him a week or so The books are safer here you see for the present for Stephen lives alone and is a good deal away for he edits a paper at Mowbray and that must be looked after He is to be my gardener still I promised him that Well done dame said Gerard as the old woman entered I hope for the honour of the house a good brew Now comrade sit down it will do you good after your long stroll You should eat your own trout if you would wait By no means You will miss your friend I should think We shall see a good deal of him I doubt not what with the garden and neighbourhood and so on besides in a manner he is master of his own time His work is not like ours and though the pull on the brain is sometimes great I have often wished I had a talent that way It s a drear life to do the same thing every day at the same hour But I never could express my ideas except with my tongue and there I feel tolerably at home It will be a pity to see this room without these books said Egremont encouraging conversation on domestic subjects So it will said Gerard I have got very few of my own But my daughter will be able to fill the shelves in time I warrant Your daughter she is coming to live with you Yes that is the reason why Stephen quits us He only remained here until Sybil could keep my house and that happy day is at hand That is a great compensation for the loss of your friend said Egremont And yet she talks of flitting said Gerard in a rather melancholy tone She hankers after the cloister She has passed a still sweet life in the convent here the Superior is the sister of my employer and a very saint on earth and Sybil knows nothing of the real world except its sufferings No matter he added more cheerfully I would not have her take the veil rashly but if I lose her it may be for the best For the married life of a woman of our class in the present condition of our country is a lease of woe he added shaking his head slaves and the slaves of slaves Even woman s spirit cannot stand against it and it can bear against more than we can master Your daughter is not made for the common cares of life said Egremont We ll not talk of them said Gerard Sybil has an English heart and that s not easily broken And you comrade you are a traveller in these parts eh A kind of traveller something in the way of your friend Morley connected with the press Indeed a reporter eh I thought you had something about you a little more knowing than we provincials Yes a reporter they want information in London as to the real state of the country and this time of the year Parliament not sitting Ah I understand a flying commission and a summer tour Well I often wish I were a penman but I never could do it I ll read any day as long as you like but that writing I could never manage My friend Morley is a powerful hand at it His journal circulates a good deal about here and if as I often tell him he would only sink his high flying philosophy and stick to old English politics he might make a property of it You ll like to know him Much And what first took you to the press if I may ask Why my father was a gentleman said Egremont in a hesitating tone and I was a younger son Ah said Gerard that is as bad as being a woman I had no patrimony continued Egremont and I was obliged to work I had no head I believe for the law the church was not exactly in my way and as for the army how was I to advance without money or connexions I had had some education and so I thought I would turn it to account Wisely done you are one of the working classes and will enlist I hope in the great struggle against the drones The natural friends of the people are younger sons though they are generally enlisted against us The more fools they to devote their energies to the maintenance of a system which is founded on selfishness and which leads to fraud and of which they are the first victims But every man thinks he will be an exception And yet said Egremont a great family rooted in the land has been deemed to be an element of political strength I ll tell you what said Gerard there is a great family in this country and rooted in it of which we have heard much less than they deserved but of which I suspect we shall hear very soon enough to make us all think a bit In this county Ay in this county and every other one I mean the PEOPLE Ah said Egremont that family has existed for a long time But it has taken to increase rapidly of late my friend how may I call you They call me Franklin A good English name of a good English class that has disappeared Well mister Franklin be sure of this that the Population Returns of this country are very instructive reading I can conceive so I became a man when the bad times were beginning said Gerard I have passed through many doleful years I was a Franklin s son myself and we had lived on this island at least no worse for a longer time than I care to recollect as little as what I am now But that s nothing I am not thinking of myself I am prosperous in a fashion it is the serfs I live among of whom I am thinking Well I have heard in the course of years of some specifics for this constant degradation of the people some thing or some person that was to put all right and for my part I was not unready to support any proposal or follow any leader There was reform and there was paper money and no machinery and a thousand other remedies and there were demagogues of all kinds some as had as myself and some with blood in their veins almost as costly as flows in those of our great neighbour here Earl de Mowbray and I have always heard that was very choice but I will frankly own to you I never had much faith in any of these proposals or proposers but they were a change and that is something But I have been persuaded of late that there is something going on in this country of more efficacy a remedial power as I believe and irresistible but whether remedial or not at any rate a power that will mar all or cure all You apprehend me I speak of the annual arrival of more than three hundred thousand strangers in this island How will you feed them How will you clothe them How will you house them They have given up butcher s meat must they give up bread And as for raiment and shelter the rags of the kingdom are exhausted and your sinks and cellars already swarm like rabbit warrens Tis an awful consideration said Egremont musing Awful said Gerard tis the most solemn thing since the deluge What kingdom can stand against it Why go to your history you re a scholar and see the fall of the great Roman empire what was that Every now and then there came two or three hundred thousand strangers out of the forests and crossed the mountains and rivers They come to us every year and in greater numbers What are your invasions of the barbarous nations your Goths and Visigoths your Lombards and Huns to our Population Returns END OF THE SECOND BOOK BOOK III Book three Chapter one The last rays of the sun contending with clouds of smoke that drifted across the country partially illumined a peculiar landscape Far as the eye could reach and the region was level except where a range of limestone hills formed its distant limit a wilderness of cottages or tenements that were hardly entitled to a higher name were scattered for many miles over the land some detached some connected in little rows some clustering in groups yet rarely forming continuous streets but interspersed with blazing furnaces heaps of burning coal and piles of smouldering ironstone while forges and engine chimneys roared and puffed in all directions and indicated the frequent presence of the mouth of the mine and the bank of the coal pit Notwithstanding the whole country might be compared to a vast rabbit warren it was nevertheless intersected with canals crossing each other at various levels and though the subterranean operations were prosecuted with so much avidity that it was not uncommon to observe whole rows of houses awry from the shifting and hollow nature of the land still intermingled with heaps of mineral refuse or of metallic dross patches of the surface might here and there be recognised covered as if in mockery with grass and corn looking very much like those gentlemen s sons that we used to read of in our youth stolen by the chimneysweeps and giving some intimations of their breeding beneath their grimy livery But a tree or a shrub such an existence was unknown in this dingy rather than dreary region It was the twilight hour the hour at which in southern climes the peasant kneels before the sunset image of the blessed Hebrew maiden when caravans halt in their long course over vast deserts and the turbaned traveller bending in the sand pays his homage to the sacred stone and the sacred city the hour not less holy that announces the cessation of English toil and sends forth the miner and the collier to breathe the air of earth and gaze on the light of heaven They come forth the mine delivers its gang and the pit its bondsmen the forge is silent and the engine is still The plain is covered with the swarming multitude bands of stalwart men broad chested and muscular wet with toil and black as the children of the tropics troops of youth alas of both sexes though neither their raiment nor their language indicates the difference all are clad in male attire and oaths that men might shudder at issue from lips born to breathe words of sweetness Yet these are to be some are the mothers of England But can we wonder at the hideous coarseness of their language when we remember the savage rudeness of their lives Naked to the waist an iron chain fastened to a belt of leather runs between their legs clad in canvas trousers while on hands and feet an English girl for twelve sometimes for sixteen hours a day hauls and hurries tubs of coals up subterranean roads dark precipitous and plashy circumstances that seem to have escaped the notice of the Society for the Abolition of Negro Slavery Those worthy gentlemen too appear to have been singularly unconscious of the sufferings of the little Trappers which was remarkable as many of them were in their own employ See too these emerge from the bowels of the earth Infants of four and five years of age many of them girls pretty and still soft and timid entrusted with the fulfilment of most responsible duties and the nature of which entails on them the necessity of being the earliest to enter the mine and the latest to leave it Their labour indeed is not severe for that would be impossible but it is passed in darkness and in solitude They endure that punishment which philosophical philanthropy has invented for the direst criminals and which those criminals deem more terrible than the death for which it is substituted Hour after hour elapses and all that reminds the infant Trappers of the world they have quitted and that which they have joined is the passage of the coal waggons for which they open the air doors of the galleries and on keeping which doors constantly closed except at this moment of passage the safety of the mine and the lives of the persons employed in it entirely depend Sir Joshua a man of genius and a courtly artist struck by the seraphic countenance of Lady Alice Gordon when a child of very tender years painted the celestial visage in various attitudes on the same canvass and styled the group of heavenly faces guardian angels We would say to some great master of the pencil mister Landseer or mister Etty go thou to the little trappers and do likewise A small party of miners approached a house of more pretension than the generality of the dwellings and announcing its character by a very flagrant sign of the Rising Sun They entered it as men accustomed and were greeted with smiles and many civil words from the lady at the bar who inquired very cheerfully what the gentlemen would have They soon found themselves seated in the tap and though it was not entirely unoccupied in their accustomed places for there seemed a general understanding that they enjoyed a prescriptive right With hunches of white bread in their black hands and grinning with their sable countenances and ivory teeth they really looked like a gang of negroes at a revel The cups of ale circulated the pipes were lighted the preliminary puffs achieved There was at length silence when he who seemed their leader and who filled a sort of president s seat took his pipe from his mouth and then uttering the first complete sentence that had yet been expressed aloud thus delivered himself The fact is we are tommied to death You never spoke a truer word Master Nixon said one of his companions It s gospel every word of it said another And the point is continued Master Nixon what are we for to do Ay surely said a collier that s the marrow Ay ay agreed several there it is The question is said Nixon looking round with a magisterial air what is wages I say tayn t sugar tayn t tea tayn t bacon I don t think it s candles but of this I be sure tayn t waistcoats Here there was a general groan Comrades continued Nixon you know what has happened you know as how Juggins applied for his balance after his tommy book was paid up and that incarnate nigger Diggs has made him take two waistcoats Now the question rises what is a collier to do with waistcoats Pawn em I s pose to Diggs son in law next door to his father s shop and sell the ticket for sixpence Now there s the question keep to the question the question is waistcoats and tommy first waistcoats and then tommy I have been making a pound a week these two months past said another but as I m a sinner saved I have never seen the young queen s picture yet And I have been obliged to pay the doctor for my poor wife in tommy said another Doctor I said says I I blush to do it but all I have got is tommy and what shall it be bacon or cheese Cheese at tenpence a pound says he which I buy for my servants at sixpence Never mind says he for he is a thorough Christian I ll take the tommy as I find it Juggins has got his rent to pay and is afeard of the bums said Nixon and he has got two waistcoats Besides said another Diggs tommy is only open once a week and if you re not there in time you go over for another seven days And it s such a distance and he keeps a body there such a time it s always a day s work for my poor woman she can t do nothing after it what with the waiting and the standing and the cussing of Master Joseph Diggs for he do swear at the women when they rush in for the first turn most fearful They do say he s a shocking little dog Master Joseph is wery wiolent but there is no one like old Diggs for grabbing a bit of one s wages He do so love it And then he says you never need be at no loss for nothing you can find everything under my roof I should like to know who is to mend our shoes Has Gaffer Diggs a cobbler s stall Or sell us a penn orth of potatoes said another Or a ha porth of milk No and so to get them one is obliged to go and sell some tommy and much one gets for it Bacon at ninepence a pound at Diggs which you may get at a huckster s for sixpence and therefore the huckster can t be expected to give you more than fourpence halfpenny by which token the tommy in our field just cuts our wages atween the navel And that s as true as if you heard it in church Master Waghorn This Diggs seems to be an oppressor of the people said a voice from a distant corner of the room Master Nixon looked around smoked puffed and then said I should think he wor as bloody a hearted butty as ever jingled But what business has a butty to keep a shop inquired the stranger The law touches him I should like to know who would touch the law said Nixon not I for one Them tommy shops is very delicate things they won t stand no handling I can tell you that But he cannot force you to take goods said the stranger he must pay you in current coin of the realm if you demand it They only pay us once in five weeks said a collier and how is a man to live meanwhile And suppose we were to make shift for a month or five weeks and have all our money coming and have no tommy out of the shop what would the butty say to me He would say do you want e er a note this time and if I was to say no then he would say you ve no call to go down to work any more here And that s what I call forsation Ay ay said another collier ask for the young queen s picture and you would soon have to put your shirt on and go up the shaft It s them long reckonings that force us to the tommy shops said another collier and if a butty turns you away because you won t take no tommy you re a marked man in every field about A Butty in the mining districts is a middleman a Doggy is his manager The Butty generally keeps a Tommy or Truck shop and pays the wages of his labourers in goods When miners and colliers strike they term it going to play There s wus things as tommy said a collier who had hitherto been silent and that s these here butties What s going on in the pit is known only to God Almighty and the colliers I have been a consistent methodist for many years strived to do well and all the harm I have ever done to the butties was to tell them that their deeds would not stand on the day of judgment They are deeds of darkness surely for many s the morn we work for nothing by one excuse or another and many s the good stint that they undermeasure And many s the cup of their ale that you must drink before they will give you any work If the queen would do something for us poor men it would be a blessed job There ayn t no black tyrant on this earth like a butty surely said a collier and there s no redress for poor men But why do not you state your grievances to the landlords and lessees said the stranger I take it you be a stranger in these parts sir said Master Nixon following up this remark by a most enormous puff He was the oracle of his circle and there was silence whenever he was inclined to address them which was not too often though when he spoke his words as his followers often observed were a regular ten yard coal I take it you be a stranger in these parts sir or else you would know that it s as easy for a miner to speak to a mainmaster as it is for me to pick coal with this here clay Sir there s a gulf atween em I went into the pit when I was five year old and I count forty year in the service come Martinmas and a very good age sir for a man what does his work and I knows what I m speaking about In forty year sir a man sees a pretty deal specially when he don t move out of the same spot and keeps his tention I ve been at play sir several times in forty year and have seen as great stick outs as ever happened in this country I ve seen the people at play for weeks together and so clammed that I never tasted nothing but a potatoe and a little salt for more than a fortnight Talk of tommy that was hard fare but we were holding out for our rights and that s sauce for any gander And I ll tell you what sir that I never knew the people play yet but if a word had passed atween them and the main masters aforehand it might not have been settled but you can t get at them any way Atween the poor man and the gentleman there never was no connection and that s the wital mischief of this country It s a very true word Master Nixon and by this token that when we went to play in twenty eight and the masters said they would meet us what did they do but walk about the ground and speak to the butties The butties has their ear We never want no soldiers here if the masters would speak with the men but the sight of a pitman is pison to a gentleman and if we go up to speak with em they always run away It s the butties said Nixon they re wusser nor tommy The people will never have their rights said the stranger until they learn their power Suppose instead of sticking out and playing fifty of your families were to live under one roof You would live better than you live now you would feed more fully and he lodged and clothed more comfortably and you might save half the amount of your wages you would become capitalists you might yourselves hire your mines and pits from the owners and pay them a better rent than they now obtain and yet yourselves gain more and work less Sir said mister Nixon taking his pipe from his mouth and sending forth a volume of smoke you speak like a book It is the principle of association said the stranger the want of the age Sir said mister Nixon this here age wants a great deal but what it principally wants is to have its wages paid in the current coin of the realm Soon after this there were symptoms of empty mugs and exhausted pipes and the party began to stir The stranger addressing Nixon enquired of him what was their present distance from Wodgate Wodgate exclaimed mister Nixon with an unconscious air The gentleman means Hell house Yard said one of his companions I m at home said mister Nixon but tis the first time I ever heard Hell house Yard called Wodgate It s called so in joggraphy said Juggins But you hay nt going to Hell house Yard this time of night said mister Nixon I d as soon think of going down the pit with the windlass turned by lushy Bob Tayn t a journey for Christians said Juggins They re a very queer lot even in sunshine said another And how far is it asked the stranger I walked there once in three hours said a collier but that was to the wake If you want to see divils carnal there s your time of day They re no less than heathens I be sure I d be sorry to see even our butty among them for he is a sort of a Christian when he has taken a glass of ale Book three Chapter two Two days after the visit of Egremont to the cottage of Walter Gerard the visit of the Marney family to Mowbray terminated and they returned to the Abbey There is something mournful in the breaking up of an agreeable party and few are the roofs in which one has sojourned which are quitted without some feeling of depression The sudden cessation of all those sources of excitement which pervade a gay and well arranged mansion in the country unstrings the nervous system For a week or so we have done nothing which was not agreeable and heard nothing which was not pleasant Our self love has been respected there has been a total cessation of petty cares all the enjoyment of an establisnment without any of its solicitude We have beheld civilization only in its favoured aspect and tasted only the sunny side of the fruit Sometimes there are associations with our visit of a still sweeter and softer character but on these we need not dwell glances that cannot be forgotten and tones that linger in the ear sentiment that subdues the soul and flirtation that agitates the fancy No matter whatever may be the cause one too often drives away from a country house rather hipped The specific would be immediately to drive to another and it is a favourite remedy But sometimes it is not in our power sometimes for instance we must return to our household gods in the shape of a nursery and though this was not the form assumed by the penates of Lord Marney his presence the presence of an individual so important and so indefatigable was still required His Lordship had passed his time at Mowbray to his satisfaction He had had his own way in everything His selfishness had not received a single shock He had lain down the law and it had not been questioned He had dogmatised and impugned and his assertions had passed current and his doctrines been accepted as orthodox Lord Mowbray suited him he liked the consideration of so great a personage Lord Marney also really liked pomp a curious table and a luxurious life but he liked them under any roof rather than his own Not that he was what is commonly called a Screw that is to say he was not a mere screw but he was acute and malicious saw everybody s worth and position at a glance could not bear to expend his choice wines and costly viands on hangers on and toad eaters though at the same time no man encouraged and required hangers on and toad eaters more Lord Marney had all the petty social vices and none of those petty social weaknesses which soften their harshness or their hideousness To receive a prince of the blood or a great peer he would spare nothing Had he to fulfil any of the public duties of his station his performance would baffle criticism But he enjoyed making the Vicar of Marney or Captain Grouse drink some claret that was on the wane or praise a bottle of Burgundy that he knew was pricked Little things affect little minds Lord Marney rose in no very good humour he was kept at the station which aggravated his spleen During his journey on the railroad he spoke little and though he more than once laboured to get up a controversy he was unable for Lady Marney who rather dreaded her dull home and was not yet in a tone of mind that could hail the presence of the little Poinsett as full compensation for the brilliant circle of Mowbray replied in amiable monosyllables and Egremont himself in austere ones for he was musing over Sybil Gerard and a thousand things as wild and sweet Everything went wrong this day Even Captain Grouse was not at the Abbey to welcome them back He was playing in a cricket match Marney against Marham Nothing else would have induced him to be absent So it happened that the three fellow travellers had to dine together utterly weary of themselves and of each other Captain Grouse was never more wanted he would have amused Lord Marney relieved his wife and brother reported all that had been said and done in their neighbourhood during their absence introduced a new tone and effected a happy diversion Leaving Mowbray detained at the station Grouse away some disagreeable letters or letters which an ill humoured man chooses to esteem disagreeable seemed to announce a climax Lord Marney ordered the dinner to be served in the small dining room which was contiguous to a saloon in which Lady Marney when they were alone generally passed the evening The dinner was silent and sombre happily it was also short Lord Marney tasted several dishes ate of none found fault with his own claret though the butler had given him a choice bottle praised Lord Mowbray s wondered where he got it all the wines at Mowbray were good then for the twentieth time wondered what could have induced Grouse to fix the cricket match the day he returned home though he chose to forget that he had never communicated to Grouse even the probable day on which he might be expected As for Egremont it must be admitted that he was scarcely in a more contented mood than his brother though he had not such insufficient cause for his dark humours In quitting Mowbray he had quitted something else than merely an agreeable circle enough had happened in that visit to stir up the deep recesses of his heart and to prompt him to investigate in an unusual spirit the cause and attributes of his position He had found a letter on his return to the Abbey not calculated to dispel these somewhat morbid feelings a letter from his agent urging the settlement of his election accounts the primary cause of his visit to his brother Lady Marney left the dining room the brothers were alone Lord Marney filled a bumper which he drank off rapidly pushed the bottle to his brother and then said again What a cursed bore it is that Grouse is not here Well I cannot say George that I particularly miss the presence of Captain Grouse said his brother Lord Marney looked at Egremont pugnaciously and then observed Grouse is a capital fellow one is never dull when Grouse is here Well for my part said Egremont I do not much admire that amusement which is dependent on the efforts of hangers on Grouse is no more a hanger on than any one else said Lord Marney rather fiercely Perhaps not said Egremont quietly I am no judge of such sort of people I should like to know what you are a judge of certainly not of making yourself agreeable to young ladies Arabella cannot he particularly charmed with the result of your visit to Mowbray as far as Lady Joan is concerned Arabella s most intimate friend by the bye If for no other reason you ought to have paid her more attention I cannot pay attention unless I am attracted said Egremont I have not the ever ready talent of your friend Captain Grouse I do not know what you mean by my friend Captain Grouse Captain Grouse is no more my friend than your friend One must have people about the house to do a thousand things which one cannot do oneself and which one cannot trust to servants and Grouse does all this capitally Exactly he is just what I said a capital hanger on if you like but still a hanger on Well and what then Suppose he is a hanger on may I not have hangers on as well as any other man Of course you may but I am not bound to regret their absence Who said you were But I will regret their absence if I choose And I regret the absence of Grouse regret it very much and if he did happen to be inextricably engaged in this unfortunate match I say and you may contradict me if you please that he ought to have taken care that Slimsey dined here to tell me all that had happened I am very glad he omitted to do so said Egremont I prefer Grouse to Slimsey I dare say you do said Lord Marney filling his glass and looking very black you would like I have no doubt to see a fine gentleman saint like your friend mister saint Lys at Marney preaching in cottages filling the people with discontent lecturing me about low wages soliciting plots of grounds for new churches and inveigling Arabella into subscriptions to painted windows I certainly should like to see a man like Aubrey saint Lys at Marney said Egremont quietly but rather doggedly And if he were here I would soon see who should be master said Lord Marney I would not succumb like Mowbray One might as well have a jesuit in the house at once I dare say saint Lys would care very little about entering your house said Egremont I know it was with great reluctance that he ever came to Mowbray Castle I dare say very great reluctance indeed And very reluctant he was I make no doubt to sit next to Lady Maud I wonder he does not fly higher and preach to Lady Joan but she is too sensible a woman for such fanatical tricks saint Lys thinks it his duty to enter all societies That is the reason why he goes to Mowbray Castle as well as to the squalid courts and cellars of the town He takes care that those who are clad in purple and fine linen shall know the state of their neighbours They cannot at least plead ignorance for the nonfulfilment of their duty Before saint Lys s time the family at Mowbray Castle might as well have not existed as far as benefiting their miserable vicinage It would be well perhaps for other districts not less wretched and for other families as high and favoured as the Mowbrays if there were a mister saint Lys on the spot instead of a mister Slimsey I suppose that is meant for a cut said Lord Marney but I wish the people were as well off in every part of the country as they are on my estate They get here their eight shillings a week always at least seven and every hand is at this moment in employ except a parcel of scoundrels who prefer woodstealing and poaching and who would prefer wood stealing and poaching if you gave them double the wages The rate of wages is nothing certainty is the thing and every man at Marney may be sure of his seven shillings a week for at least nine months in the year and for the other three they can go to the House and a very proper place for them it is heated with hot air and has every comfort Even Marney Abbey is not heated with hot air I have often thought of it it makes me mad sometimes to think of those lazy pampered menials passing their lives with their backs to a great roaring fire but I am afraid of the flues I wonder talking of fires that you are not more afraid of burning ricks said Egremont It s an infernal lie said Lord Marney very violently What is said Egremont That there is any incendiarism in this neighbourhood Why there was a fire the day after I came That had nothing to do with wages it was an accident I examined into it myself so did Grouse so did Slimsey I sent them about everywhere I told them I was sure the fire was purely accidental and to go and see about it and they came back and agreed that it was purely accidental I dare say they did said Egremont but no one has discovered the accident For my part I believe it was spontaneous combustion said Lord Marney That is a satisfactory solution said Egremont but for my part the fire being a fact and it being painfully notorious that the people of Marney Well sir the people of Marney said his lordship fiercely Are without question the most miserable population in the county Did mister saint Lys tell you that interrupted Lord Marney white with rage No not mister Lys but one better acquainted with the neighbourhood I ll know your informant s name said Lord Marney with energy My informant was a woman said Egremont Lady Maud I suppose second hand from mister saint Lys Mv informant was a woman and one of the people said Egremont Some poacher s drab I don t care what women say high or low they always exaggerate The misery of a family who live upon seven or even eight shillings a week can scarcely be exaggerated What should you know about it Did you ever live on seven or eight shillings a week What can you know about the people who pass your time at London clubs or in fine country houses I suppose you want the people to live as they do at a house dinner at Boodle s I say that a family can live very well on seven shillings a week and on eight shillings very well indeed The poor are very well off at least the agricultural poor very well off indeed Their incomes are certain that is a great point and they have no cares no anxieties they always have a resource they always have the House People without cares do not require as much food as those whose life entails anxieties See how long they live Compare the rate of mortality among them with that of the manufacturing districts Incendiarism indeed If there had been a proper rural police such a thing as incendiarism would never have been heard of There was a pause Lord Marney dashed off another bumper Egremont sipped his wine At length he said This argument made me forget the principal reason George why I am glad that we are alone together to day I am sorry to bore you but I am bored myself deucedly I find a letter from my agent These election accounts must be settled Why I thought they were settled How do you mean I thought my mother had given you a thousand pounds No doubt of that but that was long ago disposed of In my opinion quite enough for a seat in these times Instead of paying to get into Parliament a man ought to be paid for entering it There may be a good deal in what you say said Egremont but it is too late to take that view of the business The expense has been incurred and must be met I don t see that said Lord Marney we have paid one thousand pounds and there is a balance unsettled When was there ever a contest without a balance being unsettled I remember hearing my father often say that when he stood for this county our grandfather paid more than a hundred thousand pounds and yet I know to this day there are accounts unsettled Regularly every year I receive anonymous letters threatening me with fearful punishment if I don t pay one hundred and fifty pounds for a breakfast at the Jolly Tinkers You jest the matter indeed requires a serious vein I wish these accounts to be settled at once And I should like to know where the funds are to come from I have none The quantity of barns I am building now is something tremendous Then this rage for draining it would dry up any purse What think you of two million tiles this year And rents to keep up which we are making these awful sacrifices they are merely nominal or soon will be They never will be satisfied till they have touched the land That is clear to me I am prepared for a reduction of five and twenty per cent if the corn laws are touched it can t be less than that My mother ought to take it into consideration and reduce her jointure accordingly But I dare say she will not people are so selfish particularly as she has given you this thousand pounds which in fact after all comes out of my pocket All this you have said to me before What does it mean I fought this battle at the instigation of the family from no feeling of my own You are the head of the family and you were consulted on the step Unless I had concluded that it was with your sanction I certainly should not have made my appearance on the hustings I am very glad you did though said Lord Marney Parliament is a great point for our class in these days especially more even than in the old time I was truly rejoiced at your success and it mortified the whigs about us most confoundedly Some people thought there was only one family in the world to have their Richmond or their Malton Getting you in for the old borough was really a coup Well now to retain our interest said Egremont quick payment of our expenses is the most efficient way believe me You have got six years perhaps seven said Lord Marney and long before that I hope to find you the husband of Lady Joan Fitz Warene I do not wish to connect the two contingencies said Egremont firmly They are inseparable said Lord Marney What do you mean I mean that I think this pedantic acquittance of an electioneering account is in the highest degree ridiculous and that I cannot interfere in it The legal expenses are you say paid and if they were not I should feel myself bound as the head of the family to defray them but I can go no further I cannot bring myself to sanction an expenditure for certainly very unnecessary perhaps and I much fear it for illegal and very immoral purposes That really is your determination After the most mature reflection prompted by a sincere solicitude for your benefit Well George I have often suspected it but now I feel quite persuaded that you are really the greatest humbug that ever existed Abuse is not argument mister Egremont You are beneath abuse as you are beneath every sentiment but one which I most entirely feel and Egremont rose from the table You may thank your own obstinacy and conceit said Lord Marney I took you to Mowbray Castle and the cards were in your own hands if you chose to play them You have interfered with me once before on such a subject Lord Marney said Egremont with a kindling eye and a cheek pallid with rage You had better not say that again said Lord Marney in a tone of menace Why not asked Egremont fiercely Who and what are you to dare to address me thus I am your elder brother sir whose relationship to you is your only claim to the consideration of society A curse on the society that has fashioned such claims said Egremont in an heightened tone claims founded in selfishness cruelty and fraud and leading to demoralization misery and crime Claims which I will make you respect at least in this house sir said Lord Marney springing from his chair Touch me at your peril exclaimed Egremont or I will forget you are my mother s son and cleave you to the ground You have been the blight of my life you stole from me my bride and now you would rob me of my honour Liar and villain exclaimed Lord Marney darting forward but at this moment his wife rushed into the apartment and clung to him For heaven s sake she exclaimed What is all this George Charles dearest George Let me go Arabella Let him come on But Lady Marney gave a piercing shriek and held out her arms to keep the brothers apart A sound was heard at the other door there was nothing in the world that Lord Marney dreaded so much as that his servants should witness a domestic scene He sprang forward to the door to prevent any one entering partially opening it he said Lady Marney was unwell and desired her maid returning he found Arabella insensible on the ground and Egremont vanished Book three Chapter three It was a wet morning there had been a heavy rain since dawn which impelled by a gusty south wester came driving on a crowd of women and girls who were assembled before the door of a still unclosed shop Some protected themselves with umbrellas some sought shelter beneath a row of old elms that grew alongside the canal that fronted the house Notwithstanding the weather the clack of tongues was incessant I thought I saw the wicket of the yard gates open said a woman So did I said her neighbour but it was shut again immediately It was only Master Joseph said a third He likes to see us getting wet through If they would only let us into the yard and get under one of the workshop sheds as they do at Simmon s said another You may well say Simmon s missus Page I only wish my master served in his field I have been here since half past four missus Grigsby with this chilt at my breast all the time It s three miles for me here and the same back and unless I get the first turn how are my poor boys to find their dinner ready when they come out of the pit A very true word missus Page and by this token that last Thursday I was here by half past eleven certainly afore noon having only called at my mother in law s in the way and it was eight o clock before I got home Ah it s cruel work is the tommy shop How d ye do neighbour Prance said a comely dame with a large white basket And how s your good man They was saying at Belfy s he had changed his service I hear there s a new butty in mister Parker s field but the old doggy kept on so I always thought he was always a favourite and they do say measured the stints very fair And what do you hear bacon is in town They do tell me only sixpence and real home cured I wonder Diggs has the face to be selling still at nine pence and so very green I think I see Dame Toddles how wonderful she do wear What are you doing here little dear very young to fetch tommy keeping place for mother eh that s a good girl she d do well to be here soon for I think the strike s on eight Diggs is sticking it on yellow soap very terrible What do you think Ah the doors are going to open No a false alarm How fare you neighbour said a pale young woman carrying an infant to the comely dame Here s an awful crowd surely The women will be fighting and tearing to get in I guess I be much afeard Well first come first served all the world over said the comely dame And you must put a good heart on the business and tie your bonnet I dare guess there are not much less than two hundred here It s grand tommy day you know And for my part I don t care so much for a good squeedge one sees so many faces one knows The cheese here at sixpence is pretty tidy said a crone to her companion but you may get as good in town for fourpence What I complain is the weights replied her companion I weighed my pound of butter bought last tommy day and it was two penny pieces too light Indeed I have been in my time to all the shops about here for the lads or their father but never knew tommy so bad as this I have two children at home ill from their flour I have been very poorly myself one is used to a little white clay but when they lay it on thick it s very grave Are your girls in the pit No we strive to keep them out and my man has gone scores of days on bread and water for that purpose and if we were not forced to take so much tommy one might manage but tommy will beat anything Health first and honesty afterwards that s my say Well for my part said the crone meat s my grievance all the best bits go to the butties and the pieces with bone in are chopped off for the colliers wives Dame when will the door open asked a very little palefaced boy I have been here all this morn and never broke my fast And what do you want chilt I want a loaf for mother but I don t feel I shall ever get home again I m all in a way so dizzy Liza Gray said a woman with black beady eyes and a red nose speaking in a sharp voice and rushing up to a pretty slatternly woman in a straw bonnet with a dirty fine ribbon and a babe at her breast you know the person I m looking for Well missus Mullins and how do you do she replied in a sweet sawney tone How do you do indeed How are people to do in these bad times They is indeed hard missus Mullins If you could see my tommy book How I wish I knew figures Made up as of last Thursday night by that little divil Master Joe Diggs He has stuck it in here and stuck it in there till it makes one all of a maze I m sure I never had the things and my man is out of all patience and says I can no more keep house than a natural born My man is a wanting to see your man said missus Mullins with a flashing eye and you know what about And very natural too said Liza Gray but how are we to pay the money we owe him with such a tommy book as this good neighbour Mullins We re as poor as our neighbours missus Gray and if we are not paid we must borrow It s a scarlet shame to go to the spout because money lent to a friend is not to be found You had it in your need Liza Gray and we want it in our need and have it I will Liza Gray Hush hush said Liza Gray don t wake the little un for she is very fretful I will have the five shillings or I will have as good said missus Mullins Hush hush neighbour now I ll tell you you shall have it but yet a little time This is great tommy day and settles our reckoning for five weeks but my man may have a draw after to morrow and he shall draw five shillings and give you half And the other half said missus Mullins Ah the other half said Liza Gray with a sigh Well then we shall have a death in our family soon this poor babe can t struggle on much longer it belongs to two burial clubs that will be three pounds from each and after the drink and the funeral there will be enough to pay all our debts and put us all square The doors of mister Diggs tommy shop opened The rush was like the advance into the pit of a theatre when the drama existed pushing squeezing fighting tearing shrieking On a high seat guarded by rails from all contact sate mister Diggs senior with a bland smile on his sanctified countenance a pen behind his ear and recommending his constrained customers in honeyed tones to be patient and orderly Behind the substantial counter which was an impregnable fortification was his popular son Master Joseph a short ill favoured cur with a spirit of vulgar oppression and malicious mischief stamped on his visage His black greasy lank hair his pug nose his coarse red face and his projecting tusks contrasted with the mild and lengthened countenance of his father who looked very much like a wolf in sheep s clothing For the first five minutes Master Joseph Diggs did nothing but blaspheme and swear at his customers occasionally leaning over the counter and cuffing the women in the van or lugging some girl by the hair I was first Master Joseph said a woman eagerly No I was said another I was here said the first as the clock struck four and seated myself on the steps because I must be home early my husband is hurt in the knee If you were first you shall be helped last said Master Joseph to reward you for your pains and he began taking the orders of the other woman O Lord have mercy on me said the disappointed woman and I got up in the middle of the night for this More fool you And what you came for I am sure I don t know said Master Joseph for you have a pretty long figure against you I can tell you that I declare most solemnly said the woman Don t make a brawling here said Master Joseph or I ll jump over this here counter and knock you down like nothing What did you say woman are you deaf what did you say how much best tea do you want I don t want any sir You never want best tea you must take three ounces of best tea or you shan t have nothing If you say another word I ll put you down four You tall gal what s your name you keep back there or I ll fetch you such a cut as ll keep you at home till next reckoning Cuss you you old fool do you think I am to be kept all day while you are mumbling here Who s pushing on there I see you missus Page Won t there be a black mark against you Oh its missus Prance is it Father put down missus Prance for a peck of flour I ll have order here You think the last bacon a little too fat oh you do ma am do you I ll take care you shan t complain in futur I likes to please my customers There s a very nice flitch hanging up in the engine room the men wanted some rust for the machinery you shall have a slice of that and we ll say ten pence a pound high dried and wery lean will that satisfy you Order there order you cussed women order or I ll be among you And if I just do jump over this here counter won t I let fly right and left Speak out you ideot do you think I can hear your muttering in this Babel Cuss them I ll keep them quiet and so he took up a yard measure and leaning over the counter hit right and left Oh you little monster exclaimed a woman you have put out my babby s eye There was a murmur almost a groan Whose baby s hurt asked Master Joseph in a softened tone Mine sir said an indignant voice Mary Church Oh Mary Church is it said the malicious imp then I ll put Mary Church down for half a pound of best arrow root that s the finest thing in the world for babbies and will cure you of bringing your cussed monkeys here as if you all thought our shop was a hinfant school Where s your book Susan Travers Left at home Then you may go and fetch it No books no tommy You are Jones s wife are you Ticket for three and sixpence out of eighteen shillings wages Is this the only ticket you have brought There s your money and you may tell your husband he need not take his coat off again to go down our shaft He must think us cussed fools Tell him I hope he has got plenty of money to travel into Wales for he won t have no work in England again or my name ayn t Diggs Who s pushing there I ll be among you I ll close the shop If I do get hold of some of you cussed women you shan t forget it If anybody will tell me who is pushing there they shall have their bacon for seven pence Will nobody have bacon for seven pence Leagued together eh Then everybody shall have their bacon for ten pence Two can play at that Push again and I ll be among you said the infuriated little tyrant But the waving of the multitude impatient and annoyed by the weather was not to be stilled the movement could not be regulated the shop was in commotion and Master Joseph Diggs losing all patience jumped on the counter and amid the shrieks of the women sprang into the crowd Two women fainted others cried for their bonnets others bemoaned their aprons nothing however deterred Diggs who kicked and cuffed and cursed in every quarter and gave none At last there was a general scream of horror and a cry of a boy killed The senior Diggs who from his eminence had hitherto viewed the scene with unruffled complacency who in fact derived from these not unusual exhibitions the same agreeable excitement which a Roman emperor might have received from the combats of the circus began to think that affairs were growing serious and rose to counsel order and enforce amiable dispositions Even Master Joseph was quelled by that mild voice which would have become Augustus It appeared to be quite true that a boy was dead It was the little boy who sent to get a loaf for his mother had complained before the shop was opened of his fainting energies He had fallen in the fray and it was thought to use the phrase of the comely dame who tried to rescue him that he was quite smothered They carried him out of the shop the perspiration poured off him he had no pulse He had no friends there I ll stand by the body said the comely dame though I lose my turn At this moment Stephen Morley for the reader has doubtless discovered that the stranger who held colloquy with the colliers was the friend of Walter Gerard arrived at the tommy shop which was about half way between the house where he had passed the night and Wodgate He stopped inquired and being a man of science and some skill decided after examining the poor boy that life was not extinct Taking the elder Diggs aside he said I am the editor of the Mowbray Phalanx I will not speak to you before these people but I tell you fairly you and your son have been represented to me as oppressors of the people Will it be my lot to report this death and comment on it I trust not There is yet time and hope What is to be done sir inquired the alarmed mister Diggs a fellow creature in this condition Don t talk but act said Morley There is no time to be lost The boy must be taken up stairs and put to bed a warm bed in one of your best rooms with every comfort I am pressed for business but I will wait and watch over him till the crisis is passed Come let you and I take him in our arms and carry him up stairs through your private door Every minute is precious And so saying Morley and the elder Diggs entered the house Book three Chapter four Wodgate or Wogate as it was called on the map was a district that in old days had been consecrated to Woden and which appeared destined through successive ages to retain its heathen character At the beginning of the revolutionary war Wodgate was a sort of squatting district of the great mining region to which it was contiguous a place where adventurers in the industry which was rapidly developing settled themselves for though the great veins of coal and ironstone cropped up as they phrase it before they reached this bare and barren land and it was thus deficient in those mineral and metallic treasures which had enriched its neighbourhood Wodgate had advantages of its own and of a kind which touch the fancy of the lawless It was land without an owner no one claimed any manorial right over it they could build cottages without paying rent It was a district recognized by no parish so there were no tithes and no meddlesome supervision It abounded in fuel which cost nothing for though the veins were not worth working as a source of mining profit the soil of Wodgate was similar in its superficial character to that of the country around So a population gathered and rapidly increased in the ugliest spot in England to which neither Nature nor art had contributed a single charm where a tree could not be seen a flower was unknown where there was neither belfry nor steeple nor a single sight or sound that could soften the heart or humanise the mind Whatever may have been the cause whether as not unlikely the original squatters brought with them some traditionary skill or whether their isolated and unchequered existence concentrated their energies on their craft the fact is certain that the inhabitants of Wodgate early acquired a celebrity as skilful workmen This reputation so much increased and in time spread so far that for more than a quarter of a century both in their skill and the economy of their labour they have been unmatched throughout the country As manufacturers of ironmongery they carry the palm from the whole district as founders of brass and workers of steel they fear none while as nailers and locksmiths their fame has spread even to the European markets whither their most skilful workmen have frequently been invited Invited in vain No wages can tempt the Wodgate man from his native home that squatters seat which soon assumed the form of a large village and then in turn soon expanded into a town and at the present moment numbers its population by swarming thousands lodged in the most miserable tenements in the most hideous burgh in the ugliest country in the world But it has its enduring spell Notwithstanding the spread of its civic prosperity it has lost none of the characteristics of its original society on the contrary it has zealously preserved them There are no landlords head lessees main masters or butties in Wodgate No church there has yet raised its spire and as if the jealous spirit of Woden still haunted his ancient temple even the conventicle scarcely dares show its humble front in some obscure corner There is no municipality no magistrate no local acts no vestries no schools of any kind The streets are never cleaned every man lights his own house nor does any one know anything except his business More than this at Wodgate a factory or large establishment of any kind is unknown Here Labour reigns supreme Its division indeed is favoured by their manners but the interference or influence of mere capital is instantly resisted The business of Wodgate is carried on by master workmen in their own houses each of whom possesses an unlimited number of what they call apprentices by whom their affairs are principally conducted and whom they treat as the Mamlouks treated the Egyptians These master workmen indeed form a powerful aristocracy nor is it possible to conceive one apparently more oppressive They are ruthless tyrants they habitually inflict upon their subjects punishments more grievous than the slave population of our colonies were ever visited with not content with beating them with sticks or flogging them with knotted ropes they are in the habit of felling them with hammers or cutting their heads open with a file or lock The most usual punishment however or rather stimulus to increase exertion is to pull an apprentice s ears till they run with blood These youths too are worked for sixteen and even twenty hours a day they are often sold by one master to another they are fed on carrion and they sleep in lofts or cellars yet whether it be that they are hardened by brutality and really unconscious of their degradation and unusual sufferings or whether they are supported by the belief that their day to be masters and oppressors will surely arrive the aristocracy of Wodgate is by no means so unpopular as the aristocracy of most other places In the first place it is a real aristocracy it is privileged but it does something for its privileges It is distinguished from the main body not merely by name It is the most knowing class at Wodgate it possesses indeed in its way complete knowledge and it imparts in its manner a certain quantity of it to those whom it guides Thus it is an aristocracy that leads and therefore a fact Moreover the social system of Wodgate is not an unvarying course of infinite toil Their plan is to work hard but not always They seldom exceed four days of labour in the week On Sunday the masters begin to drink for the apprentices there is dog fighting without any stint On Monday and Tuesday the whole population of Wodgate is drunk of all stations ages and sexes even babes who should be at the breast for they are drammed with Godfrey s cordial Here is relaxation excitement if less vice otherwise than might be at first anticipated we must remember that excesses are checked by poverty of blood and constant exhaustion Scanty food and hard labour are in their way if not exactly moralists a tolerably good police There are no others at Wodgate to preach or to control It is not that the people are immoral for immorality implies some forethought or ignorant for ignorance is relative but they are animals unconscious their minds a blank and their worst actions only the impulse of a gross or savage instinct There are many in this town who are ignorant of their very names very few who can spell them It is rare that you meet with a young person who knows his own age rarer to find the boy who has seen a book or the girl who has seen a flower Ask them the name of their sovereign and they will give you an unmeaning stare ask them the name of their religion and they will laugh who rules them on earth or who can save them in heaven are alike mysteries to them Such was the population with whom Morley was about to mingle Wodgate had the appearance of a vast squalid suburb As you advanced leaving behind you long lines of little dingy tenements with infants lying about the road you expected every moment to emerge into some streets and encounter buildings bearing some correspondence in their size and comfort to the considerable population swarming and busied around you Nothing of the kind There were no public buildings of any sort no churches chapels town hall institute theatre and the principal streets in the heart of the town in which were situate the coarse and grimy shops though formed by houses of a greater elevation than the preceding were equally narrow and if possible more dirty At every fourth or fifth house alleys seldom above a yard wide and streaming with filth opened out of the street These were crowded with dwellings of various size while from the principal court often branched out a number of smaller alleys or rather narrow passages than which nothing can be conceived more close and squalid and obscure Here during the days of business the sound of the hammer and the file never ceased amid gutters of abomination and piles of foulness and stagnant pools of filth reservoirs of leprosy and plague whose exhalations were sufficient to taint the atmosphere of the whole kingdom and fill the country with fever and pestilence A lank and haggard youth ricketty and smoke dried and black with his craft was sitting on the threshold of a miserable hovel and working at the file Behind him stood a stunted and meagre girl with a back like a grasshopper a deformity occasioned by the displacement of the bladebone and prevalent among the girls of Wodgate from the cramping posture of their usual toil Her long melancholy visage and vacant stare at Morley as he passed attracted his notice and it occurring to him that the opportunity was convenient to enquire something of the individual of whom he was in search he stopped and addressed the workman Do you happen to know friend a person here or hereabouts by name Hatton Hatton said the youth looking up with a grin yet still continuing his labour I should think I did Well that s fortunate you can tell me something about him Do you see this here said the youth still grinning and letting the file drop from his distorted and knotty hand he pointed to a deep scar that crossed his forehead he did that An accident Very like An accident that often happened I should like to have a crown for every time he has cut my head open He cut it open once with a key and twice with a lock he knocked the corner of a lock into my head twice once with a bolt and once with a shut you know what that is the thing what runs into the staple He hit me on the head with a hammer once That was a blow I fell away that time When I came to master had stopped the blood with some fur off his hat I had to go on with my work immediately master said I should do my stint if I worked till twelve o clock at night Many s the ash stick he has broken on my body sometimes the weals remained on me for a week he cut my eyelid open once with a nutstick cut a regular hole in it and it bled all over the files I was working at He has pulled my ears sometimes that I thought they must come off in his hand But all this was a mere nothin to this here cut that was serous and if I hadn t got thro that they do say there must have been a crowner s quest though I think that gammon tor old Tugsford did for one of his prentices and the body was never found And now you ask me if I know Hatton I should think I did And the lank haggard youth laughed merrily as if he had been recounting a series of the happiest adventures But is there no redress for such iniquitous oppression said Morley who had listened with astonishment to this complacent statement Is there no magistrate to apply to No no said the filer with an air of obvious pride we don t have no magistrates at Wodgate We ve got a constable and there was a prentice who coz his master laid it on only with a seat rod went over to Ramborough and got a warrant He fetched the summons himself and giv it to the constable but he never served it That s why they has a constable here I am sorry said Morley that I have affairs with such a wretch as this Hatton You ll find him a wery hearty sort of man said the filer if he don t hap to be in drink He s a little robustious then but take him all in all for a master you may go further and fare worse What this monster Lord bless you it s his way that s all we be a queer set here but he has his pints Give him a lock to make and you won t have your box picked he s wery lib ral too in the wittals Never had horse flesh the whole time I was with him they has nothin else at Tugsford s never had no sick cow except when meat was very dear He always put his face agin still born calves he used to say he liked his boys to have meat what was born alive and killed alive By which token there never was any sheep what had bust in the head sold in our court And then sometimes he would give us a treat of fish when it had been four or five days in town and not sold No give the devil his due say I There never was no want for anything at meals with the Bishop except time to eat them in And why do you call him the Bishop That s his name and authority for he s the governor here over all of us And it has always been so that Wodgate has been governed by a bishop because as we have no church we will have as good And by this token that this day sen night the day my time was up he married me to this here young lady She is of the Baptist school religion and wanted us to be tied by her clergyman but all the lads that served their time with me were married by the Bishop and many a more and I saw no call to do no otherwise So he sprinkled some salt over a gridiron read Our Father backwards and wrote our name in a book and we were spliced but I didn t do it rashly did I Suky by the token that we had kept company for two years and there isn t a gal in all Wodgate what handles a file like Sue And what is your name my good fellow They call me Tummas but I ayn t got no second name but now I am married I mean to take my wife s for she has been baptised and so has got two Yes sir said the girl with the vacant face and the back like a grasshopper I be a reg lar born Christian and my mother afore me and that s what few gals in the Yard can say Thomas will take to it himself when work is slack and he believes now in our Lord and Saviour Pontius Pilate who was crucified to save our sins and in Moses Goliath and the rest of the Apostles Ah me thought Morley and could not they spare one Missionary from Tahiti for their fellow countrymen at Wodgate Book three Chapter five The summer twilight had faded into sweet night the young and star attended moon glittered like a sickle in the deep purple sky of all the luminous host Hesperus alone was visible and a breeze that bore the last embrace of the flowers by the sun moved languidly and fitfully over the still and odorous earth The moonbeam fell upon the roof and garden of Gerard It suffused the cottage with its brilliant light except where the dark depth of the embowered porch defied its entry All around the beds of flowers and herbs spread sparkling and defined You could trace the minutest walk almost distinguish every leaf Now and then there came a breath and the sweet peas murmured in their sleep or the roses rustled as if they were afraid they were about to be roused from their lightsome dreams Farther on the fruit trees caught the splendour of the night and looked like a troop of sultanas taking their gardened air when the eye of man could not profane them and laden with jewels There were apples that rivalled rubies pears of topaz tint a whole paraphernalia of plums some purple as the amethyst others blue and brilliant as the sapphire an emerald here and now a golden drop that gleamed like the yellow diamond of Gengis Khan Within was the scene less fair A single lamp shed over the chamber a soft and sufficient light The library of Stephen Morley had been removed but the place of his volumes had been partly supplied for the shelves were far from being empty Their contents were of no ordinary character many volumes of devotion some of church history one or two on ecclesiastical art several works of our elder dramatists some good reprints of our chronicles and many folios of church music which last indeed amounted to a remarkable collection There was no musical instrument however in the room of any kind and the only change in its furniture since we last visited the room of Gerard was the presence of a long backed chair of antique form most beautifully embroidered and a portrait of a female saint over the mantel piece As for Gerard himself he sat with his head leaning on his arm which rested on the table while he listened with great interest to a book which was read to him by his daughter at whose feet lay the fiery and faithful bloodhound So you see my father said Sybil with animation and dropping her book which however her hand did not relinquish even then all was not lost The stout earl retired beyond the Trent and years and reigns elapsed before this part of the island accepted their laws and customs I see said her father and yet I cannot help wishing that Harold Here the hound hearing his name suddenly rose and looked at Gerard who smiling patted him and said We were not talking of thee good sir but of thy great namesake but ne er mind a live dog they say is worth a dead king Ah why have we not such a man now said Sybil to protect the people Were I a prince I know no career that I should deem so great But Stephen says no said Gerard he says that these great men have never made use of us but as tools and that the people never can have their rights until they produce competent champions from their own order But then Stephen does not want to recall the past said Sybil with a kind of sigh he wishes to create the future The past is a dream said Gerard And what is the future enquired Sybil Alack I know not but I often wish the battle of Hastings were to be fought over again and I was going to have a hand in it Ah my father said Sybil with a mournful smile there is ever your fatal specific of physical force Even Stephen is against physical force with all his odd fancies All very true said Gerard smiling with good nature but all the same when I was coming home a few days ago and stopped awhile on the bridge and chanced to see myself in the stream I could not help fancying that my Maker had fashioned these limbs rather to hold a lance or draw a bow than to supervise a shuttle or a spindle Yet with the shuttle and the spindle we may redeem our race said Sybil with animation if we could only form the minds that move those peaceful weapons Oh my father I will believe that moral power is irresistible or where are we to look for hope Gerard shook his head with his habitual sweet good tempered smile Ah said he what can we do they have got the land and the land governs the people The Norman knew that Sybil as you just read If indeed we had our rights one might do something but I don t know I dare say if I had our land again I should be as bad as the rest Oh no my father exclaimed Sybil with energy never never Your thoughts would be as princely as your lot What a leader of the people you would make Harold sprang up suddenly and growled Hush said Gerard some one knocks and he rose and left the room Sybil heard voices and broken sentences You ll excuse me I take it kindly So we are neighbours And then her father returned ushering in a person and saying Here is my friend mister Franklin that I was speaking of Sybil who is going to be our neighbour down Harold down and he presented to his daughter the companion of mister saint Lys in that visit to the Hand loom weaver when she had herself met the vicar of Mowbray Sybil rose and letting her book drop gently on the table received Egremont with composure and native grace It is civilization that makes us awkward for it gives us an uncertain position Perplexed we take refuge in pretence and embarrassed we seek a resource in affectation The Bedouin and the Red Indian never lose their presence of mind and the wife of a peasant when you enter her cottage often greets you with a propriety of mien which favourably contrasts with your reception by some grand dame in some grand assembly meeting her guests alternately with a caricature of courtesy or an exaggeradon of supercilious self control I dare say said Egremont bowing to Sybil you have seen our poor friend the weaver since we met there The day I quitted Mowbray said Sybil They are not without friends Ah you have met my daughter before On a mission of grace said Egremont And I suppose you found the town not very pleasant mister Franklin continued Gerard No I could not stand it the nights were so close Besides I have a great accumulation of notes and I fancied I could reduce them into a report more efficiently in comparative seclusion So I have got a room near here with a little garden not so pretty as yours but still a garden is something and if I want any additional information why after all Mowbray is only a walk You say well and have done wisely Besides you have such late hours in London and hard work Some country air will do you all the good in the world That gallery must be tiresome Do you use shorthand A sort of shorthand of my own said Egremont I trust a good deal to my memory Ah you are young My daughter also has a wonderful memory For my own part there are many things which I am not sorry to forget You see I took you at your word neighbour said Egremont When one has been at work the whole day one feels a little lonely towards night Very true and I dare say you find desk work sometimes very dull I never could make anything of it myself I can manage a book well enough if it be well written and on points I care for but I would sooner listen than read any time said Gerard Indeed I should be right glad to see the minstrel and the storyteller going their rounds again It would be easy after a day s work when one has not as I have now a good child to read to me This volume said Egremont drawing his chair to the table and looking at Sybil who intimated assent by a nod Ah it s a fine book said Gerard though on a sad subject The History of the Conquest of England by the Normans said Egremont reading the title page on which also was written Ursula Trafford to Sybil Gerard You know it said Sybil Only by fame Perhaps the subject may not interest you so much as it does us said Sybil It must interest all and all alike said her father for we are divided between the conquerors and the conquered But do not you think said Egremont that such a distinction has long ceased to exist In what degree asked Gerard Many circumstances of oppression have doubtless gradually disappeared but that has arisen from the change of manners not from any political recognition of their injustice The same course of time which has removed many enormities more shocking however to our modern feelings than to those who devised and endured them has simultaneously removed many alleviating circumstances If the mere baron s grasp be not so ruthless the champion we found in the church is no longer so ready The spirit of Conquest has adapted itself to the changing circumstances of ages and however its results vary in form in degree they are much the same But how do they show themselves In many circumstances which concern many classes but I speak of those which touch my own order and therefore I say at once in the degradation of the people But are the people so degraded There is more serfdom in England now than at any time since the Conquest I speak of what passes under my daily eyes when I say that those who labour can as little choose or change their masters now as when they were born thralls There are great bodies of the working classes of this country nearer the condition of brutes than they have been at any time since the Conquest Indeed I see nothing to distinguish them from brutes except that their morals are inferior Incest and infanticide are as common among them as among the lower animals The domestic principle waxes weaker and weaker every year in England nor can we wonder at it when there is no comfort to cheer and no sentiment to hallow the Home I was reading a work the other day said Egremont that statistically proved that the general condition of the people was much better at this moment than it had been at any known period of history Ah yes I know that style of speculation said Gerard your gentleman who reminds you that a working man now has a pair of cotton stockings and that Harry the Eighth himself was not as well off At any rate the condition of classes must be judged of by the age and by their relation with each other One need not dwell on that I deny the premises I deny that the condition of the main body is better now than at any other period of our history that it is as good as it has been at several I say for instance the people were better clothed better lodged and better fed just before the war of the Roses than they are at this moment We know how an English peasant lived in those times he eat flesh every day he never drank water was well housed and clothed in stout woollens Nor are the Chronicles necessary to tell us this The acts of Parliament from the Plantagenets to the Tudors teach us alike the price of provisions and the rate of wages and we see in a moment that the wages of those days brought as much sustenance and comfort as a reasonable man could desire I know how deeply you feel upon this subject said Egremont turning to Sybil Indeed it is the only subject that ever engages my thought she replied except one And that one Is to see the people once more kneel before our blessed Lady replied Sybil Look at the average term of life said Gerard coming unintentionally to the relief of Egremont who was a little embarrassed The average term of life in this district among the working classes is seventeen What think you of that Of the infants born in Mowbray more than a moiety die before the age of five And yet said Egremont in old days they had terrible pestilences But they touched all alike said Gerard We have more pestilence now in England than we ever had but it only reaches the poor You never hear of it Why Typhus alone takes every year from the dwellings of the artisan and peasant a population equal to that of the whole county of Westmoreland This goes on every year but the representatives of the conquerors are not touched it is the descendants of the conquered alone who are the victims It sometimes seems to me said Sybil despondingly that nothing short of the descent of angels can save the people of this kingdom I sometimes think I hear a little bird said Gerard who sings that the long frost may yet break up I have a friend him of whom I was speaking to you the other day who has his remedies But Stephen Morley does not believe in angels said Sybil with a sigh and I have no faith in his plan He believes that God will help those who help themselves said Gerard And I believe said Sybil that those only can help themselves whom God helps All this time Egremont was sitting at the table with the book in his hand gazing fitfully and occasionally with an air of absence on its title page whereon was written the name of its owner Suddenly he said Sybil Yes said the daughter of Gerard with an air of some astonishment I beg your pardon said Egremont blushing I was reading your name I thought I was reading it to myself Sybil Gerard What a beautiful name is Sybil My mother s name said Gerard and my grandame s name and a name I believe that has been about our hearth as long as our race and that s a very long time indeed he added smiling for we were tall men in King John s reign as I have heard say Yours is indeed an old family Ay we have some English blood in our veins though peasants and the sons of peasants But there was one of us who drew a bow at Azincourt and I have heard greater things but I believe they are old wives tales At least we have nothing left said Sybil but our old faith and that we have clung to through good report and evil report And now said Gerard I rise with the lark good neighbour Franklin but before you go Sybil will sing to us a requiem that I love it stills the spirit before we sink into the slumber which may this night be death and which one day must be Book three Chapter six A bloom was spread over the morning sky A soft golden light bathed with its fresh beam the bosom of the valley except where a delicate haze rather than a mist still partially lingered over the river which yet occasionally gleamed and sparkled in the sunshine A sort of shadowy lustre suffused the landscape which though distinct was mitigated in all its features the distant woods the clumps of tall trees that rose about the old grey bridge the cottage chimneys that sent their smoke into the blue still air amid their clustering orchards and garden of flowers and herbs Ah what is there so fresh and joyous as a summer morn That spring time of the day when the brain is bright and the heart is brave the season of daring and of hope the renovating hour Came forth from his cottage room the brother of Lord Marney to feel the vigorous bliss of life amid sunshiny gardens and the voices of bees and birds Ah this is delicious he felt This is existence Thank God I am here that I have quitted for ever that formal and heartless Marney Were it not for my mother I would remain mister Franklin for ever Would I were indeed a journalist provided I always had a mission to the vale of Mowbray Or anything so that I were ever here As companions independent of everything else they are superior to any that I have been used to Why do these persons interest me They feel and they think two habits that have quite gone out of fashion if ever they existed among my friends And that polish of manners that studied and factitious refinement which is to compensate for the heartlessness or the stupidity we are doomed to is my host of last night deficient in that refinement If he do want our conventional discipline he has a native breeding which far excels it I observe no word or action which is not prompted by that fine feeling which is the sure source of good taste This Gerard appears to me a real genuine man full of knowledge worked out by his own head with large yet wholesome sympathies and a deuced deal better educated than Lord de Mowbray or my brother and they do occasionally turn over a book which is not the habit of our set And his daughter ay his daughter There is something almost sublime about that young girl yet strangely sweet withal a tone so lofty combined with such simplicity is very rare For there is no affectation of enthusiasm about her nothing exaggerated nothing rhapsodical Her dark eyes and lustrous face and the solemn sweetness of her thrilling voice they haunt me they have haunted me from the first moment I encountered her like a spirit amid the ruins of our abbey And I am one of the family of sacrilege If she knew that And I am one of the conquering class she denounces If also she knew that Ah there is much to know Above all the future Away the tree of knowledge is the tree of death I will have no thought that is not as bright and lovely as this morn He went forth from his little garden and strolled along the road in the direction of the cottage of Gerard which was about three quarters of a mile distant You might see almost as far the sunshiny road a little winding and rising a very slight ascent The cottage itself was hid by its trees While Egremont was still musing of one who lived under that roof he beheld in the distance Sybil She was springing along with a quick and airy step Her black dress displayed her undulating and elastic figure Her little foot bounded from the earth with a merry air A long rosary hung at her side and her head was partly covered with a hood which descended just over her shoulders She seemed gay for Harold kept running before her with a frolicsome air and then returning to his mistress danced about her and almost overpowered her with his gambols I salute thee holy sister said Egremont Oh is not this a merry morn she exclaimed with a bright and happy face I feel it as you And whither do you go I go to the convent I pay my first visit to our Superior since I left them Not very long ago said Egremont with a smile and turning with her It seems so said Sybil They walked on together Sybil glad as the hour noticing a thousand cheerful sights speaking to her dog in her ringing voice as he gambolled before them or seized her garments in his mouth and ever and anon bounded away and then returned looking up in his mistress face to inquire whether he had been wanted in his absence What a pity it is that your father s way each morning lies up the valley said Egremont he would be your companion to Mowbray Ah but I am so happy that he has not to work in a town said Sybil He is not made to be cooped up in a hot factory in a smoky street At least he labours among the woods and waters And the Traffords are such good people So kind to him and to all You love your father very much She looked at him a little surprised and then her sweet serious face broke into a smile and she said And is that strange I think not said Egremont I am inclined to love him myself Ah you win my heart said Sybil when you praise him I think that is the real reason why I like Stephen for otherwise he is always saying something with which I cannot agree which I disapprove and yet he is so good to my father You speak of mister Morley Oh we don t call him mister said Sybil slightly laughing I mean Stephen Morley said Egremont recalling his position whom I met in Marney Abbey He is very clever is he not He is a great writer and a great student and what he is he has made himself I hear too that you follow the same pursuit said Sybil But I am not a great writer or a great student said Egremont Whatever you be I trust said Sybil in a more serious tone that you will never employ the talents that God has given you against the People I have come here to learn something of their condition said Egremont That is not to be done in a great city like London We all of us live too much in a circle You will assist me I am sure added Egremont your spirit will animate me You told me last night that there was no other subject except one which ever occupied your thoughts Yes said Sybil I have lived under two roofs only two roofs and each has given me a great idea the Convent and the Cottage One has taught me the degradation of my faith the other of my race You should not wonder therefore that my heart is concentrated on the Church and the People But there are other ideas said Egremont that might equally be entitled to your thought I feel these are enough said Sybil too great as it is for my brain Book three Chapter seven At the end of a court in Wodgate of rather larger dimensions than usual in that town was a high and many windowed house of several stories in height which had been added to it at intervals It was in a most dilapidated state the principal part occupied as a nail workshop where a great number of heavy iron machines were working in every room on each floor the building itself in so shattered a condition that every part of it creaked and vibrated with their motion The flooring was so broken that in many places one could look down through the gaping and rotten planks while the upper floors from time to time had been shored up with props This was the Palace of the Bishop of Wodgate and here with his arms bare and black he worked at those locks which defied any skeleton key that was not made by himself He was a short thickset man powerfully made with brawny arms disproportionately short even for his height and with a countenance as far as one could judge of a face so disfigured by his grimy toil rather brutal than savage His choice apprentices full of admiration and terror worked about him lank and haggard youths who never for an instant dared to raise their dingy faces and lack lustre eyes from their ceaseless labour On each side of their master seated on a stool higher than the rest was an urchin of not more than four or five years of age serious and demure and as if proud of his eminent position or working incessantly at his little file these were two sons of the bishop Now boys said the bishop in a hoarse harsh voice steady there steady There s a file what don t sing can t deceive my ear I know all their voices Don t let me find that un out or I won t walk into him won t I Ayn t you lucky boys to have reg lar work like this and the best of prog It worn t my lot I can tell you that Give me that shut you there Scrubbynose can t you move Look sharp or I won t move you won t I Steady steady All right That s music Where will you hear music like twenty files all working at once You ought to be happy boys oughtn t you Won t there be a treat of fish after this that s all Hulloa there you red haired varmint what are you looking after Three boys looking about them what s all this Won t I be among you and he sprang forward and seized the luckless ears of the first apprentice he could get hold off and wrung them till the blood spouted forth Please bishop sang out the boy it worn t my fault Here s a man what wants you Who wants me said the bishop looking round and he caught the figure of Morley who had just entered the shop Well what s your will Locks or nails Neither said Morley I wish to see a man named Hatton Well you see a man named Hatton said the bishop and now what do want of him I should like to say a word to you alone said Morley Hem I should like to know who is to finish this lock and to look after my boys If it s an order let us have it at once It is not an order said Morley Then I don t want to hear nothing about it said the bishop It s about family matters said Morley Ah said Hatton eagerly what do you come from him It may be said Morley Upon this the bishop looking up to the ceiling of the room in which there were several large chinks began calling out lustily to some unseen person above and immediately was replied to in a shrill voice of objurgation demanding in peremptory words interlarded with many oaths what he wanted His reply called down his unseen correspondent who soon entered his workshop It was the awful presence of missus Hatton a tall bearded virago with a file in her hand for that seemed the distinctive arm of the house and eyes flashing with unbridled power Look after the boys said Hatton for I have business Won t I said missus Hatton and a thrill of terror pervaded the assembly All the files moved in regular melody no one dared to raise his face even her two young children looked still more serious and demure Not that any being present flattered himself for an instant that the most sedulous attention on his part could prevent an outbreak all that each aspired to and wildly hoped was that he might not be the victim singled out to have his head cut open or his eye knocked out or his ears half pulled off by the being who was the terror not only of the workshop but of Wodgate itself their bishop s gentle wife In the meantime that worthy taking Morley into a room where there were no machines at work except those made of iron said Well what have you brought me In the first place said Morley I would speak to you of your brother I concluded that said Hatton when you spoke of family matters bringing you here he is the only relation I have in this world and therefore it must be of him It is of him said Morley Has he sent anything Hem said Morley who was by nature a diplomatist and instantly comprehended his position being himself pumped when he came to pump but he resolved not to precipitate the affair How late is it since you heard from him he asked Why I suppose you know said Hatton I heard as usual From his usual place inquired Morley I wish you would tell me where that is said Hatton eagerly Why he writes to you Blank letters never had a line except once and that is more than twelve year ago He sends me a twenty pound note every Christmas and that is all I know about him Then he is rich and well to do in the world said Morley Why don t you know said Hatton I thought you came from him I came about him I wished to know whether he were alive and that you have been able to inform me and where he was and that you have not been able to inform me Why you re a regular muff said the bishop Book three Chapter eight A few days after his morning walk with Sybil it was agreed that Egremont should visit mister Trafford s factory which he had expressed a great desire to inspect Gerard always left his cottage at break of dawn and as Sybil had not yet paid her accustomed visit to her friend and patron who was the employer of her father it was arranged that Egremont should accompany her at a later and more convenient hour in the morning and then that they should all return together The factory was about a mile distant from their cottage which belonged indeed to mister Trafford and had been built by him He was the younger son of a family that had for centuries been planted in the land but who not satisfied with the factitious consideration with which society compensates the junior members of a territorial house for their entailed poverty had availed himself of some opportunities that offered themselves and had devoted his energies to those new sources of wealth that were unknown to his ancestors His operations at first had been extremely limited like his fortunes but with a small capital though his profits were not considerable he at least gained experience With gentle blood in his veins and old English feelings he imbibed at an early period of his career a correct conception of the relations which should subsist between the employer and the employed He felt that between them there should be other ties than the payment and the receipt of wages A distant and childless relative who made him a visit pleased with his energy and enterprise and touched by the development of his social views left him a considerable sum at a moment too when a great opening was offered to manufacturing capital and skill Trafford schooled in rigid fortunes and formed by struggle if not by adversity was ripe for the occasion and equal to it He became very opulent and he lost no time in carrying into life and being the plans which he had brooded over in the years when his good thoughts were limited to dreams On the banks of his native Mowe he had built a factory which was now one of the marvels of the district one might almost say of the country a single room spreading over nearly two acres and holding more than two thousand work people The roof of groined arches lighted by ventilating domes at the height of eighteen feet was supported by hollow cast iron columns through which the drainage of the roof was effected The height of the ordinary rooms in which the work people in manufactories are engaged is not more than from nine to eleven feet and these are built in stories the heat and effluvia of the lower rooms communicated to those above and the difficulty of ventilation insurmountable At mister Trafford s by an ingenious process not unlike that which is practised in the House of Commons the ventilation was also carried on from below so that the whole building was kept at a steady temperature and little susceptible to atmospheric influence The physical advantages of thus carrying on the whole work in one chamber are great in the improved health of the people the security against dangerous accidents for women and youth and the reduced fatigue resulting from not having to ascend and descend and carry materials to the higher rooms But the moral advantages resulting from superior inspection and general observation are not less important the child works under the eye of the parent the parent under that of the superior workman the inspector or employer at a glance can behold all When the workpeople of mister Trafford left his factory they were not forgotten Deeply had he pondered on the influence of the employer on the health and content of his workpeople He knew well that the domestic virtues are dependent on the existence of a home and one of his first efforts had been to build a village where every family might be well lodged Though he was the principal proprietor and proud of that character he nevertheless encouraged his workmen to purchase the fee there were some who had saved sufficient money to effect this proud of their house and their little garden and of the horticultural society where its produce permitted them to be annual competitors In every street there was a well behind the factory were the public baths the schools were under the direction of the perpetual curate of the church which mister Trafford though a Roman Catholic had raised and endowed In the midst of this village surrounded by beautiful gardens which gave an impulse to the horticulture of the community was the house of Trafford himself who comprehended his position too well to withdraw himself with vulgar exclusiveness from his real dependents but recognized the baronial principle reviving in a new form and adapted to the softer manners and more ingenious circumstances of the times And what was the influence of such an employer and such a system of employment on the morals and manners of the employed Great infinitely beneficial The connexion of a labourer with his place of work whether agricultural or manufacturing is itself a vast advantage Proximity to the employer brings cleanliness and order because it brings observation and encouragement In the settlement of Trafford crime was positively unknown and offences were very slight There was not a single person in the village of a reprobate character The men were well clad the women had a blooming cheek drunkenness was unknown while the moral condition of the softer sex was proportionately elevated The vast form of the spreading factory the roofs and gardens of the village the Tudor chimneys of the house of Trafford the spire of the gothic church with the sparkling river and the sylvan hack ground came rather suddenly on the sight of Egremont They were indeed in the pretty village street before he was aware he was about to enter it Some beautiful children rushed out of a cottage and flew to Sybil crying out the queen the queen one clinging to her dress another seizing her arm and a third too small to struggle pouting out its lips to be embraced My subjects said Sybil laughing as she greeted them all and then they ran away to announce to others that their queen had arrived Others came beautiful and young As Sybil and Egremont walked along the race too tender for labour seemed to spring out of every cottage to greet their queen Her visits had been very rare of late but they were never forgotten they formed epochs in the village annals of the children some of whom knew only by tradition the golden age when Sybil Gerard lived at the great house and daily glanced like a spirit among their homes smiling and met with smiles blessing and ever blessed And here she said to Egremont I must bid you good bye and this little boy touching gently on his head a very serious urchin who had never left her side for a moment proud of his position and holding tight her hand with all his strength this little boy shall be your guide It is not a hundred yards Now Pierce you must take mister Franklin to the factory and ask for mister Gerard And she went her way They had not separated five minutes when the sound of whirling wheels caught the ear of Egremont and looking round he saw a cavalcade of great pretension rapidly approaching dames and cavaliers on horseback a brilliant equipage postilions and four horses a crowd of grooms Egremont stood aside The horsemen and horsewomen caracoled gaily by him proudly swept on the sparkling barouche the saucy grooms pranced in his face Their masters and mistresses were not strangers to him he recognized with some dismay the liveries and then the arms of Lord de Mowbray and caught the cold proud countenance of Lady Joan and the flexible visage of Lady Maud both on horseback and surrounded by admiring cavaliers Egremont flattered himself that he had not been recognised and dismissing his little guide instead of proceeding to the factory he sauntered away in an opposite direction and made a visit to the church The wife of Trafford embraced Sybil and then embraced her again She seemed as happy as the children of the village that the joy of her roof as of so many others had returned to them though only for a few hours Her husband she said had just quitted the house he was obliged to go to the factory to receive a great and distinguished party who were expected this morning having written to him several days before for permission to view the works We expect them to lunch here afterwards said missus Trafford a very refined woman but unused to society and who rather trembled at the ceremony Oh do stay with me Sybil to receive them This intimation so much alarmed Sybil that she rose as soon as was practicable and saying that she had some visits to make in the village she promised to return when missus Trafford was less engaged An hour elapsed there was a loud ring at the hall door the great and distinguished party had arrived missus Trafford prepared for the interview and tried to look very composed as the doors opened and her husband ushered in and presented to her Lord and Lady de Mowbray their daughters Lady Firebrace mister Jermyn who still lingered at the castle and mister Alfred Mountchesney and Lord Milford who were mere passing guests on their way to Scotland but reconnoitering the heiresses in their course Lord de Mowbray was profuse of praise and compliments His lordship was apt to be too civil The breed would come out sometimes To day he was quite the coffee house waiter He praised everything the machinery the workmen the cotton manufactured and the cotton raw even the smoke But missus Trafford would not have the smoke defended and his lordship gave the smoke up but only to please her As for Lady de Mowbray she was as usual courteous and condescending with a kind of smouldering smile on her fair aquiline face that seemed half pleasure and half surprise at the strange people she was among Lady Joan was haughty and scientific approved of much but principally of the system of ventilation of which she asked several questions which greatly perplexed missus Trafford who slightly blushed and looked at her husband for relief but he was engaged with Lady Maud who was full of enthusiasm entered into everything with the zest of sympathy identified herself with the factory system almost as much as she had done with the crusades and longed to teach in singing schools found public gardens and bid fountains flow and sparkle for the people I think the works were very wonderful said Lord Milford as he was cutting a pasty and indeed missus Trafford everything here is quite charming but what I have most admired at your place is a young girl we met the most beautiful I think I ever saw With the most beautiful dog said mister Mountchesney Oh that must have been Sybil exclaimed missus Trafford And who is Sybil asked Lady Maud That is one of our family names We all thought her quite beautiful She is a child of the house said missus Trafford or rather was for I am sorry to say she has long quitted us Is she a nun asked Lord Milford for her vestments had a conventual air She has just left your convent at Mowbray said mister Trafford addressing his answer to Lady Maud and rather against her will She clings to the dress she was accustomed to there And now she resides with you No I should be very happy if she did I might almost say she was brought up under this roof She lives now with her father And who is so fortunate as to be her father enquired mister Mountchesney Her father is the inspector of my works the person who accompanied us over them this morning What that handsome man I so much admired said Lady Maud so very aristocratic looking Papa she said addressing herself to Lord de Mowbray the inspector of mister Trafford s works we are speaking of that aristocratic looking person that I observed to you he is the father of the beautiful girl He seemed a very intelligent person said Lord de Mowbray with many smiles Yes said mister Trafford he has great talents and great integrity I would trust him with anything and to any amount All I wish he added with a smile and in a lower tone to Lady de Mowbray all I wish is that he was not quite so fond of politics Is he very violent enquired her ladyship in a sugary tone Too violent said mister Trafford and wild in his ideas And yet I suppose said Lord Milford he must be very well off Why I must say for him it is not selfishness that makes him a malcontent said mister Trafford he bemoans the condition of the people If we are to judge of the condition of the people by what we see here said Lord de Mowbray there is little to lament in it But I fear these are instances not so common as we could wish You must have been at a great outlay mister Trafford Why said mister Trafford for my part I have always considered that there was nothing so expensive as a vicious population I hope I had other objects in view in what I have done than a pecuniary compensation They say we all have our hobbies and it was ever mine to improve the condition of my workpeople to see what good tenements and good schools and just wages paid in a fair manner and the encouragement of civilizing pursuits would do to elevate their character I should find an ample reward in the moral tone and material happiness of this community but really viewing it in a pecuniary point of view the investment of capital has been one of the most profitable I ever made and I would not I assure you for double its amount exchange my workpeople for the promiscuous assemblage engaged in other factories The influence of the atmosphere on the condition of the labourer is a subject which deserves investigation said Lady Joan to mister Jermyn who stared and bowed And you do not feel alarmed at having a person of such violent opinions as your inspector at the head of your establishment said Lady Firebrace to mister Trafford who smiled a negative What is the name of the intelligent individual who accompanied us enquired Lord de Mowbray His name is Gerard said mister Trafford I believe a common name in these parts said Lord de Mowbray looking a little confused Not very said mister Trafford tis an old name and the stock has spread but all Gerards claim a common lineage I believe and my inspector has gentle blood they say in his veins He looks as if he had said Lady Maud All persons with good names affect good blood said Lord de Mowbray and then turning to missus Trafford he overwhelmed her with elaborate courtesies of phrase praised everything again first generally and then in detail the factory which he seemed to prefer to his castle the house which he seemed to prefer even to the factory the gardens from which he anticipated even greater gratification than from the house And this led to an expression of a hope that he would visit them And so in due time the luncheon was achieved missus Trafford looked at her guests there was a rustling and a stir and everybody was to go and see the gardens that Lord de Mowbray had so much praised I am all for looking after the beautiful Nun said mister Mountchesney to Lord Milford I think I shall ask the respectable manufacturer to introduce me to her replied his lordship In the meantime Egremont had joined Gerard at the factory You should have come sooner said Gerard and then you might have gone round with the fine folks We have had a grand party here from the castle So I perceived said Egremont and withdrew Ah they were not in your way eh he said in a mocking smile Well they were very condescending at least for such great people An earl Earl de Mowbray I suppose he came over with William the Conqueror mister Trafford makes a show of the place and it amuses their visitors I dare say like anything else that s strange There were some young gentlemen with them who did not seem to know much about anything I thought I had a right to be amused too and I must say I liked very much to see one of them looking at the machinery through his eye glass There was one very venturesome chap I thought he was going to catch hold of the fly wheel but I gave him a spin which I believed saved his life though he did rather stare He was a lord They are great heiresses his daughters they say at Mowbray said Egremont I dare say said Gerard A year ago this earl had a son an only son and then his daughters were not great heiresses But the son died and now it s their turn And perhaps some day it will be somebody else s turn If you want to understand the ups and downs of life there s nothing like the parchments of an estate Now master now man He who served in the hall now lords in it and very often the baseborn change their liveries for coronets while gentle blood has nothing left but dreams eh master Franklin It seems you know the history of this Lord de Mowbray Why a man learns a good many things in his time and living in these parts there are few secrets of the notables He has had the title to his broad acres questioned before this time my friend Indeed Yes I could not help thinking of that to day said Gerard when he questioned me with his mincing voice and pulled the wool with his cursed white hands and showed it to his dame who touched it with her little finger and his daughters who tossed their heads like pea hens Lady Joan and Lady Maud Lady Joan and Lady Maud repeated Gerard in a voice of bitter sarcasm I did not care for the rest but I could not stand that Lady Joan and that Lady Maud I wonder if my Sybil saw them In the meantime Sybil had been sent for by missus Trafford She had inferred from the message that the guests had departed and her animated cheek showed the eagerness with which she had responded to the call Bounding along with a gladness of the heart which lent additional lustre to her transcendent brightness she suddenly found herself surrounded in the garden by Lady Maud and her friends The daughter of Lord de Mowbray who could conceive nothing but humility as the cause of her alarmed look attempted to re assure her by condescending volubility turning often to her friends and praising in admiring interrogatories Sybil s beauty And we took advantage of your absence said Lady Maud in a tone of amiable artlessness to find out all about you And what a pity we did not know you when you were at the convent because then you might have been constantly at the castle indeed I should have insisted on it But still I hear we are neighbours you must promise to pay me a visit you must indeed Is not she beautiful she added in a lower but still distinct voice to her friend Do you know I think there is so much beauty among the lower order mister Mountchesney and Lord Milford poured forth several insipid compliments accompanied with some speaking looks which they flattered themselves could not be misconstrued Sybil said not a word but answered each flood of phrases with a cold reverence Undeterred by her somewhat haughty demeanour which Lady Maud only attributed to the novelty of her situation her ignorance of the world and her embarrassment under this overpowering condescension the good tempered and fussy daughter of Lord de Mowbray proceeded to re assure Sybil and to enforce on her that this perhaps unprecedented descent from superiority was not a mere transient courtliness of the moment and that she really might rely on her patronage and favourable feeling You really must come and see me said Lady Maud I shall never be happy till you have made me a visit Where do you live I will come and fetch you myself in the carriage Now let us fix a day at once Let me see this is Saturday What say you to next Monday I thank you said Sybil very gravely but I never quit my home What a darling exclaimed Lady Maud looking round at her friends Is not she I know exactly what you feel But really you shall not be the least embarrassed It may feel strange at first to be sure but then I shall be there and do you know I look upon you quite as my protege Protege said Sybil I live with my father What a dear said Lady Maud looking round to Lord Milford Is not she naive And are you the guardian of these beautiful flowers said mister Mountchesney Sybil signified a negative and added missus Trafford is very proud of them You must see the flowers at Mowbray Castle said Lady Maud They are unprecedented are they not Lord Milford You know you said the other day that they were almost equal to missus Lawrence s I am charmed to find you are fond of flowers continued Lady Maud you will be so delighted with Mowbray Ah mama is calling us Now fix shall it be Monday Indeed said Sybil I never leave my home I am one of the lower order and live only among the lower order I am here to day merely for a few hours to pay an act of homage to a benefactor Well I shall come and fetch you said Maud covering her surprise and mortification by a jaunty air that would not confess defeat And so shall I said mister Mountchesney And so shall I whispered Lord Milford lingering a little behind The great and distinguished party had disappeared their glittering barouche their prancing horses their gay grooms all had vanished the sound of their wheels was no longer heard Time flew on the bell announced that the labour of the week had closed There was a half holiday always on the last day of the week at mister Trafford s settlement and every man woman and child were paid their wages in the great room before they left the mill Thus the expensive and evil habits which result from wages being paid in public houses were prevented There was also in this system another great advantage for the workpeople They received their wages early enough to repair to the neighbouring markets and make their purchases for the morrow This added greatly to their comfort and rendering it unnecessary for them to run in debt to the shopkeepers added really to their wealth mister Trafford thought that next to the amount of wages the most important consideration was the method in which wages are paid and those of our readers who may have read or can recall the sketches neither coloured nor exagerated which we have given in the early part of this volume of the very different manner in which the working classes may receive the remuneration for their toil will probably agree with the sensible and virtuous master of Walter Gerard He accompanied by his daughter and Egremont is now on his way home A soft summer afternoon the mild beam still gilding the tranquil scene a river green meads full of kine woods vocal with the joyous song of the thrush and the blackbird and in the distance the lofty breast of the purple moor still blazing in the sun fair sights and renovating sounds after a day of labour passed in walls and amid the ceaseless and monotonous clang of the spindle and the loom So Gerard felt it as he stretched his great limbs in the air and inhaled its perfumed volume Ah I was made for this Sybil he exclaimed but never mind my child never mind tell me more of your fine visitors Egremont found the walk too short fortunately from the undulation of the vale they could not see the cottage until within a hundred yards of it When they were in sight a man came forth from the garden to greet them Sybil gave an exclamation of pleasure it was MORLEY Book three Chapter nine Morley greeted Gerard and his daughter with great warmth and then looked at Egremont Our companion in the ruins of Marney Abbey said Gerard you and our friend Franklin here should become acquainted Stephen for you both follow the same craft He is a journalist like yourself and is our neighbour for a time and yours What journal are you on may I ask enquired Morley Egremont reddened was confused and then replied I have no claim to the distinguished title of a journalist I am but a reporter and have some special duties here Hem said Morley and then taking Gerard by the arm he walked away with him leaving Egremont and Sybil to follow them Well I have found him Walter What Hatton No no the brother And what knows he Little enough yet something Our man lives and prospers these are facts but where he is or what he is not a clue And this brother cannot help us On the contrary he sought information from me he is a savage beneath even our worst ideas of popular degradation All that is ascertained is that our man exists and is well to do in the world There comes an annual and anonymous contribution and not a light one to his brother I examined the post marks of the letters but they all varied and were evidently arranged to mislead I fear you will deem I have not done much yet it was wearisome enough I can tell you I doubt it not and I am sure Stephen you have done all that man could I was fancying that I should hear from you to day for what think you has happened My Lord himself his family and train have all been in state to visit the works and I had to show them Queer that wasn t it He offered me money when it was over How much I know not I would not look at it Though to be sure they were perhaps my own rents eh But I pointed to the sick box and his own dainty hand deposited the sum there Tis very strange And you were with him face to face Face to face Had you brought me news of the papers I should have thought that providence had rather a hand in it but now we are still at sea Still at sea said Morley musingly but he lives and prospers He will turn up yet Walter Amen Since you have taken up this thing Stephen it is strange how my mind has hankered after the old business and yet it ruined my father and mayhap may do as bad for his son We will not think that said Morley At present we will think of other things You may guess I am a bit wearied I think I ll say good night you have strangers with you Nay nay man nay This Franklin is a likely lad enough I think you will take to him Prithee come in Sybil will not take it kindly if you go after so long an absence and I am sure I shall not So they entered together The evening passed in various conversation though it led frequently to the staple subject of talk beneath the roof of Gerard the Condition of the People What Morley had seen in his recent excursion afforded materials for many comments The domestic feeling is fast vanishing among the working classes of this country said Gerard nor is it wonderful the Home no longer exists But there are means of reviving it said Egremont we have witnessed them to day Give men homes and they will have soft and homely notions If all men acted like mister Trafford the condition of the people would be changed But all men will not act like mister Trafford said Morley It requires a sacrifice of self which cannot be expected which is unnatural It is not individual influence that can renovate society it is some new principle that must reconstruct it You lament the expiring idea of Home It would not be expiring if it were worth retaining The domestic principle has fulfilled its purpose The irresistible law of progress demands that another should be developed It will come you may advance or retard but you cannot prevent it It will work out like the development of organic nature In the present state of civilization and with the scientific means of happiness at our command the notion of home should be obsolete Home is a barbarous idea the method of a rude age home is isolation therefore anti social What we want is Community It is all very fine said Gerard and I dare say you are right Stephen but I like stretching my feet on my own hearth Book three Chapter ten Time passes with a measured and memorable wing during the first period of a sojourn in a new place among new characters and new manners Every person every incident every feeling touches and stirs the imagination The restless mind creates and observes at the same time Indeed there is scarcely any popular tenet more erroneous than that which holds that when time is slow life is dull It is very often and very much the reverse If we look back on those passages of our life which dwell most upon the memory they are brief periods full of action and novel sensation Egremont found this so during the first days of his new residence in Mowedale The first week an epoch in his life seemed an age at the end of the first month he began to deplore the swiftness of time and almost to moralize over the brevity of existence He found that he was leading a life of perfect happiness but of remarkable simplicity he wished it might never end but felt difficulty in comprehending how in the first days of his experience of it it had seemed so strange almost as strange as it was sweet The day that commenced early was past in reading books lent him often too by Sybil Gerard sometimes in a ramble with her and Morley who had time much at his command to some memorable spot in the neighbourhood or in the sport which the river and the rod secured Egremont In the evening he invariably repaired to the cottage of Gerard beneath whose humble roof he found every female charm that can fascinate and conversation that stimulated his intelligence Gerard was ever the same hearty simple with a depth of feeling and native thought on the subjects on which they touched and with a certain grandeur of sentiment and conception which contrasted with his social position but which became his idiosyncracy Sybil spoke little but hung upon the accents of her father yet ever and anon her rich tones conveyed to the charmed ear of Egremont some deep conviction the earnestness of her intellect as remarkable as the almost sacred repose of her mien and manner Of Morley at first Egremont saw a great deal he lent our friend books opened with unreserve and with great richness of speculative and illustrative power on the questions which ever engaged him and which were new and highly interesting to his companion But as time advanced whether it were that the occupations of Morley increased and the calls on his hours left him fewer occasions for the indulgence of social intercourse Egremont saw him seldom except at Gerard s cottage where generally he might be found in the course of the week and their rambles together had entirely ceased Alone Egremont mused much over the daughter of Gerard but shrinking from the precise and the definite his dreams were delightful but vague All that he asked was that his present life should go on for ever he wished for no change and at length almost persuaded himself that no change could arrive as men who are basking in a summer sun surrounded by bright and beautiful objects cannot comprehend how the seasons can ever alter that the sparkling foliage should shrivel and fall away the foaming waters become icebound and the blue serene a dark and howling space In this train of mind the early days of October having already stolen on him an incident occurred which startled him in his retirement and rendered it necessary that he should instantly quit it Egremont had entrusted the secret of his residence to a faithful servant who communicated with him when necessary under his assumed name Through these means he received a letter from his mother written from London where she had unexpectedly arrived entreating him in urgent terms to repair to her without a moment s delay on a matter of equal interest and importance to herself and him Such an appeal from such a quarter from the parent that had ever been kind and the friend that had been ever faithful was not for a moment to be neglected Already a period had elapsed since its transmission which Egremont regretted He resolved at once to quit Mowedale nor could he console himself with the prospect of an immediate return Parliament was to assemble in the ensuing month and independent of the unknown cause which summoned him immediately to town he was well aware that much disagreeable business awaited him which could no longer be postponed He had determined not to take his seat unless the expenses of his contest were previously discharged and despairing of his brother s aid and shrinking from trespassing any further on his mother s resources the future looked gloomy enough indeed nothing but the frequent presence and the constant influence of Sybil had driven from his mind the ignoble melancholy which relieved by no pensive fancy is the invariable attendant of pecuniary embarrassment And now he was to leave her The event rather the catastrophe which under any circumstances could not be long postponed was to be precipitated He strolled up to the cottage to bid her farewell and to leave kind words for her father Sybil was not there The old dame who kept their home informed him that Sybil was at the convent but would return in the evening It was impossible to quit Mowedale without seeing Sybil equally impossible to postpone his departure But by travelling through the night the lost hours might be regained And Egremont made his arrangements and awaited with anxiety and impatience the last evening The evening like his heart was not serene The soft air that had lingered so long with them a summer visitant in an autumnal sky and loth to part was no more present A cold harsh wind gradually rising chilled the system and grated on the nerves There was misery in its blast and depression in its moan Egremont felt infinitely dispirited The landscape around him that he had so often looked upon with love and joy was dull and hard the trees dingy the leaden waters motionless the distant hills rough and austere Where was that translucent sky once brilliant as his enamoured fancy those bowery groves of aromatic fervor wherein he had loved to roam and muse that river of swift and sparkling light that flowed and flashed like the current of his enchanted hours All vanished as his dreams He stood before the cottage of Gerard he recalled the eve that he had first gazed upon its moonlit garden What wild and delicious thoughts were then his They were gone like the illumined hour Nature and fortune had alike changed Prescient of sorrow almost prophetic of evil he opened the cottage door and the first person his eye encountered was Morley Egremont had not met him for some time and his cordial greeting of Egremont to night contrasted with the coldness not to say estrangement which to the regret and sometimes the perplexity of Egremont had gradually grown up between them Yet on no occasion was his presence less desired by our friend Morley was talking as Egremont entered with great animation in his hand a newspaper on a paragraph contained in which he was commenting The name of Marney caught the ear of Egremont who turned rather pale at the sound and hesitated on the threshold The unembarrassed welcome of his friends however re assured him and in a moment he even ventured to enquire the subject of their conversation Morley immediately referring to the newspaper said This is what I have just read EXTRAORDINARY SPORT AT THE EARL OF MARNEY S On Wednesday in a small cover called the Horns near Marney Abbey his grace the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine the Earl of Marney Colonel Rippe and Captain Grouse with only four hours shooting bagged the extraordinary number of seven hundred and thirty head of game namely hares three hundred and thirty nine pheasants two hundred and twenty one partridges thirty four rabbits eighty seven and the following day upwards of fifty hares pheasants c wounded the previous day were picked up Out of the four hours shooting two of the party were absent an hour and a half namely the Earl of Marney and Captain Grouse attending an agricultural meeting in the neighbourhood the noble earl with his usual considerate condescension having kindly consented personally to distribute the various prizes to the labourers whose good conduct entitled them to the distinction What do you think of that Franklin said Morley That is our worthy friend of Marney Abbey where we first met You do not know this part of the country or you would smile at the considerate condescension of the worst landlord in England and who was it seems thus employed the day or so after his battue as they call it And Morley turning the paper read another paragraph At a Petty Sessions holden at the Green Dragon Inn Marney Friday October eighteen thirty seven Magistrates present The Earl of Marney the reverend Felix Flimsey and Captain Grouse Information against Robert Hind for a trespass in pursuit of game in Blackrock Wood the property of Sir Vavasour Firebrace Bart The case was distinctly proved several wires being found in the pocket of the defendant Defendant was fined in the full penalty of forty shillings and costs twenty seven the Bench being of opinion there was no excuse for him Hind being in regular employ as a farm labourer and gaining his seven shillings a week Defendant being unable to pay the penalty was sent for two months to Marham Gaol What a pity said Morley that Robert Hind instead of meditating the snaring of a hare had not been fortunate enough to pick up a maimed one crawling about the fields the day after the battue It would certainly have been better for himself and if he has a wife and family better for the parish Oh said Gerard I doubt not they were all picked up by the poulterer who has the contract even the Normans did not sell their game The question is said Morley would you rather be barbarous or mean that is the alternative presented by the real and the pseudo Norman nobility of England Where I have been lately there is a Bishopsgate Street merchant who has been made for no conceiveable public reason a baron bold Bigod and Bohun could not enforce the forest laws with such severity as this dealer in cotton and indigo It is a difficult question to deal with this affair of the game laws said Egremont how will you reach the evil Would you do away with the offence of trespass And if so what is your protection for property It comes to a simple point though said Morley the Territorialists must at length understand that they cannot at the same time have the profits of a farm and the pleasures of a chase At this moment entered Sybil At the sight of her the remembrance that they were about to part nearly overwhelmed Egremont Her supremacy over his spirit was revealed to him and nothing but the presence of other persons could have prevented him avowing his entire subjection His hand trembled as he touched her s and his eye searching yet agitated would have penetrated her serene soul Gerard and Morley somewhat withdrawn pursued their conversation while Egremont hanging over Sybil attempted to summon courage to express to her his sad adieu It was in vain Alone perhaps he might have poured forth a passionate farewell But constrained he became embarrassed and his conduct was at the same time tender and perplexing He asked and repeated questions which had already been answered His thoughts wandered from their conversation but not from her with whom he should have conversed Once their eyes met and Sybil observed his suffused with tears Once he looked round and caught the glance of Morley instantly withdrawn but not easy to be forgotten Shortly after this and earlier than his wont Morley rose and wished them good night He shook hands with Egremont and bade him farewell with some abruptness Harold who seemed half asleep suddenly sprang from the side of his mistress and gave an agitated bark Harold was never very friendly to Morley who now tried to soothe him but in vain The dog looked fiercely at him and barked again but the moment Morley had disappeared Harold resumed his usual air of proud high bred gentleness and thrust his nose into the hand of Egremont who patted him with fondness The departure of Morley was a great relief to Egremont though the task that was left was still a painful effort He rose and walked for a moment up and down the room commenced an unfinished sentence approached the hearth and leant over the mantel and then at length extending his hand to Gerard he exclaimed in a trembling voice Best of friends I must leave Mowedale I am very sorry said Gerard and when Now said Egremont Now said Sybil Yes this instant My summons is urgent I ought to have left this morning I came here then to bid you farewell he said looking at Sybil to express to you how deeply I was indebted to you for all your goodness how dearly I shall cherish the memory of these happy days the happiest I have ever known and his voice faltered I came also to leave a kind message for you my friend a hope that we might meet again and soon but your daughter was absent and I could not leave Mowedale without seeing either of you So I must contrive to get on through the night Well we lose a very pleasant neighbour said Gerard we shall miss you I doubt not eh Sybil But Sybil had turned away her head she was leaning over and seemed to be caressing Harold and was silent How much Egremont would have liked to have offered or invited correspondence to have proffered his services when the occasion permitted to have said or proposed many things that might have cherished their acquaintance or friendship but embarrassed by his incognito and all its consequent deception he could do nothing but tenderly express his regret at parting and speak vaguely and almost mysteriously of their soon again meeting He held out again his hand to Gerard who shook it heartily then approaching Sybil Egremont said you have shewn me a thousand kindnesses which I cherish he added in a lower tone above all human circumstances Would you deign to let this volume lie upon your table and he offered Sybil an English translation of Thomas a Kempis illustrated by some masterpieces In its first page was written Sybil from a faithful friend I accept it said Sybil with a trembling voice and rather pale in remembrance of a friend She held forth her hand to Egremont who retained it for an instant and then bending very low pressed it to his lips As with an agitated heart he hastily crossed the threshold of the cottage something seemed to hold him back He turned round The bloodhound had seized him by the coat and looked up to him with an expression of affectionate remonstrance against his departure Egremont bent down caressed Harold and released himself from his grasp When Egremont left the cottage he found the country enveloped in a thick white mist so that had it not been for some huge black shadows which he recognized as the crests of trees it would have been very difficult to discriminate the earth from the sky and the mist thickening as he advanced even these fallacious landmarks threatened to disappear He had to walk to Mowbray to catch a night train for London Every moment was valuable but the unexpected and increasing obscurity rendered his progress slow and even perilous The contiguity to the river made every step important He had according to his calculations proceeded nearly as far as his old residence and notwithstanding the careless courage of youth and the annoyance of relinquishing a project intolerable at that season of life was meditating the expediency of renouncing that night the attempt on Mowbray and of gaining his former quarters for shelter He stopped as he had stopped several times before to calculate rather than to observe The mist was so thick that he could not see his own extended hand It was not the first time that it had occurred to him that some one or something was hovering about his course Who is there exclaimed Egremont But no one answered He moved on a little but very slowly He felt assured that his ear caught a contiguous step He repeated his interrogatory in a louder tone but it obtained no response Again he stopped Suddenly he was seized an iron grasp assailed his throat a hand of steel griped his arm The unexpected onset hurried him on The sound of waters assured him that he was approaching the precipitous bank of that part of the river which from a ledge of pointed rocks here formed rapids Vigorous and desperate Egremont plunged like some strong animal on whom a beast of prey had made a fatal spring His feet clung to the earth as if they were held by some magnetic power With his disengaged arm he grappled with his mysterious and unseen foe At this moment he heard the deep bay of a hound Harold he exclaimed The dog invisible sprang forward and seized upon his assailant So violent was the impulse that Egremont staggered and fell but he fell freed from his dark enemy Stunned and exhausted some moments elapsed before he was entirely himself The wind had suddenly changed a violent gust had partially dispelled the mist the outline of the landscape was in many places visible Beneath him were the rapids of the Mowe over which a watery moon threw a faint flickering light Egremont was lying on its precipitous bank and Harold panting was leaning over him and looking in his face and sometimes licking him with that tongue which though not gifted with speech had spoken so seasonably in the moment of danger END OF THE THIRD BOOK BOOK IV Book four Chapter one Are you going down to the house Egerton enquired mister Berners at Brookes of a brother M P about four o clock in the early part of the spring of eighteen thirty nine The moment I have sealed this letter we will walk down together if you like and in a few minutes they left the club Our fellows are in a sort of fright about this Jamaica bill said mister Egerton in an undertone as if he were afraid a passer by might overhear him Don t say anything about it but there s a screw loose The deuce But how do you mean They say the Rads are going to throw us over Talk talk They have threatened this half a dozen times Smoke sir it will end in smoke I hope it may but I know in great confidence mind you that Lord John was saying something about it yesterday That may be I believe our fellows are heartily sick of the business and perhaps would be glad of an excuse to break up the government but we must not have Peel in nothing could prevent a dissolution Their fellows go about and say that Peel would not dissolve if he came in Trust him He has had enough of dissolutions they say Why after all they have not done him much harm Even thirty four was a hit Whoever dissolves said mister Egerton I don t think there will be much of a majority either way in our time We have seen strange things said mister Berners They never would think of breaking up the government without making their peers said mister Egerton The Queen is not over partial to making more peers and when parties are in the present state of equality the Sovereign is no longer a mere pageant They say her Majesty is more touched about these affairs of the Chartists than anything else said mister Egerton They are rather queer but for my part I have no serious fears of a Jacquerie Not if it comes to an outbreak but a passive resistance Jacquerie is altogether a different thing When we see a regular Convention assembled in London and holding its daily meetings in Palace Yard and a general inclination evinced throughout the country to refrain from the consumption of exciseable articles I cannot help thinking that affairs are more serious than you imagine I know the government are all on the qui vive Just the fellows we wanted exclaimed Lord Fitz Heron who was leaning on the arm of Lord Milford and who met mister Egerton and his friend in Pall Mall We want a brace of pairs said Lord Milford Will you two fellows pair I must go down said mister Egerton but I will pair from halfpast seven to eleven I just paired with Ormsby at White s said Berners not half an hour ago We are both going to dine at Eskdale s and so it was arranged Have you any news to day Nothing except that they say that Alfred Mountchesney is going to marry Lady Joan Fitz Warene said Lord Milford She has been given to so many said mister Egerton It is always so with these great heiresses said his companion They never marry They cannot bear the thought of sharing their money I bet Lady Joan will turn out another specimen of the TABITHA CROESUS Well put down our pair Egerton said Lord Fitz Heron You do not dine at Sidonia s by any chance Would that I did You will have the best dishes and the best guests I feed at old Malton s perhaps a tete a tete Scotch broth and to tell him the news There is nothing like being a dutiful nephew particularly when one s uncle is a bachelor and has twenty thousand a year said Lord Milford Au revoir I suppose there will be no division to night No chance Egerton and Berners walked on a little further As they came to the Golden Ball a lady quitting the shop was just about to get into her carriage she stopped as she recognized them It was Lady Firebrace Ah mister Berners how d ye do You were just the person I wanted to see How is Lady Augusta mister Egerton You have no idea mister Berners how I have been fighting your battles Really Lady Firebrace said mister Berners rather uneasy for he had perhaps like most of us a peculiar dislike to being attacked or cheapened You are too good Oh I don t care what a person s politics are exclaimed Lady Firebrace with an air of affectionate devotion I should be very glad indeed to see you one of us You know your father was But if any one is my friend I never will hear him attacked behind his back without fighting his battles and I certainly did fight yours last night Pray tell me where it was Lady Crumbleford Confound Lady Crumbleford said mister Berners indignant but a little relieved No no Lady Crumbleford told Lady Alicia Severn Yes yes said Berners a little pale for he was touched But I cannot stop said Lady Firebrace I must be with Lady saint Julians exactly at a quarter past four and she sprang into her carriage I would sooner meet any woman in London than Lady Firebrace said mister Berners she makes me uneasy for the day she contrives to convince me that the whole world are employed behind my back in abusing or ridiculing me It is her way said Egerton she proves her zeal by showing you that you are odious It is very successful with people of weak nerves Scared at their general unpopularity they seek refuge with the very person who at the same time assures them of their odium and alone believes it unjust She rules that poor old goose Lady Gramshawe who feels that Lady Firebrace makes her life miserable but is convinced that if she break with the torturer she loses her only friend There goes a man who is as much altered as any fellow of our time Not in his looks I was thinking the other night that he was better looking than ever Oh no not in his looks but in his life I was at Christchurch with him and we entered the world about the same time I was rather before him He did everything and did it well And now one never sees him except at the House He goes nowhere and they tell me he is a regular reading man Do you think he looks to office He does not put himself forward He attends and his brother will always be able to get anything for him said Egerton Oh he and Marney never speak they hate each other By Jove However there is his mother with this marriage of hers and Deloraine House she will be their grandest dame She is the only good woman the tories have I think their others do them harm from Lady saint Julians down to your friend Lady Firebrace I wish Lady Deloraine were with us She keeps their men together wonderfully makes her house agreeable and then her manner it certainly is perfect natural and yet refined Lady Mina Blake has an idea that far from looking to office Egremont s heart is faintly with his party and that if it were not for the Marchioness We might gain him eh Hem I hardly know that he has got crotchets about the people I am told What the ballot and household suffrage Gad I believe it is quite a different sort of a thing I do not know what it is exactly but I understand he is crotchetty Well that will not do for Peel He does not like crotchetty men Do you see that Egerton At this moment mister Egerton and his friend were about to step over from Trafalgar square to Charing Cross They observed the carriages of Lady saint Julians and the Marchioness of Deloraine drawn up side by side in the middle of the street and those two eminent stateswomen in earnest conversation Egerton and Berners bowed and smiled but could not hear the brief but not uninteresting words that have nevertheless reached us I give them eleven said Lady saint Julians Well Charles tells me said Lady Deloraine that Sir Thomas says so and he certainly is generally right but it is not Charles own opinion Sir Thomas I know gives them eleven said Lady saint Julians and that would satisfy me and we will say eleven But I have a list here and she slightly elevated her brow and then glanced at Lady Deloraine with a piquant air which proves that they cannot have more than nine but this is in the greatest confidence of course between us there can be no secrets It is mister Tadpole s list nobody has seen it but me not even Sir Robert Lord Grubminster has had a stroke they are concealing it but mister Tadpole has found it out They wanted to pair him off with Colonel Fantomme who they think is dying but mister Tadpole has got a Mesmerist who has done wonders for him and who has guaranteed that he shall vote Well that makes a difference of one And then Sir Henry Churton Oh you know it said Lady saint Julians looking slightly mortified Yes he votes with us Lady Deloraine shook her head I think she said I know the origin of that report Quite a mistake He is in a bad humour has been so the whole session and he was at Lady Alice Fermyne s and did say all sorts of things All that is true But he told Charles this morning on a committee that he should vote with the Government Stupid man exclaimed Lady saint Julians I never could bear him And I have sent his vulgar wife and great staring daughter a card for next Wednesday Well I hope affairs will soon be brought to a crisis for I do not think I can bear much longer this life of perpetual sacrifice added Lady saint Julians a little out of temper both because she had lost a vote and found her friend and rival better informed than herself There is no chance of a division to night said Lady Deloraine That is settled said Lady saint Julians Adieu my dear friend We meet I believe at dinner Plotting said mister Egerton to mister Berners as they passed the great ladies The only consolation one has said Berners is that if they do turn us out Lady Deloraine and Lady saint Julians must quarrel for they both want the same thing Lady Deloraine will have it said Egerton Here they picked up mister Jermyn a young tory M P who perhaps the reader may remember at Mowbray Castle and they walked on together Egerton and Berners trying to pump him as to the expectations of his friends How will Trodgits go said Egerton I think Trodgits will stay away said Jermyn Who do you give that new man to that north country borough fellow what s his name said Berners Blugsby Oh Blugsby dined with Peel said Jermyn Our fellows say dinners are no good said Egerton and they certainly are a cursed bore but you may depend upon it they do for the burgesses We don t dine our men half enough Now Blugsby was just the sort of fellow to be caught by dining with Peel and I dare say they made Peel remember to take wine with him We got Melbourne to give a grand feed the other day to some of our men who want attention they say and he did not take wine with a single guest He forgot I wonder what they are doing at the House Here s Spencer May he will tell us Well what is going on WISHY is up and WASHY follows No division of course Not a chance a regular covey ready on both sides Book four Chapter two On the morning of the same day that mister Egerton and his friend mister Berners walked down together to the House of Commons as appears in our last chapter Egremont had made a visit to his mother who had married since the commencement of this history the Marquis of Deloraine a great noble who had always been her admirer The family had been established by a lawyer and recently in our history The present Lord Deloraine though he was gartered and had been a viceroy was only the grandson of an attorney but one who conscious of his powers had been called to the bar and died an ex chancellor A certain talent was hereditary in the family The attorney s son had been a successful courtier and had planted himself in the cabinet for a quarter of a century It was a maxim in this family to make great alliances so the blood progressively refined and the connections were always distinguished by power and fashion It was a great hit in the second generation of an earldom to convert the coronet into that of a marquis but the son of the old chancellor lived in stirring times and cruised for his object with the same devoted patience with which Lord Anson watched for the galleon It came at last as everything does if men are firm and calm The present marquis through his ancestry and his first wife was allied with the highest houses of the realm and looked their peer He might have been selected as the personification of aristocracy so noble was his appearance so distinguished his manner his bow gained every eye his smile every heart He was also very accomplished and not ill informed had read a little and thought a little and was in every respect a most superior man alike famed for his favour by the fair and the constancy of his homage to the charming Lady Marney Lord Deloraine was not very rich but he was not embarrassed and had the appearance of princely wealth a splendid family mansion with a courtyard a noble country seat with a magnificent park including a quite celebrated lake but with very few farms attached to it He however held a good patent place which had been conferred on his descendants by the old chancellor and this brought in annually some thousands His marriage with Lady Marney was quite an affair of the heart her considerable jointure however did not diminish the lustre of his position It was this impending marriage and the anxiety of Lady Marney to see Egremont s affairs settled before it took place which about a year and a half ago had induced her to summon him so urgently from Mowedale which the reader perhaps may have not forgotten And now Egremont is paying one of his almost daily visits to his mother at Deloraine House A truce to politics my dear Charles said Lady Marney you must be wearied with my inquiries Besides I do not take the sanguine view of affairs in which some of our friends indulge I am one of those who think the pear is not ripe These men will totter on and longer perhaps than even themselves imagine I want to speak of something very different To morrow my dear son is your birth day Now I should grieve were it to pass without your receiving something which showed that its recollection was cherished by your mother But of all silly things in the world the silliest is a present that is not wanted It destroys the sentiment a little perhaps but it enhances the gift if I ask you in the most literal manner to assist me in giving you something that really would please you But how can I my dear mother said Egremont You have ever been so kind and so generous that I literally want nothing Oh you cannot be such a fortunate man as to want nothing Charles said Lady Marney with a smile A dressing case you have your rooms are furnished enough all this is in my way but there are such things as horses and guns of which I know nothing but which men always require You must want a horse or a gun Charles Well I should like you to get either the finest the most valuable that money can purchase Or a brougham Charles what do you think of a new brougham Would you like that Barker should build you a brougham You are too good my dear mother I have horses and guns enough and my present carriage is all I can desire You will not assist me then You are resolved that I shall do something very stupid For to give you something I am determined Well my dear mother said Egremont smiling and looking round give me something that is here Choose then said Lady Marney and she looked round the blue satin walls of her apartment covered with cabinet pictures of exquisite art and then at her tables crowded with precious and fantastic toys It would be plunder my dear mother said Egremont No no you have said it you shall choose something Will you have those vases and she pointed to an almost matchless specimen of old Sevres porcelain They are in too becoming a position to be disturbed said Egremont and would ill suit my quiet chambers where a bronze or a marble is my greatest ornament If you would permit me I would rather choose a picture Then select one at once said Lady Marney I make no reservation except that Watteau for it was given me by your father before we were married Shall it be this Cuyp I would rather choose this said Egremont and he pointed to the portrait of a saint by Allori the face of a beautiful young girl radiant and yet solemn with rich tresses of golden brown hair and large eyes dark as night fringed with ebon lashes that hung upon the glowing cheek Ah you choose that Well that was a great favourite of poor Sir Thomas Lawrence But for my part I have never seen any one in the least like it and I think I am sure that you have not It reminds me said Egremont musingly Of what you have dreamed said Lady Marney Perhaps so said Egremont indeed I think it must have been a dream Well the vision shall still hover before you said his mother and you shall find this portrait to morrow over your chimney in the Albany Book four Chapter three Strangers must withdraw Division clear the gallery Withdraw Nonsense no it s quite ridiculous quite absurd Some fellow must get up Send to the Carlton send to the Reform send to Brookes s Are your men ready No are your s I am sure I can t say What does it mean Most absurd Are there many fellows in the library The smoking room is quite full All our men are paired till half past eleven It wants five minutes to the halfhour What do you think of Trenchard s speech I don t care for ourselves I am sorry for him Well that is very charitable Withdraw withdraw you must withdraw Where are you going Fitztheron said a Conservative whipling I must go I am paired till half past eleven and it wants some minutes and my man is not here Confound it How will it go Gad I don t know Fishy eh Deuced said the under whip in an under tone pale and speaking behind his teeth The division bell was still ringing peers and diplomatists and strangers were turned out members came rushing in from library and smoking room some desperate cabs just arrived in time to land their passengers in the waiting room The doors were locked The mysteries of the Lobby are only for the initiated Three quarters of an hour after the division was called the result was known to the exoteric world Majority for Ministers thirty seven Never had the opposition made such a bad division and this too on their trial of strength for the session Everything went wrong Lord Milford was away without a pair mister Ormsby who had paired with mister Berners never came and let his man poll for which he was infinitely accursed particularly by the expectant twelve hundred a yearers but not wanting anything himself and having an income of forty thousand pounds paid quarterly mister Ormsby bore their reported indignation like a lamb There were several other similar or analogous mischances the whigs contrived to poll Lord Grubminster in a wheeled chair he was unconscious but had heard as much of the debate as a good many Colonel Fantomme on the other hand could not come to time the mesmerist had thrown him into a trance from which it was fated he should never awake but the crash of the night was a speech made against the opposition by one of their own men mister Trenchard who voted with the government The rest may be accounted for said Lady saint Julians to Lady Deloraine the morning after it is simply vexatious it was a surprise and will be a lesson but this affair of this mister Trenchard and they tell me that William Loraine was absolutely cheering him the whole time what does it mean Do you know the man I have heard Charles speak of him and I think much in his favour said Lady Deloraine if he were here he would tell us more about it I wonder he does not come he never misses looking in after a great division and giving me all the news Do you know my dear friend said Lady saint Julians with an air of some solemnity I am half meditating a great stroke This is not a time for trifling It is all very well for these people to boast of their division of last night but it was a surprise and as great to them as to us I know there is dissension in the camp ever since that Finality speech of Lord John there has been a smouldering sedition mister Tadpole knows all about it he has liaisons with the frondeurs This affair of Trenchard may do us the greatest possible injury When it comes to a fair fight the government have not more than twelve or so If this mister Trenchard and three or four others choose to make themselves of importance you see The danger is imminent it must be met with decision And what do you propose doing Has he a wife I really do not know I wish Charles would come perhaps he could tell us I have no doubt he has said Lady saint Julians One would have met him somehow or other in the course of two years if he had not been married Well married or unmarried with his wife or without his wife I shall send him a card for Wednesday And Lady saint Julians paused overwhelmed as it were by the commensurate vastness of her idea and her sacrifice Do not you think it would be rather sudden said Lady Deloraine What does that signify He will understand it he will have gained his object and all will be right But are you sure it is his object We do not know the man What else can be his object said Lady saint Julians People get into Parliament to get on their aims are indefinite If they have indulged in hallucinations about place before they enter the House they are soon freed from such distempered fancies they find they have no more talent than other people and if they had they learn that power patronage and pay are reserved for us and our friends Well then like practical men they look to some result and they get it They are asked out to dinner more than they would be they move rigmarole resolutions at nonsensical public meetings and they get invited with their women to assemblies at their leader s where they see stars and blue ribbons and above all us whom they little think in appearing on such occasions make the greatest conceivable sacrifice Well then of course such people are entirely in one s power if one only had time and inclination to notice them You can do anything with them Ask them to a ball and they will give you their votes invite them to dinner and if necessary they will rescind them but cultivate them remember their wives at assemblies and call their daughters if possible by their right names and they will not only change their principles or desert their party for you but subscribe their fortunes if necessary and lay down their lives in your service You paint them to the life my dear Lady saint Julians said Lady Deloraine laughing but with such knowledge and such powers why did you not save our boroughs We had lost our heads then I must confess said Lady saint Julians What with the dear King and the dear Duke we really had brought ourselves to believe that we lived in the days of Versailles or nearly and I must admit I think we had become a little too exclusive Out of the cottage circle there was really no world and after all we were lost not by insulting the people but by snubbing the aristocracy The servant announced Lady Firebrace Oh my dear Lady Deloraine Oh my dear Lady saint Julians and she shook her head You have no news I suppose said Lady saint Julians Only about that dreadful mister Trenchard you know the reason why he ratted No indeed said Lady saint Julians with a sigh An invitation to Lansdowne House for himself and his wife Oh he is married then Yes she is at the bottom of it all Terms regularly settled beforehand I have a note here all the facts And Lady Firebrace twirled in her hand a bulletin from mister Tadpole Lansdowne House is destined to cross me said Lady saint Julians with bitterness Well it is very provoking said Lady Deloraine when you had made up your mind to ask them for Wednesday Yes that alone is a sacrifice said Lady saint Julians Talking over the division I suppose said Egremont as he entered Ah mister Egremont said Lady saint Julians What a hachis you made of it Lady Firebrace shook her head as it were reproachfully Charles said Lady Deloraine we were talking of this mister Trenchard Did I not once hear you say you knew something of him Why he is one of my intimate acquaintance Heavens what a man for a friend said Lady saint Julians Heavens echoed Lady Firebrace raising her hands And why did you not present him to me Charles said Lady Deloraine I did at Lady Peel s And why did you not ask him here I did several times but he would not come He is going to Lansdowne House though said Lady Firebrace I suppose you wrote the leading article in the Standard which I have just read said Egremont smiling It announces in large type the secret reasons of mister Trenchard s vote It is a fact said Lady Firebrace That Trenchard is going to Lansdowne House to night very likely I have met him at Lansdowne House half a dozen times He is very intimate with the family and lives in the same county But his wife said Lady Firebrace that s the point he never could get his wife there before He has none said Egremont very quietly Then we may regain him said Lady saint Julians with energy You shall make a little dinner to Greenwich mister Egremont and I will sit next to him Fortunate Trenchard said Egremont But do you know I fear he is hardly worthy of his lot He has a horror of fine ladies and there is nothing in the world he more avoids than what you call society At home as this morning when I breakfasted with him or in a circle of his intimates he is the best company in the world no one so well informed fuller of rich humour and more sincerely amiable He is popular with all who know him except Taper Lady saint Julians and Tadpole Lady Firebrace Well I think I will ask him still for Wednesday said Lady saint Julians and I will write him a little note If society is not his object what is Ay said Egremont there is a great question for you and Lady Firebrace to ponder over This is a lesson for you fine ladies who think you can govern the world by what you call your social influences asking people once or twice a year to an inconvenient crowd in your house now haughtily smirking and now impertinently staring at them and flattering yourselves all this time that to have the occasional privilege of entering your saloons and the periodical experience of your insolent recognition is to be a reward for great exertions or if necessary an inducement to infamous tergiversation Book four Chapter four It was night clear and serene though the moon had not risen and a vast concourse of persons were assembling on Mowbray Moor The chief gathering collected in the vicinity of some huge rocks one of which pre eminent above its fellows and having a broad flat head on which some twenty persons might easily stand at the same time was called the Druid s Altar The ground about was strewn with stony fragments covered tonight with human beings who found a convenient resting place amid these ruins of some ancient temple or relics of some ancient world The shadowy concourse increased the dim circle of the nocturnal assemblage each moment spread and widened there was the hum and stir of many thousands Suddenly in the distance the sound of martial music and instantly quick as the lightning and far more wild each person present brandished a flaming torch amid a chorus of cheers that renewed and resounding floated far away over the broad bosom of the dusk wilderness The music and the banners denoted the arrival of the leaders of the people They mounted the craggy ascent that led to the summit of the Druid s Altar and there surrounded by his companions amid the enthusiastic shouts of the multitude Walter Gerard came forth to address a TORCH LIGHT MEETING His tall form seemed colossal in the uncertain and flickering light his rich and powerful voice reached almost to the utmost limit of his vast audience now still with expectation and silent with excitement Their fixed and eager glance the mouth compressed with fierce resolution or distended by novel sympathy as they listened to the exposition of their wrongs and the vindication of the sacred rights of labour the shouts and waving of the torches as some bright or bold phrase touched them to the quick the cause the hour the scene all combined to render the assemblage in a high degree exciting I wonder if Warner will speak to night said Dandy Mick to Devilsdust He can t pitch it in like Gerard replied his companion But he is a trump in the tender said the Dandy The Handlooms looks to him as their man and that s a powerful section If you come to the depth of a question there s nothing like Stephen Morley said Devilsdust Twould take six clergymen any day to settle him He knows the principles of society by heart But Gerard gets hold of the passions And that s the way to do the trick said Dandy Mick I wish he would say march and no mistake There is a great deal to do before saying that said Devilsdust We must have discussion because when it comes to reasoning the oligarchs have not got a leg to stand on and we must stop the consumption of exciseable articles and when they have no tin to pay the bayonets and their b y police they are dished You have a long head Dusty said Mick Why I have been thinking of it ever since I knew two and two made four said his friend I was not ten years old when I said to myself It s a pretty go this that I should be toiling in a shoddy hole to pay the taxes for a gentleman what drinks his port wine and stretches his legs on a Turkey carpet Hear hear he suddenly exclaimed as Gerard threw off a stinging sentence Ah that s the man for the people You will see Mick whatever happens Gerard is the man who will always lead Gerard had ceased amid enthusiastic plaudits and Warner that hand loom weaver whom the reader may recollect and who had since become a popular leader and one of the principal followers of Gerard had also addressed the multitude They had cheered and shouted and voted resolutions and the business of the night was over Now they were enjoined to disperse in order and depart in peace The band sounded a triumphant retreat the leaders had descended from the Druid s Altar the multitude were melting away bearing back to the town their high resolves and panting thoughts and echoing in many quarters the suggestive appeals of those who had addressed them Dandy Mick and Devilsdust departed together the business of their night had not yet commenced and it was an important one They took their way to that suburb whither Gerard and Morley repaired the evening of their return from Marney Abbey but it was not on this occasion to pay a visit to Chaffing Jack and his brilliant saloon Winding through many obscure lanes Mick and his friend at length turned into a passage which ended in a square court of a not inconsiderable size and which was surrounded by high buildings that had the appearance of warehouses Entering one of these and taking up a dim lamp that was placed on the stone of an empty hearth Devilsdust led his friend through several unoccupied and unfurnished rooms until he came to one in which there were some signs of occupation Now Mick said he in a very earnest almost solemn tone are you firm All right my hearty replied his friend though not without some affectation of ease There is a good deal to go through said Devilsdust It tries a man You don t mean that But if you are firm all s right Now I must leave you No no Dusty said Mick I must go said Devilsdust and you must rest here till you are sent for Now mind whatever is bid you obey and whatever you see be quiet There and Devilsdust taking a flask out of his pocket held it forth to his friend give a good pull man I can t leave it you for though your heart must be warm your head must be cool and so saying he vanished Notwithstanding the animating draught the heart of Mick Radley trembled There are some moments when the nervous system defies even brandy Mick was on the eve of a great and solemn incident round which for years his imagination had gathered and brooded Often in that imagination he had conceived the scene and successfully confronted its perils or its trials Often had the occasion been the drama of many a triumphant reverie but the stern presence of reality had dispelled all his fancy and all his courage He recalled the warning of Julia who had often dissuaded him from the impending step that warning received with so much scorn and treated with so much levity He began to think that women were always right that Devilsdust was after all a dangerous counsellor he even meditated over the possibility of a retreat He looked around him the glimmering lamp scarcely indicated the outline of the obscure chamber It was lofty nor in the obscurity was it possible for the eye to reach the ceiling which several huge beams seemed to cross transversally looming in the darkness There was apparently no windows and the door by which they had entered was not easily to be recognised Mick had just taken up the lamp and was surveying his position when a slight noise startled him and looking round he beheld at some little distance two forms which he hoped were human Enveloped in dark cloaks and wearing black masks a conical cap of the same colour adding to their considerable height each held a torch They stood in silence two awful sentries Their appearance appalled their stillness terrified Mick he remained with his mouth open and the lamp in his extended arm At length unable any longer to sustain the solemn mystery and plucking up his natural audacity he exclaimed I say what do you want All was silent Come come said Mick much alarmed none of this sort of thing I say you must speak though The figures advanced they stuck their torches in a niche that was by and then they placed each of them a hand on the shoulder of Mick No no none of that said Mick trying to disembarrass himself But notwithstanding this fresh appeal one of the silent masks pinioned his arms and in a moment the eyes of the helpless friend of Devilsdust were bandaged Conducted by these guides it seemed to Mick that he was traversing interminable rooms or rather galleries for once stretching out his arm while one of his supporters had momentarily quitted him to open some gate or door Mick touched a wall At length one of the masks spoke and said In five minutes you will be in the presence of the SEVEN prepare At this moment rose the sound of distant voices singing in concert and gradually increasing in volume as Mick and the masks advanced One of these attendants now notifying to their charge that he must kneel down Mick found he rested on a cushion while at the same time his arms still pinioned he seemed to be left alone The voices became louder and louder Mick could distinguish the words and burthen of the hymn he was sensible that many persons were entering the apartment he could distinguish the measured tread of some solemn procession Round the chamber more than once they moved with slow and awful step Suddenly that movement ceased there was a pause of a few minutes at length a voice spoke I denounce John Briars Why said another He offers to take nothing but piece work the man who does piece work is guilty of less defensible conduct than a drunkard The worst passions of our nature are enlisted in support of piece work Avarice meanness cunning hypocrisy all excite and feed upon the miserable votary who works by the task and not by the hour A man who earns by piece work forty shillings per week the usual wages for day work being twenty robs his fellows of a week s employment therefore I denounce John Briars Let it go forth said the other voice John Briars is denounced If he receive another week s wages by the piece he shall not have the option of working the week after for time No eighty seven see to John Briars I denounce Claughton and Hicks said another voice Why They have removed Gregory Ray from being a superintendent because he belonged to this lodge Brethren is it your pleasure that there shall be a turn out for ten days at Claughton and Hicks It is our pleasure cried several voices No thirty four give orders to morrow that the works at Claughton and Hicks stop till further orders Brethren said another voice I propose the expulsion from this Union of any member who shall be known to boast of his superior ability as to either the quantity or quality of work he can do either in public or private company Is it your pleasure It is our pleasure Brethren said a voice that seemed a presiding one before we proceed to the receipt of the revenue from the different districts of this lodge there is I am informed a stranger present who prays to be admitted into our fraternity Are all robed in the mystic robe Are all masked in the secret mask All Then let us pray And thereupon after a movement which intimated that all present were kneeling the presiding voice offered up an extemporary prayer of great power and even eloquence This was succeeded by the Hymn of Labour and at its conclusion the arms of the neophyte were unpinioned and then his eyes were unbandaged Mick found himself in a lofty and spacious room lighted with many tapers Its walls were hung with black cloth at a table covered with the same material were seated seven persons in surplices and masked the president on a loftier seat above which on a pedestal was a skeleton complete On each side of the skeleton was a man robed and masked holding a drawn sword and on each of Mick was a man in the same garb holding a battle axe On the table was the sacred volume open and at a distance ranged in order on each side of the room was a row of persons in white robes and white masks and holding torches Michael Radley said the President Do you voluntarily swear in the presence of Almighty God and before these witnesses that you will execute with zeal and alacrity as far as in you lies every task and injunction that the majority of your brethren testified by the mandate of this grand committee shall impose upon you in futherance of our common welfare of which they are the sole judges such as the chastisement of Nobs the assassination of oppressive and tyrannical masters or the demolition of all mills works and shops that shall be deemed by us incorrigible Do you swear this in the presence of Almighty God and before these witnesses I do swear it replied a tremulous voice Then rise and kiss that book Mick slowly rose from his kneeling position advanced with a trembling step and bending embraced with reverence the open volume Immediately every one unmasked Devilsdust came forward and taking Mick by the hand led him to the President who received him pronouncing some mystic rhymes He was covered with a robe and presented with a torch and then ranged in order with his companions Thus terminated the initiation of Dandy Mick into a TRADES UNION Book four Chapter five His lordship has not yet rung his bell gentlemen It was the valet of Lord Milford that spoke addressing from the door of a house in Belgrave Square about noon a deputation from the National Convention consisting of two of its delegates who waited on the young viscount in common with other members of the legislature in order to call his particular attention to the National Petition which the Convention had prepared and which in the course of the session was to be presented by one of the members for Birmingham I fear we are too early for these fine birds said one delegate to the other Who is next on our list No twenty seven Street close by mister THOROUGH BASE he ought to be with the people for his father was only a fiddler but I understand he is quite an aristocrat and has married a widow of quality Well knock mister Thorough Base was not at home had received the card of the delegates apprising him of the honour of their intended visit but had made up his mind on the subject No eighteen in the same street received them more courteously Here resided mister KREMLIN who after listening with patience if not with interest to their statement apprised them that forms of government were of no consequence and domestic policy of no interest that there was only one subject which should engage the attention of public men because everything depended on it that was our external system and that the only specific for a revival of trade and the contentment of the people was a general settlement of the boundary questions Finally mister Kremlin urged upon the National Convention to recast their petition with this view assuring them that on foreign policy they would have the public with them The deputation in reply might have referred as an evidence of the general interest excited by questions of foreign policy to the impossibility even of a leader making a house on one and to the fact that there are not three men in the House of Commons who even pretend to have any acquaintance with the external circumstances of the country they might have added that even in such an assembly mister Kremlin himself was distinguished for ignorance for he had only one idea and that was wrong Their next visit was to WRIGGLE a member for a metropolitan district a disciple of Progress who went with the times but who took particular good care to ascertain their complexion and whose movements if expedient could partake of a regressive character As the Charter might some day turn up trumps as well as so many other unexpected cards and colours Wriggle gave his adhesion to it but of course only provisionally provided that is to say he might vote against it at present But he saw no harm in it not he and should be prepared to support it when circumstances that is to say the temper of the times would permit him More could hardly be expected from a gentleman in the delicate position in which Wriggle found himself at this moment for he had solicited a baronetcy of the whigs and had secretly pledged himself to Taper to vote against them on the impending Jamaica division BOMBASTES RIP snubbed them which was hard for he had been one of themselves had written confidential letters in eighteen thirty one to the secretary of the Treasury and provided his expenses were paid offered to come up from the manufacturing town he now represented at the head of a hundred thousand men and burn down Apsley House But now Bombastes Rip talked of the great middle class of public order and public credit He would have said more to them but had an appointment in the city being a most active member of the committee for raising a statue to the Duke of Wellington FLOATWELL received them in the politest manner though he did not agree with them What he did agree with was difficult to say Clever brisk and bustling with an university reputation and without patrimony Floatwell shrunk from the toils of a profession and in the hurry skurry of reform found himself to his astonishment a parliament man There he had remained but why the Fates alone knew The fun of such a thing must have evaporated with the novelty Floatwell had entered public life in complete ignorance of every subject which could possibly engage the attention of a public man He knew nothing of history national or constitutional law had indeed none but puerile acquirements and had seen nothing of life Assiduous at committees he gained those superficial habits of business which are competent to the conduct of ordinary affairs and picked up in time some of the slang of economical questions Floatwell began at once with a little success and he kept his little success nobody envied him it he hoarded his sixpences without exciting any evil emulation He was one of those characters who above all things shrink from isolation and who imagine they are getting on if they are keeping company with some who stick like themselves He was always an idolater of some great personage who was on the shelf and who he was convinced because the great personage assured him of it after dinner would sooner or later turn out the man At present Floatwell swore by Lord Dunderhead and the game of this little coterie who dined together and thought they were a party was to be courteous to the Convention After the endurance of an almost interminable lecture on the currency from mister KITE who would pledge himself to the charter if the charter would pledge itself to one pound notes the two delegates had arrived in Piccadilly and the next member upon their list was Lord Valentine It is two o clock said one of the delegates I think we may venture so they knocked at the portal of the court yard and found they were awaited A private staircase led to the suite of rooms of Lord Valentine who lived in the family mansion The delegates were ushered through an ante chamber into a saloon which opened into a very fanciful conservatory where amid tall tropical plants played a fountain The saloon was hung with blue satin and adorned with brilliant mirrors its coved ceiling was richly painted and its furniture became the rest of its decorations On one sofa were a number of portfolios some open full of drawings of costumes a table of pietra dura was covered with richly bound volumes that appeared to have been recently referred to several ancient swords of extreme beauty were lying on a couch in a corner of the room was a figure in complete armour black and gold richly inlaid and grasping in its gauntlet the ancient standard of England The two delegates of the National Convention stared at each other as if to express their surprise that a dweller in such an abode should ever have permitted them to enter it but ere either of them could venture to speak Lord Valentine made his appearance He was a young man above the middle height slender broad shouldered small waisted of a graceful presence he was very fair with dark blue eyes bright and intelligent and features of classic precision a small Greek cap crowned his long light brown hair and he was enveloped in a morning robe of Indian shawls Well gentlemen said his lordship as he invited them to be seated in a clear and cheerful voice and with an unaffected tone of frankness which put his guests at their ease I promised to see you well what have you got to say The delegates made their accustomed statement they wished to pledge no one all that the people desired was a respectful discussion of their claims the national petition signed by nearly a million and a half of the flower of the working classes was shortly to be presented to the House of Commons praying the House to take into consideration the five points in which the working classes deemed their best interests involved to wit universal suffrage vote by ballot annual parliaments salaried members and the abolition of the property qualification And supposing these five points conceded said Lord Valentine what do you mean to do The people then being at length really represented replied one of the delegates they would decide upon the measures which the interests of the great majority require I am not so clear about that said Lord Valentine that is the very point at issue I do not think the great majority are the best judges of their own interests At all events gentlemen the respective advantages of aristocracy and democracy are a moot point Well then finding the question practically settled in this country you will excuse me for not wishing to agitate it I give you complete credit for the sincerity of your convictions extend the same confidence to me You are democrats I am an aristocrat My family has been ennobled for nearly three centuries they bore a knightly name before their elevation They have mainly and materially assisted in making England what it is They have shed their blood in many battles I have had two ancestors killed in the command of our fleets You will not underrate such services even if you do not appreciate their conduct as statesmen though that has often been laborious and sometimes distinguished The finest trees in England were planted by my family they raised several of your most beautiful churches they have built bridges made roads dug mines and constructed canals and drained a marsh of a million of acres which bears our name to this day and is now one of the most flourishing portions of the country You talk of our taxation and our wars and of your inventions and your industry Our wars converted an island into an empire and at any rate developed that industry and stimulated those inventions of which you boast You tell me that you are the delegates of the unrepresented working classes of Mowbray Why what would Mowbray have been if it had not been for your aristocracy and their wars Your town would not have existed there would have been no working classes there to send up delegates In fact you owe your every existence to us I have told you what my ancestors have done I am prepared if the occasion requires it not to disgrace them I have inherited their great position and I tell you fairly gentlemen I will not relinquish it without a struggle Will you combat the people in that suit of armour my lord said one of the delegates smiling but in a tone of kindness and respect That suit of armour has combated for the people before this said Lord Valentine for it stood by Simon de Montfort on the field of Evesham My lord said the other delegate it is well known that you come from a great and honoured race and we have seen enough to day to show that in intelligence and spirit you are not unworthy of your ancestry But the great question which your lordship has introduced not us is not to be decided by a happy instance Your ancestors may have done great things What wonder They were members of a very limited class which had the monopoly of action And the people have not they shed their blood in battle though they may have commanded fleets less often than your lordship s relatives And these mines and canals that you have excavated and constructed these woods you have planted these waters you have drained had the people no hand in these creations What share in these great works had that faculty of Labour whose sacred claims we now urge but which for centuries have been passed over in contemptuous silence No my lord we call upon you to decide this question by the result The Aristocracy of England have had for three centuries the exercise of power for the last century and a half that exercise has been uncontrolled they form at this moment the most prosperous class that the history of the world can furnish as rich as the Roman senators with sources of convenience and enjoyment which modern science could alone supply All this is not denied Your order stands before Europe the most gorgeous of existing spectacles though you have of late years dexterously thrown some of the odium of your polity upon that middle class which you despise and who are despicable only because they imitate you your tenure of power is not in reality impaired You govern us still with absolute authority and you govern the most miserable people on the face of the globe And is this a fair description of the people of England said Lord Valentine A flash of rhetoric I presume that would place them lower than the Portuguese or the Poles the serfs of Russia or the Lazzaroni of Naples Infinitely lower said the delegate for they are not only degraded but conscious of their degradation They no longer believe in any innate difference between the governing and the governed classes of this country They are sufficiently enlightened to feel they are victims Compared with the privileged classes of their own land they are in a lower state than any other population compared with its privileged classes All is relative my lord and believe me the relations of the working classes of England to its privileged orders are relations of enmity and therefore of peril The people must have leaders said Lord Valentine And they have found them said the delegate When it comes to a push they will follow their nobility said Lord Valentine Will their nobility lead them said the other delegate For my part I do not pretend to be a philosopher and if I saw a Simon de Montfort again I should be content to fight under his banner We have an aristocracy of wealth said the delegate who had chiefly spoken In a progressive civilization wealth is the only means of class distinction but a new disposition of wealth may remove even this Ah you want to get at our estates said Lord Valentine smiling but the effort on your part may resolve society into its original elements and the old sources of distinction may again develope themselves Tall barons will not stand against Paixhans rockets said the delegate Modern science has vindicated the natural equality of man And I must say I am very sorry for it said the other delegate for human strength always seems to me the natural process of settling affairs I am not surprised at your opinion said Lord Valentine turning to the delegate and smiling I should not be over glad to meet you in a fray You stand some inches above six feet or I am mistaken I was six feet two inches when I stopped growing said the delegate and age has not stolen any of my height yet That suit of armour would fit you said Lord Valentine as they all rose And might I ask your lordship said the tall delegate why it is here I am to represent Richard Coeur de Lion at the Queen s ball said Lord Valentine and before my sovereign I will not don a Drury Lane cuirass so I got this up from my father s castle Ah I almost wish the good old times of Coeur de Lion were here again said the tall delegate And we should be serfs said his companion I am not sure of that said the tall delegate At any rate there was the free forest I like that young fellow said the tall delegate to his companion as they descended the staircase He has awful prejudices said his friend Well well he has his opinions and we have ours But he is a man with clear straightforward ideas a frank noble presence and as good looking a fellow as I ever set eyes on Where are we now We have only one more name on our list to day and it is at hand Letter K No one Albany Another member of the aristocracy the Honourable Charles Egremont Well I prefer them as far as I can judge to Wriggle and Rip and Thorough Base said the tall delegate laughing I dare say we should have found Lord Milford a very jolly fellow if he had only been up Here we are said his companion as he knocked mister Egremont is he at home The gentlemen of the deputation Yes my master gave particular orders that he was at home to you Will you walk in gentlemen There you see said the tall delegate This would be a lesson to Thorough Base They sat down in an antechamber the servant opened a mahogany folding door which he shut after him and announced to his master the arrival of the delegates Egremont was seated in his library at a round table covered with writing materials books and letters On another table were arranged his parliamentary papers and piles of blue books The room was classically furnished On the mantelpiece were some ancient vases which he had brought with him from Italy standing on each side of that picture of Allori of which we have spoken The servant returned to the ante room and announcing to the delegates that his master was ready to receive them ushered into the presence of Egremont WALTER GERARD and STEPHEN MORLEY Book four Chapter six It is much to be deplored that our sacred buildings are generally closed except at the stated periods of public resort It is still more to be regretted that when with difficulty entered there is so much in their arrangements to offend the taste and outrage the feelings In the tumult of life a few minutes occasionally passed in the solemn shadow of some lofty and ancient aisle exercise very often a salutary influence they purify the heart and elevate the mind dispel many haunting fancies and prevent many an act which otherwise might be repented The church would in this light still afford us a sanctuary not against the power of the law but against the violence of our own will not against the passions of man but against our own The Abbey of Westminster rises amid the strife of factions Around its consecrated precinct some of the boldest and some of the worst deeds have been achieved or perpetrated sacrilege rapine murder and treason Here robbery has been practised on the greatest scale known in modern ages here ten thousand manors belonging to the order of the Templars without any proof scarcely with a pretext were forfeited in one day and divided among the monarch and his chief nobles here the great estate of the church which whatever its articles of faith belonged and still belongs to the people was seized at various times under various pretences by an assembly that continually changed the religion of their country and their own by a parliamentary majority but which never refunded the booty Here too was brought forth that monstrous conception which even patrician Rome in its most ruthless period never equalled the mortgaging of the industry of the country to enrich and to protect property an act which is now bringing its retributive consequences in a degraded and alienated population Here too have the innocent been impeached and hunted to death and a virtuous and able monarch martyred because among other benefits projected for his people he was of opinion that it was more for their advantage that the economic service of the state should be supplied by direct taxation levied by an individual known to all than by indirect taxation raised by an irresponsible and fluctuating assembly But thanks to parliamentary patriotism the people of England were saved from ship money which money the wealthy paid and only got in its stead the customs and excise which the poor mainly supply Rightly was King Charles surnamed the Martyr for he was the holocaust of direct taxation Never yet did man lay down his heroic life for so great a cause the cause of the Church and the cause of the Poor Even now in the quiet times in which we live when public robbery is out of fashion and takes the milder title of a commission of inquiry and when there is no treason except voting against a Minister who though he may have changed all the policy which you have been elected to support expects your vote and confidence all the same even in this age of mean passions and petty risks it is something to step aside from Palace Yard and instead of listening to a dull debate where the facts are only a repetition of the blue books you have already read and the fancy an ingenious appeal to the recrimination of Hansard to enter the old abbey and listen to an anthem This was a favourite habit of Egremont and though the mean discipline and sordid arrangements of the ecclesiastical body to which the guardianship of the beautiful edifice is intrusted have certainly done all that could injure and impair the holy genius of the place it still was a habit often full of charm and consolation There is not perhaps another metropolitan population in the world that would tolerate such conduct as is pursued to that great lubber the public by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster and submit in silence to be shut out from the only building in the two cities which is worthy of the name of a cathedral But the British public will bear anything they are so busy in speculating in railroad shares When Egremont had entered on his first visit to the Abbey by the south transept and beheld the boards and the spikes with which he seemed to be environed as if the Abbey were in a state of siege iron gates shutting him out from the solemn nave and the shadowy aisles scarcely a glimpse to be caught of a single window while on a dirty form some noisy vergers sate like ticket porters or babbled like tapsters at their ease the visions of abbatial perfection in which he had early and often indulged among the ruins of Marney rose on his outraged sense and he was then about hastily to retire from the scene he had so long purposed to visit when suddenly the organ burst forth a celestial symphony floated in the lofty roof and voices of plaintive melody blended with the swelling sounds He was fixed to the spot Perhaps it was some similar feeling that influenced another individual on the day after the visit of the deputation to Egremont The sun though in his summer heaven he had still a long course had passed his meridian by many hours the service was performing in the choir and a few persons entering by the door into that part of the Abbey Church which is so well known by the name of Poet s Corner proceeded through the unseemly stockade which the chapter have erected and took their seats One only a female declined to pass notwithstanding the officious admonitions of the vergers that she had better move on but approaching the iron grating that shut her out from the body of the church looked wistfully down the long dim perspective of the beautiful southern aisle And thus motionless she remained in contemplation or it might be prayer while the solemn peals of the organ and the sweet voices of the choir enjoyed that holy liberty for which she sighed and seemed to wander at their will in every sacred recess and consecrated corner The sounds those mystical and thrilling sounds that at once elevate the soul and touch the heart ceased the chaunting of the service recommenced the motionless form moved and as she moved Egremont came forth from the choir and his eye was at once caught by the symmetry of her shape and the picturesque position which she gracefully occupied still gazing through that grate while the light pouring through the western window suffused the body of the church with a soft radiance just touching the head of the unknown with a kind of halo Egremont approached the transept door with a lingering pace so that the stranger who he observed was preparing to leave the church might overtake him As he reached the door anxious to assure himself that he was not mistaken he turned round and his eye at once caught the face of Sybil He started he trembled she was not two yards distant she evidently recognised him he held open the swinging postern of the Abbey that she might pass which she did and then stopped on the outside and said mister Franklin It was therefore clear that her father had not thought fit or had not yet had an opportunity to communicate to Sybil the interview of yesterday Egremont was still mister Franklin This was perplexing Egremont would like to have been saved the pain and awkwardness of the avowal yet it must be made though not with unnecessary crudeness And so at present he only expressed his delight the unexpected delight he experienced at their meeting And then he walked on by her side Indeed said Sybil I can easily imagine you must have been surprised at seeing me in this great city But many things strange and unforeseen have happened to us since you were at Mowedale You know of course you with your pursuits must know that the People have at length resolved to summon their own parliament in Westminster The people of Mowbray had to send up two delegates to the Convention and they chose my father for one of them For so great is their confidence in him none other would content them He must have made a great sacrifice in coming said Egremont Oh what are sacrifices in such a cause said Sybil Yes he made great sacrifices she continued earnestly great sacrifices and I am proud of them Our home which was a happy home is gone he has quitted the Traffords to whom we were knit by many many ties and her voice faltered and for whom I know well he would have perilled his life And now we are parted said Sybil with a sigh perhaps for ever They offered to receive me under their roof she continued with emotion Had I needed shelter there was another roof which has long awaited me but I could not leave my father at such a moment He appealed to me and I am here All I desire all I live for is to soothe and support him in his great struggle and I should die content if the People were only free and a Gerard had freed them Egremont mused he must disclose all yet how embarrassing to enter into such explanations in a public thoroughfare Should he bid her after a while farewell and then make his confession in writing Should he at once accompany her home and there offer his perplexing explanations Or should he acknowledge his interview of yesterday with Gerard and then leave the rest to the natural consequences of that acknowledgment when Sybil met her father Thus pondering Egremont and Sybil quitting the court of the Abbey entered Abingdon Street Let me walk home with you said Egremont as Sybil seemed to intimate her intention here to separate My father is not there said Sybil but I will not fail to tell him that I have met his old companion Would he had been as frank thought Egremont And must he quit her in this way Never You must indeed let me attend you he said aloud It is not far said Sybil We live almost in the Precinct in an old house with some kind old people the brother of one of the nuns of Mowbray The nearest way to it is straight along this street but that is too bustling for me I have discovered she added with a smile a more tranquil path And guided by her they turned up College Street And how long have you been in London A fortnight Tis a great prison How strange it is that in a vast city like this one can scarcely walk alone You want Harold said Egremont How is that most faithful of friends Poor Harold To part with him too was a pang I fear your hours must be heavy said Egremont Oh no said Sybil there is so much at stake so much to hear the moment my father returns I take so much interest too in their discussions and sometimes I go to hear him speak None of them can compare with him It seems to me that it would be impossible to resist our claims if our rulers only heard them from his lips Egremont smiled Your Convention is in its bloom or rather its bud he said all is fresh and pure now but a little while and it will find the fate of all popular assemblies You will have factions But why said Sybil They are the real representatives of the people and all that the people want is justice that Labour should be as much respected by law and society as Property While they thus conversed they passed through several clean still streets that had rather the appearance of streets in a very quiet country town than of abodes in the greatest city in the world and in the vicinity of palaces and parliaments Rarely was a shop to be remarked among the neat little tenements many of them built of curious old brick and all of them raised without any regard to symmetry or proportion Not the sound of a single wheel was heard sometimes not a single individual was visible or stirring Making a circuitous course through this tranquil and orderly district they at last found themselves in an open place in the centre of which rose a church of vast proportions and built of hewn stone in that stately not to say ponderous style which Vanburgh introduced The area round it which was sufficiently ample was formed by buildings generally of a very mean character the long back premises of a carpenter the straggling yard of a hackney man sometimes a small narrow isolated private residence like a waterspout in which a rat might reside sometimes a group of houses of more pretension In the extreme corner of this area which was dignified by the name of Smith s Square instead of taking a more appropriate title from the church of saint John which it encircled was a large old house that had been masked at the beginning of the century with a modern front of pale coloured bricks but which still stood in its courtyard surrounded by its iron railings withdrawn as it were from the vulgar gaze like an individual who had known higher fortunes and blending with his humility something of the reserve which is prompted by the memory of vanished greatness This is my home said Sybil It is a still place and suits us well Near the house was a narrow passage which was a thoroughfare into the most populous quarter of the neighbourhood As Egremont was opening the gate of the courtyard Gerard ascended the steps of this passage and approached them Book four Chapter seven When Gerard and Morley quitted the Albany after their visit to Egremont they separated and Stephen whom we will accompany proceeded in the direction of the Temple in the vicinity of which he himself lodged and where he was about to visit a brother journalist who occupied chambers in that famous inn of court As he passed under Temple Bar his eye caught a portly gentleman stepping out of a public cab with a bundle of papers in his hand and immediately disappearing through that well known archway which Morley was on the point of reaching The gentleman indeed was still in sight descending the way when Morley entered who observed him drop a letter Morley hailed him but in vain and fearing the stranger might disappear in one of the many inextricable courts and so lose his letter he ran forward picked up the paper and then pushed on to the person who dropped it calling out so frequently that the stranger at length began to suspect that he himself might be the object of the salute and stopped and looked round Morley almost mechanically glanced at the outside of the letter the seal of which was broken and which was however addressed to a name that immediately fixed his interest The direction was to Baptist Hatton esquire Inner Temple This letter is I believe addressed to you Sir said Morley looking very intently upon the person to whom he spoke a portly man and a comely florid gentleman like but with as little of the expression which Morley in imagination had associated with that Hatton over whom he once pondered as can easily be imagined Sir I am extremely obliged to you said the strange gentleman the letter belongs to me though it is not addressed to me I must have this moment dropped it My name Sir is Firebrace Sir Vavasour Firebrace and this letter is addressed to a a not exactly my lawyer but a gentleman a professional gentleman whom I am in the habit of frequently seeing daily I may say He is employed in a great question in which I am deeply interested Sir I am vastly obliged to you and I trust that you are satisfied Oh I perfectly Sir Vavasour and Morley bowed and going in different directions they separated Do you happen to know a lawyer by name Hatton in this Inn inquired Morley of his friend the journalist when having transacted their business the occasion served No lawyer of that name but the famous Hatton lives here was the reply The famous Hatton And what is he famous for You forget I am a provincial He has made more peers of the realm than our gracious Sovereign said the journalist And since the reform of parliament the only chance of a tory becoming a peer is the favour of Baptist Hatton though who he is no one knows and what he is no one can describe You speak in conundrums said Morley I wish I could guess them Try to adapt yourself to my somewhat simple capacity In a word then said his friend if you must have a definition Hatton may rank under the genus antiquary though his species is more difficult to describe He is a heraldic antiquary a discoverer inventor framer arranger of pedigrees profound in the mysteries of genealogies an authority I believe unrivalled in everything that concerns the constitution and elements of the House of Lords consulted by lawyers though not professing the law and startling and alarming the noblest families in the country by claiming the ancient baronies which they have often assumed without authority for obscure pretenders many of whom he has succeeded in seating in the parliament of his country And what part of the country did he come from do you happen to know inquired Morley evidently much interested though he attempted to conceal his emotion He may be a veritable subject of the kingdom of Cockaigne for aught I know replied his friend He has been buried in this inn I believe for years for very many before I settled here and for a long time I apprehend was sufficiently obscure though doing they say a great deal in a small way but the Mallory case made his fortune about ten years ago That was a barony by writ of summons which had been claimed a century before and failed Hatton seated his man and the precedent enabled three or four more gentlemen under his auspices to follow that example They were Roman Catholics which probably brought him the Mallory case for Hatton is of the old church better than that they were all gentlemen of great estate and there is no doubt their champion was well rewarded for his successful service They say he is very rich At present all the business of the country connected with descents flows into his chambers Not a pedigree in dispute not a peerage in abeyance which is not submitted to his consideration I don t know him personally but you can now form some idea of his character and if you want to claim a peerage the journalist added laughingly he is your man A strong impression was on the mind of Morley that this was his man he resolved to inquire of Gerard whom he should see in the evening as to the fact of their Hatton being a Catholic and if so to call on the antiquary on the morrow In the meantime we must not forget one who is already making that visit Sir Vavasour Firebrace is seated in a spacious library that looks upon the Thames and the gardens of the Temple Though piles of parchments and papers cover the numerous tables and in many parts intrude upon the Turkey carpet an air of order of comfort and of taste pervades the chamber The hangings of crimson damask silk blend with the antique furniture of oak the upper panes of the windows are tinted by the brilliant pencil of feudal Germany while the choice volumes that line the shelves are clothed in bindings which become their rare contents The master of this apartment was a man of ordinary height inclined to corpulency and in the wane of middle life though his unwrinkled cheek his undimmed blue eye and his brown hair very apparent though he wore a cap of black velvet did not betray his age or the midnight studies by which he had in a great degree acquired that learning for which he was celebrated The general expression of his countenance was pleasing though dashed with a trait of the sinister He was seated in an easy chair before a kidney table at which he was writing Near at hand was a long tall oaken desk on which were several folio volumes open and some manuscripts which denoted that he had recently been engaged with them At present mister Hatton with his pen still in his hand and himself in a chamber robe of the same material as his cap leant back in his chair while he listened to his client Sir Vavasour Several most beautiful black and tan spaniels of the breed of King Charles the Second were reposing near him on velvet cushions with a haughty luxuriousness which would have become the beauties of the merry monarch and a white Persian cat with blue eyes and a very long tail with a visage not altogether unlike that of its master was resting with great gravity on the writing table and assisting at the conference Sir Vavasour had evidently been delivering himself of a long narrative to which mister Hatton had listened with that imperturbable patience which characterised him and which was unquestionably one of the elements of his success He never gave up anything and he never interrupted anybody And now in a silvery voice he replied to his visitor What you tell me Sir Vavasour is what I foresaw but which as my influence could not affect it I dismissed from my thoughts You came to me for a specific object I accomplished it I undertook to ascertain the rights and revive the claims of the baronets of England That was what you required me I fulfilled your wish Those rights are ascertained those claims are revived A great majority of the Order have given in their adhesion to the organized movement The nation is acquainted with your demands accustomed to them and the monarch once favourably received them I can do no more I do not pretend to make baronets still less can I confer on those already made the right to wear stars and coronets the dark green dress of Equites aurati or white hats with white plumes of feathers These distinctions even if their previous usage were established must flow from the gracious permission of the Crown and no one could expect in an age hostile to personal distinctions that any ministry would recommend the sovereign to a step which with vulgar minds would be odious and by malignant ones might be rendered ridiculous Ridiculous said Sir Vavasour All the world said mister Hatton do not take upon these questions the same enlightened view as ourselves Sir Vavasour I never could for a moment believe that the Sovereign would consent to invest such a numerous body of men with such privileges But you never expressed this opinion said Sir Vavasour You never asked for my opinion said mister Hatton and if I had given it you and your friends would not have been influenced by it The point was one on which you might with reason hold yourselves as competent judges as I am All you asked of me was to make out your case and I made it out I will venture to say a better case never left these chambers I do not believe there is a person in the kingdom who could answer it except myself They have refused the Order their honours Sir Vavasour but it is some consolation that they have never answered their case I think it only aggravates the oppression said Sir Vavasour shaking his head but cannot you advise any new step mister Hatton After so many years of suspense after so much anxiety and such a vast expenditure it really is too bad that I and Lady Firebrace should be announced at court in the same style as our fishmonger if he happens to be a sheriff I can make a Peer said mister Hatton leaning back in his chair and playing with his seals but I do not pretend to make Baronets I can place a coronet with four balls on a man s brow but a coronet with two balls is an exercise of the prerogative with which I do not presume to interfere I mention it in the utmost confidence said Sir Vavasour in a whisper but Lady Firebrace has a sort of promise that in the event of a change of government we shall be in the first batch of peers mister Hatton shook his head with a slight smile of contemptuous incredulity Sir Robert he said will make no peers take my word for that The whigs and I have so deluged the House of Lords that you may rely upon it as a secret of state that if the tories come in there will be no peers made I know the Queen is sensitively alive to the cheapening of all honours of late years If the whigs go out to morrow mark me they will disappoint all their friends Their underlings have promised so many that treachery is inevitable and if they deceive some they may as well deceive all Perhaps they may distribute a coronet or two among themselves and I shall this year make three and those are the only additions to the peerage which will occur for many years You may rely on that For the tories will make none and I have some thoughts of retiring from business It is difficult to express the astonishment the perplexity the agitation that pervaded the countenance of Sir Vavasour while his companion thus coolly delivered himself High hopes extinguished and excited at the same moment cherished promises vanishing mysterious expectations rising up revelations of astounding state secrets chief ministers voluntarily renouncing their highest means of influence and an obscure private individual distributing those distinctions which sovereigns were obliged to hoard and to obtain which the first men in the country were ready to injure their estates and to sacrifice their honour At length Sir Vavasour said You amaze me mister Hatton I could mention to you twenty members of Boodle s at least who believe they will be made peers the moment the tories come in Not a man of them said Hatton peremptorily Tell me one of their names and I will tell you whether they will be made peers Well then there is mister Tubbe Sweete a county member and his son in parliament too I know he has a promise I repeat to you Sir Vavasour the tories will not make a single peer the candidates must come to me and I ask you what can I do for a Tubbe Sweete the son of a Jamaica cooper Are there any old families among your twenty members of Brookes Why I can hardly say said Sir Vavasour there is Sir Charles Featherly an old baronet The founder a lord mayor in James the First s reign That is not the sort of old family that I mean said mister Hatton Well there is Colonel Cockawhoop said Sir Vavasour The Cockawhoops are a very good family I have always heard Contractors of Queen Anne partners with Marlborough and Solomon Medina a very good family indeed but I do not make peers out of good families Sir Vavasour old families are the blocks out of which I cut my Mercurys But what do you call an old family said Sir Vavasour Yours said mister Hatton and he threw a full glance on the countenance on which the light rested We were in the first batch of baronets said Sir Vavasour Forget the baronets for a while said Hatton Tell me what was your family before James the First They always lived on their lands said Sir Vavasour I have a room full of papers that would perhaps tell us something about them Would you like to see them By all means bring them all here Not that I want them to inform me of your rights I am fully acquainted with them You would like to be a peer sir Well you are really Lord Vavasour but there is a difficulty in establishing your undoubted right from the single writ of summons difficulty I will not trouble you with technicalities Sir Vavasour sufficient that the difficulty is great though perhaps not unmanageable But we have no need of management Your claim on the barony of Lovel is very good I could recommend your pursuing it did not another more inviting still present itself In a word if you wish to be Lord Bardolf I will undertake to make you so before in all probability Sir Robert Peel obtains office and that I should think would gratify Lady Firebrace Indeed it would said Sir Vavasour for if it had not been for this sort of a promise of a peerage made I speak in great confidence mister Hatton made by mister Taper my tenants would have voted for the whigs the other day at the shire election and the conservative candidate would have been beaten Lord Masque had almost arranged it but Lady Firebrace would have a written promise from a high quarter and so it fell to the ground Well we are independent of all these petty arrangements now said mister Hatton It is very wonderful said Sir Vavasour rising from his chair and speaking as it were to himself And what do you think our expenses will be in this claim he inquired Bagatelle said mister Hatton Why a dozen years ago I have known men lay out nearly half a million in land and not get two per cent for their money in order to obtain a borough influence which might ultimately obtain them a spick and span coronet and now you are going to put one on your head which will give you precedence over every peer on the roll except three and I made those and it will not cost you a paltry twenty or thirty thousand pounds Why I know men who would give that for the precedence alone Here and he rose and took up some papers from a table Here is a case a man you know I dare say an earl and of a decent date as earls go George the First The first baron was a Dutch valet of William the Third Well I am to terminate an abeyance in his favour through his mother and give him one of the baronies of the Herberts He buys off the other claimant who is already ennobled with a larger sum than you will expend on your ancient coronet Nor is that all The other claimant is of French descent and name came over at the revocation of the Edict of Nantes Well besides the hush money my client is to defray all the expense of attempting to transform the descendant of the silkweaver of Lyons into the heir of a Norman conqueror So you see Sir Vavasour I am not unreasonable Pah I would sooner gain five thousand pounds by restoring you to your rights than fifty thousand in establishing any of these pretenders in their base assumptions I must work in my craft Sir Vavasour but I love the old English blood and have it in my veins I am satisfied mister Hatton said Sir Vavasour let no time be lost All I regret is that you did not mention all this to me before and then we might have saved a great deal of trouble and expence You never consulted me said mister Hatton You gave me your instructions and I obeyed them I was sorry to see you in that mind for to speak frankly and I am sure now you will not be offended my lord for such is your real dignity there is no title in the world for which I have such a contempt as that of a baronet Sir Vavasour winced but the future was full of glory and the present of excitement and he wished mister Hatton good morning with a promise that he would himself bring the papers on the morrow mister Hatton was buried for a few moments in a reverie during which he played with the tail of the Persian cat Book four Chapter eight We left Sybil and Egremont just at the moment that Gerard arrived at the very threshold which they had themselves reached Ah my father exclaimed Sybil and then with a faint blush of which she was perhaps unconscious she added as if apprehensive Gerard would not recall his old companion you remember mister Franklin This gentleman and myself had the pleasure of meeting yesterday said Gerard embarrassed while Egremont himself changed colour and was infinitely confused Sybil felt surprised that her father should have met mister Franklin and not have mentioned a circumstance naturally interesting to her Egremont was about to speak when the street door was opened And were they to part again and no explanation And was Sybil to be left with her father who was evidently in no haste perhaps had no great tendency to give that explanation Every feeling of an ingenuous spirit urged Egremont personally to terminate this prolonged misconception You will permit me I hope he said appealing as much to Gerard as to his daughter to enter with you for a few moments It was not possible to resist such a request yet it was conceded on the part of Gerard with no cordiality So they entered the large gloomy hail of the house and towards the end of a long passage Gerard opened a door and they all went into a spacious melancholy room situate at the back of the house and looking upon a small square plot of dank grass in the midst of which rose a very weather stained Cupid with one arm broken and the other raised in the air with a long shell to its mouth It seemed that in old days it might have been a fountain At the end of the plot the blind side of a house offered a high wall which had once been painted in fresco Though much of the coloured plaster had cracked and peeled away and all that remained was stained and faded still some traces of the original design might yet be detected festive wreaths the colonnades and perspective of a palace The wails of the room itself were waincsotted in pannels of dark stained wood the window curtains were of coarse green worsted and encrusted with dust so ancient and irremovable that it presented almost a lava like appearance the carpet that had once been bright and showy was entirely threadbare and had become grey with age There were several heavy mahogany arm chairs in the room a Pembroke table and an immense unwieldy sideboard garnished with a few wine glasses of a deep blue colour Over the lofty uncouth mantel was a portrait of the Marquis of Granby which might have been a sign and opposite to him over the sideboard was a large tawdry coloured print by Bunbury of Ranelagh in its most festive hour The general appearance of the room however though dingy was not squalid and what with its spaciousness its extreme repose and the associations raised by such few images as it did suggest the impression on the mind of the spectator was far from unpleasing partaking indeed of that vague melancholy which springs from the contemplation of the past and which at all times softens the spirit Gerard walked to the window and looked at the grass plot Sybil seating herself invited their guest to follow her example Egremont not without agitation seemed suddenly to make an effort to collect himself and then in a voice not distinguished by its accustomed clearness he said I explained yesterday to one who I hope I may still call my friend why I assumed a name to which I have no right Sybil started a little slightly stared but did not speak I should be happy if you also would give me credit in taking that step at least for motives of which I need not be ashamed even he added in a hesitating voice even if you deemed my conduct indiscreet Their eyes met astonishment was imprinted on the countenance of Sybil but she uttered not a word and her father whose back was turned to them did not move I was told continued Egremont that an impassable gulf divided the Rich from the Poor I was told that the Privileged and the People formed Two Nations governed by different laws influenced by different manners with no thoughts or sympathies in common with an innate inability of mutual comprehension I believed that if this were indeed the case the ruin of our common country was at hand I would have endeavoured feebly perchance but not without zeal to resist such a catastrophe I possessed a station which entailed on me some portion of its responsibility to obtain that knowledge which could alone qualify me for beneficial action I resolved to live without suspicion among my fellow subjects who were estranged from me even void of all celebrity as I am I could not have done that without suspicion had I been known they would have recoiled from my class and my name as you yourself recoiled Sybil when they were once accidentally mentioned before you These are the reasons these the feelings which impelled I will not say justified me to pass your threshold under a feigned name I entreat you to judge kindly of my conduct to pardon me and not to make me feel the bitterness that I have forfeited the good opinion of one for whom under all circumstances and in all situations I must ever feel the highest conceivable respect I would say a reverential regard His tones of passionate emotion ceased Sybil with a countenance beautiful and disturbed gazed at him for an instant and seemed about to speak but her trembling lips refused the office then with an effort turning to Gerard she said My father I am amazed tell me then who is this gentleman who addresses me The brother of Lord Marney Sybil said Gerard turning to her The brother of Lord Marney repeated Sybil with an air almost of stupor Yes said Egremont a member of that family of sacrilege of those oppressors of the people whom you have denounced to me with such withering scorn The elbow of Sybil rested on the arm of her chair and her cheek upon her hand as Egremont said these words she shaded her face which was thus entirely unseen for some moments there was silence Then looking up with an expression grave but serene and as if she had just emerged from some deep thinking Sybil said I am sorry for my words sorry for the pain I unconsciously gave you sorry indeed for all that has past and that my father has lost a pleasant friend And why should he be lost said Egremont mournfully and yet with tenderness Why should we not still befriends Oh sir said Sybil haughtily I am one of those who believe the gulf is impassable Yes she added slightly but with singular grace waving her hands and somewhat turning away her head utterly impassable There are tumults of the mind when like the great convulsions of nature all seems anarchy and returning chaos yet often in those moments of vast disturbance as in the material strife itself some new principle of order or some new impulse of conduct develops itself and controls and regulates and brings to an harmonious consequence passions and elements which seemed only to threaten despair and subversion So it was with Egremont He looked for a moment in despair upon this maiden walled out from sympathy by prejudices and convictions more impassable than all the mere consequences of class He looked for a moment but only for a moment in despair He found in his tortured spirit energies that responded to the exigency of the occasion Even the otherwise embarrassing presence of Gerard would not have prevented but just at this moment the door opened and Morley and another person entered the room Book four Chapter nine Morley paused as he recognised Egremont then advancing to Gerard followed by his companion he said This is mister Hatton of whom we were speaking last night and who claims to be an ancient acquaintance of yours
4018_107338_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Perhaps I should rather say of your poor dear father said Hatton scanning Gerard with his clear blue eye and then he added He was of great service to me in my youth and one is not apt to forget such things 
4018_107338_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 One ought not said Gerard but it is a sort of memory as I have understood that is rather rare 
none	none	For my part I remember you very well Baptist Hatton said Gerard examining his guest with almost as complete a scrutiny as he had himself experienced
4018_107338_000007_000002	train-clean-100	 This world has gone well with you I am glad to hear and see 
4018_107338_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Qui laborat orat said Hatton in a silvery voice is the gracious maxim of our Holy Church and I venture to believe my prayers and vigils have been accepted for I have laboured in my time and as he was speaking these words he turned and addressed them to Sybil 
none	none	She beheld him with no little interest this mysterious name that had sounded so often in her young ears and was associated with so many strange and high hopes and some dark blending of doubt and apprehension and discordant thoughts Hatton in his appearance realised little of the fancies in which Sybil had sometime indulged with regard to him That appearance was prepossessing a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance his once rich brown hair still long though very thin was so arranged as naturally to conceal his baldness he was dressed with great simplicity but with remarkable taste and care nor did the repose and suavity of his manner and the hushed tone of his voice detract from the favourable effect that he always at once produced
4018_107338_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 Qui laborat orat said Sybil with a smile is the privilege of the people 
none	none	Of whom I am one said Hatton bowing well recollecting that he was addressing the daughter of a chartist delegate But is your labour their labour said Sybil Is yours that life of uncomplaining toil wherein there is so much of beauty and of goodness that by the fine maxim of our Church it is held to include the force and efficacy of prayer
4018_107338_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 I am sure that I should complain of no toil that would benefit you said Hatton and then addressing himself again to Gerard he led him to a distant part of the room where they were soon engaged in earnest converse 
4018_107338_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Morley at the same moment approached Sybil and spoke to her in a subdued tone 
none	none	Egremont feeling embarrassed advanced and bade her farewell 
4018_107338_000013_000003	train-clean-100	She rose and returned his salute with some ceremony then hesitating while a soft expression came over her countenance she held forth her hand which he retained for a moment and withdrew 
none	none	I was with him more than an hour continued Morley At first he recollected nothing even the name of Gerard though he received it as familiar to him seemed to produce little impression he recollected nothing of any papers was clear that they must have been quite insignificant whatever they were he doubtless had them now as he never destroyed papers would order a search to be made for them and so on 
4018_107338_000014_000002	train-clean-100	I was about to withdraw when he asked me carelessly a question about your father what he was doing and whether he were married and had children 
4018_107338_000014_000003	train-clean-100	This led to a very long conversation in which he suddenly seemed to take great interest 
4018_107338_000014_000004	train-clean-100	At first he talked of writing to see your father and I offered that Gerard should call upon him 
none	none	He took down your direction in order that he might write to your father and give him an appointment when observing that it was Westminster he said that his carriage was ordered to go to the House of Lords in a quarter of an hour and that if not inconvenient to me he would propose that I should at once accompany him 
4018_107338_000014_000006	train-clean-100	I thought whatever might be the result it must be a satisfaction to Gerard at last to see this man of whom he has talked and thought so much and so we are here 
none	none	You did well good Stephen as you always do said Sybil with a musing and abstracted air no one has so much forethought and so much energy as you He threw a glance at her and immediately withdrew it 
4018_107338_000016_000001	train-clean-100	Their eyes had met hers were kind and calm 
4018_107338_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 And this Egremont said Morley rather hurriedly and abruptly and looking on the ground how came he here 
4018_107338_000017_000001	train-clean-100	When we discovered him yesterday your father and myself agreed that we should not mention to you the the mystification of which we had been dupes 
none	none	And you did wrong said Sybil
4018_107338_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 There is no wisdom like frankness 
none	none	Had you told me he would not have been here today He met and addressed me and I only recognised an acquaintance who had once contributed so much to the pleasantness of our life 
4018_107338_000018_000004	train-clean-100	Had he not accompanied me to this door and met my father which precipitated an explanation on his part which he found had not been given by others I might have remained in an ignorance which hereafter might have produced inconvenience 
none	none	You are right said Morley looking at her rather keenly
4018_107338_000019_000001	train-clean-100	 We have all of us opened ourselves too unreservedly before this aristocrat 
4018_107338_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 I should hope that none of us have said to him a word that we wish to be forgotten said Sybil 
4018_107338_000020_000001	train-clean-100	 He chose to wear a disguise and can hardly quarrel with the frankness with which we spoke of his order or his family 
4018_107338_000020_000002	train-clean-100	And for the rest he has not been injured from learning something of the feelings of the people by living among them 
none	none	And yet if anything were to happen to morrow said Morley rest assured this man has his eye on us 
4018_107338_000021_000001	train-clean-100	He can walk into the government offices like themselves and tell his tale for though one of the pseudo opposition the moment the people move the factions become united 
4018_107338_000022_000000	train-clean-100	Sybil turned and looked at him and then said And what could happen to morrow that we should care for the government being acquainted with it or us 
4018_107338_000022_000001	train-clean-100	Do not they know everything 
4018_107338_000022_000002	train-clean-100	Do not you meet in their very sight 
none	none	You pursue an avowed and legal aim by legal means do you not What then is there to fear 
4018_107338_000022_000004	train-clean-100	And why should anything happen that should make us apprehensive 
4018_107338_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 All is very well at this moment said Morley and all may continue well but popular assemblies breed turbulent spirits Sybil 
4018_107338_000023_000001	train-clean-100	Your father takes a leading part he is a great orator and is in his element in this clamorous and fiery life 
4018_107338_000023_000002	train-clean-100	It does not much suit me I am a man of the closet 
4018_107338_000023_000003	train-clean-100	This Convention as you well know was never much to my taste 
none	none	Their Charter is a coarse specific for our social evils 
4018_107338_000023_000005	train-clean-100	The spirit that would cure our ills must be of a deeper and finer mood 
none	none	Then why are you here said Sybil Morley shrugged his shoulders and then said An easy question Questions are always easy 
4018_107338_000025_000001	train-clean-100	The fact is in active life one cannot afford to refine 
none	none	I could have wished the movement to have taken a different shape and to have worked for a different end but it has not done this But it is still a movement and a great one and I must work it for my end and try to shape it to my form 
4018_107338_000025_000003	train-clean-100	If I had refused to be a leader I should not have prevented the movement I should only have secured my own insignificance 
4018_107338_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 But my father has not these fears he is full of hope and exultation said Sybil 
none	none	And surely it is a great thing that the people should have their Parliament lawfully meeting in open day and their delegates from the whole realm declaring their grievances in language which would not disgrace the conquering race which has in vain endeavoured to degrade them 
4018_107338_000026_000002	train-clean-100	When I heard my father speak the other night my heart glowed with emotion my eyes were suffused with tears I was proud to be his daughter and I gloried in a race of forefathers who belonged to the oppressed and not to the oppressors 
none	none	Morley watched the deep splendour of her eye and the mantling of her radiant cheek as she spoke these latter words with not merely animation but fervour Her bright hair that hung on either side her face in long tresses of luxuriant richness was drawn off a forehead that was the very throne of thought and majesty while her rich lip still quivered with the sensibility which expressed its impassioned truth
4018_107338_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 But your father Sybil stands alone at length Morley replied surrounded by votaries who have nothing but enthusiasm to recommend them and by emulous and intriguing rivals who watch every word and action in order that they may discredit his conduct and ultimately secure his downfall 
4018_107338_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 My father s downfall said Sybil 
4018_107338_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 Is he not one of themselves 
4018_107338_000029_000002	train-clean-100	And is it possible that among the delegates of the People there can be other than one and the same object 
none	none	A thousand said Morley we have already as many parties as in saint Stephen s itself
4018_107338_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 You terrify me said Sybil 
4018_107338_000031_000001	train-clean-100	 I knew we had fearful odds to combat against 
none	none	My visit to this city alone has taught me how strong are our enemies But I believed that we had on our side God and Truth They know neither of them in the National Convention said Morley Our career will be a vulgar caricature of the bad passions and the low intrigues the factions and the failures of our oppressors 
4018_107338_000033_000000	train-clean-100	At this moment Gerard and Hatton who were sitting in the remote part of the room rose together and advanced forward and this movement interrupted the conversation of Sybil and Morley 
4018_107338_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Before however her father and his new friend could reach them Hatton as if some point on which he had not been sufficiently explicit had occurred to him stopped and placing his hand on Gerard s arm withdrew him again saying in a voice which could only be heard by the individual whom he addressed 
none	none	You understand I have not the slightest doubt myself of your moral right I believe on every principle of justice that Mowbray Castle is as much yours as the house that is built by the tenant on the lord s land but can we prove it We never had the legal evidence You are in error in supposing that these papers were of any vital consequence mere memoranda very useful no doubt I hope I shall find them but of no validity 
4018_107338_000033_000004	train-clean-100	If money were the only difficulty trust me it should not be wanting I owe much to the memory of your father my good Gerard I would fain serve you and your daughter 
none	none	I ll not tell you what I would do for you my good Gerard 
4018_107338_000033_000006	train-clean-100	You would think me foolish but I am alone in the world and seeing you again and talking of old times I really am scarcely fit for business 
4018_107338_000033_000007	train-clean-100	Go however I must I have an appointment at the House of Lords 
none	none	Good bye I must say farewell to the Lady Sybil Book four Chapter ten You can t have that table sir it is engaged said a waiter at the Athenaeum to a member of the club who seemed unmindful of the type of appropriation which in the shape of an inverted plate ought to have warned him off the coveted premises It is always engaged grumbled the member Who has taken it mister Hatton sir And indeed at this very moment it being about eight o clock of the same day on which the meeting detailed in the last chapter had occurred a very handsome dark brougham with a beautiful horse was stopping in Waterloo Place before the portico of the Athenaeum Club house from which equipage immediately emerged the prosperous person of Baptist Hatton This club was Hatton s only relaxation He had never entered society and now his habits were so formed the effort would have been a painful one though with a first rate reputation in his calling and supposed to be rich the openings were numerous to a familiar intercourse with those middle aged nameless gentlemen of easy circumstances who haunt clubs and dine a great deal at each others houses and chambers men who travel regularly a little and gossip regularly a great deal who lead a sort of facile slipshod existence doing nothing yet mightily interested in what others do great critics of little things profuse in minor luxuries and inclined to the respectable practice of a decorous profligacy peering through the window of a clubhouse as if they were discovering a planet and usually much excited about things with which they have no concern and personages who never heard of them All this was not in Hatton s way who was free from all pretension and who had acquired from his severe habits of historical research a respect only for what was authentic These nonentities flitted about him and he shrunk from an existence that seemed to him at once dull and trifling He had a few literary acquaintances that he had made at the Antiquarian Society of which he was a distinguished member a vice president of that body had introduced him to the Athenaeum It was the first and only club that Hatton had ever belonged to and he delighted in it He liked splendour and the light and bustle of a great establishment They saved him from that melancholy which after a day of action is the doom of energetic celibacy A luxurious dinner without trouble suited him after his exhaustion sipping his claret he revolved his plans Above all he revelled in the magnificent library and perhaps was never happier than when after a stimulating repast he adjourned up stairs and buried himself in an easy chair with Dugdale or Selden or an erudite treatise on forfeiture or abeyance To day however Hatton was not in this mood He came in exhausted and excited eat rapidly and rather ravenously despatched a pint of champagne and then called for a bottle of Lafitte His table cleared a devilled biscuit placed before him a cool bottle and a fresh glass he indulged in that reverie which the tumult of his feelings and the physical requirements of existence had hitherto combined to prevent A strange day he thought as with an abstracted air he filled his glass and sipping the wine leant back in his chair The son of Walter Gerard A chartist delegate The best blood in England What would I not be were it mine Those infernal papers They made my fortune and yet I know not how it is the deed has cost me many a pang Yet it seemed innoxious the old man dead insolvent myself starving his son ignorant of all to whom too they could be of no use for it required thousands to work them and even with thousands they could only be worked by myself Had I not done it I should ere this probably have been swept from the surface of the earth worn out with penury disease and heart ache And now I am Baptist Hatton with a fortune almost large enough to buy Mowbray itself and with knowledge that can make the proudest tremble And for what object all this wealth and power What memory shall I leave What family shall I found Not a relative in the world except a solitary barbarian from whom when years ago I visited him as a stranger I recoiled with unutterable loathing Ah had I a child a child like the beautiful daughter of Gerard And here mechanically Hatton filled his glass and quaffed at once a bumper And I have deprived her of a principality That seraphic being whose lustre even now haunts my vision the ring of whose silver tone even now lingers in my ear He must be a fiend who could injure her I am that fiend Let me see let me see And now he seemed wrapt in the very paradise of some creative vision still he filled the glass but this time he only sipped it as if he were afraid to disturb the clustering images around him Let me see let me see I could make her a baroness Gerard is as much Baron Valence as Shrewsbury is a Talbot Her name is Sybil Curious how even when peasants the good blood keeps the good old family names The Valences were ever Sybils I could make her a baroness Yes and I could give her wherewith to endow her state I could compensate for the broad lands which should be hers and which perhaps through me she has forfeited Could I do more Could I restore her to the rank she would honour assuage these sharp pangs of conscience and achieve the secret ambition of my life What if my son were to be Lord Valence Is it too bold A chartist delegate a peasant s daughter With all that shining beauty that I witnessed with all the marvellous gifts that their friend Morley so descanted on would she shrink from me I m not a crook backed Richard I could proffer much I feel I could urge it plausibly She must be very wretched With such a form such high imaginings such thoughts of power and pomp as I could breathe in her I think she d melt And to one of her own faith too To build up a great Catholic house again of the old blood and the old names and the old faith by holy Mary it is a glorious vision Book four Chapter eleven On the evening of the day that Egremont had met Sybil in the Abbey of Westminster and subsequently parted from her under circumstances so distressing the Countess of Marney held a great assembly at the family mansion in saint James Square which Lord Marney had intended to have let to a new club and himself and his family to have taken refuge for a short season at an hotel but he drove so hard a bargain that before the lease was signed the new club which mainly consisted of an ingenious individual who had created himself secretary had vanished Then it was agreed that the family mansion should be inhabited for the season by the family and to night Arabella was receiving all that great world of which she herself was a distinguished ornament We come to you as early as possible my dear Arabella said Lady Deloraine to her daughter in law You are always so good Have you seen Charles I was in hopes he would have come Lady Marney added in a somewhat mournful tone He is at the House otherwise I am sure he would have been here said Lady Deloraine glad that she had so good a reason for an absence which under any circumstances she well knew would have occurred I fear you will be sadly in want of beaus this evening my love We dined at the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine s and all our cavaliers vanished They talk of an early division I really wish all these divisions were over said Lady Marney They are very anti social Ah here is Lady de Mowbray Alfred Mountchesney hovered round Lady Joan Fitz Warene who was gratified by the devotion of the Cupid of May Fair He uttered inconceivable nothings and she replied to him in incomprehensible somethings Her learned profundity and his vapid lightness effectively contrasted Occasionally he caught her eye and conveyed to her the anguish of his soul in a glance of self complacent softness Lady saint Julians leaning on the arm of the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine stopped to speak to Lady Joan Lady saint Julians was determined that the heiress of Mowbray should marry one of her sons She watched therefore with a restless eye all those who attempted to monopolize Lady Joan s attention and contrived perpetually to interfere with their manoeuvres In the midst of a delightful conversation that seemed to approach a crisis Lady saint Julians was sure to advance and interfere with some affectionate appeal to Lady Joan whom she called her dear child and sweetest love while she did not deign even to notice the unhappy cavalier whom she had thus as it were unhorsed My sweet child said Lady saint Julians to Lady Joan you have no idea how unhappy Frederick is this evening but he cannot leave the House and I fear it will be a late affair Lady Joan looked as if the absence or presence of Frederick was to her a matter of great indifference and then she added I do not think the division so important as is generally imagined A defeat upon a question of colonial government does not appear to me of sufficient weight to dissolve a cabinet Any defeat will do that now said Lady saint Julians but to tell you the truth I am not very sanguine Lady Deloraine says they will be beat she says the radicals will desert them but I am not so sure Why should the radicals desert them And what have we done for the radicals Had we indeed foreseen this Jamaica business and asked some of them to dinner or given a ball or two to their wives and daughters I am sure if I had had the least idea that we had so good a chance of coming in I should not have cared myself to have done something even to have invited their women But you are such a capital partisan Lady saint Julians said the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine who with the viceroyalty of Ireland dexterously dangled before his eyes for the last two years had become a thorough conservative and had almost as much confidence in Sir Robert as in Lord Stanley I have made great sacrifices said Lady saint Julians I went once and stayed a week at Lady Jenny Spinner s to gain her looby of a son and his eighty thousand a year and Lord saint Julians proposed him at White s and then after all the whigs made him a peer They certainly make more of their social influences than we do That affair of that mister Trenchard was a blow Losing a vote at such a critical time when if I had had only a remote idea of what was passing through his mind I would have even asked him to Barrowley for a couple of days A foreign diplomatist of distinction had pinned Lord Marney and was dexterously pumping him as to the probable future But is the pear ripe said the diplomatist The pear is ripe if we have courage to pluck it said Lord Marney but our fellows have no pluck But do you think that the Duke of Wellington and here the diplomatist stopped and looked up in Lord Marney s face as if he would convey something that he would not venture to express Here he is said Lord Marney he will answer the question himself Lord Deloraine and mister Ormsby passed by the diplomatist addressed them You have not been to the Chamber No said Lord Deloraine but I hear there is hot work It will be late Do you think said the diplomatist and he looked up in the face of Lord Deloraine I think that in the long run everything will have an end said Lord Deloraine Ah said the diplomatist Bah said Lord Deloraine as he walked away with mister Ormsby I remember that fellow a sort of equivocal attache at Paris when we were there with Monmouth at the peace and now he is a quasi ambassador and ribboned and starred to the chin The only stars I have got said mister Ormsby demurely are four stars in India stock Lady Firebrace and Lady Maud Fitz Warene were announced they had just come from the Commons a dame and damsel full of political enthusiasm Lady Firebrace gave critical reports and disseminated many contradictory estimates of the result Lady Maud talked only of a speech made by Lord Milford which from the elaborate noise she made about it you would have supposed to have been the oration of the evening on the contrary it had lasted only a few minutes and in a thin house had been nearly inaudible but then as Lady Maud added it was in such good taste Alfred Mountchesney and Lady Joan Fitz Warene passed Lady Marney who was speaking to Lord Deloraine Do you think said Lady Marney that mister Mountchesney will bear away the prize Lord Deloraine shook his head These great heiresses can never make up their minds The bitter drop rises in all their reveries And yet said Lady Marney I would just as soon be married for my money as my face Soon after this there was a stir in the saloons a murmur the ingress of many gentlemen among others Lord Valentine Lord Milford mister Egerton mister Berners Lord Fitz Heron mister Jermyn The House was up the great Jamaica division was announced the radicals had thrown over the government who left in a majority of only five had already intimated their sense of the unequivocal feeling of the House with respect to them It was known that on the morrow the government would resign Lady Deloraine prepared for the great result was calm Lady saint Julians who had not anticipated it was in a wild flutter of distracted triumph A vague yet dreadful sensation came over her in the midst of her joy that Lady Deloraine had been beforehand with her had made her combinations with the new Minister perhaps even sounded the Court At the same time that in this agitating vision the great offices of the palace which she had apportioned to herself and her husband seemed to elude her grasp the claims and hopes and interests of her various children haunted her perplexed consciousness What if Charles Egremont were to get the place which she had projected for Frederick or Augustus What if Lord Marney became master of the horse Or Lord Deloraine went again to Ireland In her nervous excitement she credited all these catastrophes seized upon the Duke in order that Lady Deloraine might not gain his ear and resolved to get home as soon as possible in order that she might write without a moment s loss of time to Sir Robert They will hardly go out without making some peers said Sir Vavasour Firebrace to mister Jermyn Why they have made enough Hem I know Tubbe Swete has a promise and so has Cockawhoop I don t think Cockawhoop could show again at Boodle s without a coronet I don t see why these fellows should go out said mister Ormsby What does it signify whether ministers have a majority of five or ten or twenty In my time a proper majority was a third of the House That was Lord Liverpool s majority Lord Monmouth used to say that there were ten families in this country who if they could only agree could always share the government Ah those were the good old times We never had adjourned debates then but sate it out like gentlemen who had been used all their lives to be up all night and then supped at Watier s afterwards Ah my dear Ormsby said mister Berners do not mention Watier s you make my mouth water Shall you stand for Birmingham Ormsby if there be a dissolution said Lord Fitz Heron I have been asked said mister Ormsby but the House of Commons is not the House of Commons of my time and I have no wish to re enter it If I had a taste for business I might be a member of the Marylebone vestry All I repeat said Lord Marney to his mother as he rose from the sofa where he had been some time in conversation with her that if there be any idea that I wish Lady Marney should be a lady in waiting it is an error Lady Deloraine I wish that to be understood I am a domestic man and I wish Lady Marney to be always with me and what I want I want for myself I hope in arranging the household the domestic character of every member of it will be considered After all that has occurred the country expects that But my dear George I think it is really premature I dare say it is but I recommend you my dear mother to be alive I heard Lady saint Julians just now in the supper room asking the Duke to promise her that her Augustus should be a Lord of the Admiralty She said the Treasury would not do as there was no house and that with such a fortune as his wife brought him he could not hire a house under a thousand a year He will not have the Admiralty said Lady Deloraine She looks herself to the Robes Poor woman said Lady Deloraine Is it quite true said a great whig dame to mister Egerton one of her own party Quite he said I can endure anything except Lady saint Julian s glance of triumph said the whig dame I really think if it were only to ease her Majesty from such an infliction they ought to have held on And must the household be changed said mister Egerton Do not look so serious said the whig dame smiling with fascination we are surrounded by the enemy Will you be at home to morrow early said mister Egerton As early as you please Very well we will talk then Lady Charlotte has heard something nous verrons Courage we have the Court with us and the Country cares for nothing Book four Chapter twelve It is all right said mister Tadpole They are out Lord Melbourne has been with the Queen and recommended her Majesty to send for the Duke and the Duke has recommended her Majesty to send for Sir Robert Are you sure said mister Taper I tell you Sir Robert is on his road to the palace at this moment I saw him pass full dressed It is too much said mister Taper Now what are we to do said mister Tadpole We must not dissolve said mister Taper We have no cry As much cry as the other fellows said mister Tadpole but no one of course would think of dissolution before the next registration No no this is a very manageable Parliament depend upon it The malcontent radicals who have turned them out are not going to bring them in That makes us equal Then we have an important section to work upon the Sneaks the men who are afraid of a dissolution I will be bound we make a good working conservative majority of five and twenty out of the sneaks With the Treasury patronage said mister Taper fear and favour combined An impending dissolution and all the places we refuse our own men we may count on the Sneaks Then there are several religious men who have wanted an excuse for a long time to rat said mister Tadpole We must get Sir Robert to make some kind of a religious move and that will secure Sir Litany Lax and young mister Salem It will never do to throw over the Church Commission said mister Taper Commissions and committees ought always to be supported Besides it will frighten the saints said mister Tadpole If we could get him to speak at Exeter Hall were it only a slavery meeting that would do It is difficult said Taper he must be pledged to nothing not even to the right of search Yet if we could get up something with a good deal of sentiment and no principle involved referring only to the past but with his practised powers touching the present What do you think of a monument to Wilberforce or a commemoration of Clarkson There is a good deal in that said mister Tadpole At present go about and keep our fellows in good humour Whisper nothings that sound like something But be discreet do not let there be more than half a hundred fellows who believe they are going to be Under Secretaries of State And be cautious about titles If they push you give a wink and press your finger to your lip I must call here continued mister Tadpole as he stopped before the house of the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine This gentleman is my particular charge I have been cooking him these three years I had two notes from him yesterday and can delay a visit no longer The worst of it is he expects that I shall bear him the non official announcement of his being sent to Ireland of which he has about as much chance as I have of being Governor General of India It must be confessed ours is critical work sometimes friend Taper but never mind what we have to do to individuals Peel has to with a nation and therefore we ought not to complain The Duke of Fitz Aquitaine wanted Ireland and Lord de Mowbray wanted the Garter Lord Marney who wanted the Buckhounds was convinced that neither of his friends had the slightest chance of obtaining their respective objects but believed that he had a very good one of securing his own if he used them for his purpose and persuaded them to combine together for the common good So at his suggestion they had all met together at the duke s and were in full conference on the present state of affairs while Tadpole and Taper were engaged in that interesting and instructive conversation of which we have snatched a passage You may depend upon it said Lord Marney that nothing is to be done by delicacy It is not delicacy that rules the House of Lords What has kept us silent for years Threats and threats used in the most downright manner We were told that if we did not conform absolutely and without appeal to the will and pleasure of one individual the cards would be thrown up We gave in the game has been played and won I am not at all clear that it has been won by those tactics but gained it is and now what shall we do In my opinion it is high time to get rid of the dictatorship The new ruse now for the palace is to persuade her Majesty that Peel is the only man who can manage the House of Lords Well then it is exactly the time to make certain persons understand that the House of Lords are not going to be tools any longer merely for other people Rely upon it a bold united front at this moment would be a spoke in the wheel We three form the nucleus there are plenty to gather round I have written to Marisforde he is quite ripe Lord Hounslow will be here to morrow The thing is to be done and if we are not firm the grand conservative triumph will only end in securing the best posts both at home and abroad for one too powerful family Who had never been heard of in the time of my father said the duke Nor in the time of mine said Lord de Mowbray Royal and Norman blood like ours said Lord Marney is not to be thrown over in that way It was just at this moment that a servant entered with a card which the duke looking at said It is Tadpole shall we have him in I dare say he will tell us something And notwithstanding the important character of their conference political curiosity and perhaps some private feeling which not one of them cared to acknowledge made them unanimously agree that mister Tadpole should be admitted Lord Marney and Lord de Mowbray with the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine thought mister Tadpole as he was ushered into the library and his eye practised in machinations and prophetic in manoeuvres surveyed the three nobles This looks like business and perhaps means mischief Very lucky I called With an honest smile he saluted them all What news from the palace Tadpole inquired the duke Sir Robert is there replied Tadpole That s good news exclaimed his grace echoed by Lord de Mowbray and backed up with a faint bravo from Lord Marney Then arose a conversation in which all affected much interest respecting the Jamaica debate whether the whigs had originally intended to resign whether it were Lord Melbourne or Lord John who had insisted on the step whether if postponed they could have tided over the session and so on Tadpole who was somewhat earnest in his talk seemed to have pinned the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine Lord Marney who wanted to say a word alone to Lord de Mowbray had dexterously drawn that personage aside on the pretence of looking at a picture Tadpole who had a most frank and unsophisticated mien had an eye for every corner of a room seized the opportunity for which he had been long cruising I don t pretend to be behind the scenes duke but it was said to me to day Tadpole if you do chance to see the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine you may say that positively Lord Killcroppy will not go to Ireland A smile of satisfaction played over the handsome face of the duke instantly suppressed lest it might excite suspicion and then with a friendly and very significant nod that intimated to Tadpole not to dwell on the subject at the present moment the duke with a rather uninterested air recurred to the Jamaica debate and soon after appealed on some domestic point to his son in law This broke up the conversation between Lord de Mowbray and Lord Marney Lord de Mowbray advancing was met accidentally on purpose by mister Tadpole who seemed anxious to push forward to Lord Marney You have heard of Lord Ribbonville said Tadpole in a suppressed tone No what Can t live the day out How fortunate Sir Robert is Two garters to begin with Tadpole had now succeeded in tackling Lord Marney alone the other peers were far out of ear shot I don t pretend to be behind the scenes my Lord said the honest gentleman in a peculiarly confidential tone and with a glance that spoke volumes of state secrecy but it was said to me to day Tadpole if you do chance to meet Lord Marney you may say that positively Lord Rambrooke will not have the Buck hounds All I want said Lord Marney is to see men of character about her Majesty This is a domestic country and the country expects that no nobleman should take household office whose private character is not inexpugnable Now that fellow Rambrooke keeps a French woman It is not much known but it is a fact Dreadful exclaimed mister Tadpole I have no doubt of it But he has no chance of the Buck hounds you may rely on that Private character is to be the basis of the new government Since the Reform Act that is a qualification much more esteemed by the constituency than public services We must go with the times my Lord A virtuous middle class shrink with horror from French actresses and the Wesleyans the Wesleyans must be considered Lord Marney I always subscribe to them said his Lordship Ah said mister Tadpole mysteriously I am glad to hear that Nothing I have heard to day has given me so much pleasure as those few words One may hardly jest on such a subject he added with a sanctimonious air but I think I may say and here he broke into a horse smile I think I may say that those subscriptions will not be without their fruit And with a bow honest Tadpole disappeared saying to himself as he left the house If you were ready to be conspirators when I entered the room my Lords you were at least prepared to be traitors when I quitted it In the meantime Lord Marney in the best possible humour said to Lord de Mowbray You are going to White s are you If so take me I am sorry my dear Lord but I have an appointment in the city I have got to go to the Temple and I am already behind my time Book four Chapter thirteen And why was Lord de Mowbray going to the Temple He had received the day before when he came home to dress a very disagreeable letter from some lawyers apprising him that they were instructed by their client mister Walter Gerard to commence proceedings against his lordship on a writ of right with respect to his manors of Mowbray Valence Mowedale Mowbray Valence and several others carefully enumerated in their precise epistle and the catalogue of which read like an extract from Domesday Book More than twenty years had elapsed since the question had been mooted and though the discussion had left upon Lord de Mowbray an impression from which at times he had never entirely recovered still circumstances had occurred since the last proceedings which gave him a moral if not a legal conviction that he should be disturbed no more And these were the circumstances Lord de Mowbray after the death of the father of Walter Gerard had found himself in communication with the agent who had developed and pursued the claim for the yeoman and had purchased for a good round sum the documents on which that claim was founded and by which apparently that claim could only be sustained The vendor of these muniments was Baptist Hatton and the sum which he obtained for them by allowing him to settle in the metropolis pursue his studies purchase his library and collections and otherwise give himself that fair field which brains without capital can seldom command was in fact the foundation of his fortune Many years afterwards Lord de Mowbray had recognised Hatton in the prosperous parliamentary agent who often appeared at the bar of the House of Lords and before committees of privileges and who gradually obtained an unrivalled reputation and employment in peerage cases Lord de Mowbray renewed his acquaintance with a man who was successful bowed to Hatton whenever they met and finally consulted him respecting the barony of Valence which had been in the old Fitz Warene and Mowbray families and to which it was thought the present earl might prefer some hocus pocus claim through his deceased mother so that however recent was his date as an English earl he might figure on the roll as a Plantagenet baron which in the course of another century would complete the grand mystification of high nobility The death of his son dexterously christened Valence had a little damped his ardour in this respect but still there was a sufficiently intimate connection kept up between him and Hatton so that before he placed the letter he had received in the hands of his lawyers he thought it desirable to consult his ancient ally This was the reason that Lord de Mowbray was at the present moment seated in the same chair in the same library as was a few days back that worthy baronet Sir Vavasour Firebrace mister Hatton was at the same table similarly employed his Persian cat on his right hand and his choice spaniels reposing on their cushions at his feet mister Hatton held forward his hand to receive the letter of which Lord de Mowbray had been speaking to him and which he read with great attention weighing as it were each word Singular as the letter had been written by himself and the firm who signed it were only his instruments obeying the spring of the master hand Very remarkable said mister Hatton Is it not said Lord de Mowbray And your Lordship received this yesterday Yesterday I lost no time in communicating with you Jubb and Jinks continued mister Hatton musingly surveying the signature of the letter A very respectable firm That makes it more strange said his Lordship It does said mister Hatton A respectable firm would hardly embark in such a proceeding without some show of pretext said Lord de Mowbray Hardly said mister Hatton But what can they have urged his Lordship What indeed said mister Hatton mister Walter Gerard without his pedigree is a mere flash in the pan and I defy him to prove anything without the deed of seventy seven Well he has not got that said Lord de Mowbray Safe of course said mister Hatton Certain I almost wish I had burnt it as well as the whole box full Destroy that deed and the other muniments and the Earl de Mowbray will never be Baron Valence said mister Hatton But what use are these deeds now said his lordship If we produce them we may give a colour to this fellow s claim Time will settle his claim said mister Hatton it will mature yours You can wait Alas since the death of my poor boy It has become doubly important Substantiate the barony it will descend to your eldest daughter who even if married will retain your name Your family will live and ennobled The Fitz Warenes Lords Valence will yield to none in antiquity and as to rank as long as Mowbray Castle belongs to them the revival of the earldom is safe at the first coronation or the first ministry that exists with a balanced state of parties That is the right view of the case said Lord de Mowbray and what do you advise Be calm and you have nothing to fear This is the mere revival of an old claim too vast to be allowed to lapse from desuetude Your documents you say are all secure Be sure of that They are at this moment in the muniment room of the great tower of Mowbray Castle in the same iron box and in the same cabinet they were deposited When by placing them in your hands said mister Hatton finishing a sentence which might have been awkward I had the extreme satisfaction of confirming the rights and calming the anxieties of one of our ancient houses I would recommend your lordship to instruct your lawyers to appear to this writ as a matter of course But enter into no details no unnecessary confidence with them They are needless Treat the matter lightly especially to them You will hear no more of it You feel confidence Perfect Walter Gerard has no documents of any kind Whatever his claim might be good or bad the only evidence that can prove his pedigree is in your possession and the only use to which it ever will be put will be in due time to seat your grandson in the House of Lords I am glad I called upon you said Lord Mowbray To be sure Your lordship can speak to me without reserve and I am used to these start ups It is part of the trade but an old soldier is not to be deceived by such feints Clearly a feint you think A feint a feint Good morning I am glad I have called How goes on my friend Sir Vavasour Oh I shall land him at last Well he is an excellent neighbourly man I have a great respect for Sir Vavasour Would you dine with me mister Hatton on Thursday It would give me and Lady de Mowbray great pleasure Your lordship is extremely kind said mister Hatton bowing with a slight sarcastic smile but I am an hermit But your friends should see you sometimes said Lord de Mowbray Your lordship is too good but I am a mere man of business and know my position I feel I am not at home in ladies society Well then come to morrow I am alone and I will ask some persons to meet you whom you know and like Sir Vavasour and Lord Shaftesbury and a most learned Frenchman who is over here a Vicomte de Narbonne who is very anxious to make your acquaintance Your name is current I can tell you at Paris Your lordship is too good another day I have a great pressure of affairs at present Well well so be it Good morning mister Hatton Hatton bowed lowly The moment the door was shut rubbing his hands he said In the same box and in the same cabinet the muniment room in the great tower of Mowbray Castle They exist and I know their whereabouts I ll have em Book four Chapter fourteen Two and even three days had rolled over since mister Tadpole had reported Sir Robert on his way to the palace and marvellously little had transpired It was of course known that a cabinet was in formation and the daily papers reported to the public the diurnal visits of certain noble lords and right honourable gentlemen to the new first minister But the world of high politics had suddenly become so cautious that nothing leaked out Even gossip was at fault Lord Marney had not received the Buckhounds though he never quitted his house for ride or lounge without leaving precise instructions with Captain Grouse as to the identical time he should return home so that his acceptance should not be delayed Ireland was not yet governed by the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine and the Earl de Mowbray was still ungartered These three distinguished noblemen were all of them anxious a little fidgetty but at the same time it was not even whispered that Lord Rambrooke or any other lord had received the post which Lord Marney had appropriated to himself nor had Lord Killcroppy had a suspicious interview with the prime minister which kept the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine quiet though not easy while not a shadow of coming events had glanced over the vacant stall of Lord Ribbonville in saint George s Chapel and this made Lord de Mowbray tranquil though scarcely content In the meantime daily and hourly they all pumped mister Tadpole who did not find it difficult to keep up his reputation for discretion for knowing nothing and beginning himself to be perplexed at the protracted silence he took refuge in oracular mystery and delivered himself of certain Delphic sentences which adroitly satisfied those who consulted him while they never committed himself At length one morning there was an odd whisper in the circle of first initiation The blood mantled on the cheek of Lady saint Julians Lady Deloraine turned pale Lady Firebrace wrote confidential notes with the same pen to mister Tadpole and Lord Masque Lord Marney called early in the morning on the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine and already found Lord de Mowbray there The clubs were crowded even at noon Everywhere a mysterious bustle and an awful stir What could be the matter What has happened It is true said mister Egerton to mister Berners at Brookes Is it true asked mister Jermyn of Lord Valentine at the Canton I heard it last night at Crockford s said mister Ormsby one always hears things there four and twenty hours before other places The world was employed the whole of the morning in asking and answering this important question Is it true Towards dinner time it was settled universally in the affirmative and then the world went out to dine and to ascertain why it was true and how it was true And now what really had happened What had happened was what is commonly called a hitch There was undoubtedly a hitch somewhere and somehow a hitch in the construction of the new cabinet Who could have thought it The whig ministers it seems had resigned but somehow or other had not entirely and completely gone out What a constitutional dilemma The Houses must evidently meet address the throne and impeach its obstinate counsellors Clearly the right course and party feeling ran so high that it was not impossible that something might be done At any rate it was a capital opportunity for the House of Lords to pluck up a little courage and take what is called in high political jargon the initiative Lord Marney at the suggestion of mister Tadpole was quite ready to do this and so was the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine and almost the Earl de Mowbray But then when all seemed ripe and ready and there appeared a probability of the Independence of the House of Lords being again the favourite toast of conservative dinners the oddest rumour in the world got about which threw such a ridicule on these great constitutional movements in petto that even with the Buckhounds in the distance and Tadpole at his elbow Lord Marney hesitated It seemed though of course no one could for a moment credit it that these wrong headed rebellious ministers who would not go out wore petticoats And the great Jamaica debate that had been cooked so long and the anxiously expected yet almost despaired of defection of the independent radical section and the full dressed visit to the palace that had gladdened the heart of Tadpole were they all to end in this Was Conservatism that mighty mystery of the nineteenth century was it after all to be brained by a fan Since the farce of the Invincibles nothing had ever been so ludicrously successful Lady Deloraine consoled herself for the Bedchamber Plot by declaring that Lady saint Julians was indirectly the cause of it and that had it not been for the anticipation of her official entrance into the royal apartments the conspiracy would not have been more real than the Meal tub plot or any other of the many imaginary machinations that still haunt the page of history and occasionally flit about the prejudiced memory of nations Lady saint Julians on the contrary wrung her hands over the unhappy fate of her enthralled sovereign deprived of her faithful presence and obliged to put up with the society of personages of whom she knew nothing and who called themselves the friends of her youth The ministers who had missed especially those who had received their appointments looked as all men do when they are jilted embarrassed and affecting an awkward ease as if they knew something which if they told would free them from the supreme ridicule of their situation but which as men of delicacy and honour they refrained from revealing All those who had been in fluttering hopes however faint of receiving preferment took courage now that the occasion had passed and loudly complained of their cruel and undeniable deprivation The constitution was wounded in their persons Some fifty gentlemen who had not been appointed under secretaries of state moaned over the martyrdom of young ambition Peel ought to have taken office said Lord Marney What are the women to us Peel ought to have taken office said the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine He should have remembered how much he owed to Ireland Peel ought to have taken office said Lord de Mowbray The garter will become now a mere party badge Perhaps it may be allowed to the impartial pen that traces these memoirs of our times to agree though for a different reason with these distinguished followers of Sir Robert Peel One may be permitted to think that under all circumstances he should have taken office in eighteen thirty nine His withdrawal seems to have been a mistake In the great heat of parliamentary faction which had prevailed since eighteen thirty one the royal prerogative which unfortunately for the rights and liberties and social welfare of the people had since sixteen eighty eight been more or less oppressed had waned fainter and fainter A youthful princess on the throne whose appearance touched the imagination and to whom her people were generally inclined to ascribe something of that decision of character which becomes those born to command offered a favourable opportunity to restore the exercise of that regal authority the usurpation of whose functions has entailed on the people of England so much suffering and so much degradation It was unfortunate that one who if any should have occupied the proud and national position of the leader of the tory party the chief of the people and the champion of the throne should have commenced his career as minister under Victoria by an unseemly contrariety to the personal wishes of the Queen The reaction of public opinion disgusted with years of parliamentary tumult and the incoherence of party legislation the balanced state in the kingdom of political parties themselves the personal character of the sovereign these were all causes which intimated that a movement in favour of prerogative was at hand The leader of the tory party should have vindicated his natural position and availed himself of the gracious occasion he missed it and as the occasion was inevitable the whigs enjoyed its occurrence And thus England witnessed for the first time the portentous anomaly of the oligarchical or Venetian party which had in the old days destroyed the free monarchy of England retaining power merely by the favour of the Court But we forget Sir Robert Peel is not the leader of the Tory party the party that resisted the ruinous mystification that metamorphosed direct taxation by the Crown into indirect taxation by the Commons that denounced the system that mortgaged industry to protect property the party that ruled Ireland by a scheme which reconciled both churches and by a series of parliaments which counted among them lords and commons of both religions that has maintained at all times the territorial constitution of England as the only basis and security for local government and which nevertheless once laid on the table of the House of Commons a commercial tariff negociated at Utrecht which is the most rational that was ever devised by statesmen a party that has prevented the Church from being the salaried agent of the state and has supported through many struggles the parochial polity of the country which secures to every labourer a home In a parliamentary sense that great party has ceased to exist but I will believe it still lives in the thought and sentiment and consecrated memory of the English nation It has its origin in great principles and in noble instincts it sympathises with the lowly it looks up to the Most High it can count its heroes and its martyrs they have met in its behalf plunder proscription and death Nor when it finally yielded to the iron progress of oligarchical supremacy was its catastrophe inglorious Its genius was vindicated in golden sentences and with fervent arguments of impassioned logic by saint John and breathed in the intrepid eloquence and patriot soul of William Wyndham Even now it is not dead but sleepeth and in an age of political materialism of confused purposes and perplexed intelligence that aspires only to wealth because it has faith in no other accomplishment as men rifle cargoes on the verge of shipwreck Toryism will yet rise from the tomb over which Bolingbroke shed his last tear to bring back strength to the Crown liberty to the Subject and to announce that power has only one duty to secure the social welfare of the PEOPLE Book four Chapter fifteen During the week of political agitation which terminated with the inglorious catastrophe of the Bedchamber plot Sybil remained tranquil and would have been scarcely conscious of what was disturbing so many right honourable hearts had it not been for the incidental notice of their transactions by her father and his friends To the chartists indeed the factious embroilment at first was of no great moment except as the breaking up and formation of cabinets might delay the presentation of the National Petition They had long ceased to distinguish between the two parties who then and now contend for power And they were tight Between the noble lord who goes out and the right honourable gentleman who comes in where is the distinctive principle A shadowy difference may be simulated in opposition to serve a cry and stimulate the hustings but the mask is not even worn in Downing Street and the conscientious conservative seeks in the pigeon holes of a whig bureau for the measures against which for ten years he has been sanctioning by the speaking silence of an approving nod a general wail of frenzied alarm Once it was otherwise once the people recognised a party in the state whose principles identified them with the rights and privileges of the multitude but when they found the parochial constitution of the country sacrificed without a struggle and a rude assault made on all local influences in order to establish a severely organised centralisation a blow was given to the influence of the priest and of the gentleman the ancient champions of the people against arbitrary courts and rapacious parliaments from which they will find that it requires no ordinary courage and wisdom to recover The unexpected termination of the events of May eighteen thirty nine in the re establishment in power of a party confessedly too weak to carry on the parliamentary government of the country was viewed however by the chartists in a very different spirit to that with which they had witnessed the outbreak of these transactions It had unquestionably a tendency to animate their efforts and imparted a bolder tone to their future plans and movements They were encouraged to try a fall with a feeble administration Gerard from this moment became engrossed in affairs his correspondence greatly increased and he was so much occupied that Sybil saw daily less and less of her father It was on the morning after the day that Hatton had made his first and unlooked for visit in Smith s Square some of the delegates who had caught the rumour of the resignation of the whigs had called early on Gerard and he had soon after left the house in their company and Sybil was alone The strange incidents of the preceding day were revolving in her mind as her eye wandered vaguely over her book The presence of that Hatton who had so often and in such different scenes occupied their conversation the re appearance of that stranger whose unexpected entrance into their little world had eighteen months ago so often lent interest and pleasure to their life these were materials for pensive sentiment mister Franklin had left some gracious memories with Sybil the natural legacy of one so refined intelligent and gentle whose temper seemed never ruffled and who evidently so sincerely relished their society Mowedale rose before her in all the golden beauty of its autumnal hour their wild rambles and hearty greetings and earnest converse when her father returned from his daily duties and his eye kindled with pleasure as the accustomed knock announced the arrival of his almost daily companion In spite of the excitement of the passing moment its high hopes and glorious aspirations and visions perchance of greatness and of power the eye of Sybil was dimmed with emotion as she recalled that innocent and tranquil dream Her father had heard from Franklin after his departure more than once but his letters though abounding in frank expressions of deep interest in the welfare of Gerard and his daughter were in some degree constrained a kind of reserve seemed to envelope him they never learnt anything of his life and duties he seemed sometimes as it were meditating a departure from his country There was undoubtedly about him something mysterious and unsatisfactory Morley was of opinion that he was a spy Gerard less suspicious ultimately concluded that he was harassed by his creditors and when at Mowedale was probably hiding from them And now the mystery was at length dissolved And what an explanation A Norman a noble an oppressor of the people a plunderer of the church all the characters and capacities that Sybil had been bred up to look upon with fear and aversion and to recognise as the authors of the degradation of her race Sybil sighed the door opened and Egremont stood before her The blood rose to her cheek her heart trembled for the first time in his presence she felt embarrassed and constrained His countenance on the contrary was collected serious and pale I am an intruder he said advancing but I wish much to speak to you and he seated himself near her There was a momentary pause You seemed to treat with scorn yesterday resumed Egremont in accents less sustained the belief that sympathy was independent of the mere accidents of position Pardon me Sybil but even you may be prejudiced He paused I should be sorry to treat anything you said with scorn replied Sybil in a subdued tone Many things happened yesterday she added which might be offered as some excuse for an unguarded word Would that it had been unguarded said Egremont in a voice of melancholy I could have endured it with less repining No Sybil I have known you I have had the happiness and the sorrow of knowing you too well to doubt the convictions of your mind or to believe that they can be lightly removed and yet I would strive to remove them You look upon me as an enemy as a natural foe because I am born among the privileged I am a man Sybil as well as a noble Again he paused she looked down but did not speak And can I not feel for men my fellows whatever be their lot I know you will deny it but you are in error Sybil you have formed your opinions upon tradition not upon experience The world that exists is not the world of which you have read the class that calls itself your superior is not the same class as ruled in the time of your fathers There is a change in them as in all other things and I participate that change I shared it before I knew you Sybil and if it touched me then at least believe it does not influence me less now If there be a change said Sybil it is because in some degree the People have learnt their strength Ah dismiss from your mind those fallacious fancies said Egremont The People are not strong the People never can be strong Their attempts at self vindication will end only in their suffering and confusion It is civilisation that has effected that is effecting this change It is that increased knowledge of themselves that teaches the educated their social duties There is a dayspring in the history of this nation which those who are on the mountain tops can as yet perhaps only recognize You deem you are in darkness and I see a dawn The new generation of the aristocracy of England are not tyrants not oppressors Sybil as you persist in believing Their intelligence better than that their hearts are open to the responsibility of their position But the work that is before them is no holiday work It is not the fever of superficial impulse that can remove the deep fixed barriers of centuries of ignorance and crime Enough that their sympathies are awakened time and thought will bring the rest They are the natural leaders of the People Sybil believe me they are the only ones The leaders of the People are those whom the People trust said Sybil rather haughtily And who may betray them said Egremont Betray them exclaimed Sybil And can you believe that my father No no you can feel Sybil though I cannot express how much I honour your father But he stands alone in the singleness and purity of his heart Who surround him Those whom the People have also chosen and from a like confidence in their virtues and abilities They are a senate supported by the sympathy of millions with only one object in view the emancipation of their race It is a sublime spectacle these delegates of labour advocating the sacred cause in a manner which might shame your haughty factions What can resist a demonstration so truly national What can withstand the supremacy of its moral power Her eye met the glance of Egremont That brow full of thought and majesty was fixed on his He encountered that face radiant as a seraph s those dark eyes flashing with the inspiration of the martyr Egremont rose moved slowly to the window gazed in abstraction for a few moments on the little garden with its dank turf that no foot ever trod its mutilated statue and its mouldering frescoes What a silence how profound What a prospect how drear Suddenly he turned and advancing with a more rapid pace he approached Sybil Her head was averted and leaning on her left arm she seemed lost in reverie Egremont fell upon his knee and gently taking her hand he pressed it to his lips She started she looked round agitated alarmed while he breathed forth in tremulous accents Let me express to you my adoration Ah not now for the first time but for ever from the moment I first beheld you in the starlit arch of Marney has your spirit ruled my being and softened every spring of my affections I followed you to your home and lived for a time content in the silent worship of your nature When I came the last morning to the cottage it was to tell and to ask all Since then for a moment your image has never been absent from my consciousness your picture consecrates my hearth and your approval has been the spur of my career Do not reject my love it is deep as your nature and fervent as my own Banish those prejudices that have embittered your existence and if persisted in may wither mine Deign to retain this hand If I be a noble I have none of the accidents of nobility I cannot offer you wealth splendour or power but I can offer you the devotion of an entranced being aspirations that you shall guide an ambition that you shall govern These words are mystical and wild said Sybil with an amazed air they come upon me with convulsive suddenness And she paused for an instant collecting as it were her mind with an expression almost of pain upon her countenance These changes of life are so strange and rapid that it seems to me I can scarcely meet them You are Lord Marney s brother it was but yesterday only but yesterday I learnt it I thought then I had lost your friendship and now you speak of love Love of me Retain your hand and share your life and fortunes You forget what I am But though I learnt only yesterday what you are I will not be so remiss Once you wrote upon a page you were my faithful friend and I have pondered over that line with kindness often I will be your faithful friend I will recall you to yourself I will at least not bring you shame and degradation O Sybil beloved beautiful Sybil not such bitter words no no No bitterness to you that would indeed be harsh and she covered with her hand her streaming eyes Why what is this after a pause and with an effort she exclaimed An union between the child and brother of nobles and a daughter of the people Estrangement from your family and with cause their hopes destroyed their pride outraged alienation from your order and justly all their prejudices insulted You will forfeit every source of worldly content and cast off every spring of social success Society for you will become a great confederation to deprive you of self complacency And rightly Will you not be a traitor to the cause No no kind friend for such I ll call you Your opinion of me too good and great as I feel it touches me deeply I am not used to such passages in life I have read of such Pardon me feel for me if I receive them with some disorder They sound to me for the first time and for the last Perhaps they ought never to have reached my ear No matter now I have a life of penitence before me and I trust I shall be pardoned And she wept You have indeed punished me for the fatal accident of birth if it deprives me of you Not so she added weeping I shall never be the bride of earth and but for one whose claims though earthly are to me irresistible I should have ere this forgotten my hereditary sorrows in the cloister All this time Egremont had retained her hand which she had not attempted to withdraw He had bent his head over it as she spoke it was touched with his tears For some moments there was silence then looking up and in a smothered voice Egremont made one more effort to induce Sybil to consider his suit He combated her views as to the importance to him of the sympathies of his family and of society he detailed to her his hopes and plans for their future welfare he dwelt with passionate eloquence on his abounding love But with a solemn sweetness and as it were a tender inflexibility the tears trickling down her beautiful cheek and pressing his hand in both of hers she subdued and put aside all his efforts Believe me she said the gulf is impassable END OF THE FOURTH BOOK BOOK V Book five Chapter one Terrible news from Birmingham said mister Egerton at Brookes They have massacred the police beat off the military and sacked the town News just arrived I have known it these two hours said a grey headed gentleman speaking without taking his eyes off the newspaper There is a cabinet sitting now Well I always said so said mister Egerton our fellows ought to have put down that Convention It is deuced lucky said mister Berners that the Bedchamber business is over and we are all right This affair in the midst of the Jamaica hitch would have been fatal to us These chartists evidently act upon a system said mister Egerton You see they were perfectly quiet till the National Petition was presented and debated and now almost simultaneously with our refusing to consider their petition we have news of this outbreak I hope they will not spread said the grey headed gentleman There are not troops enough in the country if there be anything like a general movement I hear they have sent the guards down by a special train and a hundred more of the police London is not over garrisoned They are always ready for a riot at Birmingham said a Warwickshire peer Trade is very bad there and they suffer a good deal But I should think it would not go farther I am told said the grey headed gentleman that business is getting slack in all the districts It might be better said mister Egerton but they have got work Here several gentlemen entered enquiring whether the evening papers were in and what was the news from Birmingham I am told said one of them that the police were regularly smashed Is it true that the military were really beat off Quite untrue the fact is there were no proper preparations the town was taken by surprise the magistrates lost their heads the people were masters of the place and when the police did act they were met by a triumphant populace who two hours before would have fled before them They say they have burnt down above forty houses It is a bad thing this beating the police said the grey headed gentleman But what is the present state of affairs enquired mister Berners Are the rioters put down Not in the least said mister Egerton as I hear They are encamped in the Bull Ring amid smoking ruins and breathe nothing but havoc Well I voted for taking the National Petition into consideration said mister Berners It could do us no harm and would have kept things quiet So did every fellow on our side said mister Egerton who was not in office or about to be Well Heaven knows what may come next The Charter may some day be as popular in this club as the Reform Act The oddest thing in that debate said mister Berners was Egremont s move I saw Marney last night at Lady saint Julians said mister Egerton and congratulated him on his brother s speech He looked daggers and grinned like a ghoul It was a very remarkable speech that of Egremont said the grey headed gentleman I wonder what he wants I think he must be going to turn radical said the Warwickshire peer Why the whole speech was against radicalism said mister Egerton Ah then he is going to turn whig I suppose He is ultra anti whig said Egerton Then what the deuce is he said mister Berners Not a conservative certainly for Lady saint Julians does nothing but abuse him I suppose he is crotchetty suggested the Warwickshire noble That speech of Egremont was the most really democratic speech that I ever read said the grey headed gentleman How was it listened to Oh capitally said mister Egerton He has very seldom spoken before and always slightly though well He was listened to with mute attention never was a better house I should say made a great impression though no one knew exactly what he was after What does he mean by obtaining the results of the charter without the intervention of its machinery enquired Lord Loraine a mild middle aged lounging languid man who passed his life in crossing from Brookes to Boodle s and from Boodle s to Brookes and testing the comparative intelligence of these two celebrated bodies himself gifted with no ordinary abilities cultivated with no ordinary care but the victim of sauntering his sultana queen as it was according to Lord Halifax of the second Charles Stuart He spoke throughout in an exoteric vein said the grey headed gentleman and I apprehend was not very sure of his audience but I took him to mean indeed it was the gist of the speech that if you wished for a time to retain your political power you could only effect your purpose by securing for the people greater social felicity Well that is sheer radicalism said the Warwickshire peer pretending that the People can be better off than they are is radicalism and nothing else I fear if that be radicalism said Lord Loraine we must all take a leaf out of the same book Sloane was saying at Boodle s just now that he looked forward to the winter in his country with horror And they have no manufactures there said mister Egerton Sloane was always a croaker said the Warwickshire peer He always said the New Poor Law would not act and there is no part of the country where it works so well as his own They say at Boodle s there is to be an increase to the army said Lord Loraine ten thousand men immediately decided on by the cabinet this afternoon It could hardly have leaked out by this time said the grey headed gentleman The cabinet were sitting less than an hour ago They have been up a good hour said Lord Loraine quite long enough for their decisions to be known in saint James s Street In the good old times George Farnley used always to walk from Downing Street to this place the moment the council was up and tell us everything Ah those were the good old gentleman like times said mister Berners when members of Parliament had nobody to please and ministers of State nothing to do The riots of Birmingham occurred two months after the events that closed our last volume That period as far as the obvious movements of the chartists were concerned had been passed in preparations for the presentation and discussion of the National Petition which the parliamentary embroilments of the spring of that year had hitherto procrastinated and prevented The petition was ultimately carried down to Westminster on a triumphal car accompanied by all the delegates of the Convention in solemn procession It was necessary to construct a machine in order to introduce the huge bulk of parchment signed by a million and a half of persons into the House of Commons and thus supported its vast form remained on the floor of the House during the discussion The House after a debate which was not deemed by the people commensurate with the importance of the occasion decided on rejecting the prayer of the Petition and from that moment the party in the Convention who advocated a recourse to physical force in order to obtain their purpose was in the ascendant The National Petition and the belief that although its objects would not at present be obtained still that a solemn and prolonged debate on its prayer would at least hold out to the working classes the hope that their rights might from that date rank among the acknowledged subjects of parliamentary discussion and ultimately by the force of discussion be recognized as other rights of other portions of the people once equally disputed had been the means by which the party in the Convention who upheld on all occasions the supremacy of moral power had been able to curb the energetic and reckless minority who derided from the first all other methods but terror and violence as effective of their end The hopes of all the vanity of many were frustrated and shocked by finding that the exertions and expenditure of long months were not only fruitless but had not even attracted as numerous an assembly or excited as much interest as an ordinary party struggle on some petty point of factitious interest forgotten as soon as fought The attention of the working classes was especially called by their leaders to the contrast between the interest occasioned by the endangered constitution of Jamaica a petty and exhausted colony and the claims for the same constitutional rights by the working millions of England In the first instance not a member was absent from his place men were brought indeed from distant capitals to participate in the struggle and to decide it the debate lasted for days almost for weeks not a public man of light and leading in the country withheld the expression of his opinion the fate of governments was involved in it cabinets were overthrown and reconstructed in the throes and tumult of the strife and for the first time for a long period the Sovereign personally interposed in public transactions with a significance of character which made the working classes almost believe that the privileged had at last found a master and the unfranchished regained their natural chief The mean position which the Saxon multitude occupied as distinguished from the Jamaica planters sunk deep into their hearts From that moment all hope of relief from the demonstration of a high moral conduct in the millions and the exhibition of that well regulated order of public life which would intimate their fitness for the possession and fulfilment of public rights vanished The party of violence a small minority as is usually the case but consisting of men of determined character triumphed and the outbreak at Birmingham was the first consequence of those reckless councils that were destined in the course of the ensuing years to inflict on the working classes of this country so much suffering and disaster It was about this time a balmy morning of July that Sybil tempted by the soft sunshine and a longing for the sight of flowers and turf and the spread of winding waters went forth from her gloomy domicile to those beautiful gardens that bloom in that once melancholy region of marsh celebrated in old days only for its Dutch canal and its Chinese bridge and now not unworthy of the royal park that incloses them Except here and there a pretty nursery maid with her interesting charge some beautiful child with nodding plume immense bow and gorgeous sash the gardens were vacant Indeed it was only at this early hour that Sybil found from experience that it was agreeable in London for a woman unaccompanied to venture abroad There is no European city where our fair sisters are so little independent as in our metropolis to our shame Something of the renovating influence of a beautiful nature was needed by the daughter of Gerard She was at this moment anxious and dispirited The outbreak at Birmingham the conviction that such proceedings must ultimately prove fatal to the cause to which she was devoted the dark apprehension that her father was in some manner implicated in this movement that had commenced with so much public disaster and which menaced consequences still more awful all these events and fears and sad forebodings acted with immense influence on a temperament which though gifted with even a sublime courage was singularly sensitive The quick and teeming imagination of Sybil conjured up a thousand fears which were in some degree unfounded in a great degree exaggerated but this is the inevitable lot of the creative mind practising on the inexperienced The shock too had been sudden The two months that had elapsed since she had parted as she supposed for ever from Egremont while they had not less abounded than the preceding time in that pleasing public excitement which her father s career in her estimation alike useful honourable and distinguished occasioned her had been fruitful in some sources of satisfaction of a softer and more domestic character The acquaintance of Hatton of whom they saw a great deal had very much contributed to the increased amenity of her life He was a most agreeable instructive and obliging companion who seemed peculiarly to possess the art of making life pleasant by the adroit management of unobtrusive resources He lent Sybil books and all that he recommended to her notice were of a kind that harmonized with her sentiment and taste He furnished her from his library with splendid works of art illustrative of those periods of our history and those choice and costly edifices which were associated with her fondest thought and fancy He placed in her room the best periodical literature of the day which for her was a new world he furnished her with newspapers whose columns of discussion taught her that the opinions she had embraced were not unquestioned as she had never seen a journal in her life before except a stray number of the Mowbray Phalanx or the metropolitan publication which was devoted to the cause of the National Convention and reported her father s speeches the effect of this reading on her intelligence was to say the least suggestive Many a morning too when Gerard was disengaged Hatton would propose that they should show Sybil something of the splendour or the rarities of the metropolis its public buildings museums and galleries of art Sybil though uninstructed in painting had that native taste which requires only observation to arrive at true results She was much interested with all she saw and all that occurred and her gratification was heightened by the society of an individual who not only sympathised with all she felt but who if she made an inquiry was ever ready with an instructive reply Hatton poured forth the taste and treasures of a well stored and refined intelligence And then too always easy bland and considerate and though with luxuries and conveniences at his command to participate in which under any other circumstances might have been embarrassing to his companions with so much tact that either by an allusion to early days happy days when he owed so much to Gerard s father or some other mode equally felicitous he contrived completely to maintain among them the spirit of social equality In the evening Hatton generally looked in when Gerard was at home and on Sundays they were always together Their common faith was a bond of union which led them to the same altar and on that day Hatton had obtained their promise always to dine with him He was careful to ascertain each holy day at what chapel the music was most exquisite that the most passionate taste of Sybil might be gratified Indeed during this residence in London the opportunity it afforded of making her acquainted with some of the great masters of the human voice was perhaps to Sybil a source of pleasure not the least important For though it was not deemed consistent with the future discipline which she contemplated to enter a theatre there were yet occasions which permitted her under every advantage to listen to the performance of the master pieces of sacred melody Alone with Hatton and her father she often poured forth those tones of celestial sweetness and etherial power that had melted the soul of Egremont amid the ruins of Marney Abbey More intimately acquainted with Sybil Gerard Hatton had shrunk from the project that he had at first so crudely formed There was something about her that awed while it fascinated him He did not relinquish his purpose for it was a rule of his life never to do that but he postponed the plans of its fulfilment Hatton was not what is commonly understood by the phrase in love with Sybil certainly not passionately in love with her With all his daring and talents and fine taste there was in Hatton such a vein of thorough good sense that it was impossible for him to act or even to think anything that was ridiculous He wished still to marry Sybil for the great object that we have stated he had a mind quite equal to appreciate her admirable qualities but sense enough to wish that she were a less dazzling creature because then he would have a better chance of accomplishing his end He perceived when he had had a due opportunity to study her character that the cloister was the natural catastrophe impending over a woman who with an exalted mind great abilities a fine and profound education and almost supernatural charms found herself born and rooted in the ranks of a degraded population All this Hatton understood it was a conclusion he had gradually arrived at by a gradual process of induction and by a vigilant observation that in its study of character had rarely been deceived and when one evening with an art that could not be suspected he sounded Gerard on the future of his daughter he found that the clear intellect and straight forward sagacity of the father had arrived at the same result She wishes said Gerard to take the veil and I only oppose it for a time that she may have some knowledge of life and a clear conception of what she is about to do I wish not that she should hereafter reproach her father But to my mind Sybil is right She cannot look to marriage no man that she could marry would be worthy of her During these two months and especially during the last Morley was rarely in London though ever much with Gerard and often with his daughter during his visits The necessary impulse had been given to the affairs of the Convention the delegates had visited the members the preparations for the presentation of the National Petition had been completed the overthrow of the whig government the abortive effort of Sir Robert Peel the return of the whig administration and the consequent measures had occasioned a delay of two months in the presentation of the great document it was well for Gerard to remain who was a leader in debate and whose absence for a week would have endangered his position as the head of a party but these considerations did not influence Morley who had already found great inconvenience in managing his journal at a distance so about the middle of May he had returned to Mowbray coming up occasionally by the train if anything important were stirring or his vote could be of service to his friend and colleague The affair of Birmingham however had alarmed Morley and he had written up to Gerard that he should instantly repair to town Indeed he was expected the very morning that Sybil her father having gone to the Convention where there were at this very moment very fiery debates went forth to take the morning air of summer in the gardens of saint James Park It was a real summer day large round glossy fleecy clouds as white and shining as glaciers studded with their immense and immoveable forms the deep blue sky There was not even a summer breeze though the air was mellow balmy and exhilarating There was a bloom upon the trees the waters glittered the prismatic wild fowl dived breathed again and again disappeared Beautiful children fresh and sweet as the new born rose glanced about with the gestures and sometimes the voices of Paradise And in the distance rose the sacred towers of the great Western Minster How fair is a garden amid the toils and passions of existence A curse upon those who vulgarize and desecrate these holy haunts breaking the hearts of nursery maids and smoking tobacco in the palace of the rose The mental clouds dispelled as Sybil felt the freshness and fragrance of nature The colour came to her cheek the deep brightness returned to her eye her step that at first had been languid and if not melancholy at least contemplative became active and animated She forgot the cares of life and was touched by all the sense of its enjoyment To move to breathe to feel the sunbeam were sensible and surpassing pleasures Cheerful by nature notwithstanding her stately thoughts and solemn life a brilliant smile played on her seraphic face as she marked the wild passage of the daring birds or watched the thoughtless grace of infancy She rested herself on a bench beneath a branching elm and her eye that for some time had followed the various objects that had attracted it was now fixed in abstraction on the sunny waters The visions of past life rose before her It was one of those reveries when the incidents of our existence are mapped before us when each is considered with relation to the rest and assumes in our knowledge its distinct and absolute position when as it were we take stock of our experience and ascertain how rich sorrow and pleasure feeling and thought intercourse with our fellow creatures and the fortuitous mysteries of life have made us in wisdom The quick intelligence and the ardent imagination of Sybil had made her comprehend with fervor the two ideas that had been impressed on her young mind the oppression of her church and the degradation of her people Educated in solitude and exchanging thoughts only with individuals of the same sympathies these impression had resolved themselves into one profound and gloomy conviction that the world was divided only between the oppressors and the oppressed With her to be one of the people was to be miserable and innocent one of the privileged a luxurious tyrant In the cloister in her garden amid the scenes of suffering which she often visited and always solaced she had raised up two phantoms which with her represented human nature But the experience of the last few months had operated a great change in these impressions She had seen enough to suspect that the world was a more complicated system than she had preconceived There was not that strong and rude simplicity in its organization she had supposed The characters were more various the motives more mixed the classes more blended the elements of each more subtle and diversified than she had imagined The People she found was not that pure embodiment of unity of feeling of interest and of purpose which she had pictured in her abstractions The people had enemies among the people their own passions which made them often sympathize often combine with the privileged Her father with all his virtues all his abilities singleness of purpose and simplicity of aim encountered rivals in their own Convention and was beset by open or still worse secret foes Sybil whose mind had been nurtured with great thoughts and with whom success or failure alike partook of the heroic who had hoped for triumph but who was prepared for sacrifice found to her surprise that great thoughts have very little to do with the business of the world that human affairs even in an age of revolution are the subject of compromise and that the essence of compromise is littleness She thought that the People calm and collected conscious at last of their strength and confident in their holy cause had but to express their pure and noble convictions by the delegates of their choice and that an antique and decrepid authority must bow before the irresistible influence of their moral power These delegates of their choice turned out to be a plebeian senate of wild ambitions and sinister and selfish ends while the decrepid authority that she had been taught existed only by the sufferance of the millions was compact and organized with every element of physical power at its command and supported by the interests the sympathies the honest convictions and the strong prejudices of classes influential not merely from their wealth but even by their numbers Nor could she resist the belief that the feeling of the rich towards the poor was not that sentiment of unmingled hate and scorn which she associated with Norman conquerors and feudal laws She would ascribe rather the want of sympathy that unquestionably exists between Wealth and Work in England to mutual ignorance between the classes which possess these two great elements of national prosperity and though the source of that ignorance was to be sought in antecedent circumstances of violence and oppression the consequences perhaps had outlived the causes as customs survive opinions Sybil looked towards Westminster to those proud and passionate halls where assembles the Parliament of England that rapacious violent and haughty body that had brought kings and prelates to the block spoiled churches and then seized the sacred manors for their personal prey invested their own possessions with infinite privileges and then mortgaged for their state and empire the labour of countless generations Could the voice of solace sound from such a quarter Sybil unfolded a journal which she had brought not now to be read for the first time but now for the first time to be read alone undisturbed in a scene of softness and serenity It contained a report of the debate in the House of Commons on the presentation of the National Petition that important document which had been the means of drawing forth Sybil from her solitude and of teaching her something of that world of which she had often pondered and yet which she had so inaccurately preconceived Yes there was one voice that had sounded in that proud Parliament that free from the slang of faction had dared to express immortal truths the voice of a noble who without being a demagogue had upheld the popular cause had pronounced his conviction that the rights of labour were as sacred as those of property that if a difference were to be established the interests of the living wealth ought to be preferred who had declared that the social happiness of the millions should be the first object of a statesman and that if that were not achieved thrones and dominions the pomp and power of courts and empires were alike worthless With a heart not without emotion with a kindling cheek and eyes suffused with tears Sybil read the speech of Egremont She ceased still holding the paper with one hand she laid on it the other with tenderness and looked up to breathe as it were for relief Before her stood the orator himself Book five Chapter two Egremont had recognized Sybil as she entered the garden He was himself crossing the park to attend a committee of the House of Commons which had sat for the first time that morning The meeting had been formal and brief the committee soon adjourned and Egremont repaired to the spot where he was in the hope of still finding Sybil He approached her not without some restraint with reserve and yet with tenderness This is a great an unexpected pleasure indeed he said in a faltering tone She had looked up the expression of an agitation not distressful on her beautiful countenance could not be concealed She smiled through a gushing vision and with a flushed cheek impelled perhaps by her native frankness perhaps by some softer and irresistible feeling of gratitude respect regard she said in a low voice I was reading your beautiful speech Indeed said Egremont much moved that is an honour a pleasure a reward I never could have even hoped to have attained By all continued Sybil with more self possession it must be read with pleasure with advantage but by me oh with what deep interest If anything that I said finds an echo in your breast and here he hesitated it will give me confidence for the future he hurriedly added Ah why do not others feel like you said Sybil all would not then be hopeless But you are not hopeless said Egremont and he seated himself on the bench but at some distance from her Sybil shook her head But when we spoke last said Egremont you were full of confidence in your cause and in your means It is not very long ago said Sybil since we thus spoke and yet time in the interval has taught me some bitter truths Truth is very precious said Egremont to us all and yet I fear I could not sufficiently appreciate the cause that deprived you of your sanguine faith Alas said Sybil mournfully I was but a dreamer of dreams I wake from my hallucination as others have done I suppose before me Like them too I feel the glory of life has gone but my content at least and she bent her head meekly has never rested I hope too much on this world You are depressed dear Sybil I am unhappy I am anxious about my father I fear that he is surrounded by men unworthy of his confidence These scenes of violence alarm me Under any circumstances I should shrink from them but I am impressed with the conviction that they can bring us nothing but disaster and disgrace I honor your father said Egremont I know no man whose character I esteem so truly noble such a just compound of intelligence and courage and gentle and generous impulse I should deeply grieve were he to compromise himself But you have influence over him the greatest as you have over all Counsel him to return to Mowbray Can I give counsel said Sybil I who have been wrong in all my judgments I came up to this city with him to be his guide his guardian What arrogance What short sighted pride I thought the People all felt as I feel that I had nothing to do but to sustain and animate him to encourage him when he flagged to uphold him when he wavered I thought that moral power must govern the world and that moral power was embodied in an assembly whose annals will be a series of petty intrigues or what is worse of violent machinations Exert every energy said Egremont that your father should leave London immediately to morrow to night if possible After this business at Birmingham the government must act I hear that they will immediately increase the army and the police and that there is a circular from the Secretary of State to the Lords Lieutenant of counties But the government will strike at the Convention The members who remain will be the victims If your father return to Mowbray and be quiet he has a chance of not being disturbed An ignoble end of many lofty hopes said Sybil Let us retain our hopes said Egremont and cherish them I have none she replied And I am sanguine said Egremont Ah because you have made a beautiful speech But they will listen to you they will cheer you but they will never follow you The dove and the eagle will not mate the lion and the lamb will not lie down together and the conquerors will never rescue the conquered Egremont shook his head You still will cherish these phantoms dear Sybil and why They are not visions of delight Believe me they are as vain as they are distressing The mind of England is the mind ever of the rising race Trust me it is with the People And not the less so because this feeling is one of which even in a great degree it is unconscious Those opinions which you have been educated to dread and mistrust are opinions that are dying away Predominant opinions are generally the opinions of the generation that is vanishing Let an accident which speculation could not foresee the balanced state at this moment of parliamentary parties cease and in a few years more or less cease it must and you will witness a development of the new mind of England which will make up by its rapid progress for its retarded action I live among these men I know their inmost souls I watch their instincts and their impulses I know the principles which they have imbibed and I know however hindered by circumstances for the moment those principles must bear their fruit It will be a produce hostile to the oligarchical system The future principle of English politics will not be a levelling principle not a principle adverse to privileges but favourable to their extension It will seek to ensure equality not by levelling the Few but by elevating the Many Indulging for some little time in the mutual reflections which the tone of the conversation suggested Sybil at length rose and saying that she hoped by this time her father might have returned bade farewell to Egremont but he also rising would for a time accompany her At the gate of the gardens however she paused and said with a soft sad smile Here we must part and extended to him her hand Heaven will guard over you said Egremont for you are a celestial charge Book five Chapter three As Sybil approached her home she recognized her father in the court before their house accompanied by several men with whom he seemed on the point of going forth She was so anxious to speak to Gerard that she did not hesitate at once to advance There was a stir as she entered the gate the men ceased talking some stood aloof all welcomed her with silent respect With one or two Sybil was not entirely unacquainted at least by name or person To them as she passed she bent her head and then going up to her father who was about to welcome her she said in a tone of calmness and with a semblance of composure If you are going out dear father I should like to see you for one moment first A moment friends said Gerard with your leave and he accompanied his daughter into the house He would have stopped in the hall but she walked on to their room and Gerard though pressed for time was compelled to follow her When they had entered their chamber Sybil closed the door with care and then Gerard sitting or rather leaning carelessly on the edge of the table she said We are once more together dear father we will never again he separated Gerard sprang quickly on his legs his eye kindled his cheek flushed Something has happened to you Sybil No she said shaking her head mournfully not that but something may happen to you How so my child said her father relapsing into his customary good tempered placidity and speaking in an easy measured almost drawling tone that was habitual to him You are in danger said Sybil great and immediate No matter at this moment how I am persuaded of this I wish no mysteries but there is no time for details The government will strike at the Convention they are resolved This outbreak at Birmingham has brought affairs to a crisis They have already arrested the leaders there they will seize those who remain here in avowed correspondence with them If they arrest all who are in correspondence with the Convention said Gerard they will have enough to do Yes but you take a leading part said Sybil you are the individual they would select Would you have me hide myself said Gerard just because something is going on besides talk Besides talk exclaimed Sybil O my father what thoughts are these It may be that words are vain to save us but feeble deeds are vainer far than words I do not see that the deeds though I have nothing to do with them are so feeble said Gerard their boasted police are beaten and by the isolated movement of an unorganized mass What if the outbreak had not been a solitary one What if the people had been disciplined What if everything were changed if everything were contrary to what it is said Sybil The people are not disciplined their action will not be cannot be coherent and uniform these are riots in which you are involved not revolutions and you will be a victim and not a sacrifice Gerard looked thoughtful but not anxious after a momentary pause he said We must not be scared at a few arrests Sybil These are hap hazard pranks of a government that wants to terrify but is itself frightened I have not counselled none of us have counselled this stir at Birmingham It is a casualty We were none of us prepared for it But great things spring from casualties I say the police were beaten and the troops alarmed and I say this was done without organization and in a single spot I am as much against feeble deeds as you can be Sybil and to prove this to you our conversation at the moment you arrived was to take care for the future that there shall be none Neither vain words nor feeble deeds for the future added Gerard and he moved to depart Sybil approached him with gentleness she took his hand as if to bid him farewell she retained it for a moment and looked at him steadfastly in the face with a glance at the same time serious and soft Then throwing her arms round his neck and leaning her cheek upon his breast she murmured Oh my father your child is most unhappy Sybil exclaimed Gerard in a tone of tender reproach this is womanish weakness I love but must not share it It may be womanish said Sybil but it is wise for what should make us unhappy if not the sense of impending yet unknown danger And why danger said Gerard Why mystery said Sybil Why are you ever pre occupied and involved in dark thoughts my father It is not the pressure of business as you will perhaps tell me that occasions this change in a disposition so frank and even careless The pressure of affairs is not nearly as great cannot he nearly as great as in the early period of your assembling when the eyes of the whole country were on you and you were in communication with all parts of it How often have you told me that there was no degree of business which you found irksome Now you are all dispersed and scattered no discussions no committees little correspondence and you yourself are ever brooding and ever in conclave with persons too who I know for Stephen has told me so are the preachers of violence violence perhaps that some of them may preach yet will not practise both bad traitors it may be or at the best hare brained men Stephen is prejudiced said Gerard He is a visionary indulging in impossible dreams and if possible little desirable He knows nothing of the feeling of the country or the character of his countrymen Englishmen want none of his joint stock felicity they want their rights rights consistent with the rights of other classes but without which the rights of other classes cannot and ought not to be secure Stephen is at least your friend my father and once you honoured him And do so now and love him very dearly I honour him for his great abilities and knowledge Stephen is a scholar I have no pretensions that way but I can feel the pulse of a people and can comprehend the signs of the times Sybil Stephen was all very well talking in our cottage and garden at Mowbray when we had nothing to do but now we must act or others will act for us Stephen is not a practical man he is crotchety Sybil and that s just it But violence and action said Sybil are they identical my father I did not speak of violence No but you looked it I know the language of your countenance even to the quiver of your lip Action as you and Stephen once taught me and I think wisely was to prove to our rulers by an agitation orderly and intellectual that we were sensible of our degradation and that it was neither Christianlike nor prudent neither good nor wise to let us remain so That you did and you did it well the respect of the world even of those who differed from you in interest or opinion was not withheld from you and can be withheld from none who exercise the moral power that springs from great talents and a good cause You have let this great moral power this pearl of price said Sybil with emotion we cannot conceal it from ourselves my father you have let it escape from your hands Gerard looked at her as she spoke with an earnestness unusual with him As she ceased he cast his eyes down and seemed for a moment deep in thought then looking up he said The season for words is past I must be gone dear Sybil And he moved towards the door You shall not leave me said Sybil springing forward and seizing his arm What would you what would you said Gerard distressed That we should quit this city to night What quit my post Why yours Have not your colleagues dispersed Is not your assembly formally adjourned to another town Is it not known that the great majority of the delegates have returned to their homes And why not you to yours I have no home said Gerard almost in a voice of harshness I came here to do the business that was wanting and by the blessing of God I will do it I am no changeling nor can I refine and split straws like your philosophers and Morleys but if the people will struggle I will struggle with them and die if need be in the front Nor will I be deterred from my purpose by the tears of a girl and he released himself from the hand of his daughter with abruptness Sybil looked up to heaven with streaming eyes and clasped her hands in unutterable woe Gerard moved again towards the door but before he reached it his step faltered and he turned again and looked at his daughter with tenderness and anxiety She remained in the same position save that her arms that had fallen were crossed before her and her downward glance seemed fixed in deep abstraction Her father approached her unnoticed he took her hand she started and looking round with a cold and distressed expression said in a smothered tone I thought you had gone Not in anger my sweet child and Gerard pressed her to his heart But you go murmured Sybil These men await me said Gerard Our council is of importance We must take some immediate steps for the aid of our brethren in distress at Birmingham and to discountenance similar scenes of outbreak as this affair but the moment this is over I will come back to you and for the rest it shall be as you desire to morrow we will return to Mowbray Sybil returned her father s embrace with a warmth which expressed her sense of his kindness and her own soothed feelings but she said nothing and bidding her now to be of good cheer Gerard quitted the apartment Book five Chapter four The clock of saint John s church struck three and the clock of saint John s church struck four and the fifth hour sounded from saint John s church and the clock of saint John s was sounding six And Gerard had not yet returned The time for a while after his departure had been comparatively light hearted and agreeable Easier in her mind and for a time busied with the preparations for their journey Sybil sate by the open window more serene and cheerful than for a long period had been her wont Sometimes she ceased for a moment from her volume and fell into a reverie of the morrow and of Mowbray Viewed through the magic haze of time and distance the scene of her youth assumed a character of tenderness and even of peaceful bliss She sighed for the days of their cottage and their garden when the discontent of her father was only theoretical and their political conclaves were limited to a discussion between him and Morley on the rights of the people or the principles of society The bright waters of the Mowe and its wooded hills her matin walks to the convent to visit Ursula Trafford a pilgrimage of piety and charity and love the faithful Harold so devoted and so intelligent even the crowded haunts of labour and suffering among which she glided like an angel blessing and blessed they rose before her those touching images of the past and her eyes were suffused with tears of tenderness not of gloom And blended with them the thought of one who had been for a season the kind and gentle companion of her girlhood that mister Franklin whom she had never quite forgotten and who alas was not mister Franklin after all Ah that was a wonderful history a somewhat thrilling chapter in the memory of one so innocent and so young His voice even now lingered in her ear She recalled without an effort those tones of the morning tones of tenderness and yet of wisdom and considerate thought that had sounded only for her welfare Never had Egremont appeared to her in a light so subduing He was what man should be to woman ever gentle and yet a guide A thousand images dazzling and wild rose in her mind a thousand thoughts beautiful and quivering as the twilight clustered round her heart for a moment she indulged in impossible dreams and seemed to have entered a newly discovered world The horizon of her experience expanded like the glittering heaven of a fairy tale Her eye was fixed in lustrous contemplation the flush on her cheek was a messenger from her heart the movement of her mouth would have in an instant become a smile when the clock of saint John s struck four and Sybil started from her reverie The clock of saint John s struck four and Sybil became anxious the clock of saint John s struck five and Sybil became disquieted restless and perturbed she was walking up and down the chamber her books long since thrown aside when the clock of saint John s struck six She clasped her hands and looked up to heaven There was a knock at the street door she herself sprang out to open it It was not Gerard It was Morley Ah Stephen said Sybil with a countenance of undisguised disappointment I thought it was my father I should have been glad to have found him here said Morley However with your permission I will enter And he will soon arrive said Sybil I am sure he will soon arrive I have been expecting him every minute For hours added Morley finishing her sentence as they entered the room The business that he is on he continued throwing himself into a chair with a recklessness very unlike his usual composure and even precision The business that he is on is engrossing Thank Heaven said Sybil we leave this place to morrow Hah said Morley starting who told you so My father has so settled it has indeed promised me that we shall depart And you were anxious to do so Most anxious my mind is prophetic only of mischief to him if we remain Mine too Otherwise I should not have come up today You have seen him I hope said Sybil I have I have been hours with him I am glad At this conference he talked of Yes at this headstrong council and I have seen him since alone Whatever hap to him my conscience is assoiled You terrify me Stephen said Sybil rising from her seat What can happen to him What would he do what would you resist Tell me tell me dear friend Oh yes said Morley pale and with a slight yet bitter smile Oh yes dear friend I said dear friend for so I deemed you said Sybil and so we have ever found you Why do you stare at me so strangely Stephen So you deem me and so you have ever found me said Morley in a slow and measured tone repeating her words Well what more would you have What more should any of us want he asked abruptly I want no more said Sybil innocently I warrant me you do not Well well nothing matters And so he added in his ordinary tone you are waiting for your father Whom you have not long since seen said Sybil and whom you expected to find here No said Morley shaking his head with the same bitter smile no no I didn t I came to find you You have something to tell me said Sybil earnestly Something has happened to my father Do not break it to me tell me at once and she advanced and laid her hand upon his arm Morley trembled and then in a hurried and agitated voice said No no no nothing has happened Much may happen but nothing has happened And we may prevent it We Tell me what may happen tell me what to do Your father said Morley slowly rising from his seat and pacing the room and speaking in a low calm voice Your father and my friend is in this position Sybil he is conspiring against the State Yes yes said Sybil very pale speaking almost in a whisper and with her gaze fixed intently on her companion Tell me all I will He is conspiring I say against the State Tonight they meet in secret to give the last finish to their plans and tonight they will be arrested O God said Sybil clasping her hands He told me truth Who told you truth said Morley springing to her side in a hoarse voice and with an eye of fire A friend said Sybil dropping her arms and bending her head in woe a kind good friend I met him but this morn and he warned me of all this Hah hah said Morley with a sort of stifled laugh Hah hah he told you did he the kind good friend whom you met this morning Did I not warn you Sybil of the traitor Did I not tell you to beware of taking this false aristocrat to your hearth to worm out all the secrets of that home that he once polluted by his espionage and now would desolate by his treason Of whom and what do you speak said Sybil throwing herself into a chair I speak of that base spy Egremont You slander an honourable man said Sybil with dignity mister Egremont has never entered this house since you met him here for the first time save once He needed no entrance to this house to worm out its secrets said Morley maliciously That could be more adroitly done by one who had assignations at command with the most charming of its inmates Unmannerly churl exclaimed Sybil starting in her chair her eye flashing lightning her distended nostril quivering with scorn Oh yes I am a churl said Morley I know I am a churl Were I a noble the daughter of the people would perhaps condescend to treat me with less contempt The daughter of the people loves truth and manly bearing Stephen Morley and will treat with contempt all those who slander women whether they be nobles or serfs And where is the slanderer Ask him who told you I held assignations with mister Egremont or with any one Mine eyes mine own eyes were my informant said Morley This morn the very morn I arrived in London I learnt how your matins were now spent Yes he added in a tone of mournful anguish I passed the gate of the gardens I witnessed your adieus We met by hazard said Sybil in a calm tone and with an expression that denoted she was thinking of other things and in all probability we shall never meet again Talk not of these trifles Stephen my father how can we save him Are they trifles said Morley slowly and earnestly walking to her side and looking her intently in the face Are they indeed trifles Sybil Oh make me credit that and then he paused Sybil returned his gaze the deep lustre of her dark orb rested on his peering vision his eye fled from the unequal contest his heart throbbed his limbs trembled he fell upon his knee Pardon me pardon me he said and he took her hand Pardon the most miserable and the most devoted of men What need of pardon dear Stephen said Sybil in a soothing tone In the agitated hour wild words escape If I have used them I regret if you I have forgotten The clock of saint John s told that the sixth hour was more than half past Ah said Sybil withdrawing her hand you told me how precious was time What can we do Morley rose from his kneeling position and again paced the chamber lost for some moments in deep meditation Suddenly he seized her arm and said I can endure no longer the anguish of my life I love you and if you will not be mine I care for no one s fate I am not born for love said Sybil frightened yet endeavouring to conceal her alarm We are all born for love said Morley It is the principle of existence and its only end And love of you Sybil he continued in a tone of impassioned pathos has been to me for years the hoarded treasure of my life For this I have haunted your hearth and hovered round your home for this I have served your father like a slave and embarked in a cause with which I have little sympathy and which can meet with no success It is your image that has stimulated my ambition developed my powers sustained me in the hour of humiliation and secured me that material prosperity which I can now command Oh deign to share it share it with the impassioned heart and the devoted life that now bow before you and do not shrink from them because they are the feelings and the fortunes of the People You astound you overwhelm me said Sybil agitated You came for another purpose we were speaking of other feelings it is the hour of exigency you choose for these strange these startling words I also have my hour of exigency said Morley and its minutes are now numbering Upon it all depends Another time said Sybil in a low and deprecatory voice speak of these things another time The caverns of my mind are open said Morley and they will not close Stephen said Sybil dear Stephen I am grateful for your kind feelings but indeed this is not the time for such passages cease my friend I came to know my fate said Morley doggedly It is a sacrilege of sentiment said Sybil unable any longer to restrain her emotion to obtrude its expression on a daughter at such a moment You would not deem it so if you loved or if you could love me Sybil said Morley mournfully Why it s a moment of deep feeling and suited for the expression of deep feeling You would not have answered thus if he who had been kneeling here had been named Egremont He would not have adopted a course said Sybil unable any longer to restrain her displeasure so selfish so indecent Ah she loves him exclaimed Morley springing on his legs and with a demoniac laugh There was a pause Under ordinary circumstances Sybil would have left the room and terminated a distressing interview but in the present instance that was impossible for on the continuance of that interview any hope of assisting her father depended Morley had thrown himself into a chair opposite her leaning back in silence with his face covered Sybil was disinclined to revive the conversation about her father because she had already perceived that Morley was only too much aware of the command which the subject gave him over her feelings and even conduct Yet time time now full of terror time was stealing on It was evident that Morley would not break the silence At length unable any longer to repress her tortured heart Sybil said Stephen be generous speak to me of your friend I have no friend said Morley without taking his hands from his face The Saints in heaven have mercy on me said Sybil for I am very wretched No no no said Morley rising rapidly from his seat and again kneeling at her side not wretched not that tone of anguish What can I do what say Sybil dearest Sybil I love you so much so fervently so devotedly none can love you as I do say not you are wretched Alas alas said Sybil What shall I do what say said Morley You know what I would have you say said Sybil Speak of one who is my father if no longer your friend you know what I would have you do save him save him from death and me from despair I am ready said Morley I came for that Listen There is a meeting to night at half past eight o clock they meet to arrange a general rising in the country their intention is known to the government they will be arrested Now it is in my power which it was not when I saw your father this morning to convince him of the truth of this and were I to see him before eight o clock which I could easily do I could prevent his attendance certainly prevent his attendance and he would be saved for the government depend much upon the papers some proclamations and things of that kind which will be signed this evening for their proofs Well I am ready to save Gerard my friend for so I ll call him as you wish it one I have served before and long one whom I came up from Mowbray this day to serve and save I am ready to do that which you require you yourself admit it is no light deed and coming from one you have known so long and as you confess so much regarded should be doubly cherished I am ready to do this great service to save the father from death and the daughter from despair if she would but only say to me I have but one reward and it is yours I have read of something of this sort said Sybil speaking in a murmuring tone and looking round her with a wild expression this bargaining of blood and shall I call it love But that was ever between the oppressors and the oppressed This is the first time that a child of the people has been so assailed by one of her own class and who exercises his power from the confidence which the sympathy of their sorrows alone caused It is bitter bitter for me and mine but for you pollution Am I answered said Morley Yes said Sybil in the name of the holy Virgin Good night then said Morley and he approached the door His hand was on it The voice of Sybil made him turn his head Where do they meet to night she inquired in a smothered tone I am bound to secrecy said Morley There is no softness in your spirit said Sybil I am met with none We have ever been your friends A blossom that has brought no fruit This hour will be remembered at the judgment seat said Sybil The holy Virgin will perhaps interpose for me said Morley with a sneer We have merited this said Sybil who have taken an infidel to our hearts If he had only been a heretic like Egremont said Morley Sybil burst into tears Morley sprang to her Swear by the holy Virgin swear by all the saints swear by your hope of heaven and by your own sweet name without equivocation without reserve with fulness and with truth that you will never give your heart or hand to Egremont and I will save your father As in a low voice but with a terrible earnestness Morley dictated this oath Sybil already pale became white as the marble saint of some sacred niche Her large dark eyes seemed fixed a fleet expression of agony flitted over her beautiful brow like a cloud and she said I swear that I will never give my hand to And your heart your heart said Morley eagerly Omit not that Swear by the holy oaths again you do not love him She falters Ah she blushes For a burning brightness now suffused the cheek of Sybil She loves him exclaimed Morley wildly and he rushed franticly from the room Book five Chapter five Agitated and overcome by these unexpected and passionate appeals and these outrageous ebullitions acting on her at a time when she herself was labouring under no ordinary excitement and was distracted with disturbing thoughts the mind of Sybil seemed for a moment to desert her neither by sound nor gesture did she signify her sense of Morley s last words and departure and it was not until the loud closing of the street door echoing through the long passage recalled her to herself that she was aware how much was at stake in that incident She darted out of the room to recall him to make one more effort for her father but in vain By the side of their house was an intricate passage leading into a labyrinth of small streets Through this Morley had disappeared and his name more than once sounded in a voice of anguish in that silent and most obsolete Smith s Square received no echo Darkness and terror came over the spirit of Sybil a sense of confounding and confusing woe with which it was in vain to cope The conviction of her helplessness prostrated her She sate her down upon the steps before the door of that dreary house within the railings of that gloomy court and buried her face in her hands a wild vision of the past and the future without thought or feeling coherence or consequence sunset gleams of vanished bliss and stormy gusts of impending doom The clock of saint John s struck seven It was the only thing that spoke in that still and dreary square it was the only voice that there seemed ever to sound but it was a voice from heaven it was the voice of saint John Sybil looked up she looked up at the holy building Sybil listened she listened to the holy sounds saint John told her that the danger of her father was yet so much advanced Oh why are there saints in heaven if they cannot aid the saintly The oath that Morley would have enforced came whispering in the ear of Sybil Swear by the holy Virgin and by all the saints And shall she not pray to the holy Virgin and all the saints Sybil prayed she prayed to the holy Virgin and all the saints and especially to the beloved saint John most favoured among Hebrew men on whose breast reposed the divine Friend Brightness and courage returned to the spirit of Sybil a sense of animating and exalting faith that could move mountains and combat without fear a thousand perils The conviction of celestial aid inspired her She rose from her sad resting place and re entered the house only however to provide herself with her walking attire and then alone and without a guide the shades of evening already descending this child of innocence and divine thoughts born in a cottage and bred in a cloister she went forth on a great enterprise of duty and devotion into the busiest and the wildest haunts of the greatest of modern cities Sybil knew well her way to Palace Yard This point was soon reached she desired the cabman to drive her to a Street in the Strand in which was a coffee house where during the last weeks of their stay in London the scanty remnants of the National Convention had held their sittings It was by a mere accident that Sybil had learnt this circumstance for when she had attended the meetings of the Convention in order to hear her father s speeches it was in the prime of their gathering and when their numbers were great and when they met in audacious rivalry opposite that saint Stephen s which they wished to supersede This accidental recollection however was her only clue in the urgent adventure on which she had embarked She cast an anxious glance at the clock of saint Martin s as she passed that church the hand was approaching the half hour of seven She urged on the driver they were in the Strand there was an agitating stoppage she was about to descend when the obstacle was removed and in a few minutes they turned down the street which she sought What number Ma am asked the cabman Tis a coffee house I know not the number nor the name of him who keeps it Tis a coffee house Can you see one Look look I pray you I am much pressed Here s a coffee house Ma am said the man in a hoarse voice three hundred seventy two How good you are Yes I will get out You will wait for me I am sure All right said the cabman as Sybil entered the illumined door Poor young thing she s wery anxious about summut Sybil at once stepped into a rather capacious room fitted up in the old fashioned style of coffee rooms with mahogany boxes in several of which were men drinking coffee and reading newspapers by a painful glare of gas There was a waiter in the middle of the room who was throwing some fresh sand upon the floor but who stared immensely when looking up he beheld Sybil Now Ma am if you please said the waiter inquiringly Is mister Gerard here said Sybil No Ma am mister Gerard has not been here to day nor yesterday neither and he went on throwing the sand I should like to see the master of the house said Sybil very humbly Should you Ma am said the waiter but he gave no indication of assisting her in the fulfilment of her wish Sybil repeated that wish and this time the waiter said nothing This vulgar and insolent neglect to which she was so little accustomed depressed her spirit She could have encountered tyranny and oppression and she would have tried to struggle with them but this insolence of the insignificant made her feel her insignificance and the absorption all this time of the guests in their newspapers aggravated her nervous sense of her utter helplessness All her feminine reserve and modesty came over her alone in this room among men she felt overpowered and she was about to make a precipitate retreat when the clock of the coffee room sounded the half hour In a paroxysm of nervous excitement she exclaimed Is there not one among you who will assist me All the newspaper readers put down their journals and stared Hoity toity said the waiter and he left off throwing the sand Well what s the matter now said one of the guests I wish to see the master of the house on business of urgency said Sybil to himself and to one of his friends and his servant here will not even reply to my inquiries I say Saul why don t you answer the young lady said another guest So I did said Saul Did you call for coffee Ma am Here s mister Tanner if you want him my dear said the first guest as a lean black looking individual with grizzled hair and a red nose entered the coffee room from the interior Tanner here s a lady wants you And a very pretty girl too whispered one to another What s your pleasure said mister Tanner abruptly I wish to speak to you alone said Sybil and advancing towards him she said in a low voice Tis about Walter Gerard I would speak to you Well you can step in here if you like said Tanner very discourteously there s only my wife and he led the way to the inner room a small close parlour adorned with portraits of Tom Paine Cobbett Thistlewood and General Jackson with a fire though it was a hot July and a very fat woman affording still more heat and who was drinking shrub and water and reading the police reports She stared rudely at Sybil as she entered following Tanner who himself when the door was closed said Well now what have you got to say I wish to see Walter Gerard Do you indeed And continued Sybil notwithstanding his sneering remark I come here that you may tell me where I may find him I believe he lives somewhere in Westminster said Tanner that s all I know about him and if this be all you had to say it might have been said in the coffee room It is not all that I have to say said Sybil and I beseech you sir listen to me I know where Gerard lives I am his daughter and the same roof covers our heads But I wish to know where they meet to night you understand me and she looked at his wife who had resumed her police reports tis urgent I don t know nothing about Gerard said Tanner except that he comes here and goes away again The matter on which I would see him said Sybil is as urgent as the imagination can conceive and it concerns you as well as himself but if you know not where I can find him and she moved as if about to retire tis of no use Stop said Tanner you can tell it to me Why so You know not where he is you cannot tell it to him I don t know that said Tanner Come let s have it out and if it will do him any good I ll see if we can t manage to find him I can impart my news to him and no one else said Sybil I am solemnly bound You can t have a better counseller than Tanner urged his wife getting curious you had better tell us I want no counsel I want that which you can give me if you choose information My father instructed me that if certain circumstances occurred it was a matter of the last urgency that I should see him this evening and before nine o clock I was to call here and obtain from you the direction where to find him the direction she added in a lowered tone and looking Tanner full in the face where they hold their secret council to night Hem said Tanner I see you re on the free list And pray how am I to know you are Gerard s daughter You do not doubt I am his daughter said Sybil proudly Hem said Tanner I do not know that I do very much and he whispered to his wife Sybil removed from them as far as she was able And this news is very urgent resumed Tanner and concerns me you say Concerns you all said Sybil and every minute is of the last importance I should like to have gone with you myself and then there could have been no mistake said Tanner but that can t be we have a meeting here at half past eight in our great room I don t much like breaking rules especially in such a business and yet concerning all of us as you say and so very urgent I don t see how it could do harm and I might I wish I was quite sure you were the party How can I satisfy you said Sybil distressed Perhaps the young person have got her mark on her linen suggested the wife Have you got a handkerchief Ma am and she took Sybil s handkerchief and looked at it and examined it at every corner It had no mark And this unforeseen circumstance of great suspicion might have destroyed everything had not the production of the handkerchief by Sybil also brought forth a letter addressed to her from Hatton It seems to be the party said the wife Well said Tanner you know saint Martin s Lane I suppose Well you go up saint Martin s Lane to a certain point and then you will get into Seven Dials and then you ll go on However it is impossible to direct you you must find your way Hunt Street going out of Silver Street No twenty two Tis what you call a blind street with no thoroughfare and then you go down an alley Can you recollect that Fear not No twenty two Hunt Street going out of Silver Street Remember the alley It s an ugly neighbourhood but you go of your own accord Yes yes Good night Book five Chapter six Urged by Sybil s entreaties the cab driver hurried on With all the skilled experience of a thorough cockney charioteer he tried to conquer time and space by his rare knowledge of short cuts and fine acquaintance with unknown thoroughfares He seemed to avoid every street which was the customary passage of mankind The houses the population the costume the manners the language through which they whirled their way were of a different state and nation to those with which the dwellers in the dainty quarters of this city are acquainted Now dark streets of frippery and old stores new market places of entrails and carrion with gutters running gore sometimes the way was enveloped in the yeasty fumes of a colossal brewery and sometimes they plunged into a labyrinth of lanes teeming with life and where the dog stealer and the pick pocket the burglar and the assassin found a sympathetic multitude of all ages comrades for every enterprise and a market for every booty The long summer twilight was just expiring the pale shadows of the moon were just stealing on the gas was beginning to glare in the shops of tripe and bacon and the paper lanthorns to adorn the stall and the stand They crossed a broad street which seemed the metropolis of the district it flamed with gin palaces a multitude were sauntering in the mild though tainted air bargaining blaspheming drinking wrangling and varying their business and their potations their fierce strife and their impious irreverence with flashes of rich humour gleams of native wit and racy phrases of idiomatic slang Absorbed in her great mission Sybil was almost insensible to the scenes through which she passed and her innocence was thus spared many a sight and sound that might have startled her vision or alarmed her ear They could not now he very distant from the spot they were crossing this broad way and then were about to enter another series of small obscure dingy streets when the cab driver giving a flank to his steed to stimulate it to a last effort the horse sprang forward and the wheel of the cab came off Sybil extricated herself from the vehicle unhurt a group immediately formed round the cab a knot of young thieves almost young enough for infant schools a dustman a woman nearly naked and very drunk and two unshorn ruffians with brutality stamped on every feature with pipes in their mouths and their hands in their pockets I can take you no further said the cabman my fare is three shillings What am I to do said Sybil taking out her purse The best thing the young lady can do said the dustman in a hoarse voice is to stand something to us all That s your time o day squeaked a young thief I ll drink your health with very great pleasure my dear hiccupped the woman How much have you got there said the young thief making a dash at the purse but he was not quite tall enough and failed No wiolence said one of the ruffians taking his pipe out of his mouth and sending a volume of smoke into Sybil s face we ll take the young lady to Mother Poppy s and then we ll make a night of it But at this moment appeared a policeman one of the permanent garrison of the quarter who seeing one of her Majesty s carriages in trouble thought he must interfere Hilloa he said what s all this And the cabman who was a good fellow though in too much trouble to aid Sybil explained in the terse and picturesque language of Cockaigne doing full justice to his late fare the whole circumstances Oh that s it said the policeman the lady s respectable is she Then I d advise you and Hell Fire Dick to stir your chalks Splinter legs Keep moving s the time of day Madam you get on Come and taking the woman by her shoulder he gave her a spin that sent her many a good yard And what do you want he asked gruffly of the lads We wants a ticket for the Mendicity Society said the captain of the infant hand putting his thumb to his nose and running away followed by his troop And so you want to go to Silver Street said her official preserver to Sybil for she had not thought it wise to confess her ultimate purpose and indicate under the apprehended circumstances the place of rendezvous to a member of the police Well that s not very difficult now Go a head take the second turning to your right and the third to your left and you re landed Aided by these instructions Sybil hastened on avoiding notice as much as was in her power and assisted in some degree by the advancing gloom of night She had reached Silver Street a long narrow hilly Street and now she was at fault There were not many persons about and there were few shops here yet one was at last at hand and she entered to enquire her way The person at the counter was engaged and many customers awaited him time was very precious Sybil had made the enquiry and received only a supercilious stare from the shopman who was weighing with precision some article that he was serving A young man shabby but of a very superior appearance to the people of this quarter good looking though with a dissolute air and who seemed waiting for a customer in attendance addressed Sybil I am going to Hunt Street he said shall I show you the way She accepted this offer most thankfully It is close at hand I believe Here it is he said and he turned down a street What is your house No twenty two a printing office said Sybil for the street she had entered was so dark she despaired of finding her way and ventured to trust so far a guide who was not a policeman The very house I am going to said the stranger I am a printer And they walked on some way until they at length stopped before a glass and illumined door covered with a red curtain Before it was a group of several men and women brawling but who did not notice Sybil and her companion Here we are said the man and he pushed the door open inviting Sybil to enter She hesitated it did not agree with the description that had been given her by the coffee house keeper but she had seen so much since and felt so much and gone through so much that she had not at the moment that clear command of her memory for which she was otherwise remarkable but while she faltered an inner door was violently thrown open and Sybil moving aside two girls still beautiful in spite of gin and paint stepped into the Street This cannot be the house exclaimed Sybil starting back overwhelmed with shame and terror O holy Virgin aid me And that s a blessed word to hear in this heathen land exclaimed an Irishman who was one of the group on the outside If you be of our holy church said Sybil appealing to the man who had thus spoken and whom she gently drew aside I beseech you by everything we hold sacred to aid me And will I not said the man and I should like to see the arm that would hurt you and he looked round but the young man had disappeared You are not a countrywoman I am thinking he added No but a sister in Christ said Sybil listen to me good friend I hasten to my father he is in great danger in Hunt Street I know not my way every moment is precious guide me I beseech you honestly and truly guide me Will I not Don t you be afraid my dear And her poor father is ill I wish I had such a daughter We have not far to go You should have taken the next turning We must walk up this again for tis a small street with no thoroughfare Come on without fear Nor did Sybil fear for the description of the street which the honest man had incidentally given tallied with her instructions Encouraging her with many kind words and full of rough courtesies the good Irishman led her to the spot she had so long sought There was the court she was told to enter It was well lit and descending the steps she stopped at the first door on her left and knocked Book five Chapter seven On the same night that Sybil was encountering so many dangers the saloons of Deloraine House blazed with a thousand lights to welcome the world of power and fashion to a festival of almost unprecedented magnificence Fronting a royal park its long lines of illumined windows and the bursts of gay and fantastic music that floated from its walls attracted the admiration and curiosity of another party that was assembled in the same fashionable quarter beneath a canopy not less bright and reclining on a couch scarcely less luxurious for they were lit by the stars and reposed upon the grass I say Jim said a young genius of fourteen stretching himself upon the turf I pity them ere jarvies a sitting on their boxes all the night and waiting for the nobs what is dancing They as no repose But they as porter replied his friend a sedater spirit with the advantage of an additional year or two of experience They takes their pot of half and half by turns and if their name is called the link what they subscribe for to pay sings out here and that s the way their guvners is done I think I should like to be a link Jim said the young one I wish you may get it was the response it s the next best thing to a crossing it s what every one looks to when he enters public life but he soon finds taint to be done without a deal of interest They keeps it to themselves and never lets any one in unless he makes himself very troublesome and gets up a party agin em I wonder what the nobs has for supper said the young one pensively Lots of kidneys I dare say Oh no sweets is the time of day in these here blowouts syllabubs like blazes and snapdragon as makes the flunkys quite pale I would thank you sir not to tread upon this child said a widow She had three others with her slumbering around and this was the youngest wrapt in her only shawl Madam replied the person whom she addressed in tolerable English but with a marked accent I have bivouacked in many lands but never with so young a comrade I beg you a thousand pardons Sir you are very polite These warm nights are a great blessing but I am sure I know not what we shall do in the fall of the leaf Take no thought of the morrow said the foreigner who was a Pole had served as a boy beneath the suns of the Peninsula under Soult and fought against Diebitsch on the banks of the icy Vistula It brings many changes And arranging the cloak which he had taken that day out of pawn around him he delivered himself up to sleep with that facility which is not uncommon among soldiers Here broke out a brawl two girls began fighting and blaspheming a man immediately came up chastised and separated them I am the Lord Mayor of the night he said and I will have no row here Tis the like of you that makes the beaks threaten to expel us from our lodgings His authority seemed generally recognized the girls were quiet but they had disturbed a sleeping man who roused himself looked around him and said with a scared look Where am I What s all this Oh it s nothin said the elder of the two lads we first noticed only a couple of unfortinate gals who ve prigged a watch from a cove what was lushy and fell asleep under the trees between this and Kinsington I wish they had not waked me said the man I walked as far as from Stokenchurch and that s a matter of forty miles this morning to see if I could get some work and went to bed here without any supper I m blessed if I worn t dreaming of a roast leg of pork It has not been a lucky day for me rejoined the lad I could not find a single gentleman s horse to hold so help me except one what was at the House of Commons and he kept me there two mortal hours and said when he came out that he would remember me next time I ain t tasted no wittals to day except some cat s meat and a cold potatoe what was given me by a cabman but I have got a quid here and if you are very low I ll give you half In the meantime Lord Valentine and the Princess Stephanie of Eurasberg with some companions worthy of such a pair were dancing a new Mazurka before the admiring assembly at Deloraine House The ball was in the statue gallery illumined on this night in the Russian fashion which while it diffused a brilliant light throughout the beautiful chamber was peculiarly adapted to develope the contour of the marble forms of grace and loveliness that were ranged around Where is Arabella enquired Lord Marney of his mother I want to present young Huntingford to her He can be of great use to me but he bores me so I cannot talk to him I want to present him to Arabella Arabella is in the blue drawing room I saw her just now with mister Jermyn and Charles Count Soudriaffsky is teaching them some Russian tricks What are Russian tricks to me she must talk to young Huntingford everything depends on his working with me against the Cut and Come again branch line they have refused me my compensation and I am not going to have my estate cut up into ribbons without compensation My dear Lady Deloraine said Lady de Mowbray How beautiful your gallery looks to night Certainly there is nothing in London that lights up so well Its greatest ornaments are its guests I am charmed to see Lady Joan looking so well You think so Indeed I wish and here Lady de Mowbray gave a smiling sigh What do you think of mister Mountchesney He is universally admired So every one says and yet Well what do you think of the Dashville Fitz said mister Berners to Lord Fitzheron I saw you dancing with her I can t bear her she sets up to be natural and is only rude mistakes insolence for innocence says everything which comes first to her lips and thinks she is gay when she is only giddy Tis brilliant said Lady Joan to mister Mountchesney When you are here he murmured And yet a ball in a gallery of art is not in my opinion in good taste The associations which are suggested by sculpture are not festive Repose is the characteristic of sculpture Do not you think so Decidedly said mister Mountchesney We danced in the gallery at Matfield this Christmas and I thought all the time that a gallery is not the place for a ball it is too long and too narrow Lady Joan looked at him and her lip rather curled I wonder if Valentine has sold that bay cob of his said Lord Milford to Lord Eugene de Vere I wonder said Lord Eugene I wish you would ask him Eugene said Lord Milford you understand I don t want him to know I want it Tis such a bore to ask questions said Lord Eugene Shall we carry Chichester asked Lady Firebrace of Lady saint Julians Oh do not speak to me ever again of the House of Commons she replied in a tone of affected despair What use is winning our way by units It may take years Lord Protocol says that one is enough That Jamaica affair has really ended by greatly strengthening them I do not despair said Lady Firebrace The unequivocal adhesion of the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine is a great thing It gives us the northern division at a dissolution That is to say in five years my dear Lady Firebrace The country will be ruined before that We shall see Is it a settled thing between Lady Joan and mister Mountchesney Not the slightest foundation Lady Joan is a most sensible girl as well as a most charming person and my dear friend She is not in a hurry to marry and quite right If indeed Frederick were a little more steady but nothing shall ever induce me to consent to his marrying her unless I thought he was worthy of her You are such a good mother exclaimed Lady Firebrace and such a good friend I am glad to hear it is not true about mister Mountchesney If you could only help me my dear Lady Firebrace to put an end to that affair between Frederick and Lady Wallington It is so silly and getting talked about and in his heart too he really loves Lady Joan only he is scarcely aware of it himself We must manage it said Lady Firebrace with a look of encouraging mystery Do my dear creature speak to him he is very much guided by your opinion Tell him everybody is laughing at him and any other little thing that occurs to you I will come directly said Lady Marney to her husband only let me see this Well I will bring Huntingford here Mind you speak to him a great deal take his arm and go down to supper with him if you can He is a very nice sensible young fellow and you will like him very much I am sure a little shy at first but he only wants bringing out A dexterous description of one of the most unlicked and unlickable cubs that ever entered society with forty thousand a year courted by all and with just that degree of cunning that made him suspicious of every attention This dreadful Lord Huntingford said Lady Marney Jermyn and I will intefere said Egremont and help you No no said Lady Marney shaking her head I must do it At this moment a groom of the chambers advanced and drew Egremont aside saying in a low tone Your servant mister Egremont is here and wishes to see you instantly My servant Instantly What the deuce can be the matter I hope the Albany is not on fire and he quitted the room In the outer hall amid a crowd of footmen Egremont recognized his valet who immediately came forward A porter has brought this letter sir and I thought it best to come on with it at once The letter directed to Egremont bore also on its superscription these words This letter must be instantly carried by the bearer to mister Egremont wherever he may be Egremont with some change of countenance drew aside and opening the letter read it by a lamp at hand It must have been very brief but the face of him to whom it was addressed became as he perused its lines greatly agitated When he had finished reading it he seemed for a moment lost in profound thought then looking up he dismissed his servant without instructions and hastening back to the assembly he enquired of the groom of the chambers whether Lord John Russell whom he had observed in the course of the evening was still present and he was answered in the affirmative About a quarter of an hour after this incident Lady Firebrace said to Lady saint Julians in a tone of mysterious alarm Do you see that No what Do not look as if you observed them Lord John and mister Egremont in the furthest window they have been there these ten minutes in the most earnest conversation I am afraid we have lost him I have always been expecting it said Lady saint Julians He breakfasts with that mister Trenchard and does all those sorts of things Men who breakfast out are generally liberals Have not you observed that I wonder why It shows a restless revolutionary mind said Lady Firebrace that can settle to nothing but must be running after gossip the moment they are awake Yes said Lady saint Julians I think those men who breakfast out or who give breakfasts are generally dangerous characters at least I would not trust them The whigs are very fond of that sort of thing If mister Egremont joins them I really do not see what shadow of a claim Lady Deloraine can urge to have anything She only wants one thing said Lady Firebrace and we know she cannot have that Why Because Lady saint Julians will have it You are too kind with many smiles No I assure you Lord Masque told me that her Majesty and here Lady Firehrace whispered Well said Lady saint Julians evidently much gratified I do not think I am one who am likely to forget my friends That I am sure you are not said Lady Firebrace Book five Chapter eight Behind the printing office in the alley at the door of which we left Sybil was a yard which led to some premises that had once been used as a work shop but were now generally unoccupied In a rather spacious chamber over which was a loft five men one of whom was Gerard were busily engaged There was no furniture in the room except a few chairs and a deal table on which was a solitary light and a variety of papers Depend upon it said Gerard we must stick to the National Holiday we can do nothing effectively unless the movement is simultaneous They have not troops to cope with a simultaneous movement and the Holiday is the only machinery to secure unity of action No work for six weeks and the rights of Labour will be acknowledged We shall never be able to make the people unanimous in a cessation of labour said a pale young man very thin but with a countenance of remarkable energy The selfish instincts will come into play and will baulk our political object while a great increase of physical suffering must be inevitable It might be done said a middle aged thickset man in a thoughtful tone If the Unions were really to put their shoulder to the wheel it might be done And if it is not done said Gerard what do you propose The people ask you to guide them Shrink at such a conjuncture and our influence over them is forfeited and justly forfeited I am for partial but extensive insurrections said the young man Sufficient in extent and number to demand all the troops and yet to distract the military movements We can count on Birmingham again if we act at once before their new Police Act is in force Manchester is ripe and several of the cotton towns but above all I have letters that assure me that at this moment we can do anything in Wales Glamorganshire is right to a man said Wilkins a Baptist teacher And trade is so bad that the Holiday at all events must take place there for the masters themselves are extinguishing their furnaces All the north is seething said Gerard We must contrive to agitate the metropolis said Maclast a shrewd carroty haired paper stainer We must have weekly meetings at Kennington and demonstrations at White Conduit House we cannot do more here I fear than talk but a few thousand men on Kennington Common every Saturday and some spicy resolutions will keep the Guards in London Ay ay said Gerard I wish the woollen and cotton trades were as bad to do as the iron and we should need no holiday as you say Wilkins However it will come In the meantime the Poor law pinches and terrifies and will make even the most spiritless turn The accounts to day from the north are very encouraging though said the young man Stevens is producing a great effect and this plan of our people going in procession and taking possession of the churches very much affects the imagination of the multitude Ah said Gerard if we could only have the Church on our side as in the good old days we would soon put an end to the demon tyranny of Capital And now said the pale young man taking up a manuscript paper to our immediate business Here is the draft of the projected proclamation of the Convention on the Birmingham outbreak It enjoins peace and order and counsels the people to arm themselves in order to secure both You understand that they may resist if the troops and the police endeavour to produce disturbance Ay ay said Gerard Let it be stout We will settle this at once and so get it out to morrow Then for action But we must circulate this pamphlet of the Polish Count on the manner of encountering cavalry with pikes said Maclast Tis printed said the stout thickset man we have set it up on a broadside We have sent ten thousand to the north and five thousand to John Frost We shall have another delivery tomorrow It takes very generally The pale young man read the draft of the proclamation it was canvassed and criticised sentence by sentence altered approved finally put to the vote and unanimously carried On the morrow it was to be posted in every thoroughfare of the metropolis and circulated in every great city of the provinces and populous district of labour And now said Gerard I shall to morrow to the north where I am wanted But before I go I propose as suggested yesterday that we five together with Langley whom I counted on seeing here to night now form ourselves into a committee for arming the people Three of us are permanent in London Wilkins and myself will aid you in the provinces Nothing can be decided on this head till we see Langley who will make a communication from Birmingham that cannot be trusted to writing The seven o clock train must have long since arrived He is now a good hour behind his time I hear foot steps said Maclast He comes said Gerard The door of the chamber opened and a woman entered Pale agitated exhausted she advanced to them in the glimmering light What is this said several of the council Sybil exclaimed the astonished Gerard and he rose from his seat She caught the arm of her father and leant on him for a moment in silence Then looking up with an expression that seemed to indicate she was rallying her last energies she said in a voice low yet so distinct that it reached the ear of all present There is not an instant to lose fly The men rose hastily from their seats they approached the messenger of danger Gerard waved them off for he perceived his daughter was sinking Gently he placed her in his chair she was sensible for she grasped his arm and she murmured still she murmured fly Tis very strange said Maclast I feel queer said the thickset man Methinks she looks like a heavenly messenger said Wilkins I had no idea that earth had anything so fair said the youthful scribe of proclamations Hush friends said Gerard and then he bent over Sybil and said in a low soothing voice Tell me my child what is it She looked up to her father a glance as it were of devotion and despair her lips moved but they refused their office and expressed no words There was a deep silence in the room She is gone said her father Water said the young man and he hurried away to obtain some I feel queer said his thickset colleague to Maclast I will answer for Langley as for myself said Maclast and there is not another human being aware of our purpose Except Morley Yes except Morley But I should as soon doubt Gerard as Stephen Morley Certainly I cannot conceive how she traced me said Gerard I have never even breathed to her of our meeting Would we had some water Ah here it comes I arrest you in the Queen s name said a serjeant of police Resistance is vain Maclast blew out the light and then ran up into the loft followed by the thickset man who fell down the stairs Wilkins got up the chimney The sergeant took a lanthorn from his pocket and threw a powerful light on the chamber while his followers entered seized and secured all the papers and commenced their search The light fell upon a group that did not move the father holding the hand of his insensible child while he extended his other arm as if to preserve her from the profanation of the touch of the invaders You are Walter Gerard I presume said the serjeant six foot two without shoes Whoever I may he he replied I presume you will produce your warrant friend before you touch me Tis here We want five of you named herein and all others that may happen to be found in your company I shall obey the warrant said Gerard after he had examined it but this maiden my daughter knows nothing of this meeting or its purpose She has but just arrived and how she traced me I know not You will let me recover her and then permit her to depart Can t let no one out of my sight found in this room But she is innocent even if we were guilty she could be nothing else but innocent for she knows nothing of this meeting and its business both of which I am prepared at the right time and place to vindicate She entered this room a moment only before yourself entered and swooned Can t help that must take her she can tell the magistrate anything she likes and he must decide Why you are not afraid of a young girl I am afraid of nothing but I must do my duty Come we have no time for talk I must take you both By G d you shall not take her and letting go her hand Gerard advanced before her and assumed a position of defence You know I find my height my strength does not shame my stature Look to yourself Advance and touch this maiden and I will fell you and your minions like oxen at their pasture The inspector took a pistol from his pocket and pointed it at Gerard You see he said resistance is quite vain For slaves and cravens but not for us I say you shall not touch her till I am dead at her feet Now do your worst At this moment two policemen who had been searching the loft descended with Maclast who had vainly attempted to effect his escape over a neighbouring roof the thickset man was already secured and Wilkins had been pulled down the chimney and made his appearance in as grimy a state as such a shelter would naturally have occasioned The young man too their first prisoner who had been captured before they had entered the room was also brought in there was now abundance of light the four prisoners were ranged and well guarded at the end of the apartment Gerard standing before Sybil still maintained his position of defence and the serjeant was a few yards away in his front with his pistol in his hand Well you are a queer chap said the serjeant but I must do my duty I shall give orders to my men to seize you and if you resist them I shall shoot you through the head Stop called out one of the prisoners the young man who drew proclamations she moves Do with us as you think fit but you cannot be so harsh as to seize one that is senseless and a woman I must do my duty said the serjeant rather perplexed at the situation Well if you like take steps to restore her and when she has come to herself she shall be moved in a hackney coach alone with her father The means at hand to recover Sybil were rude but they assisted a reviving nature She breathed she sighed slowly opened her beautiful dark eyes and looked around Her father held her death cold hand she returned his pressure her lips moved and still she murmured fly Gerard looked at the serjeant I am ready he said and I will carry her The officer nodded assent Guarded by two policemen the tall delegate of Mowbray bore his precious burthen out of the chamber through the yard the printing offices up the alley till a hackney coach received them in Hunt Street round which a mob had already collected though kept at a discreet distance by the police One officer entered the coach with them another mounted the box Two other coaches carried the rest of the prisoners and their guards and within halt an hour from the arrival of Sybil at the scene of the secret meeting she was on her way to Bow Street to be examined as a prisoner of state Sybil rallied quickly during their progress to the police office Satisfied to find herself with her father she would have enquired as to all that had happened but Gerard at first discouraged her at length he thought it wisest gradually to convey to her that they were prisoners but he treated the matter lightly did not doubt that she would immediately be discharged and added that though he might be detained for a day or so his offence was at all events bailable and he had friends on whom he could rely When Sybil clearly comprehended that she was a prisoner and that her public examination was impending she became silent and leaning back in the coach covered her face with her hands The prisoners arrived at Bow Street they were hurried into a back office where they remained some time unnoticed several police men remaining in the room At length about twenty minutes having elapsed a man dressed in black and of a severe aspect entered the room accompanied by an inspector of police He first enquired whether these were the prisoners what were their names and descriptions which each had to give and which were written down where they were arrested why they were arrested then scrutinising them sharply he said the magistrate was at the Home Office and he doubted whether they could be examined until the morrow Upon this Gerard commenced stating the circumstances under which Sybil had unfortunately been arrested but the gentleman in black with a severe aspect immediately told him to hold his tongue and when Gerard persisted declared that if Gerard did not immediately cease he should be separated from the other prisoners and be ordered into solitary confinement Another half hour of painful suspense The prisoners were not permitted to hold any conversation Sybil sat half reclining on a form with her back against the wall and her face covered silent and motionless At the end of half an hour the inspector of police who had visited them with the gentleman in black entered and announced that the prisoners could not be brought up for examination that evening and they must make themselves as comfortable as they could for the night Gerard made a last appeal to the inspector that Sybil might be allowed a separate chamber and in this he was unexpectedly successful The inspector was a kind hearted man he lived at the office and his wife was the housekeeper He had already given her an account an interesting account of his female prisoner The good woman s imagination was touched as well as her heart she had herself suggested that they ought to soften the rigour of the fair prisoner s lot and the inspector therefore almost anticipated the request of Gerard He begged Sybil to accompany him to his better half and at once promised all the comforts and convenience which they could command As attended by the inspector she took her way to the apartments of his family they passed through a room in which there were writing materials and Sybil speaking for the first time and in a faint voice enquired of the inspector whether it were permitted to apprise a friend of her situation She was answered in the affirmative on condition that the note was previously perused by him I will write it at once she said and taking up a pen she inscribed these words I followed your counsel I entreated him to quit London this night He pledged himself to do so on the morrow I learnt he was attending a secret meeting that there was urgent peril I tracked him through scenes of terror Alas I arrived only in time to be myself seized as a conspirator and I have been arrested and carried a prisoner to Bow Street where I write this I ask you not to interfere for him that would be vain but if I were free I might at least secure him justice But I am not free I am to be brought up for public examination to morrow if I survive this night You are powerful you know all you know what I say is truth None else will credit it Save me And now said Sybil to the inspector in a tone of mournful desolation and of mild sweetness all depends on your faith to me and she extended him the letter which he read Whoever he may be and wherever he may be said the inspector with emotion for the spirit of Sybil had already controlled his nature provided the person to whom this letter is addressed is within possible distance fear not it shall reach him I will seal and address it then said Sybil and she addressed the letter to THE honorable CHARLES EGREMONT M P adding that superscription the sight of which had so agitated Egremont at Deloraine House Book five Chapter nine Night waned and Sybil was at length slumbering The cold that precedes the dawn had stolen over her senses and calmed the excitement of her nerves She was lying on the ground covered with a cloak of which her kind hostess had prevailed on her to avail herself and was partly resting on a chair at which she had been praying when exhausted nature gave way and she slept Her bonnet had fallen off and her rich hair which had broken loose covered her shoulder like a mantle Her slumber was brief and disturbed but it had in a great degree soothed the irritated brain She woke however in terror from a dream in which she had been dragged through a mob and carried before a tribunal The coarse jeers the brutal threats still echoed in her ear and when she looked around she could not for some moments recall or recognise the scene In one corner of the room which was sufficiently spacious was a bed occupied by the still sleeping wife of the inspector there was a great deal of heavy furniture of dark mahogany a bureau several chests of drawers over the mantel was a piece of faded embroidery framed that had been executed by the wife of the inspector when she was at school and opposite to it on the other side were portraits of Dick Curtis and Dutch Sam who had been the tutors of her husband and now lived as heroes in his memory Slowly came over Sybil the consciousness of the dreadful eve that was past She remained for some time on her knees in silent prayer then stepping lightly she approached the window It was barred The room which she inhabited was a high story of the house it looked down upon one of those half tawdry half squalid streets that one finds in the vicinities of our theatres some wretched courts haunts of misery and crime blended with gin palaces and slang taverns burnished and brazen not a being was stirring It was just that single hour of the twenty four when crime ceases debauchery is exhausted and even desolation finds a shelter It was dawn but still grey For the first time since she had been a prisoner Sybil was alone A prisoner and in a few hours to be examined before a public tribunal Her heart sank How far her father had committed himself was entirely a mystery to her but the language of Morley and all that she had witnessed impressed her with the conviction that he was deeply implicated He had indeed spoken in their progress to the police office with confidence as to the future but then he had every motive to encourage her in her despair and to support her under the overwhelming circumstances in which she was so suddenly involved What a catastrophe to all his high aspirations It tore her heart to think of him As for herself she would still hope that ultimately she might obtain justice but she could scarcely flatter herself that at the first any distinction would be made between her case and that of the other prisoners She would probably be committed for trial and though her innocence on that occasion might be proved she would have been a prisoner in the interval instead of devoting all her energies in freedom to the support and assistance of her father She shrank too with all the delicacy of a woman from the impending examination in open court before the magistrate Supported by her convictions vindicating a sacred principle there was no trial perhaps to which Sybil would not have been superior and no test of her energy and faith which she would not have triumphantly encountered but to be hurried like a criminal to the bar of a police office suspected of the lowest arts of sedition ignorant even of what she was accused without a conviction to support her or the ennobling consciousness of having failed at least in a great cause all these were circumstances which infinitely disheartened and depressed her She felt sometimes that she should be unable to meet the occasion had it not been for Gerard she could almost have wished that death might release her from its base perplexities Was there any hope In the agony of her soul she had confided last night in one with scarcely a bewildering hope that he could save her He might not have the power the opportunity the wish He might shrink from mixing himself up with such characters and such transactions he might not have received her hurried appeal in time to act upon it even if the desire of her soul were practicable A thousand difficulties a thousand obstacles now occurred to her and she felt her hopelessness Yet notwithstanding her extreme sorrow and the absence of all surrounding objects to soothe and to console her the expanding dawn revived and even encouraged Sybil In spite of the confined situation she could still partially behold a sky dappled with rosy hues a sense of freshness touched her she could not resist endeavouring to open the window and feel the air notwithstanding all her bars The wife of the inspector stirred and half slumbering murmured Are you up It cannot be more than five o clock If you open the window we shall catch cold but I will rise and help you to dress This woman like her husband was naturally kind and at once influenced by Sybil They both treated her as a superior being and if instead of the daughter of a lowly prisoner and herself a prisoner she had been the noble child of a captive minister of state they could not have extended to her a more humble and even delicate solicitude It had not yet struck seven and the wife of the inspector suddenly stopping and listening said They are stirring early and then after a moment s pause she opened the door at which she stood for some time endeavouring to catch the meaning of the mysterious sounds She looked back at Sybil and saying Hush I shall be back directly she withdrew shutting the door In little more than two hours as Sybil had been informed she would be summoned to her examination It was a sickening thought Hope vanished as the catastrophe advanced She almost accused herself for having without authority sought out her father it had been as regarded him a fruitless mission and by its results on her had aggravated his present sorrows and perplexities Her mind again recurred to him whose counsel had indirectly prompted her rash step and to whose aid in her infinite hopelessness she had appealed The woman who had all this time been only standing on the landing place without the door now re entered with a puzzled and curious air saying I cannot make it out some one has arrived Some one has arrived Simple yet agitating words Is it unusual enquired Sybil in a trembling tone for persons to arrive at this hour Yes said the wife of the inspector They never bring them from the stations until the office opens I cannot make it out Hush and at this moment some one tapped at the door The woman returned to the door and reopened it and some words were spoken which did not reach Sybil whose heart beat violently as a wild thought rushed over her mind The suspense was so intolerable her agitation so great that she was on the point of advancing and asking if when the door was shut and she was again left alone She threw herself on the bed It seemed to her that she had lost all control over her intelligence All thought and feeling merged in that deep suspense when the order of our being seems to stop and quiver as it were upon its axis The woman returned her countenance was glad Perceiving the agitation of Sybil she said You may dry your eyes my dear There is nothing like a friend at court there s a warrant from the Secretary of State for your release No no said Sybil springing from her chair Is he here What the Secretary of State said the woman No no I mean is any one here There is a coach waiting for you at the door with the messenger from the office and you are to depart forthwith My husband is here it was he who knocked at the door The warrant came before the office was opened My father I must see him The inspector at this moment tapped again at the door and then entered He caught the last request of Sybil and replied to it in the negative You must not stay he said you must be off immediately I will tell all to your father And take a hint this affair may be bailable or it may not be I can t give an opinion but it depends on the evidence If you have any good man you know I mean a householder long established and well to do in the world I advise you to lose no time in looking him up That will do your father much more good than saying good bye and all that sort of thing Bidding farewell to his kind wife and leaving many weeping messages for her father Sybil descended the stairs with the inspector The office was not opened a couple of policemen only were in the passage and as she appeared one of them went forth to clear the way for Sybil to the coach that was waiting for her A milkwoman or two a stray chimney sweep a pieman with his smoking apparatus and several of those nameless nothings that always congregate and make the nucleus of a mob probably our young friends who had been passing the night in Hyde Park had already gathered round the office door They were dispersed and returned again and took up their position at a more respectful distance abusing with many racy execrations that ancient body that from a traditionary habit they still called the New Police A man in a loose white great coat his countenance concealed by a shawl which was wound round his neck and by his slouched hat assisted Sybil into the coach and pressed her hand at the same time with great tenderness Then he mounted the box by the driver and ordered him to make the best of his way to Smith s Square With a beating heart Sybil leant back in the coach and clasped her hands Her brain was too wild to think the incidents of her life during the last four and twenty hours had been so strange and rapid that she seemed almost to resign any quality of intelligent control over her fortunes and to deliver herself up to the shifting visions of the startling dream His voice had sounded in her ear as his hand had touched hers And on those tones her memory lingered and that pressure had reached her heart What tender devotion What earnest fidelity What brave and romantic faith Had she breathed on some talisman and called up some obedient genie to her aid the spirit could not have been more loyal nor the completion of her behest more ample and precise She passed the towers of the church of saint John of the saint who had seemed to guard over her in the exigency of her existence She was approaching her threshold the blood left her cheek her heart palpitated The coach stopped Trembling and timid she leant upon his arm and yet dared not look upon his face They entered the house they were in the room where two months before he had knelt to her in vain which yesterday had been the scene of so many heart rending passions As in some delicious dream when the enchanted fancy has traced for a time with coherent bliss the stream of bright adventures and sweet and touching phrase there comes at last some wild gap in the flow of fascination and by means which we cannot trace and by an agency which we cannot pursue we find ourselves in some enrapturing situation that is as it were the ecstasy of our life so it happened now that while in clear and precise order there seemed to flit over the soul of Sybil all that had passed all that he had done all that she felt by some mystical process which memory could not recall Sybil found herself pressed to the throbbing heart of Egremont nor shrinking from the embrace which expressed the tenderness of his devoted love Book five Chapter ten Mowbray was in a state of great excitement It was Saturday evening the mills were closed the news had arrived of the arrest of the Delegate Here s a go said Dandy Mick to Devilsdust What do you think of this It s the beginning of the end said Devilsdust The deuce said the Dandy who did not clearly comprehend the bent of the observation of his much pondering and philosophic friend but was touched by its oracular terseness We must see Warner said Devilsdust and call a meeting of the people on the Moor for to morrow evening I will draw up some resolutions We must speak out we must terrify the Capitalists I am all for a strike said Mick Tisn t ripe said Devilsdust But that s what you always say Dusty said Mick I watch events said Devilsdust If you want to be a leader of the people you must learn to watch events But what do you mean by watching events Do you see Mother Carey s stall said Dusty pointing in the direction of the counter of the good natured widow I should think I did and what s more Julia owes her a tick for herrings Right said Devilsdust and nothing but herrings are to be seen on her board Two years ago it was meat I twig said Mick Wait till it s wegetables when the people can t buy even fish Then we will talk about strikes That s what I call watching events Julia Caroline and Harriet came up to them Mick said Julia we want to go to the Temple I wish you may get it said Mick shaking his head When you have learnt to watch events Julia you will understand that under present circumstances the Temple is no go And why so Dandy said Julia Do you see Mother Carey s stall said Mick pointing in that direction When there s a tick at Madam Carey s there is no tin for Chaffing Jack That s what I call watching events Oh as for the tin said Caroline in these half time days that s quite out of fashion But they do say it s the last night at the Temple for Chaffing Jack means to shut up it does not pay any longer and we want a lark I ll stand treat I ll put my earrings up the spout they must go at last and I would sooner at any time go to my uncle s for frolic than woe I am sure I should like very much to go to the Temple if any one would pay for me said Harriet but I won t pawn nothing If we only pay and hear them sing said Julia in a coaxing tone Very like said Mick there s nothing that makes one so thirsty as listening to a song particularly if it touches the feelings Don t you remember Dusty when we used to encore that German fellow in Scots wha ha We always had it five times Hang me if I wasn t blind drunk at the end of it I tell you what young ladies said Devilsdust looking very solemn you re dancing on a volcano Oh my said Caroline I am sure I wish we were though what you mean exactly I don t quite know I mean that we shall all soon be slaves said Devilsdust Not if we get the Ten Hour Bill said Harriet And no cleaning of machinery in meal time said Julia that is a shame You don t know what you are talking about said Devilsdust I tell you if the Capitalists put down Gerard we re done for another ten years and by that time we shall be all used up Lor Dusty you quite terrify one said Caroline It s a true bill though Instead of going to the Temple we must meet on the Moor and in as great numbers as possible Go you and get all your sweethearts I must see your father Harriet he must preside We will have the hymn of Labour sung by a hundred thousand voices in chorus It will strike terror into the hearts of the Capitalists This is what we must all be thinking of if we wish Labour to have a chance not of going to Chaffing Jack s and listening to silly songs D ye understand Don t we said Caroline and for my part for a summer eve I prefer Mowbray Moor to all the Temples in the world particularly if it s a sociable party and we have some good singing This evening it was settled among the principal champions of the cause of Labour among whom Devilsdust was now included that on the morrow there should be a monster meeting on the Moor to take into consideration the arrest of the delegate of Mowbray Such was the complete organisation of this district that by communicating with the various lodges of the Trades Unions fifty thousand persons or even double that number could within four and twenty hours on a great occasion and on a favourable day be brought into the field The morrow being a day of rest was favourable and the seizure of their cherished delegate was a stimulating cause The excitement was great the enthusiasm earnest and deep There was enough distress to make people discontented without depressing them And Devilsdust after attending a council of the Union retired to rest and dreamed of strong speeches and spicy resolutions bands and banners the cheers of assembled thousands and the eventual triumph of the sacred rights The post of the next morning brought great and stirring news to Mowbray Gerard had undergone his examination at Bow Street It was a long and laborious one he was committed for trial for a seditious conspiracy but he was held to bail The bail demanded was heavy but it was prepared and instantly proffered His sureties were Morley and a mister Hatton By this post Morley wrote to his friends apprising them that both Gerard and himself intended to leave London instantly and that they might be expected to arrive at Mowbray by the evening train The monster meeting of the Moor it was instantly resolved should be converted into a triumphant procession or rather be preceded by one Messengers on horseback were sent to all the neighbouring towns to announce the great event Every artisan felt as a Moslemin summoned by the sacred standard All went forth with their wives and their children to hail the return of the patriot and the martyr The Trades of Mowbray mustered early in the morning and in various processions took possession of all the churches Their great pride was entirely to fill the church of mister saint Lys who not daunted by their demonstration and seizing the offered opportunity suppressed the sermon with which he had supplied himself and preached to them an extemporary discourse on Fear God and honour the King In the dissenting chapels thanksgivings were publicly offered that bail had been accepted for Walter Gerard After the evening service which the Unions again attended they formed in the High Street and lined it with their ranks and banners Every half hour a procession arrived from some neighbouring town with its music and streaming flags Each was received by Warner or some other member of the managing committee who assigned to them their appointed position which they took up without confusion nor was the general order for a moment disturbed Sometimes a large party arrived without music or banners but singing psalms and headed by their minister sometimes the children walked together the women following then the men each with a ribbon of the same colour in his hat all hurried yet spontaneous and certain indications how mankind under the influence of high and earnest feelings recur instantly to ceremony and form how when the imagination is excited it appeals to the imagination and requires for its expression something beyond the routine of daily life It was arranged that the moment the train arrived and the presence of Gerard was ascertained the Trade in position nearest to the station should commence the hymn of Labour which was instantly to be taken up by its neighbour and so on in succession so that by an almost electrical agency the whole population should almost simultaneously be assured of his arrival At half past six o clock the bell announced that the train was in sight a few minutes afterwards Dandy Mick hurried up to the leader of the nearest Trade spoke a few words and instantly the signal was given and the hymn commenced It was taken up as the steeples of a great city in the silence of the night take up the new hour that has just arrived one by one the mighty voices rose till they all blended in one vast waving sea of sound Warner and some others welcomed Gerard and Morley and ushered them totally unprepared for such a reception to an open carriage drawn by four white horses that was awaiting them Orders were given that there was to be no cheering or any irregular clamour Alone was heard the hymn As the carriage passed each Trade they followed and formed in procession behind it thus all had the opportunity of beholding their chosen chief and he the proud consolation of looking on the multitude who thus enthusiastically recognised the sovereignty of his services The interminable population the mighty melody the incredible order the simple yet awful solemnity this representation of the great cause to which she was devoted under an aspect that at once satisfied the reason captivated the imagination and elevated the heart her admiration of her father thus ratified as it were by the sympathy of a nation added to all the recent passages of her life teeming with such strange and trying interest overcame Sybil The tears fell down her cheek as the carriage bore away her father while she remained under the care of one unknown to the people of Mowbray but who had accompanied her from London this was Hatton The last light of the sun was shed over the Moor when Gerard reached it and the Druids altar and its surrounding crags were burnished with its beam Book five Chapter eleven It was the night following the day after the return of Gerard to Mowbray Morley who had lent to him and Sybil his cottage in the dale was at the office of his newspaper the Mowbray Phalanx where he now resided He was alone in his room writing occasionally rising from his seat and pacing the chamber when some one knocked at his door Receiving a permission to come in there entered Hatton I fear I am disturbing an article said the guest By no means the day of labour is not at hand I am very pleased to see you My quarters are not very inviting continued Hatton It is remarkable what bad accommodation you find in these great trading towns I should have thought that the mercantile traveller had been a comfortable animal not to say a luxurious but I find everything mean and third rate The wine execrable So I thought I would come and bestow my tediousness on you Tis hardly fair You could not have pleased me better I was rather from distraction than from exigency throwing some thoughts on paper But the voice of yesterday still lingers in my ear What a spectacle Yes you see what a multitude presents who have recognised the predominance of Moral Power said Morley The spectacle was august but the results to which such a public mind must lead are sublime It must have been deeply gratifying to our friend said Hatton It will support him in his career said Morley And console him in his prison added Hatton You think that it will come to that said Morley inquiringly It has that aspect but appearances change What should change them Time and accident which change everything Time will bring the York Assizes said Morley musingly and as for accident I confess the future seems to me dreary What can happen for Gerard He might win his writ of right said Hatton demurely stretching out his legs and leaning back in his chair That also may be tried at the York Assizes His writ of right I thought that was a feint a mere affair of tactics to keep the chance of the field I believe the field may be won said Hatton very composedly Won Ay the castle and manor of Mowbray and half the lordships round to say nothing of this good town The people are prepared to be his subjects he must give up equality and be content with being a popular sovereign You jest my friend Then I speak truth in jest sometimes you know the case What mean you said Morley rising and approaching Hatton for though I have often observed you like a biting phrase you never speak idly Tell me what you mean I mean said Hatton looking Morley earnestly in the face and speaking with great gravity that the documents are in existence which prove the title of Walter Gerard to the proprietorship of this great district that I know where the documents are to be found and that it requires nothing but a resolution equal to the occasion to secure them Should that be wanting said Morley I should think not said Hatton It would belie our nature to believe so And where are these documents In the muniment room of Mowbray castle Hah exclaimed Morley in a prolonged tone Kept closely by one who knows their value for they are the title deeds not of his right but of his confusion And how can we obtain them By means more honest than those they were acquired by They are not obvious Two hundred thousand human beings yesterday acknowledged the supremacy of Gerard said Hatton Suppose they had known that within the walls of Mowbray Castle were contained the proofs that Walter Gerard was the lawful possessor of the lands on which they live I say suppose that had been the case Do you think they would have contented themselves with singing psalms What would have become of moral power then They would have taken Mowbray Castle by storm they would have sacked and gutted it they would have appointed a chosen band to rifle the round tower they would have taken care that every document in it especially an iron chest painted blue and blazoned with the shield of Valence should have been delivered to you to me to any one that Gerard appointed for the office And what could be the remedy of the Earl de Mowbray He could scarcely bring an action against the hundred for the destruction of the castle which we would prove was not his own And the most he could do would be to transport some poor wretches who had got drunk in his plundered cellars and then set fire to his golden saloons You amaze me said Morley looking with an astonished expression on the person who had just delivered himself of these suggestive details with the same coolness and arid accuracy that he would have entered into the details of a pedigree Tis a practical view of the case remarked mister Hatton Morley paced the chamber disturbed Hatton remained silent and watched him with a scrutinizing eye Are you certain of your facts at length said Morley abruptly stopping Quite so Lord de Mowbray informed me of the circumstances himself before I left London and I came down here in consequence You know him No one better And these documents some of them I suppose said Morley with a cynical look were once in your own possession then Possibly Would they were now But it is a great thing to know where they may be found Then they once were the property of Gerard Hardly that They were gained by my own pains and often paid for with my own purse Claimed by no one I parted with them to a person to whom they were valuable It is not merely to serve Gerard that I want them now though I would willingly serve him I have need of some of these papers with respect to an ancient title a claim to which by a person in whom I am interested they would substantiate Now listen good friend Morley moral force is a fine thing especially in speculation and so is a community of goods especially when a man has no property but when you have lived as long as I have and have tasted of the world s delight you ll comprehend the rapture of acquisition and learn that it is generally secured by very coarse means Come I have a mind that you should prosper The public spirit is inflamed here you are a leader of the people Let us have another meeting on the Moor a preconcerted outbreak you can put your fingers in a trice on the men who will do our work Mowbray Castle is in their possession we secure our object You shall have ten thousand pounds on the nail and I will take you back to London with me besides and teach you what is fortune I understand you said Morley You have a clear brain and a bold spirit you have no scruples which indeed are generally the creatures of perplexity rather than of principle You ought to succeed We ought to succeed you mean said Hatton for I have long perceived that you only wanted opportunity to mount Yesterday was a great burst of feeling occasioned by a very peculiar cause said Morley musingly but it must not mislead us The discontent here is not deep The people are still employed though not fully Wages have fallen but they must drop more THE PEOPLE are not ripe for the movement you intimate There are thousands who would rush to the rescue of the castle Besides there is a priest here one saint Lys who exercises a most pernicious influence over the people It will require immense efforts and great distress to root him out No it would fail Then we must wait awhile said Hatton or devise some other means Tis a very impracticable case said Morley There is a combination for every case said Hatton Ponder and it comes This seemed simple but you think you really think it would not answer At this moment not that is my conviction Well suppose instead of an insurrection we have a burglary Can you assist me to the right hands here Not I indeed What is the use then of this influence over the people of which you and Gerard are always talking After yesterday I thought here you could do anything We have not hitherto had the advantage of your worldly knowledge in future we shall be wiser Well then said Hatton we must now think of Gerard s defence He shall have the best counsel I shall retain Kelly specially I shall return to town to morrow morning You will keep me alive to the state of feeling here and if things get more mature drop me a line and I will come down This conversation had better not be mentioned to Gerard That is obvious it would only disturb him I did not preface it by a stipulation of confidence because that is idle Of course you will keep the secret it is your interest it is a great possession I know very well you will be most jealous of sharing it I know it is as safe with you as with myself And with these words Hatton wished him a hearty farewell and withdrew He is right thought Morley he knows human nature well The secret is safe I will not breathe it to Gerard I will treasure it up It is knowledge it is power great knowledge great power And what shall I do with it Time will teach me END OF THE FIFTH BOOK BOOK VI Book six Chapter one Another week exclaimed a gentleman in Downing Street on the fifth of August eighteen forty two and we shall be prorogued You can surely keep the country quiet for another week I cannot answer for the public peace for another four and twenty hours replied his companion This business at Manchester must be stopped at once you have a good force there Manchester is nothing these are movements merely to distract The serious work is not now to be apprehended in the cotton towns The state of Staffordshire and Warwickshire is infinitely more menacing Cheshire and Yorkshire alarm me The accounts from Scotland are as bad as can be And though I think the sufferings of thirty nine will keep Birmingham and the Welch collieries in check we cannot venture to move any of our force from those districts You must summon a council for four o clock I have some deputations to receive which I will throw over but to Windsor I must go Nothing has yet occurred to render any notice of the state of the country necessary in the speech from the Throne Not yet said his companion but what will to morrow bring forth After all it is only a turn out I cannot recast her Majesty s speech and bring in rebellion and closed mills instead of loyalty and a good harvest It would be a bore Well we will see to morrow and the colleague left the room And now for these deputations said the gentleman in Downing Street of all things in the world I dislike a deputation I do not care how much I labour in the Closet or the house that s real work the machine is advanced But receiving a deputation is like sham marching an immense dust and no progress To listen to their views As if I did not know what their views were before they stated them And to put on a countenance of respectful candour while they are developing their exploded or their impracticable systems Were it not that at a practised crisis I permit them to see conviction slowly stealing over my conscience I believe the fellows would never stop I cannot really receive these deputations I must leave them to Hoaxem and the gentleman in Downing Street rang his bell Well mister Hoaxem resumed the gentleman in Downing Street as that faithful functionary entered there are some deputations I understand to day You must receive them as I am going to Windsor What are they There are only two sir of moment The rest I could easily manage And these two In the first place there is our friend Colonel Bosky the members for the county of Calfshire and a deputation of tenant farmers Pah These must be attended to The members have made a strong representation to me that they really cannot any longer vote with government unless the Treasury assists them in satisfying their constituents And what do they want Statement of grievances high taxes and low prices mild expostulations and gentle hints that they have been thrown over by their friends Polish corn Holstein cattle and British income tax Well you know what to say said the gentleman in Downing Street Tell them generally that they are quite mistaken prove to them particularly that my only object has been to render protection more protective by making it practical and divesting it of the surplusage of odium that no foreign corn can come in at fifty five shillings that there are not enough cattle in all Holstein to supply the parish of Pancras daily with beef steaks and that as for the income tax they will be amply compensated for it by their diminished cost of living through the agency of that very tariff of which they are so superficially complaining Their diminished cost of living said mister Hoaxem a little confused Would not that assurance I humbly suggest clash a little with my previous demonstration that we had arranged that no reduction of prices should take place Not at all your previous demonstration is of course true but at the same time you must impress upon them the necessity of general views to form an opinion of particular instances As for example a gentleman of five thousand pounds per annum pays to the income tax which by the bye always call property tax one hundred and fifty pounds a year Well I have materially reduced the duties on eight hundred articles The consumption of each of those articles by an establishment of five thousand pounds per annum cannot be less than one pound per article The reduction of price cannot be less than a moiety therefore a saving of four hundred per annum which placed against the deduction of the property tax leaves a clear increase of income of two hundred and fifty pounds per annum by which you see that a property tax in fact increases income I see said mister Hoaxem with an admiring glance And what am I to say to the deputation of the manufacturers of Mowbray complaining of the great depression of trade and the total want of remunerating profits You must say exactly the reverse said the gentleman in Downing Street Show them how much I have done to promote the revival of trade First of all in making provisions cheaper cutting off at one blow half the protection on corn as for example at this moment under the old law the duty on foreign wheat would have been twenty seven shillings a quarter under the new law it is thirteen To be sure no wheat could come in at either price but that does not alter the principle Then as to live cattle show how I have entirely opened the trade with the continent in live cattle Enlarge upon this the subject is speculative and admits of expensive estimates If there be any dissenters on the deputation who having freed the negroes have no subject left for their foreign sympathies hint at the tortures of the bullfight and the immense consideration to humanity that instead of being speared at Seville the Andalusian Toro will probably in future be cut up at Smithfield This cheapness of provisions will permit them to compete with the foreigner in all neutral markets in time beat them in their own It is a complete compensation too for the property tax which impress upon them is a great experiment and entirely for their interests Ring the changes on great measures and great experiments till it is time to go down and make a house Your official duties of course must not be interfered with They will take the hint I have no doubt you will get through the business very well mister Hoaxem particularly if you be frank and explicit that is the right line to take when you wish to conceal your own mind and to confuse the minds of others Good morning Book six Chapter two Two days after this conversation in Downing Street a special messenger arrived at Marney Abbey from the Lord Lieutenant of the county the Duke of Fitz Aquitaine Immediately after reading the despatch of which he was the bearer there was a great bustle in the house Lady Marney was sent for to her husband s library and there enjoined immediately to write various letters which were to prevent certain expected visitors from arriving Captain Grouse was in and out the same library every five minutes receiving orders and counter orders and finally mounting his horse was flying about the neighbourhood with messages and commands All this stir signified that the Marney regiment of Yeomanry were to be called out directly Lord Marney who had succeeded in obtaining a place in the Household and was consequently devoted to the institutions of the country was full of determination to uphold them but at the same time with characteristic prudence was equally resolved that the property principally protected should be his own and that the order of his own district should chiefly engage his solicitude I do not know what the Duke means by marching into the disturbed districts said Lord Marney to Captain Grouse These are disturbed districts There have been three fires in one week and I want to know what disturbance can be worse than that In my opinion this is a mere anti corn law riot to frighten the government and suppose they do stop the mills what then I wish they were all stopped and then one might live like a gentleman again Egremont between whom and his brother a sort of bad tempered good understanding had of late years to a certain degree flourished in spite of Lord Marney remaining childless which made him hate Egremont with double distilled virulence and chiefly by the affectionate manoeuvres of their mother but whose annual visits to Marney had generally been limited to the yeomanry week arrived from London the same day as the letter of the Lord Lieutenant as he had learnt that his brother s regiment in which he commanded a troop as well as the other yeomanry corps in the North of England must immediately take the field Five years had elapsed since the commencement of our history and they had brought apparently much change to the character of the brother of Lord Marney He had become especially during the last two or three years silent and reserved he rarely entered society even the company of those who were once his intimates had ceased to attract him he was really a melancholy man The change in his demeanour was observed by all his mother and his sister in law were the only persons who endeavoured to penetrate its cause and sighed over the failure of their sagacity Quit the world and the world forgets you and Egremont would have soon been a name no longer mentioned in those brilliant saloons which he once adorned had not occasionally a sensation produced by an effective speech in the House of Commons recalled his name to his old associates who then remembered the pleasant hours passed in his society and wondered why he never went anywhere now I suppose he finds society a bore said Lord Eugene de Vere I am sure I do but then what is a fellow to do I am not in Parliament like Egremont I believe after all that s the thing for I have tried everything else and everything else is a bore I think one should marry like Alfred Mountchesney said Lord Milford But what is the use of marrying if you do not marry a rich woman and the heiresses of the present age will not marry What can be more unnatural It alone ought to produce a revolution Why Alfred is the only fellow who has made a coup and then he has not got it down She behaved in a most unprincipled manner to me that Fitz Warene said Lord Milford always took my bouquets and once made me write some verses By Jove said Lord Eugene I should like to see them What a bore it must have been to write verses I only copied them out of Mina Blake s album but I sent them in my own handwriting Baffled sympathy was the cause of Egremont s gloom It is the secret spring of most melancholy He loved and loved in vain The conviction that his passion though hopeless was not looked upon with disfavour only made him the more wretched for the disappointment is more acute in proportion as the chance is better He had never seen Sybil since the morning he quitted her in Smith s Square immediately before her departure for the North The trial of Gerard had taken place at the assizes of that year he had been found guilty and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment in York Castle the interference of Egremont both in the House of Commons and with the government saved him from the felon confinement with which he was at first threatened and from which assuredly state prisoners should be exempt During this effort some correspondence had taken place between Egremont and Sybil which he would willingly have encouraged and maintained but it ceased nevertheless with its subject Sybil through the influential interference of Ursula Trafford lived at the convent at York during the imprisonment of her father and visited him daily The anxiety to take the veil which had once characterised Sybil had certainly waned Perhaps her experience of life had impressed her with the importance of fulfilling vital duties Her father though he had never opposed her wish had never encouraged it and he had now increased and interesting claims on her devotion He had endured great trials and had fallen on adverse fortunes Sybil would look at him and though his noble frame was still erect and his countenance still displayed that mixture of frankness and decision which had distinguished it of yore she could not conceal from herself that there were ravages which time could not have produced A year and a half of imprisonment had shaken to its centre a frame born for action and shrinking at all times from the resources of sedentary life The disappointment of high hopes had jarred and tangled even the sweetness of his noble disposition He needed solicitude and solace and Sybil resolved that if vigilance and sympathy could soothe an existence that would otherwise be embittered these guardian angels should at least hover over the life of her father When the term of his imprisonment had ceased Gerard had returned with his daughter to Mowbray Had he deigned to accept the offers of his friends he need not have been anxious as to his future A public subscription for his service had been collected Morley who was well to do in the world for the circulation of the Mowbray Phalanx daily increased with the increasing sufferings of the people offered his friend to share his house and purse Hatton was munificent there was no limit either to his offers or his proffered services But all were declined Gerard would live by labour The post he had occupied at mister Trafford s was not vacant even if that gentleman had thought fit again to receive him but his reputation as a first rate artizan soon obtained him good employment though on this occasion in the town of Mowbray which for the sake of his daughter he regretted He had no pleasant home now for Sybil but he had the prospect of one and until he obtained possession of it Sybil sought a refuge which had been offered to her from the first with her kindest and dearest friend so that at this period of our history she was again an inmate of the convent at Mowbray whither her father and Morley had attended her the eve of the day she had first visited the ruins of Marney Abbey Book six Chapter three I have seen a many things in my time missus Trotman said Chaffing Jack as he took the pipe from his mouth in the silent bar room of the Cat and Fiddle but I never see any like this I think I ought to know Mowbray if any one does for man and boy I have breathed this air for a matter of half a century I sucked it in when it tasted of primroses and this tavern was a cottage covered with honeysuckle in the middle of green fields where the lads came and drank milk from the cow with their lasses and I have inhaled what they call the noxious atmosphere when a hundred chimneys have been smoking like one and always found myself pretty well Nothing like business to give one an appetite But when shall I feel peckish again missus Trotman The longest lane has a turning they say mister Trotman Never knew anything like this before replied her husband and I have seen bad times but I always used to say Mark my words friends Mowbray will rally My words carried weight missus Trotman in this quarter as they naturally should coming from a man of my experience especially when I gave tick Every man I chalked up was of the same opinion as the landlord of the Cat and Fiddle and always thought that Mowbray would rally That s the killing feature of these times missus Trotman there s no rallying in the place I begin to think it s the machines said missus Trotman Nonsense said mister Trotman it s the corn laws The town of Mowbray ought to clothe the world with our resources Why Shuffle and Screw can turn out forty mile of calico per day but where s the returns That s the point As the American gentleman said who left his bill unpaid Take my breadstuffs and I ll give you a cheque at sight on the Pennsylvanian Bank It s very true said missus Trotman Who s there Nothing in my way said a woman with a basket of black cherries with a pair of tin scales thrown upon their top Ah missus Carey said Chaffing Jack is that you My mortal self mister Trotman tho I be sure I feel more like a ghost than flesh and blood You may well say that missus Carey you and I have known Mowbray as long I should think as any in this quarter And never see such times as these mister Trotman nor the like of such But I always thought it would come to this everything turned topsy turvy as it were the children getting all the wages and decent folk turned adrift to pick up a living as they could It s something of a judgment in my mind mister Trotman It s the trade leaving the county widow and no mistake And how shall we bring it back again said the widow the police ought to interfere We must have cheap bread said mister Trotman So they tell me said the widow but whether bread be cheap or dear don t much signify if we have nothing to buy it with You don t want anything in my way neighbour It s not very tempting I fear said the good widow in a rather mournful tone but a little fresh fruit cools the mouth in this sultry time and at any rate it takes me into the world It seems like business tho very hard to turn a penny by but one s neighbours are very kind and a little chat about the dreadful times always puts me in spirits Well we will take a pound for the sake of trade widow said missus Trotman And here s a glass of gin and water widow said mister Trotman and when Mowbray rallies you shall come and pay for it Thank you both very kindly said the widow a good neighbour as our minister says is the pool of Bethesda and as you say Mowbray will rally I never said so exclaimed Chaffing Jack interrupting her Don t go about for to say that I said Mowbray would rally My words have some weight in this quarter widow Mowbray rally Why should it rally Where s the elements Where indeed said Devilsdust as he entered the Cat and Fiddle with Dandy Mick there is not the spirit of a louse in Mowbray That s a true bill said Mick Is there another white livered town in the whole realm where the operatives are all working half time and thanking the Capitalists for keeping the mills going and only starving them by inches said Devilsdust in a tone of scorn That s your time of day said Mick Very glad to see you gentlemen said mister Trotman pray be seated There s a little baccy left yet in Mowbray and a glass of twist at your service Nothing exciseable for me said Devilsdust Well it ayn t exactly the right ticket missus Trotman I believe said Mick bowing gallantly to the lady but pon my soul I am so thirsty that I ll take Chaffing Jack at his word and so saying Mick and Devilsdust ensconced themselves in the bar while good hearted missus Carey sipped her glass of gin and water which she frequently protested was a pool of Bethesda Well Jack said Devilsdust I suppose you have heard the news If it be anything that has happened at Mowbray especially in this quarter I should think I had Times must be very bad indeed that some one does not drop in to tell me anything that has happened and to ask my advice It s nothing to do with Mowbray Thank you kindly missus Trotman said Mick and here s your very good health Then I am in the dark said Chaffing Jack replying to the previous observation of Devilsdust for I never see a newspaper now except a week old and that lent by a friend I who used to take my Sun regular to say nothing of the Dispatch and Bell s Life Times is changed mister Radley You speak like a book mister Trotman said Mick and here s your very good health But as for newspapers I m all in the dark myself for the Literary and Scientific is shut up and no subscribers left except the honorary ones and not a journal to be had except the Moral World and that s gratis As bad as the Temple said Chaffing Jack it s all up with the institutions of the country And what then is the news Labour is triumphant in Lancashire said Devilsdust with bitter solemnity The deuce it is said Chaffing Jack What have they raised wages No said Devilsdust but they have stopped the mills That won t mend matters much said Jack with a puff Won t it The working classes will have less to spend than ever And what will the Capitalists have to spend said Devilsdust Worse and worse said mister Trotman you will never get institutions like the Temple re opened on this system Don t you be afraid Jack said Mick tossing off his tumbler if we only get our rights won t we have a blowout We must have a struggle said Devilsdust and teach the Capitalists on whom they depend so that in future they are not to have the lion s share and then all will be right A fair day s wage for a fair day s work said Mick that s your time of day It began at Staleybridge said Devilsdust and they have stopped them all and now they have marched into Manchester ten thousand strong They pelted the police And cheered the red coats like blazes said Mick The soldiers will fraternise said Devilsdust Do what said missus Trotman Stick their bayonets into the Capitalists who have hired them to cut the throats of the working classes said Devilsdust The Queen is with us said Mick It s well known she sets her face against gals working in mills like blazes Well this is news said missus Carey I always thought some good would come of having a woman on the throne and repeating her thanks and pinning on her shawl the widow retired eager to circulate the intelligence And now that we are alone said Devilsdust the question is what are we to do here and we came to consult you Jack as you know Mowbray better than any living man This thing will spread It won t stop short I have had a bird too singing something in my ear these two days past If they do not stop it in Lancashire and I defy them there will be a general rising I have seen a many things in my time said mister Trotman some risings and some strikes and as stiff turn outs as may be But to my fancy there is nothing like a strike in prosperous times there s more money sent under those circumstances than you can well suppose young gentlemen It s as good as Mowbray Staty any day But now to the point said Devilsdust The people are regularly sold they want a leader Why there s Gerard said Chaffing Jack never been a better man in my time And Warner the greatest man the Handlooms ever turned out Ay ay said Devilsdust but they have each of them had a year and a half and that cools blood Besides said Mick they are too old and Stephen Morley has got round them preaching moral force and all that sort of gammon I never heard that moral force won the battle of Waterloo said Devilsdust I wish the Capitalists would try moral force a little and see whether it would keep the thing going If the Capitalists will give up their red coats I would be a moral force man to morrow And the new police said Mick A pretty go when a fellow in a blue coat fetches you the Devil s own con on your head and you get moral force for a plaister Why that s all very well said Chaffing Jack but I am against violence at least much I don t object to a moderate riot provided it is not in my quarter of the town Well that s not the ticket now said Mick We don t want no violence all we want is to stop all the mills and hands in the kingdom and have a regular national holiday for six weeks at least I have seen a many things in my time said Chaffing Jack solemnly but I have always observed that if the people had worked generally for half time for a week they would stand anything That s a true bill said Mick Their spirit is broken said Chaffing Jack or else they never would have let the Temple have been shut up And think of our Institute without a single subscriber said Mick The gals is the only thing what has any spirit left Julia told me just now she would go to the cannon s mouth for the Five Points any summer day You think the spirit can t be raised Chaffing Jack said Devilsdust very seriously You ought to be a judge If I don t know Mowbray who does Trust my word the house won t draw Then it is U P said Mick Hush said Devilsdust But suppose it spreads It won t spread said Chaffing Jack I ve seen a deal of these things I fancy from what you say it s a cotton squall It will pass Sir Let me see the miners out and then I will talk to you Stranger things than that have happened said Devilsdust Then things get serious said Chaffing Jack Them miners is very stubborn and when they gets excited ayn t it a bear at play that s all Well said Devilsdust what you say is well worth attention but all the same I feel we are on the eve of a regular crisis No by jingo said Mick and tossing his cap into the air he snapped his fingers with delight at the anticipated amusement Book six Chapter four I don t think I can stand this much longer said mister Mountchesney the son in law of Lord de Mowbray to his wife as he stood before the empty fire place with his back to the mantelpiece and his hands thrust into the pockets of his coat This living in the country in August bores me to extinction I think we will go to Baden Joan But papa is so anxious dearest Alfred that we should remain here at present and see the neighbours a little I might be induced to remain here to please your father but as for your neighbours I have seen quite enough of them They are not a sort of people that I ever met before or that I wish to meet again I do not know what to say to them nor can I annex an idea to what they say to me Heigho certainly the country in August is a thing of which no one who has not tried it has the most remote conception But you always used to say you doted on the country Alfred said Lady Joan in a tone of tender reproach So I do I never was happier than when I was at Melton and even enjoyed the country in August when I was on the Moors But I cannot well go to Melton said Lady Joan I don t see why you can t missus Shelldrake goes with her husband to Melton and so does Lady Di with Barham and a very pleasant life it is Well at any rate we cannot go to Melton now said Lady Joan mortified and it is impossible for me to go to the Moors No but I could go said mister Mountchesney and leave you here I might have gone with Eugene de Vere and Milford and Fitz heron They wanted me very much What a capital party it would have been and what capital sport we should have had And I need not have been away for more than a month or perhaps six weeks and I could have written to you every day and all that sort of thing Lady Joan sighed and affected to recur to the opened volume which during this conversation she had held in her hand I wonder where Maud is said mister Mountchesney I shall want her to ride with me to day She is a capital horsewoman and always amuses me As you cannot ride now Joan I wish you would let Maud have Sunbeam As you please Well I am going to the stables and will tell them Who is this mister Mountchesney exclaimed and then walked to the window that looking over the park showed at a distance the advance of a very showy equipage Lady Joan looked up Come here Joan and tell me who this is and Lady Joan was at his side in a moment It is the livery of the Bardolfs said Lady Joan I always call them Firebrace I cannot get out of it said mister Mountchesney Well I am glad it is they I thought it might be an irruption of barbarians Lady Bardolf will bring us some news Lord and Lady Bardolf were not alone they were accompanied by a gentleman who had been staying on a visit at Firebrace and who being acquainted with Lord de Mowbray had paid his respects to the castle in his way to London This gentleman was the individual who had elevated them to the peerage mister Hatton A considerable intimacy had sprung up between him and his successful clients Firebrace was an old place rebuilt in the times of the Tudors but with something of its more ancient portions remaining and with a storehouse of muniments that had escaped the civil wars Hatton revelled in them and in pursuing his researches had already made discoveries which might perhaps place the coronet of the earldom of Lovel on the brow of the former champion of the baronetage who now however never mentioned the Order Lord de Mowbray was well content to see mister Hatton a gentleman in whom he did not repose the less confidence because his advice given him three years ago respecting the writ of right and the claim upon his estate had proved so discreet and correct Acting on that advice Lord de Mowbray had instructed his lawyers to appear to the action without entering into any unnecessary explanation of the merits of his case He counted on the accuracy of mister Hatton s judgment that the claim would not be pursued and he was right after some fencing and preliminary manoeuvring the claim had not been pursued Lord de Mowbray therefore always gracious was disposed to accord a very distinguished reception to his confidential counsellor He pressed very much his guests to remain with him some days and though that was not practicable mister Hatton promised that he would not leave the neighbourhood without paying another visit to the castle And you continue quiet here said mister Hatton to Lord de Mowbray And I am told we shall keep so said Lord de Mowbray The mills are mostly at work and the men take the reduced wages in a good spirit The fact is our agitators in this neighbourhood suffered pretty smartly in thirty nine and the Chartists have lost their influence I am sorry for poor Lady saint Julians said Lady Bardolf to Lady de Mowbray It must be such a disappointment and she has had so many but I understand there is nobody to blame but herself If she had only left the Prince alone but she would not be quiet And where are the Deloraines They are at Munich with which they are delighted And Lady Deloraine writes me that mister Egremont has promised to join them there If he do they mean to winter at Rome Somebody said he was going to be married said Lady de Mowbray His mother wishes him to marry said Lady Bardolf but I have heard nothing mister Mountchesney came in and greeted the Bardolfs with some warmth How delightful in the country in August to meet somebody that you have seen in London in June he exclaimed Now dear Lady Bardolf do tell me something for you can conceive nothing so triste as we are here We never get a letter Joan only corresponds with philosophers and Maud with clergymen and none of my friends ever write to me Perhaps you never write to them Well I never have been a letter writer because really I never wanted to write or to be written to I always knew what was going on because I was on the spot I was doing the things that people were writing letters about but now not being in the world any longer doing nothing living in the country and the country in August I should like to receive letters every day but I do not know who to fix upon as a correspondent Eugene de Vere will not write Milford cannot and as for Fitz heron he is so very selfish he always wants his letters answered That is very unreasonable said Lady Bardolf Besides what can they tell me at this moment They have gone to the Moors and are enjoying themselves They asked me to go with them but I could not go because you see I could not leave Joan though why I could not leave her I really cannot understand because Egerton has got some moors this year and he leaves Lady Augusta with her father Lady Maud entered the room in her bonnet returning from an airing She was all animation charmed to see everybody she had been to Mowbray to hear some singing at the Roman Catholic chapel in that town a service had been performed and a collection made for the suffering workpeople of the place She had been apprised of it for some days was told that she would hear the most beautiful voice that she had ever listened to but it had far exceeded her expectations A female voice it seemed no tones could be conceived more tender and yet more thrilling in short seraphic mister Mountchesney blamed her for not taking him He liked music singing especially female singing when there was so little to amuse him he was surprised that Lady Maud had not been careful that he should have been present His sister in law reminded him that she had particularly requested him to drive her over to Mowbray and he had declined the honour as a bore Yes said mister Mountchesney but I thought Joan was going with you and that you would be shopping It was a good thing our House was adjourned before these disturbances in Lancashire said Lord Bardolf to Lord de Mowbray The best thing we can all do is to be on our estates I believe said Lord de Mowbray My neighbour Marney is in a great state of excitement said Lord Bardolf all his yeomanry out But he is quiet at Marney In a way but these fires puzzle us Marney will not believe that the condition of the labourer has anything to do with them and he certainly is a very acute man But still I don t know what to say to it The poor law is very unpopular in my parish Marney will have it that the incendiaries are all strangers hired by the anti Corn law League Ah here is Lady Joan exclaimed Lady Bardolf as the wife of mister Mountchesney entered the room My dearest Lady Joan Why Joan said mister Mountchesney Maud has been to Mowbray and heard the most delicious singing Why did we not go I did mention it to you Alfred I remember you said something about going to Mowbray and that you wanted to go to several places But there is nothing I hate so much as shopping It bores me more than anything And you are so peculiarly long when you are shopping But singing and beautiful singing in a Catholic chapel by a woman perhaps a beautiful woman that is quite a different thing and I should have been amused which nobody seems ever to think of here I do not know how you find it Lady Bardolf but the country to me in August is a something and not finishing his sentence mister Mountchesney gave a look of inexpressible despair And you did not see this singer said mister Hatton sidling up to Lady Maud and speaking in a subdued tone I did not but they tell me she is most beautiful something extraordinary I tried to see her but it was impossible Is she a professional singer I should imagine not a daughter of one of the Mowbray people I believe Let us have her over to the Castle Lady de Mowbray said mister Mountchesney If you like replied Lady de Mowbray with a languid smile Well at last I have got something to do said mister Mountchesney I will ride over to Mowbray find out the beautiful singer and bring her to the Castle Book six Chapter five The beam of the declining sun softened by the stained panes of a small gothic window suffused the chamber of the Lady Superior of the convent of Mowbray The vaulted room of very moderate dimensions was furnished with great simplicity and opened into a small oratory On a table were several volumes an ebon cross was fixed in a niche and leaning in a high backed chair sate Ursula Trafford Her pale and refined complexion that in her youth had been distinguished for its lustre became her spiritual office and indeed her whole countenance the delicate brow the serene glance the small aquiline nose and the well shaped mouth firm and yet benignant betokened the celestial soul that habited that gracious frame The Lady Superior was not alone on a low seat by her side holding her hand and looking up into her face with a glance of reverential sympathy was a maiden over whose head five summers have revolved since first her girlhood broke upon our sight amid the ruins of Marney Abbey five summers that have realized the matchless promise of her charms and while they have added something to her stature have robbed it of nothing of its grace and have rather steadied the blaze of her beauty than diminished its radiance Yes I mourn over them said Sybil the deep convictions that made me look forward to the cloister as my home Is it that the world has assoiled my soul Yet I have not tasted of worldly joys all that I have known of it has been suffering and tears They will return these visions of my sacred youth dear friend tell me that they will return I too have had visions in my youth Sybil and not of the cloister yet am I here And what should I infer said Sybil enquiringly That my visions were of the world and brought me to the cloister and that yours were of the cloister and have brought you to the world My heart is sad said Sybil and the sad should seek the shade It is troubled my child rather than sorrowful Sybil shook her head Yes my child said Ursula the world has taught you that there are affections which the cloister can neither satisfy nor supply Ah Sybil I too have loved The blood rose to the cheek of Sybil and then returned as quickly to the heart her trembling hand pressed that of Ursula as she sighed and murmured No no no Yes it is his spirit that hovers over your life Sybil and in vain you would forget what haunts your heart One not less gifted than him as good as gentle as gracious once too breathed in my ear the accents of joy He was like myself the child of an old house and Nature had invested him with every quality that can dazzle and can charm But his heart was as pure and his soul as lofty as his intellect and frame were bright and Ursula paused Sybil pressed the hand of Ursula to her lips and whispered Speak on The dreams of by gone days continued Ursula in a voice of emotion the wild sorrows than I can recall and yet feel that I was wisely chastened He was stricken in his virtuous pride the day before he was to have led me to that altar where alone I found the consolation that never fails And thus closed some years of human love my Sybil said Ursula bending forward and embracing her The world for a season crossed their fair current and a power greater than the world forbade their banns but they are hallowed memory is my sympathy it is soft and free and when he came here to enquire after you his presence and agitated heart recalled the past It is too wild a thought said Sybil ruin to him ruin to all No we are severed by a fate as uncontrollable as severed you dear friend ours is a living death The morrow is unforeseen said Ursula Happy indeed would it be for me my Sybil that your innocence should be enshrined within these holy walls and that the pupil of my best years and the friend of my serene life should be my successor in this house But I feel a deep persuasion that the hour has not arrived for you to take the step that never can be recalled So saying Ursula embraced and dismissed Sybil for the conversation the last passages of which we have given had Occurred when Sybil according to her wont on Saturday afternoon had come to request the permission of the Lady Superior to visit her father It was in a tolerably spacious and not discomfortable chamber the first floor over the printing office of the Mowbray Phalanx that Gerard had found a temporary home He had not long returned from his factory and pacing the chamber with a disturbed step he awaited the expected arrival of his daughter She came the faithful step the well known knock the father and the daughter embraced he pressed to his heart the child who had clung to him through so many trials and who had softened so many sorrows who had been the visiting angel in his cell and whose devotion had led captivity captive Their meetings though regular were now comparatively rare The sacred day united them and sometimes for a short period the previous afternoon but otherwise the cheerful hearth and welcome home were no longer for Gerard And would the future bring them to him And what was to be the future of his child His mind vacillated between the convent of which she now seldom spoke and which with him was never a cherished idea and those dreams of restored and splendid fortunes which his sanguine temperament still whispered him in spite of hope so long deferred and expectations so often baulked might yet be realized And sometimes between these opposing visions there rose a third and more practical though less picturesque result the idea of her marriage And with whom It was impossible that one so rarely gifted and educated with so much daintiness could ever make a wife of the people Hatton offered wealth but Sybil had never seemed to comprehend his hopes and Gerard felt that their ill assorted ages was a great barrier There was of all the men of his own order but one who from his years his great qualities his sympathy and the nature of his toil and means seemed not unfitted to be the husband of his daughter and often had Gerard mused over the possibility of these intimate ties with Morley Sybil had been as it were bred up under his eye an affection had always subsisted between them and he knew well that in former days Sybil had appreciated and admired the great talents and acquirements of their friend At one period he almost suspected that Morley was attached to her And yet from causes which he had never attempted to penetrate probably from a combination of unintentional circumstances Sybil and Morley had for the last two or three years been thrown little together and their intimacy had entirely died away To Gerard it seemed that Morley had ever proved his faithful friend Morley had originally dissuaded him with energy against that course which had led to his discomfiture and punishment when arrested his former colleague was his bail was his companion and adviser during his trial had endeavoured to alleviate his imprisonment and on his release had offered to share his means with Gerard and when these were refused he at least supplied Gerard with a roof And yet with all this that abandonment of heart and brain and deep sympathy with every domestic thought that characterized old days was somehow or other wanting There was on the part of Morley still devotion but there was reserve You are troubled my father said Sybil as Gerard continued to pace the chamber Only a little restless I am thinking what a mistake it was to have moved in thirty nine Sybil sighed Ah you were right Sybil continued Gerard affairs were not ripe We should have waited three years Three years exclaimed Sybil starting are affairs riper now The whole of Lancashire is in revolt said Gerard There is not a sufficient force to keep them in check If the miners and colliers rise and I have cause to believe that it is more than probable they will move before many days are past the game is up You terrify me said Sybil On the Contrary said Gerard smiling the news is good enough I ll not say too good to be true for I had it from one of the old delegates who is over here to see what can be done in our north countree Yes said Sybil inquiringly and leading on her father He came to the works we had some talk There are to be no leaders this time at least no visible ones The people will do it themselves All the children of Labour are to rise on the same day and to toil no more till they have their rights No violence no bloodshed but toil halts and then our oppressors will learn the great economical truth as well as moral lesson that when Toil plays Wealth ceases When Toil ceases the People suffer said Sybil That is the only truth that we have learnt and it is a bitter one Can we be free without suffering said Gerard Is the greatest of human blessings to be obtained as a matter of course to be plucked like fruit or seized like a running stream No no we must suffer but we are wiser than of yore we will not conspire Conspiracies are for aristocrats not for nations Alas alas I see nothing but woe said Sybil I cannot believe that after all that has passed the people here will move I cannot believe that after all that has passed all that you that we have endured that you my father will counsel them to move I counsel nothing said Gerard It must be a great national instinct that does it but if all England if Wales if Scotland won t work is Mowbray to have a monopoly Ah that s a bitter jest said Sybil England Wales Scotland will be forced to work as they were forced before How can they subsist without labour And if they could there is an organised power that will subdue them The Benefit Societies the Sick and Burial Clubs have money in the banks that would maintain the whole working classes with aid in kind that will come for six weeks and that will do the business And as for force why there are not five soldiers to each town in the kingdom It s a glittering bugbear this fear of the military simultaneous strikes would baffle all the armies in Europe I ll go back and pray that all this is wild talk said Sybil earnestly After all that has passed were it only for your child you should not speak much less think this my father What havoc to our hearts and homes has been all this madness It has separated us it has destroyed our happy home it has done more than this and here she wept Nay nay my child said Gerard coming up and soothing her one cannot weigh one s words before those we love I can t hear of the people moving with coldness that s out of nature but I promise you I ll not stimulate the lads here I am told they are little inclined to stir You found me in a moment of what I must call I suppose elation but I hear they beat the red coats and police at Staley Bridge and that pricked my blood a bit I have been ridden down before this when I was a lad Sybil by Yeomanry hoofs You must allow a little for my feelings She extended her lips to the proffered embrace of her father He blessed her and pressed her to his heart and soothed her apprehensions with many words of softness There was a knock at the door Come in said Gerard And there came in mister Hatton They had not met since Gerard s release from York Castle There Hatton had visited him had exercised his influence to remedy his grievances and had more than once offered him the means of maintenance on receiving his freedom There were moments of despondency when Gerard had almost wished that the esteem and regard with which Sybil looked upon Hatton might have matured into sentiments of a deeper nature but on this subject the father had never breathed a word Nor had Hatton except to Gerard ever intimated his wishes for we could scarcely call them hopes He was a silent suitor of Sybil watching opportunities and ready to avail himself of circumstances which he worshipped His sanguine disposition fed by a very suggestive and inventive mind and stimulated by success and a prosperous life sustained him always to the last Hatton always believed that everything desirable must happen if a man had energy and watched circumstances He had confidence too in the influence of his really insinuating manner his fine taste his tender tone his ready sympathy all which masked his daring courage and absolute recklessness of means There were general greetings of the greatest warmth The eyes of Hatton were suffused with tears as he congratulated Gerard on his restored health and pressed Sybil s hand with the affection of an old friend between both his own I was down in this part of the world on business said Hatton and thought I would come over here for a day to find you all out And then after some general conversation he said And where do you think I accidentally paid a visit a day or two back At Mowbray Castle I see you are surprised I saw all your friends I did not ask his Lordship how the writ of right went on I dare say he thinks tis all hushed But he is mistaken I have learnt something which may help us over the stile yet Well a day said Gerard I once thought if I could get back the lands the people would at last have a friend but that s past I have been a dreamer of dreams often when I was overlooking them at work And so we all have I suppose I would willingly give up my claim if I could be sure the Lancashire lads will not come to harm this bout Tis a more serious business said Hatton than any thing of the kind that has yet happened The government are much alarmed They talk of sending the Guards down into the north and bringing over troops from Ireland Poor Ireland said Gerard Well I think the frieze coats might give us a helping hand now and employ the troops at least No my dear father say not such things Sybil will not let me think of these matters friend Hatton said Gerard smiling Well I suppose it s not in my way at least I certainly did not make the best hand of it in thirty nine but it was London that got me into that scrape I cannot help fancying that were I on our Moors here a bit with some good lads it might be different and I must say so I must indeed Sybil But you are very quiet here I hope said Hatton Oh yes said Gerard I believe our spirit is sufficiently broken at Mowbray Wages weekly dropping and just work enough to hinder sheer idleness that sort of thing keeps the people in very humble trim But wait a bit and when they have reached the starvation point I fancy we shall hear a murmur I remember our friend Morley in thirty nine when we returned from London gave me a very good character of the disposition of the people here said Hatton I hope it continues the same He feared no outbreak then and the distress in thirty nine was severe Well said Gerard the wages have been dropping ever since The people exist but you can scarcely say they live But they are cowed I fancy An empty belly is sometimes as apt to dull the heart as inflame the courage And then they have lost their leaders for I was away you see and have been quiet enough since I came out and Warner is broken he has suffered more from his time than I did which is strange for he had his pursuits whereas I was restless enough and that s the truth and had it not been for Sybil s daily visit I think though I may never be allowed to live in a castle I should certainly have died in one And how is Morley Right well the same as you left him I saw not a straw s change when I came out His paper spreads He still preaches moral force and believes that we shall all end in living in communities But as the only community of which I have personal experience is a gaol I am not much more inclined to his theory than heretofore Book six Chapter six The reader may not have altogether forgotten mister Nixon and his comates the miners and colliers of that district not very remote from Mowbray which Morley had visited at the commencement of this history in order to make fruitless researches after a gentleman whom he subsequently so unexpectedly stumbled upon Affairs were as little flourishing in that region as at Mowbray itself and the distress fell upon a population less accustomed to suffering and whose spirit was not daunted by the recent discomfiture and punishment of their leaders It can t last said Master Nixon as he took his pipe from his mouth at the Rising Sun He was responded to by a general groan It comes to this he continued Natur has her laws and this is one a fair day s wage for a fair day s work I wish you may get it said Juggins with a harder stint every week and a shilling a day knocked off And what s to come to morrow said Waghorn The butty has given notice to quit in Parker s field this day se nnight Simmons won t drop wages but works half time The boys will be at play afore long said a collier Hush said Master Nixon with a reproving glance play is a very serious word The boys are not to go to play as they used to do without by your leave or with your leave We must appoint a committee to consider the question and we must communicate with the other trades You re the man Master Nixon to choose for churchwarden replied the reproved miner with a glance of admiration What is Diggs doing said Master Nixon in a solemn tone A dropping wages and a raising tommy like fun said Master Waghorn There is a great stir in Hell house yard said a miner who entered the tap room at this moment much excited They say that all the workshops will be shut to morrow not an order for a month past They have got a top sawyer from London there who addresses them every evening and says that we have a right to four shillings a day wages eight hours work and two pots of ale A fair day s wage for a fair day s work said Master Nixon I would not stickle about hours but the money and the drink are very just If Hell house yard is astir said Waghorn there will be a good deal to be seen yet It s grave said Master Nixon What think you of a deputation there It might come to good I should like to hear the top sawyer from London said Juggins We had a Chartist here the other day but he did not understand our case at all I heard him said Master Nixon but what s his Five Points to us Why he ayn t got tommy among them Nor long stints said Waghorn Nor butties said Juggins He s a pretty fellow to come and talk to us said a collier He had never been down a pit in all his life The evening passed away in the tap room of the Rising Sun in reflections on the present critical state of affairs and in consultations as to the most expedient course for the future The rate of wages which for several years in this district had undergone a continuous depression had just received another downward impulse and was threatened with still further reduction for the price of iron became every day lower in the market and the article itself so little in demand that few but the great capitalists who could afford to accumulate their produce were able to maintain their furnaces in action The little men who still continued their speculations could only do so partially by diminishing the days of service and increasing their stints or toil and by decreasing the rate of wages as well as paying them entirely in goods of which they had a great stock and of which they thus relieved themselves at a high profit Add to all these causes of suffering and discontent among the workmen the apprehension of still greater evils and the tyranny of the butties or middlemen and it will with little difficulty be felt that the public mind of this district was well prepared for the excitement of the political agitator especially if he were discreet enough rather to descant on their physical sufferings and personal injuries than to attempt the propagation of abstract political principles with which it was impossible for them to sympathise with the impulse and facility of the inhabitants of manufacturing towns members of literary and scientific institutes habitual readers of political journals and accustomed to habits of discussion of all public questions It generally happens however that where a mere physical impulse urges the people to insurrection though it is often an influence of slow growth and movement the effects are more violent and sometimes more obstinate than when they move under the blended authority of moral and physical necessity and mix up together the rights and the wants of Man However this may be on the morning after the conversation at the Rising Sun which we have just noticed the population having as usual gone to their work having penetrated the pit and descended the shaft the furnaces all blazing the chimneys all smoking suddenly there rose a rumour even in the bowels of the earth that the hour and the man had at length arrived the hour that was to bring them relief and the man that was to bear them redress My missus told it me at the pit head when she brought me my breakfast said a pikeman to his comrade and he struck a vigorous blow at the broadseam on which he was working It is not ten mile said his companion They ll be here by noon There is a good deal to do in their way said the first pikeman All men at work after notice to be ducked they say and every engine to be stopped forthwith Will the police meet them before they reach this There is none my missus says that not a man John of them is to be seen The Hell cats as they call themselves halt at every town and offer fifty pounds for a live policeman I ll tell you what said the second pikeman I ll stop my stint and go up the shaft My heart s all of a flutter I can t work no more We ll have a fair day s wage for a fair day s work yet Come along I m your man if the doggy stop us we ll knock him down The People must have their rights we re driven to this but if one shilling a day is dropped why not two Very true the People must have their rights and eight hours work is quite enough In the light of day the two miners soon learnt in more detail the news which the wife of one of them earlier in the morning had given as a rumour There seemed now no doubt that the people of Wodgate commonly called the Hell cats headed by their Bishop had invaded in great force the surrounding district stopped all the engines turned all the potters out of the manufactories met with no resistance from the authorities and issued a decree that labour was to cease until the Charter was the law of the land This last edict was not the least surprising part of the whole affair for no one could have imagined that the Bishop or any of his subjects had ever even heard of the Charter much less that they could by any circumstances comprehend its nature or by any means be induced to believe that its operation would further their interests or redress their grievances But all this had been brought about as most of the great events of history by the unexpected and unobserved influence of individual character A Chartist leader had been residing for some time at Wodgate ever since the distress had become severe and had obtained great influence and popularity by assuring a suffering and half starving population that they were entitled to four shillings a day and two pots of ale and only eight hours work He was a man of abilities and of popular eloquence and his representations produced an effect their reception invested him with influence and as he addressed a population who required excitement being very slightly employed and with few resources for their vacant hours the Chartist who was careful never to speak of the Charter became an important personage at Wodgate and was much patronized by Bishop Hatton and his Lady whose good offices he was sedulous to conciliate At the right moment everything being ripe and well prepared the Bishop being very drunk and harassed by the complaints of his subjects the Chartist revealed to him the mysteries of the Charter and persuaded him not only that the Five Points would cure everything but that he was the only man who could carry the Five Points The Bishop had nothing to do he was making a lock merely for amusement he required action he embraced the Charter without having a definite idea what it meant but he embraced it fervently and he determined to march into the country at the head of the population of Wodgate and establish the faith Since the conversion of Constantine a more important adoption had never occurred The whole of the north of England and a great part of the midland counties were in a state of disaffection the entire country was suffering hope had deserted the labouring classes they had no confidence in any future of the existing system Their organisation independent of the political system of the Chartists was complete Every trade had its union and every union its lodge in every town and its central committee in every district All that was required was the first move and the Chartist emissary had long fixed upon Wodgate as the spring of the explosion when the news of the strike in Lancashire determined him to precipitate the event The march of Bishop Hatton at the head of the Hell cats into the mining districts was perhaps the most striking popular movement since the Pilgrimage of Grace Mounted on a white mule wall eyed and of hideous form the Bishop brandished a huge hammer with which he had announced he would destroy the enemies of the people all butties doggies dealers in truck and tommy middle masters and main masters Some thousand Hell cats followed him brandishing bludgeons or armed with bars of iron pickhandles and hammers On each side of the Bishop on a donkey was one of his little sons as demure and earnest as if he were handling his file A flowing standard of silk inscribed with the Charter and which had been presented to him by the delegate was borne before him like the oriflamme Never was such a gaunt grim crew As they advanced their numbers continually increased for they arrested all labour in their progress Every engine was stopped the plug was driven out of every boiler every fire was extinguished every man was turned out The decree went forth that labour was to cease until the Charter was the law of the land the mine and the mill the foundry and the loom shop were until that consummation to be idle nor was the mighty pause to be confined to these great enterprises Every trade of every kind and description was to be stopped tailor and cobbler brushmaker and sweep tinker and carter mason and builder all all for all an enormous Sabbath that was to compensate for any incidental suffering that it induced by the increased means and the elevated condition it ultimately would insure that paradise of artizans that Utopia of Toil embalmed in those ringing words sounds cheerful to the Saxon race A fair day s wage for a fair day s work Book six Chapter seven During the strike in Lancashire the people had never plundered except a few provision shops chiefly rifled by boys and their acts of violence had been confined to those with whom they were engaged in what on the whole might be described as fair contest They solicited sustenance often in great numbers but even then their language was mild and respectful and they were easily satisfied and always grateful A body of two thousand persons for example the writer speaks of circumstances within his own experience quitted one morning a manufacturing town in Lancashire when the strike had continued for some time and began to be severely felt and made a visit to a neighbouring squire of high degree They entered his park in order men women and children and then seating themselves in the immediate vicinity of the mansion they sent a deputation to announce that they were starving and to entreat relief In the instance in question the lord of the domain was absent in the fulfilment of those public duties which the disturbed state of the country devolved on him His wife who had a spirit equal to the occasion notwithstanding the presence of her young children who might well have aggravated feminine fears received the deputation herself told them that of course she was unprepared to feed so many but that if they promised to maintain order and conduct themselves with decorum she would take measures to satisfy their need They gave their pledge and remained tranquilly encamped while preparations were making to satisfy them Carts were sent to a neighbouring town for provisions the gamekeepers killed what they could and in a few hours the multitude were fed without the slightest disturbance or the least breach of their self organised discipline When all was over the deputation waited again on the lady to express to her their gratitude and the gardens of this house being of celebrity in the neighbourhood they requested permission that the people might be allowed to walk through them pledging themselves that no flower should be plucked and no fruit touched The permission was granted the multitude in order each file under a chief and each commander of the files obedient to a superior officer then made a progress through the beautiful gardens of their beautiful hostess They even passed through the forcing houses and vineries Not a border was trampled on not a grape plucked and when they quitted the domain they gave three cheers for the fair castellan The Hell cats and their following were of a different temper to these gentle Lancashire insurgents They destroyed and ravaged sacked and gutted houses plundered cellars proscribed bakers as enemies of the people sequestrated the universal stores of all truck and tommy shops burst open doors broke windows destroyed the gas works that the towns at night might be in darkness took union workhouses by storm burned rate books in the market place and ordered public distribution of loaves of bread and flitches of bacon to a mob cheering and laughing amid flames and rapine In short they robbed and rioted the police could make no head against them there was no military force the whole district was in their possession and hearing that a battalion of the Coldstreams were coming down by a train the Bishop ordered all railroads to be destroyed and if the Hell cats had not been too drunk to do his bidding and he too tipsy to repeat it it is probable that a great destruction of these public ways might have taken place Does the reader remember Diggs tommy shop And Master Joseph Well a terrible scene took place there The Wodgate girl with a back like a grasshopper of the Baptist school religion who had married Tummas once a pupil of the Bishop and still his fervent follower although he had cut open his pupil s head was the daughter of a man who had worked many years in Diggs field had suffered much under his intolerable yoke and at the present moment was deep in his awful ledger She had heard from her first years of the oppression of Diggs and had impressed it on her husband who was intolerant of any tyranny except at Wodgate Tummas and his wife and a few chosen friends therefore went out one morning to settle the tommy book of her father with mister Diggs A whisper of their intention had got about among those interested in the subject It was a fine summer morning some three hours from noon the shop was shut indeed it had not been opened since the riots and all the lower windows of the dwelling were closed barred and bolted A crowd of women had collected There was Mistress Page and Mistress Prance old Dame Toddles and missus Mullins Liza Gray and the comely dame who was so fond of society that she liked even a riot Master Joseph they say has gone to the North said the comely dame I wonder if old Diggs is at home said missus Mullins He won t show I ll be sworn said old Dame Toddles Here are the Hell cats said the comely dame Well I do declare they march like reglars two four six twelve a good score at the least The Hell cats briskly marched up to the elm trees that shaded the canal before the house and then formed in line opposite to it They were armed with bludgeons crowbars and hammers Tummas was at the head and by his side his Wodgate wife Stepping forth alone amid the cheering of the crowd of women the pupil of the Bishop advanced to the door of Diggs house gave a loud knock and a louder ring He waited patiently for several minutes there was no reply from the interior and then Tummas knocked and rang again It s very awful said the comely dame It s what I always dreamt would come to pass said Liza Gray ever since Master Joseph cut my poor baby over the eye with his three foot rule I think there can be nobody within said missus Prance Old Diggs would never leave the tommy without a guard said missus Page Now lads said Tummas looking round him and making a sign and immediately some half dozen advanced with their crowbars and were about to strike at the door when a window in the upper story of the house opened and the muzzle of a blunderbuss was presented at the assailants The women all screamed and ran away Twas Master Joseph said the comely dame halting to regain her breath Twas Master Joseph sighed missus Page Twas Master Joseph moaned missus Prance Sure enough said missus Mullins I saw his ugly face More frightful than the great gun said old Dame Toddles I hope the children will get out of the way said Liza Gray for he is sure to fire on them In the meantime while Master Joseph himself was content with his position and said not a word a benignant countenance exhibited itself at the window and requested in a mild voice to know What his good friends wanted there We have come to settle Sam Barlow s tommy book said their leader Our shop is not open to day my good friends the account can stand over far be it from me to press the poor Master Diggs said a Hell cat canst thou tell us the price of bacon to day Well good bacon said the elder Diggs willing to humour them may be eightpence a pound Thou are wrong Master Diggs said the Hell cat tis fourpence and long credit Let us see half a dozen good flitches at fourpence Master Diggs and be quick There was evidently some controversy in the interior as to the course at this moment to be pursued Master Joseph remonstrated against the policy of concession called conciliation which his father would fain follow and was for instant coercion but age and experience carried the day and in a few minutes some flitches were thrown out of the window to the Hell cats who received the booty with a cheer The women returned Tis the tenpence a pound flitch said the comely dame examining the prize with a sparkling glance I have paid as much for very green stuff said missus Mullins And now Master Diggs said Tummas what is the price of the best tea a pound We be good customers and mean to treat our wives and sweethearts here I think we must order half a chest This time there was a greater delay in complying with the gentle hint but the Hell cats getting obstreperous the tea was at length furnished and divided among the women This gracious office devolved on the wife of Tummas who soon found herself assisted by a spontaneous committee of which the comely dame was the most prominent and active member Nothing could be more considerate good natured and officious than the mode and spirit with which she divided the stores The flitches were cut up and apportioned in like manner The scene was as gay and hustling as a fair It s as good as a grand tommy day said the comely dame with a self complacent smile as she strutted about smiling and dispensing patronage The orders for bacon and tea were followed by a very popular demand for cheese The female committee received all the plunder and were very active in its distribution At length a rumour got about that Master Joseph was entering the names of all present in the tommy books so that eventually the score might be satisfied The mob had now very much increased There was a panic among the women and indignation among the men a Hell cat advanced and announced that unless the tommy books were all given up to be burnt they would pull down the house There was no reply some of the Hell cats advanced the women cheered a crowbar fell upon the door Master Joseph fired wounded a woman and killed a child There rose one of those universal shrieks of wild passion which announce that men have discarded all the trammels of civilization and found in their licentious rage new and unforseen sources of power and vengeance Where it came from how it was obtained who prompted the thought who first accomplished it were alike impossible to trace but as it were in a moment a number of trusses of straw were piled up before the house and set on fire the gates of the timber yard were forced and a quantity of scantlings and battens soon fed the flame Everything indeed that could stimulate the fire was employed and every one was occupied in the service They ran to the water side and plundered the barges and threw the huge blocks of coal upon the enormous bonfire Men women and children were alike at work with the eagerness and energy of fiends The roof of the house caught fire the dwelling burned rapidly you could see the flames like the tongues of wild beasts licking the bare and vanishing walls a single being was observed amid the fiery havoc shrieking and desperate he clung convulsively to a huge account book It was Master Joseph His father had made his escape from the back of the premises and had counselled his son instantly to follow him but Master Joseph wished to rescue the ledger as well as their lives and the delay ruined him He has got the tommy book cried Liza Gray The glare of the clear flame fell for a moment upon his countenance of agony the mob gave an infernal cheer then some part of the building falling in there rose a vast cloud of smoke and rubbish and he was seen no more Book six Chapter eight Life s a tumbleabout thing of ups and downs said Widow Carey stirring her tea but I have been down this time longer than I can ever remember Nor ever will get up Widow said Julia at whose lodgings herself and several of Julia s friends had met unless we have the Five Points I will never marry any man who is not for the Five Points said Caroline I should be ashamed to marry any one who had not the suffrage said Harriet He is no better than a slave said Julia The widow shook her head I don t like these politics said the good woman they bayn t in a manner business for our sex And I should like to know why said Julia Ayn t we as much concerned in the cause of good government as the men And don t we understand as much about it I am sure the Dandy never does anything without consulting me It s fine news for a summer day said Caroline to say we can t understand politics with a Queen on the throne She has got her ministers to tell her what to do said missus Carey taking a pinch of snuff Poor innocent young creature it often makes my heart ache to think how she is beset Over the left said Julia If the ministers try to come into her bed chamber she knows how to turn them to the right about And as for that said Harriet why are we not to interfere with politics as much as the swell ladies in London Don t you remember too at the last election here said Caroline how the fine ladies from the Castle came and canvassed for Colonel Rosemary Ah said Julia I must say I wish the Colonel had beat that horrid Muddlefist If we can t have our own man I am all for the Nobs against the Middle Class We ll have our own man soon I expect said Harriet If the people don t work how are the aristocracy to pay the police Only think said Widow Carey shaking her head Why at your time of life my dears we never even heard of these things much less talked of them I should think you didn t widow and because why said Julia because there was no march of mind then But we know the time of day now as well as any of them Lord my dear said missus Carey what s the use of all that What we want is good wages and plenty to do and as for the rest I don t grudge the Queen her throne nor the noblemen and gentlemen their good things Live and let live say I Why you are a regular oligarch widow said Harriet Well Miss Harriet replied missus Carey a little nettled tisn t calling your neighbours names that settles any question I m quite sure that Julia will agree to that and Caroline too And perhaps I might call you something if I chose Miss Harriet I ve heard things said before this that I should blush to say and blush to hear too But I won t demean myself no I won t Holly hock indeed Why holly hock At this moment entered the Dandy and Devilsdust Well young ladies said the Dandy A swelling the receipt of customs by the consumption of Congo That won t do Julia it won t indeed Ask Dusty If you want to beat the enemy you must knock up the revenue How d ye do widow The same to you Dandy Mick We is deploring the evils of the times here in a neighbourly way Oh the times will soon mend said the Dandy gaily Well so I think said the widow for when things are at the worst they always say But you always say they cannot mend Mick said Julia interrupting her Why in a sense Julia in a certain sense you are right but there are two senses to everything my girl and Mick began singing and then executed a hornpipe to the gratification of Julia and her guests Tis genteel said Mick receiving their approbation You remember it at the Circus I wonder when we shall have the Circus again said Caroline Not with the present rate of wages said Devilsdust It s very hard said Caroline that the Middle Class are always dropping our wages One really has no amusements now How I do miss the Temple We ll have the Temple open again before long said the Dandy That will be sweet exclaimed Caroline I often dream of that foreign nobleman who used to sing Oh no we never Well I cannot make out what puts you in such spirits Mick said Julia You told me only this morning that the thing was up and that we should soon be slaves for life working sixteen hours a day for no wages and living on oatmeal porridge and potatoes served out by the millocrats like a regular Bastile But as Madam Carey says when things are at the worst Oh I did say it said the widow surely because you see at my years I have seen so many ups and downs though I always say Come Dusty said Julia you are more silent than ever You won t take a dish I know but tell us the news for I am sure you have something to say I should think we had said Dusty Here all the girls began talking at the same time and without waiting for the intelligence favouring one another with their guesses of its import I am sure it s Shuffle and Screw going to work half time said Harriet I always said so It s something to put down the people said Julia I suppose the Nobs have met and are going to drop wages again I think Dusty is going to be married said Caroline Not at this rate of wages I should hope said missus Carey getting in a word I should think not said Devilsdust You are a sensible woman missus Carey And I don t know exactly what you mean Miss Caroline he added a little confused For Devilsdust was a silent admirer of Caroline and had been known to say to Mick who told Julia who told her friend that if he ever found time to think of such things that was the sort of girl he should like to make the partner of his life But Dusty said Julia now what is it Why I thought you all knew said Mick Now now said Julia I hate suspense I like news to go round like a fly wheel Well said Devilsdust dryly this is Saturday young women and missus Carey too you will not deny that I should think not said missus Carey by the token I kept a stall for thirty year in our market and never gave it up till this summer which makes me always think that though I have seen many ups and downs this Well what has Saturday to do with us said Caroline for neither Dandy Mick nor you can take us to the Temple or any other genteel place since they are all shut from the Corn Laws or some other cause or other I believe it s the machines more than the Corn Laws that have shut up the Temple said Harriet Machines indeed Fancy preferring a piece of iron or wood to your own flesh and blood And they call that Christianlike It is Saturday said Julia sure enough and if I don t lie in bed to morrow till sunset may I get a bate ticket for every day for a week to come Well go it my hearty said Mick to Devilsdust It is Saturday that they have all agreed And to morrow is Sunday said Devilsdust solemnly And the next day is the blackest day in all the week said Julia When I hear the factory bell on Monday morning I feel just the same as I did when I crossed with my uncle from Liverpool to Seaton to eat shrimps Wasn t I sick coming home that s all You won t hear that bell sound next Monday said Devilsdust solemnly You don t mean that said Julia Why what s the matter said Caroline Is the Queen dead No bell on Monday morning said missus Carey incredulously Not a single ring if all the Capitalists in Mowbray were to pull together at the same rope said Devilsdust What can it be said Julia Come Mick Dusty is always so long telling us anything Why we are going to have the devil s own strike said Mick unable any longer to contain himself and dancing with glee A strike said Julia I hope they will destroy the machines said Harriet And open the Temple said Caroline or else it will be very dull I have seen a many strikes said the widow but as Chaffing Jack was saying to me the other day Chaffing Jack be hanged said Mick Such a slow coach won t do in these high pressure times We are going to do the trick and no mistake There shan t be a capitalist in England who can get a day s work out of us even if he makes the operatives his junior partners I never heard of such things said missus Carey in amazement It s all booked though said Devilsdust We ll clean out the Savings Banks the Benefits and Burials will shell out I am treasurer of the Ancient Shepherds and we passed a resolution yesterday unanimously that we would devote all our funds to the sustenance of Labour in this its last and triumphant struggle against Capital Lor said Caroline I think it will be very jolly As long as you can give us money I don t care for my part how long we stick out said Julia Well said missus Carey I didn t think there was so much spirit in the place As Chaffing Jack was saying the other day There is no spirit in the place said Devilsdust but we mean to infuse some Some of our friends are going to pay you a visit to morrow And who may they be said Caroline To morrow is Sunday said Devilsdust and the miners mean to say their prayers in Mowbray Church Well that will be a shindy said Caroline It s a true bill though said Mick This time to morrow you will have ten thousand of them in this town and if every mill and work in it and ten mile round is not stopped my name is not MICK RADLEY Book six Chapter nine It was Monday morning Hatton enveloped in his chamber robe and wearing his velvet cap was lounging in the best room of the principal commercial inn of Mowbray over a breakfast table covered with all the delicacies of which a northern matin meal may justly boast There were pies of spiced meat and trout fresh from the stream hams that Westphalia never equalled pyramids of bread of every form and flavour adapted to the surrounding fruits some conserved with curious art and some just gathered from the bed or from the tree It s very odd said Hatton to his companion Morley you can t get coffee anywhere Morley who had supposed that coffee was about the commonest article of consumption in Mowbray looked a little surprised but at this moment Hatton s servant entered with a mysterious yet somewhat triumphant air and ushering in a travelling biggin of their own fuming like one of the springs of Geyser Now try that said Hatton to Morley as the servant poured him out a cup you won t find that so bad Does the town continue pretty quiet enquired Morley of the servant as he was leaving the room Quite quiet I believe Sir but a great many people in the streets All the mills are stopped Well this is a strange business said Hatton when they were once more alone You had no idea of it when I met you on Saturday None on the contrary I felt convinced that there were no elements of general disturbance in this district I thought from the first that the movement would be confined to Lancashire and would easily be arrested but the feebleness of the government the want of decision perhaps the want of means have permitted a flame to spread the extinction of which will not soon be witnessed Do you mean that Whenever the mining population is disturbed the disorder is obstinate On the whole they endure less physical suffering than most of the working classes their wages being considerable and they are so brutalized that they are more difficult to operate on than our reading and thinking population of the factories But when they do stir there is always violence and a determined course When I heard of their insurrection on Saturday I was prepared for great disturbances in their district but that they should suddenly resolve to invade another country as it were the seat of another class of labour and where the hardships however severe are not of their own kind is to me amazing and convinces me that there is some political head behind the scenes and that this move however unintentional on the part of the miners themselves is part of some comprehensive scheme which by widening the scene of action and combining several counties and classes of labour in the broil must inevitably embarrass and perhaps paralyse the Government There is a good deal in what you say said Hatton taking a strawberry with a rather absent air and then he added You remember a conversation we once had the eve of my departure from Mowbray in thirty nine I do said Morley reddening The miners were not so ready then said Hatton They were not said Morley speaking with some confusion Well they are here now said Hatton They are said Morley thoughtfully but more collected You saw them enter yesterday said Hatton I was sorry I missed it but I was taking a walk with the Gerards up Dale to see the cottage where they once lived and which they used to talk of so much Was it a strong body I should say about two thousand men and as far as bludgeons and iron staves go armed A formidable force with no military to encounter them Irresistible especially with a favourable population You think the people were not grieved to see them Certainly Left alone they might have remained quiet but they only wanted the spark We have a number of young men here who have for a long time been murmuring against our inaction and what they call want of spirit The Lancashire strike set them all agog and had any popular leader Gerard for example or Warner resolved to move they were ready The times are critical said Hatton wheeling his arm chair from the table and resting his feet on the empty fire place Lord de Mowbray had no idea of all this I was with him on my way here and found him quite tranquil I suppose the invasion of yesterday has opened his eyes a little What can he do said Morley It is useless to apply to the Government They have no force to spare Look at Lancashire a few dragoons and rifles hurried about from place to place and harassed by night service always arriving too late and generally attacking the wrong point some diversion from the main scheme Now we had a week ago some of the seventeenth Lancers here They have been marched into Lancashire Had they remained the invasion would never have occurred You haven t a soldier at hand Not a man they have actually sent for a party of seventy threed from Ireland to guard us Mowbray may be burnt before they land And the castle too said Hatton quietly These are indeed critical times mister Morley I was thinking when walking with our friend Gerard yesterday and hearing him and his charming daughter dilate upon the beauties of the residence which they had forfeited I was thinking what a strange thing life is and that the fact of a box of papers belonging to him being in the possession of another person who only lives close by for we were walking through Mowbray woods But at this moment a waiter entered and said there was one without who wished to speak with mister Morley Let him come up said Hatton he will give us some news perhaps And there was accordingly shown up a young man who had been a member of the Convention in thirty nine with Morley afterwards of the Secret Council with Gerard the same young man who had been the first arrested on the night that Sybil was made a prisoner having left the scene of their deliberations for a moment in order to fetch her some water He too had been tried convicted and imprisoned though for a shorter time than Gerard and he was the Chartist Apostle who had gone and resided at Wodgate preached the faith to the barbarians converted them and was thus the primary cause of the present invasion of Mowbray Ah Field said Morley is it you You are surprised to see me and then the young man looked at Hatton A friend said Morley speak as you like Our great man the leader and liberator of the people said Field with a smile who has carried all before him and who I verily believe will carry all before him for Providence has given him those superhuman energies which can alone emancipate a race wishes to confer with you on the state of this town and neighbourhood It has been represented to him that no one is more knowing and experienced than yourself in this respect besides as the head of our most influential organ in the Press it is in every way expedient that you should see him He is at this moment below giving instructions and receiving reports of the stoppage of all the country works but if you like I will bring him up here we shall be less disturbed By all means said Hatton who seemed to apprehend that Morley would make some difficulties By all means Stop said Morley have you seen Gerard No said Field I wrote to him some time back but his reply was not encouraging I thought his spirit was perhaps broken You know that he is here I concluded so but we have not seen him though to be sure we have seen so many and done so much since our arrival yesterday it is not wonderful By the bye who is this blackcoat you have here this saint Lys We took possession of the church yesterday on our arrival for it s a sort of thing that pleases the miners and colliers wonderfully and I always humour them This saint Lys preached us such a sermon that I was almost afraid at one time the game would be spoiled Our great man was alarmingly taken by it was saying his prayers all day and had nearly marched back again had it not been for the excellence of the rum and water at our quarters the champion of the Charter would have proved a pious recreant saint Lys will trouble you said Morley Alas for poor human nature when violence can only be arrested by superstition Come don t you preach said the Chartist The Charter is a thing the people can understand especially when they are masters of the country but as for moral force I should like to know how I could have marched from Wodgate to Mowbray with that on my banner Wodgate said Morley that s a queer place Wodgate said Hatton what Wodgate is that At this moment a great noise sounded without the room the door was banged there seemed a scuttling some harsh high tones the deprecatory voices of many waiters The door was banged again and this time flew open while exclaiming in an insolent coarse voice Don t tell me of your private rooms who is master here I should like to know there entered a very thickset man rather under the middle size with a brutal and grimy countenance wearing the unbuttoned coat of a police serjeant conquered in fight a cocked hat with a white plume which was also a trophy of war a pair of leather breeches and topped boots which from their antiquity had the appearance of being his authentic property This was the leader and liberator of the people of England He carried in his hand a large hammer which he had never parted with during the whole of the insurrection and stopping when he had entered the room and surveying its inmates with an air at once stupid and arrogant recognizing Field the Chartist he halloed out I tell you I want him He s my Lord Chancellor and Prime Minister my head and principal Doggy I can t go on without him Well what do you think he said advancing to Field here s a pretty go They won t stop the works at the big country mill you were talking of They won t won t they Is my word the law of the land or is it not Have I given my commands that all labour shall cease till the Queen sends me a message that the Charter is established and is a man who has a mill to shut his gates upon my forces and pump upon my people with engines There shall be fire for this water and so saying the Liberator sent his hammer with such force upon the table that the plate and porcelain and accumulated luxuries of mister Hatton s breakfast perilously vibrated We will enquire into this Sir said Field and we will take the necessary steps We will enquire into this and we will take the necessary steps said the Liberator looking round with an air of pompous stupidity and then taking up some peaches he began devouring them with considerable zest Would the Liberator like to take some breakfast said mister Hatton The Liberator looked at his host with a glance of senseless intimidation and then as if not condescending to communicate directly with ordinary men he uttered in a more subdued tone to the Chartist these words Glass of ale Ale was instantly ordered for the Liberator who after a copious draught assumed a less menacing air and smacking his lips pushed aside the dishes and sate down on the table swinging his legs This is my friend of whom I spoke and whom you wished to see Sir said the Chartist the most distinguished advocate of popular rights we possess the editor of the Mowbray Phalanx mister Morley Morley slightly advanced he caught the Liberator s eye who scrutinized him with extreme earnestness and then jumping from the table shouted Why this is the muff that called on me in Hell house Yard three years ago I had that honour said Morley quietly Honour be hanged said the Bishop you know something about somebody I couldn t squeeze you then but by G I will have it out of you now Now cut it short have you seen him and where does he live I came then to gain information not to give it said Morley I had a friend who wished much to see this gentleman He ayn t no gentleman said the Bishop he s my brother but I tell you what I ll do something for him now I m cock of the walk you see and that s a sort of thing that don t come twice in a man s life One should feel for one s flesh and blood and if I find him out I ll make his fortune or my name is not Simon Hatton The creator and counsellor of peers started in his chair and turned pale A look was interchanged between him and Morley which revealed their mutual thoughts and the great antiquary looking at the Liberator with a glance of blended terror and disgust walked away to the window Suppose you put an advertisement in your paper continued the Bishop I know a traveller who lost his keys at the Yard and got them back again by those same means Go on advertising till you find him and my prime minister and principal doggy here shall give you an order on the town council for your expenses Morley bowed his thanks in silence The Bishop continued What s the name of the man who has got the big mill here about three mile off who won t stop his works and ducked my men this morning with his engines I ll have fire I say for that water do you hear that Master Newspaper I ll have fire for that water before I am many hours older The Liberator means Trafford said the Chartist I ll Trafford him said the Liberator and he struck the table with his hammer He ducks my messenger does he I tell you I ll have fire for that water and he looked around him as if he courted some remonstrance in order that he might crush it Trafford is a humane man said Morley in a quiet tone and behaves well to his people A man with a big mill humane exclaimed the Bishop with two or three thousand slaves working under the same roof and he doing nothing but eating their vitals I ll have no big mills where I m main master Let him look to it Here goes and he jumped off the table Before an hour I ll pay this same Trafford a visit and I ll see whether he ll duck me Come on my prime Doggy and nodding to the Chartist to follow him the Liberator left the room Hatton turned his head from the window and advanced quickly to Morley To business friend Morley This savage can not be quiet for a moment he exists only in destruction and rapine If it were not Trafford s mill it would be something else I am sorry for the Traffords they have old blood in their veins Before sunset their settlement will be razed to the ground Can we prevent it And why not attack the castle instead of the mill Book six Chapter ten About noon of this day there was a great stir in Mowbray It was generally whispered about that the Liberator at the head of the Hell cats and all others who chose to accompany them was going to pay a visit to mister Trafford s settlement in order to avenge an insult which his envoys had experienced early in the morning when accompanied by a rabble of two or three hundred persons they had repaired to the Mowedale works in order to signify the commands of the Liberator that labour should stop and if necessary to enforce those commands The injunctions were disregarded and when the mob in pursuance of their further instructions began to force the great gates of the premises in order that they might enter the building drive the plugs out of the steam boilers and free the slaves enclosed a masqued battery of powerful engines was suddenly opened upon them and the whole band of patriots were deluged It was impossible to resist a power which seemed inexhaustible and wet to the skins and amid the laughter of their adversaries they fled This ridiculous catastrophe had terribly excited the ire of the Liberator He vowed vengeance and as like all great revolutionary characters and military leaders the only foundation of his power was constant employment for his troops and constant excitement for the populace he determined to place himself at the head of the chastising force and make a great example which should establish his awful reputation and spread the terror of his name throughout the district Field the Chartist had soon discovered who were the rising spirits of Mowbray and Devilsdust and Dandy Mick were both sworn on Monday morning of the council of the Liberator and took their seats at the board accordingly Devilsdust used to public business and to the fulfilment of responsible duties was calm and grave but equally ready and determined Mick s head on the contrary was quite turned by the importance of his novel position He was greatly excited could devise nothing and would do anything always followed Devilsdust in council but when he executed their joint decrees and showed himself about the town he strutted like a peacock swore at the men and winked at the girls and was the idol and admiration of every gaping or huzzaing younker There was a large crowd assembled in the Market Place in which were the Liberator s lodgings many of them armed in their rude fashion and all anxious to march Devilsdust was with the great man and Field Mick below was marshalling the men and swearing like a trooper at all who disobeyed or who misunderstood Come stupid said he addressing Tummas what are you staring about Get your men in order or I ll be among you Stupid said Tummas staring at Mick with immense astonishment And who are you who says Stupid A white livered Handloom as I dare say or a son of a gun of a factory slave Stupid indeed What next when a Hell cat is to be called stupid by such a thing as you I ll give you a piece of advice young man said Master Nixon taking his pipe out of his mouth and blowing an immense puff just you go down the shaft for a couple of months and then you ll learn a little of life which is wery useful The lively temperament of the Dandy would here probably have involved him in an inconvenient embroilment had not some one at this moment touched him on the shoulder and looking round he recognised mister Morley Notwithstanding the difference of their political schools Mick had a profound respect for Morley though why he could not perhaps precisely express But he had heard Devilsdust for years declare that Stephen Morley was the deepest head in Mowbray and though he regretted the unfortunate weakness in favour of that imaginary abstraction called Moral Force for which the editor of the Phalanx was distinguished still Devilsdust used to say that if ever the great revolution were to occur by which the rights of labour were to be recognised though bolder spirits and brawnier arms might consummate the change there was only one head among them that would be capable when they had gained their power to guide it for the public weal and as Devilsdust used to add carry out the thing and that was Morley It was a fine summer day and Mowedale was as resplendent as when Egremont amid its beauties first began to muse over the beautiful There was the same bloom over the sky the same shadowy lustre on the trees the same sparkling brilliancy on the waters A herdsman following some kine was crossing the stone bridge and except their lowing as they stopped and sniffed the current of fresh air in its centre there was not a sound Suddenly the tramp and hum of a multitude broke upon the sunshiny silence A vast crowd with some assumption of an ill disciplined order approached from the direction of Mowbray At their head rode a man on a white mule Many of his followers were armed with bludgeons and other rude weapons and moved in files Behind them spread a more miscellaneous throng in which women were not wanting and even children They moved rapidly they swept by the former cottage of Gerard they were in sight of the settlement of Trafford All the waters of the river shall not dout the blaze that I will light up to day said the Liberator He is a most inveterate Capitalist said Field and would divert the minds of the people from the Five Points by allotting them gardens and giving them baths We will have no more gardens in England everything shall be open said the Liberator and baths shall only be used to drown the enemies of the People I was always against washing it takes the marrow out of a man Here we are said Field as the roofs and bowers of the village the spire and the spreading factory broke upon them Every door and every window closed The settlement is deserted Some one has been before us and apprised them of our arrival Will they pour water on me said the Bishop It must be a stream indeed that shall put out the blaze that I am going to light What shall we do first Halt there you men said the Liberator looking back with that scowl which his apprentices never could forget Will you halt or won t you or must I be among you There was a tremulous shuffling and then a comparative silence The women and children of the village had been gathered into the factory yard of which the great gates were closed What shall we burn first asked the Bishop We may as well parley with them a little said Field perhaps we may contrive to gain admission and then we can sack the whole affair and let the people burn the machinery It will be a great moral lesson As long as there is burning said the Bishop I don t care what lessons you teach them I leave them to you but I will have fire to put out that water I ll advance said Field and so saying he went forward and rang at the gate the Bishop on his mule with a dozen Hell cats accompanying him the great body of the people about twenty yards withdrawn Who rings asked a loud voice One who by the order of the Liberator wishes to enter and see whether his commands for a complete cessation of labour have been complied with in this establishment Very good said the Bishop There is no hand at work here said the voice and you may take my word for it Your word be hanged said the Bishop I want to know Hush hush said Field and then in a louder voice he said It may be so but as our messengers this morning were not permitted to enter and were treated with great indignity That s it said the Bishop With great indignity continued Field we must have ocular experience of the state of affairs and I beg and recommend you therefore at once to let the Liberator enter None shall enter here replied the unseen guardian of the gate That s enough cried the Bishop Beware said Field Whether you let us in or not tis all the same said the Bishop I will have fire for your water and I have come for that Now lads Stop said the voice of the unseen I will speak to you He is going to let us in whispered Field to the Bishop And suddenly there appeared on the flat roof of the lodge that was on one side of the gates Gerard His air his figure his position were alike commanding and at the sight of him a loud and spontaneous cheer burst from the assembled thousands It was the sight of one who was after all the most popular leader of the people that had ever figured in these parts whose eloquence charmed and commanded whose disinterestedness was acknowledged whose sufferings had created sympathy whose courage manly bearing and famous feats of strength were a source to them of pride There was not a Mowbray man whose heart did not throb with emotion and whose memory did not recall the orations from the Druid s altar and the famous meetings on the moor Gerard for ever was the universal shout The Bishop who liked no one to be cheered except himself like many great men was much disgusted a little perplexed What does all this mean he whispered to Field I came here to burn down the place Wait awhile said Field we must humour the Mowbray men a bit This is their favourite leader at least was in old days I know him well he is a bold and honest man Is this the man who ducked my people asked the Bishop fiercely Hush said Field he is going to speak My friends said Gerard for if we are not friends who should be loud cheers and cries of Very true if you come hear to learn whether the Mowedale works are stopped I give you my word there is not a machine or man that stirs here at this moment great cheering I believe you ll take my word cheers and cries of We will I believe I m known at Mowbray Gerard for ever and on Mowbray Moor too tumultous cheering We have met together before this That we have and shall meet again yet great cheering The people haven t so many friends that they should quarrel with well wishers The master here has done his best to soften your lots He is not one of those who deny that Labour has rights loud cheers I say that mister Trafford has always acknowledged the rights of Labour prolonged cheers and cries of So he has Well is he the man that we should injure No no What if he did give a cold reception to some visitors this morning groans perhaps they wore faces he was not used to loud cheers and laughter from the Mowbray people I dare say they mean as well as we do no doubt of that but still a neighbour s a neighbour immense cheering Now my lads three cheers for the National Holiday and Gerard gave the time and his voice was echoed by the thousands present The master here has no wish to interfere with the National Holiday all he wants to secure is that all mills and works should alike stop cries of Very just And I say so too continued Gerard It is just just and manly and like a true born Englishman as he is who loves the people and whose fathers before him loved the people great cheering Three cheers for mister Trafford I say and they were given and three cheers for missus Trafford too the friend of the poor Here the mob became not only enthusiastic but maudlin all vowing to each other that Trafford was a true born Englishman and his wife a very angel upon earth This popular feeling is so contagious that even the Hell cats shared it cheering shaking hands with each other and almost shedding tears though it must be confessed that they had some vague idea that it was all to end in something to drink Their great leader however remained unmoved and nothing but his brutal stupidity could have prevented him from endeavouring to arrest the tide of public feeling but he was quite bewildered by the diversion and for the first time failed in finding a prompter in Field The Chartist was cowed by Gerard his old companion in scenes that the memory lingered over and whose superior genius had often controlled and often led him Gerard too had recognized him and had made some personal allusion and appeal to him which alike touched his conscience and flattered his vanity The ranks were broken the spirit of the expedition had dissolved the great body were talking of returning some of the stragglers indeed were on their way back the Bishop silent and confused kept knocking the mane of his mule with his hammer Now said Morley who during this scene had stood apart accompanied by Devilsdust and Dandy Mick Now said Morley to the latter now is your time Gentlemen sang out Mick A speech a speech cried out several Listen to Mick Radley whispered Devilsdust moving swiftly among the mob and addressing every one he met of influence Listen to Mick Radley he has something important Radley for ever Listen to Mick Radley Go it Dandy Pitch it into them Silence for Dandy Mick Jump up on that ere bank and on the bank Mick mounted accordingly Gentlemen said Mick Well you have said that before I like to hear him say Gentlemen it s respectful Gentlemen said the Dandy the National Holiday has begun Three cheers for it Silence hear the Dandy The National Holiday has begun continued Mick and it seems to me the best thing for the people to do is to take a walk in Lord de Mowbray s park This proposition was received with one of those wild shouts of approbation which indicate the orator has exactly hit his audience between wind and water The fact is the public mind at this instant wanted to be led and in Dandy Mick a leader appeared A leader to be successful should embody in his system the necessities of his followers express what every one feels but no one has had the ability or the courage to pronounce The courage and adroitness the influence of Gerard had reconciled the people to the relinquishment of the great end for which they had congregated but neither man nor multitude like to make preparations without obtaining a result Every one wanted to achieve some object by the movement and at this critical juncture an object was proposed and one which promised novelty amusement excitement The Bishop whose consent must be obtained but who relinquished an idea with the same difficulty with which he had imbibed it alone murmured and kept saying to Field I thought we came to burn down the mill A bloody minded Capitalist a man that makes gardens and forces the people to wash themselves What is all this Field said what he could while Devilsdust leaning over the mule s shoulder cajoled the other ear of the Bishop who at last gave his consent with almost as much reluctance as George the Fourth did to the emancipation of the Roman Catholics but he made his terms and said in a sulky voice he must have a glass of ale Drink a glass of ale with Lord de Mowbray said Devilsdust Book six Chapter eleven When the news had arrived in the morning at Mowbray that the messengers of the Bishop had met with a somewhat queer reception at the Mowedale works Gerard prescient that some trouble might in consequence occur there determined to repair at once to the residence of his late employer It so happened that Monday was the day on which the cottages up the dale and on the other side of the river were visited by an envoy of Ursula Trafford and it was the office of Sybil this morning to fulfil the duties of that mission of charity She had mentioned this to her father on the previous day and as in consequence of the strike he was no longer occupied he had proposed to accompany his daughter on the morrow Together therefore they had walked until they arrived at the bridge it being then about two hours to noon a little above their former residence Here they were to separate Gerard embraced his daughter with even more than usual tenderness and as Sybil crossed the bridge she looked round at her father and her glance caught his turned for the same fond purpose Sybil was not alone Harold who had ceased to gambol but who had gained in stature majesty and weight what he had lost of lithe and frolick grace was by her side He no longer danced before his mistress coursed away and then returned or vented his exuberant life in a thousand feats of playful vigour but sedate and observant he was always at hand ever sagacious and seemed to watch her every glance The day was beautiful the scene was fair the spot indeed was one which rendered the performance of gracious offices to Sybil doubly sweet She ever begged of the Lady Superior that she might be her minister to the cottages up Dale They were full of familiar faces It was a region endeared to Sybil by many memories of content and tenderness And as she moved along to day her heart was light and the natural joyousness of her disposition which so many adverse circumstances had tended to repress was visible in her sunny face She was happy about her father The invasion of the miners instead of prompting him as she had feared to some rash conduct appeared to have filled him only with disgust Even now he was occupied in a pursuit of order and peace counselling prudence and protecting the benevolent She passed through a copse which skirted those woods of Mowbray wherein she had once so often rambled with one whose image now hovered over her spirit Ah what scenes and changes dazzling and dark had occurred since the careless though thoughtful days of her early girlhood Sybil mused she recalled the moonlit hour when mister Franklin first paid a visit to their cottage their walks and wanderings the expeditions which she planned and the explanations which she so artlessly gave him Her memory wandered to their meeting in Westminster and all the scenes of sorrow and of softness of which it was the herald Her imagination raised before her in colours of light and life the morning the terrible morning when he came to her desperate rescue his voice sounded in her ear her cheek glowed as she recalled their tender farewell It was past noon Sybil had reached the term of her expedition had visited her last charge she was emerging from the hills into the open country and about to regain the river road that would in time have conducted her to the bridge On one side of her was the moor on the other a wood that was the boundary of Mowbray Park And now a number of women met her some of whom she recognised and had indeed visited earlier in the morning Their movements were disordered distress and panic were expressed on their countenances Sybil stopped she spoke to some the rest gathered around her The Hell cats were coming they said they were on the other side of the river burning mills destroying all they could put their hands on man woman and child Sybil alarmed for her father put to them some questions to which they gave incoherent answers It was however clear that they had seen no one and knew nothing of their own experience The rumour had reached them that the mob was advancing up Dale those who had apprised them had according to their statement absolutely witnessed the approach of the multitude and so they had locked up their cottages crossed the bridge and ran away to the woods and moor Under these circumstances deeming that there might be much exaggeration Sybil at length resolved to advance and in a few minutes those whom she had encountered were out of sight She patted Harold who looked up in her face and gave a bark significant of his approbation of her proceeding and also of his consciousness that something strange was going on She had not proceeded very far before two men on horseback at full gallop met her They pulled up directly they observed her and said You had better go back as fast as you can the mob is out and coming up Dale in great force Sybil enquired with much agitation whether they had themselves seen the people and they replied that they had not but that advices had been received from Mowbray of their approach and as for themselves they were hurrying at their utmost speed to a town ten miles off where they understood some yeomanry were stationed and to whom the Mayor of Mowbray had last night sent a despatch Sybil would have enquired whether there were time for her to reach the bridge and join her father at the factory of Trafford but the horsemen were impatient and rode off Still she determined to proceed All that she now aimed at was to reach Gerard and share his fate A boat put across the river two men and a crowd of women The mob had been seen at least there was positively one person present who had distinguished them in the extreme distance or rather the cloud of dust which they created there were dreadful stories of their violence and devastation It was understood that a body meant to attack Trafford s works but as the narrator added it was very probable that the greater part would cross the bridge and so on to the Moor where they would hold a meeting Sybil would fain have crossed in the boat but there was no one to assist her They had escaped and meant to lose no time in finding a place of refuge for the moment They were sure if they recrossed now they must meet the mob They were about to leave her Sybil in infinite distress when a lady driving herself in a pony carriage with a couple of grooms behind her mounted also on ponies of the same form and colour came up from the direction of the Moor and observing the group and Sybil much agitated pulled up and enquired the cause One of the men frequently interrupted by all the women immediately entered into a narrative of the state of affairs for which the lady was evidently quite unprepared for her alarm was considerable And this young person will persist in crossing over continued the man It s nothing less than madness I tell her she will meet instant death or worse It seems to me very rash said the lady in a kind tone and who seemed to recognise her Alas what am I to do exclaimed Sybil I left my father at mister Trafford s Well we have no time to lose said the man whose companion had now fastened the boat to the bank and so wishing them good morning and followed by the whole of his cargo they went on their way But just at this moment a gentleman mounted on a very knowing little cob came cantering up exclaiming as he reached the pony carriage My dear Joan I am looking after you I have been in the greatest alarm for you There are riots on the other side of the river and I was afraid you might have crossed the bridge Upon this Lady Joan related to mister Mountchesney how she had just become acquainted with the intelligence and then they conversed together for a moment or so in a whisper when turning round to Sybil she said I think you had really better come home with us till affairs are a little more quiet You are most kind said Sybil but if I could get back to the town through Mowbray Park I think I might do something for my father We are going to the Castle through the park at this moment said the gentleman You had better come with us There you will at least be safe and perhaps we shall be able to do something for the good people in trouble over the water and so saying nodding to a groom who advancing held his cob the gentleman dismounted and approaching Sybil with great courtesy said I think we ought all of us to know each other Lady Joan and myself had once the pleasure of meeting you I think at mister Trafford s It is a long time ago but he added in a subdued tone you are not a person to forget Sybil was insensible to mister Mountchesney s gallantry but alarmed and perplexed she yielded to the representations of himself and Lady Joan and got into the phaeton Turning from the river they pursued a road which entered after a short progress into the park mister Mountchesney cantering on before them Harold following They took their way for about a mile through a richly wooded demesne Lady Joan addressing many observations with great kindness to Sybil and frequently endeavouring though in vain to distract her agitated thoughts till they at length emerged from the more covered parts into extensive lawns while on a rising ground which they rapidly approached rose Mowbray Castle a modern castellated building raised in a style not remarkable for its taste or correctness but vast grand and imposing And now said mister Mountchesney riding up to them and addressing Sybil I will send off a scout immediately for news of your father In the mean time let us believe the best Sybil thanked him with cordiality and then she entered Mowbray Castle Book six Chapter twelve Less than an hour after the arrival of Sybil at Mowbray Castle the scout that mister Mountchesney had sent off to gather news returned and with intelligence of the triumph of Gerard s eloquence that all had ended happily and that the people were dispersing and returning to the town Kind as was the reception accorded to Sybil by Lady de Mowbray and her daughter on her arrival the remembrance of the perilous position of her father had totally disqualified her from responding to their advances Acquainted with the cause of her anxiety and depression and sympathising with womanly softness with her distress nothing could be more considerate than their behaviour It touched Sybil much and she regretted the harsh thoughts that irresistible circumstances had forced her to cherish respecting persons who now that she saw them in their domestic and unaffected hour had apparently many qualities to conciliate and to charm When the good news arrived of her father s safety and safety achieved in a manner so flattering to a daughter s pride it came upon a heart predisposed to warmth and kindness and all her feelings opened The tears stood in her beautiful eyes and they were tears not only of tenderness but gratitude Fortunately Lord de Mowbray was at the moment absent and as the question of the controverted inheritance was a secret to every member of the family except himself the name of Gerard excited no invidious sensation in the circle Sybil was willing to please and to be pleased every one was captivated by her beauty her grace her picturesque expression and sweet simplicity Lady de Mowbray serenely smiled and frequently when unobserved viewed her through her eyeglass Lady Joan much softened by marriage would show her the castle Lady Maud was in ecstasies with all that Sybil said or did while mister Mountchesney who had thought of little else but Sybil ever since Lady Maud s report of her seraphic singing and who had not let four and twenty hours go by without discovering with all the practised art of saint James the name and residence of the unknown fair flattered himself he was making great play when Sybil moved by his great kindness distinguished him by frequent notice They had viewed the castle they were in the music room Sybil had been prevailed upon though with reluctance to sing Some Spanish church music which she found there called forth all her powers all was happiness delight rapture Lady Maud in a frenzy of friendship mister Mountchesney convinced that the country in August might be delightful and Lady Joan almost gay because Alfred was pleased Lady de Mowbray had been left in her boudoir with the Morning Post Sybil had just finished a ravishing air there was a murmur of luncheon when suddenly Harold who had persisted in following his mistress and whom mister Mountchesney had gallantly introduced into the music room rose and coming forward from the corner in which he reposed barked violently How now said mister Mountchesney Harold said Sybil in a tone of remonstrance and surprise But the dog not only continued to bark but even howled At this moment the groom of the chambers entered the room abruptly and with a face of mystery said that he wished to speak with mister Mountchesney That gentleman immediately withdrew He was absent some little time the dog very agitated Lady Joan becoming disquieted when he returned His changed air struck the vigilant eye of his wife What has happened Alfred she said Oh don t be alarmed he replied with an obvious affectation of ease There are some troublesome people in the park stragglers I suppose from the rioters The gate keeper ought not to have let them pass I have given directions to Bentley what to do if they come to the castle Let us go to mama said Lady Joan And they were all about leaving the music room when a servant came running in and called out mister Bentley told me to say sir they are in sight Very well said mister Mountchesney in a calm tone but changing colour You had better go to your mama Joan and take Maud and our friend with you I will stay below for a while and notwithstanding the remonstrances of his wife mister Mountchesney went to the hall I don t know what to do sir said the house steward They are a very strong party Close all the windows lock and bar all the doors said mister Mountchesney I am frightened he continued about your lord I fear he may fall in with these people My lord is at Mowbray said mister Bentley He must have heard of this mob there And now emerging from the plantations and entering on the lawns the force and description of the invading party were easier to distinguish They were numerous though consisting of only a section of the original expedition for Gerard had collected a great portion of the Mowbray men and they preferred being under his command to following a stranger whom they did not much like on a somewhat licentious adventure of which their natural leader disapproved The invading section therefore were principally composed of Hell cats though singular enough Morley of all men in the world accompanied them attended by Devilsdust Dandy Mick and others of that youthful class of which these last were the idols and heroes There were perhaps eighteen hundred or two thousand persons armed with bars and bludgeons in general a grimy crew whose dress and appearance revealed the kind of labour to which they were accustomed The difference between them and the minority of Mowbray operatives was instantly recognizable When they perceived the castle this dreadful band gave a ferocious shout Lady de Mowbray showed blood she was composed and courageous She observed the mob from the window and re assuring her daughters and Sybil she said she would go down and speak to them She was on the point of leaving the room with this object when mister Mountchesney entered and hearing her purpose dissuaded her from attempting it Leave all to me he said and make yourselves quite easy they will go away I am certain they will go away and he again quitted them In the meantime Lady de Mowbray and her friends observed the proceedings below When the main body had advanced within a few hundred yards of the castle they halted and seated themselves on the turf This step re assured the garrison it was generally held to indicate that the intentions of the invaders were not of a very settled or hostile character that they had visited the place probably in a spirit of frolic and if met with tact and civility might ultimately be induced to retire from it without much annoyance This was evidently the opinion of mister Mountchesney from the first and when an uncouth being on a white mule attended by twenty or thirty miners advanced to the castle and asked for Lord de Mowbray mister Mountchesney met them with kindness saying that he regretted his father in law was absent expressed his readiness to represent him and enquired their pleasure His courteous bearing evidently had an influence on the Bishop who dropping his usual brutal tone mumbled something about his wish to drink Lord de Mowbray s health You shall all drink his health said mister Mountchesney humouring him and he gave directions that a couple of barrels of ale should be broached in the park before the castle The Bishop was pleased the people were in good humour some men began dancing it seemed that the cloud had blown over and mister Mountchesney sent up a bulletin to Lady de Mowbray that all danger was past and that he hoped in ten minutes they would all have disappeared The ten minutes had expired the Bishop was still drinking ale and mister Mountchesney still making civil speeches and keeping his immediate attendants in humour I wish they would go said Lady de Mowbray How wonderfully Alfred has managed them said Lady Joan After all said Lady Maud it must be confessed that the people Her sentence was interrupted Harold who had been shut out but who had laid down without quietly though moaning at intervals now sprang at the door with so much force that it trembled on its hinges while the dog again barked with renewed violence Sybil went to him he seized her dress with his teeth and would have pulled her away Suddenly uncouth and mysterious sounds were heard there was a loud shriek the gong in the hail thundered the great alarum bell of the tower sounded without and the housekeeper followed by the female domestics rushed into the room O my lady my lady they all exclaimed at the same time the Hell cats are breaking into the castle Before any one of the terrified company could reply the voice of mister Mountchesney was heard He was approaching them he was no longer calm He hurried into the room he was pale evidently greatly alarmed I have come to you he said these fellows have got in below While there is time and we can manage them you must leave the place I am ready for anything said Lady de Mowbray Lady Joan and Lady Maud wrung their hands in frantic terror Sybil very pale said Let me go down I may know some of these men No no said mister Mountchesney They are not Mowbray people It would not be safe Dreadful sounds were now heard a blending of shouts and oaths and hideous merriment Their hearts trembled The mob are in the house sir called out mister Bentley rushing up to them They say they will see everything Let them see everything said Lady de Mowbray but make a condition that they first let us go Try Alfred try to manage them before they are utterly ungovernable mister Mountchesney again left them on this desperate mission Lady de Mowbray and all the women remained in the chamber Not a word was spoken the silence was complete Even the maid servants had ceased to sigh and sob A feeling something like desperation was stealing over them The dreadful sounds continued increased They seemed to approach nearer It was impossible to distinguish a word and yet their import was frightful and ferocious Lord have mercy on us all exclaimed the housekeeper unable to restrain herself The maids began to cry After an absence of about five minutes mister Mountchesney again hurried in and leading away Lady de Mowbray he said You haven t a moment to lose Follow us There was a general rush and following mister Mountchesney they passed rapidly through several apartments the fearful noises every moment increasing until they reached the library which opened on the terrace The windows were broken the terrace crowded with people several of the mob were in the room even Lady de Mowbray cried out and fell back Come on said mister Mountchesney The mob have possession of the castle It is our only chance But the mob are here said Lady de Mowbray much terrified I see some Mowbray faces cried Sybil springing forward with a flashing eye and glowing cheek Bamford and Samuel Carr Bamford if you be my father s friend aid us now and Samuel Carr I was with your mother this morning did she think I should meet her son thus No you shall not enter said Sybil advancing They recognised her they paused I know you Couchman you told us once at the Convent that we might summon you in our need I summon you now O men men she exclaimed clasping her hands What is this Are you led away by strangers to such deeds Why I know you all You came here to aid I am sure and not to harm Guard these ladies save them from these foreigners There s Butler he ll go with us and Godfrey Wells Shall it be said you let your neighbours be plundered and assailed by strangers and never tried to shield them Now my good friends I entreat I adjure you Butler Wells Couchman what would Walter Gerard say your friend that you have so often followed if he saw this Gerard forever shouted Couchman Gerard forever exclaimed a hundred voices Tis his blessed daughter said others tis Sybil our angel Sybil Stand by Sybil Gerard Sybil had made her way upon the terrace and had collected around her a knot of stout followers who whatever may have been their original motive were now resolved to do her bidding The object of mister Mountchesney was to descend the side step of the terrace and again the flower garden from whence there were means of escape But the throng was still too fierce to permit Lady de Mowbray and her companions to attempt the passage and all that Sybil and her followers could at present do was to keep the mob off from entering the library and to exert themselves to obtain fresh recruits At this moment an unexpected aid arrived Keep back there I call upon you in the name of God to keep back exclaimed a voice of one struggling and communing with the rioters a voice which all immediately recognised It was that of mister saint Lys Charles Gardner I have been your friend The aid I gave you was often supplied to me by this house Why are you here For no evil purpose mister saint Lys I came as others did to see what was going on Then you see a deed of darkness Struggle against it Aid me and Philip Warner in this work it will support you at the judgment Tressel Tressel stand by me and Warner That s good that s right And you too Daventry and you and you I knew you would wash your hands of this fell deed It is not Mowbray men who would do this That s right that s right Form a band Good again There s not a man that joins us now who does not make a friend for life mister saint Lys had been in the neighbourhood when the news of the visit of the mob to the castle reached him He anticipated the perilous consequences He hastened immediately to the scene of action He had met Warner the handloom weaver in his way and enlisted his powerful influence with the people on his side The respective bands of Sybil and mister saint Lys in time contrived to join Their numbers were no longer contemptible they were animated by the words and presence of their leaders saint Lys struggling in their midst Sybil maintaining her position on the terrace and inciting all around her to courage and energy The multitude were kept back the passage to the side steps of the terrace was clear Now said Sybil and she encouraged Lady de Mowbray her daughters and followers to advance It was a fearful struggle to maintain the communication but it was a successful one They proceeded breathless and trembling until they reached what was commonly called the Grotto but which was in fact a subterranean way excavated through a hill and leading to the bank of a river where there were boats The entrance of this tunnel was guarded by an iron gate and mister Mountchesney had secured the key The gate was opened Warner and his friends made almost superhuman efforts at this moment to keep back the multitude Lady de Mowbray and her daughters had passed through when there came one of those violent undulations usual in mobs and which was occasioned by a sudden influx of persons attracted by what was occurring and Sybil and those who immediately surrounded her and were guarding the retreat were carried far away The gate was closed the rest of the party had passed but Sybil was left and found herself entirely among strangers In the meantime the castle was in possession of the mob The first great rush was to the cellars the Bishop himself headed this onset nor did he rest until he was seated among the prime binns of the noble proprietor This was not a crisis of corkscrews the heads of the bottles were knocked off with the same promptitude and dexterity as if they were shelling nuts or decapitating shrimps the choicest wines of Christendom were poured down the thirsty throats that ale and spirits had hitherto only stimulated Tummas was swallowing Burgundy Master Nixon had got hold of a batch of tokay while the Bishop himself seated on the ground and leaning against an arch the long perspective of the cellars full of rapacious figures brandishing bottles and torches alternately quaffed some very old Port and some Madeira of many voyages and was making up his mind as to their respective and relative merits While the cellars and offices were thus occupied bands were parading the gorgeous saloons and gazing with wonderment on their decorations and furniture Some grimy ruffians had thrown themselves with disdainful delight on the satin couches and the state beds others rifled the cabinets with an idea that they must be full of money and finding little in their way had strewn their contents papers and books and works of art over the floors of the apartments sometimes a band who had escaped from below with booty came up to consummate their orgies in the magnificence of the dwelling rooms Among these were Nixon and his friends who stared at the pictures and stood before the tall mirrors with still greater astonishment Indeed many of them had never seen an ordinary looking glass in their lives Tis Natur said Master Nixon surveying himself and turning to Juggins Many of these last grew frantic and finished their debauch by the destruction of everything around them But while these scenes of brutal riot were occurring there was one select but resolute band who shared in none of these excesses Morley followed by half a dozen Mowbray lads and two chosen Hell cats leaving all the confusion below had ascended the great staircase traced his way down a corridor to the winding steps of the Round Tower and supplied with the necessary instruments had forced his entrance into the muniment room of the castle It was a circular chamber lined with tall fire proof cases These might have presented invincible obstacles to any other than the pupils of Bishop Hatton as it was in some instances the locks in others the hinges yielded in time though after prolonged efforts to the resources of their art and while Dandy Mick and his friends kept watch at the entrance Morley and Devilsdust proceeded to examine the contents of the cases piles of parchment deeds bundles of papers arranged and docketed many boxes of various size and materials but the desired object was not visible A baffled expression came over the face of Morley he paused for an instant in his labours The thought of how much he had sacrificed for this and only to fail came upon him upon him the votary of Moral Power in the midst of havoc which he had organised and stimulated He cursed Baptist Hatton in his heart The knaves have destroyed them said Devilsdust I thought how it would be They never would run the chance of a son of Labour being lord of all this Some of the cases were very deep and they had hitherto in general in order to save time proved their contents with an iron rod Now Morley with a desperate air mounting on some steps that were in the room commenced formally rifling the cases and throwing their contents on the floor it was soon strewn with deeds and papers and boxes which he and Devilsdust the moment they had glanced at them hurled away At length when all hope seemed to have vanished clearing a case which at first appeared only to contain papers Morley struck something at its back he sprang forward with outstretched arm his body was half hid in the cabinet and he pulled out with triumphant exultation the box painted blue and blazoned with the arms of Valence It was neither large nor heavy he held it out to Devilsdust without saying a word and Morley descending the steps sate down for a moment on a pile of deeds and folded his arms At this juncture the discharge of musketry was heard Hilloa said Devilsdust with a queer expression Morley started from his seat Dandy Mick rushed into the room Troops troops there are troops here he exclaimed Let us descend said Morley In the confusion we may escape I will take the box and they left the muniment room One of their party whom Mick had sent forward to reconnoitre fell back upon them They are not troops he said they are yeomanry they are firing away and cutting every one down They have cleared the ground floor of the castle and are in complete possession below We cannot escape this way Those accursed locks said Morley clenching the box Time has beat us Let us see let us see He ran back into the mumment room and examined the egress from the window It was just possible for any one very lithe and nimble to vault upon the roof of the less elevated part of the castle Revolving this another scout rushed in and said Comrades they are here they are ascending the stairs Morley stamped on the ground with rage and despair Then seizing Mick by the hand he said You see this window can you by any means reach that roof One may as well lose one s neck that way said Mick I ll try Off If you land I will throw this box after you Now mind take it to the convent at Mowbray and deliver it yourself from me to Sybil Gerard It is light there are only papers in it but they will give her her own again and she will not forget you Never mind that said Mick I only wish I may live to see her The tramp of the ascending troopers was heard Good bye my hearties said Mick and he made the spring He seemed stunned but he might recover Morley watched him and flung the box And now he said drawing a pistol we may fight our way yet I ll shoot the first man who enters and then you must rush on them with your bludgeons The force that had so unexpectedly arrived at this scene of devastation was a troop of the yeomanry regiment of Lord Marney The strike in Lancashire and the revolt in the mining districts had so completely drained this county of military that the lord lieutenant had insisted on Lord Marney quitting his agricultural neighbourhood and quartering himself in the region of factories Within the last two days he had fixed his headquarters at a large manufacturing town within ten miles of Mowbray and a despatch on Sunday evening from the mayor of that town having reached him apprising him of the invasion of the miners Egremont had received orders to march with his troop there on the following morning Egremont had not departed more than two hours when the horsemen whom Sybil had met arrived at Lord Marney s headquarters bringing a most alarming and exaggerated report of the insurrection and of the havoc that was probably impending Lord Marney being of opinion that Egremont s forces were by no means equal to the occasion resolved therefore at once to set out for Mowbray with his own troop Crossing Mowbray Moor he encountered a great multitude now headed for purposes of peace by Walter Gerard His mind inflamed by the accounts he had received and hating at all times any popular demonstration his lordship resolved without inquiry or preparation immediately to disperse them The Riot Act was read with the rapidity with which grace is sometimes said at the head of a public table a ceremony of which none but the performer and his immediate friends are conscious The people were fired on and sabred The indignant spirit of Gerard resisted he struck down a trooper to the earth and incited those about him not to yield The father of Sybil was picked out the real friend and champion of the People and shot dead Instantly arose a groan which almost quelled the spirit of Lord Marney though armed and at the head of armed men The people who before this were in general scared and dispersing ready indeed to fly in all directions no sooner saw their beloved leader fall than a feeling of frenzy came over them They defied the troopers though themselves armed only with stones and bludgeons they rushed at the horsemen and tore them from their saddles while a shower of stones rattled on the helmet of Lord Marney and seemed never to cease In vain the men around him charged the infuriated throng the people returned to their prey nor did they rest until Lord Marney fell lifeless on Mowbray Moor literally stoned to death These disastrous events of course occurred at a subsequent period of the day to that on which half a dozen troopers were ascending the staircase of the Round Tower of Mowbray Castle The distracted house steward of Lord de Mowbray had met and impressed upon them now that the Castle was once more in their possession of securing the muniment room for mister Bentley had witnessed the ominous ascent of Morley and his companions to that important chamber Morley and his companions had taken up an advantageous position at the head of the staircase Surrender said the commander of the yeomanry Resistance is useless Morley presented his pistol but before he could pull the trigger a shot from a trooper in the rear and who from his position could well observe the intention of Morley struck Stephen in the breast still he fired but aimless and without effect The troopers pushed on Morley fainting fell back with his friends who were frightened except Devilsdust who had struck hard and well and who in turn had been slightly sabred The yeomanry entered the muniment room almost at the same time as their foes leaving Devilsdust behind them who had fallen and who cursing the Capitalist who had wounded him managed to escape Morley fell when he had regained the room The rest surrendered Morley Stephen Morley exclaimed the commander of the yeomanry You you here Yes I am sped he said in a faint voice No no succour It is useless and I desire none Why I am here is a mystery let it remain so The world will misjudge me the man of peace they will say was a hypocrite The world will be wrong as it always is Death is bitter he said with a deep sigh and speaking with great difficulty more bitter from you but just We have struggled together before Egremont I thought I had scotched you then but you escaped Our lives have been a struggle since we first met Your star has controlled mine and now I feel I have sacrificed life and fame dying men prophecy for your profit and honour O Sybil and with this name half sighed upon his lips the votary of Moral Power and the Apostle of Community ceased to exist Meanwhile Sybil separated from her friends who had made their escape through the grotto was left with only Harold for her protector for she had lost even Warner in the crush She looked around in vain for some Mowbray face that she could recognise but after some fruitless research a loud shouting in the distance followed by the firing of musketry so terrified all around her that the mob in her immediate neighbourhood dispersed as if by magic and she remained alone crouching in a corner of the flower garden while dreadful shouts and shrieks and yells resounded from the distance occasionally firing the smoke floating to her retreat She could see from where she stood the multitude flying about the park in all directions and therefore she thought it best to remain in her present position and await the terrible events She concluded that some military force had arrived and that if she could maintain her present post she hoped that the extreme danger might pass But while she indulged in these hopes a dark cloud of smoke came descending in the garden It could not be produced by musket or carbine its volume was too heavy even for ordnance and in a moment there were sparks mingled with its black form and then the shouting and shrieking which had in some degree subsided suddenly broke out again with increased force and wildness The Castle was on fire Whether from heedlessness or from insane intention for the deed sealed their own doom the drunken Hell cats brandishing their torches while they rifled the cellars and examined every closet and corner of the offices had set fire to the lower part of the building and the flames that had for some time burnt unseen had now gained the principal chambers The Bishop was lying senseless in the main cellar surrounded by his chief officers in the same state indeed the whole of the basement was covered with the recumbent figures of Hell cats as black and thick as torpid flies during the last days of their career The funeral pile of the children of Woden was a sumptuous one it was prepared and lighted by themselves and the flame that rising from the keep of Mowbray announced to the startled country that in a short hour the splendid mimickry of Norman rule would cease to exist told also the pitiless fate of the ruthless savage who with analogous pretension had presumed to style himself the Liberator of the People The clouds of smoke the tongues of flame that now began to mingle with them the multitude whom this new incident and impending catastrophe summoned hack to the scene forced Sybil to leave the garden and enter the park It was in vain she endeavoured to gain some part less frequented than the rest and to make her way unobserved Suddenly a band of drunken ruffians with shouts and oaths surrounded her she shrieked in frantic terror Harold sprung at the throat of the foremost another advanced Harold left his present prey and attacked the new assailant The brave dog did wonders but the odds were fearful and the men had bludgeons were enraged and had already wounded him One ruffian had grasped the arm of Sybil another had clenched her garments when an officer covered with dust and gore sabre in hand jumped from the terrace and hurried to the rescue He cut down one man thrust away another and placing his left arm round Sybil he defended her with his sword while Harold now become furious flew from man to man and protected her on the other side Her assailants were routed they made a staggering flight the officer turned round and pressed Sybil to his heart We will never part again said Egremont Never murmured Sybil Book six Chapter thirteen It was the Spring of last year and Lady Bardolf was making a morning visit to Lady saint Julians I heard they were to be at Lady Palmerston s last night said Lady saint Julians No said Lady Bardolf shaking his head they make their first appearance at Deloraine House We meet there on Thursday I know Well I must say said Lady saint Julians that I am curious to see her Lord Valentine met them last year at Naples And what does he say of her Oh he raves What a romantic history And what a fortunate man is Lord Marney If one could only have foreseen events exclaimed Lady saint Julians He was always a favourite of mine though But still I thought his brother was the very last person who ever would die He was so very hard I fear Lord Marney is entirely lost to us said Lady Bardolf looking very solemn Ah he always had a twist said Lady saint Julians and used to breakfast with that horrid mister Trenchard and do those sort of things But still with his immense fortune I should think he would become rational You may well say immense said Lady Bardolf mister Ormsby and there is no better judge of another man s income says there are not three peers in the kingdom who have so much a year clear They say the Mowbray estate is forty thousand a year said Lady saint Julians Poor Lady de Mowbray I understand that mister Mountchesney has resolved not to appeal against the verdict You know he has not a shadow of a chance said Lady Bardolf Ah what changes we have seen in that family They say the writ of right killed poor Lord de Mowbray but to my mind he never recovered the burning of the Castle We went over to them directly and I never saw a man so cut up We wanted them to come to us at Firebrace but he said he should leave the county immediately I remember Lord Bardolf mentioning to me that he looked like a dying man Well I must say said Lady saint Julians rallying as it were from a fit of abstraction that I am most curious to see Lady Marney The reader will infer from this conversation that Dandy Mick in spite of his stunning fall and all dangers which awaited him on his recovery had contrived in spite of fire and flame sabre and carbine trampling troopers and plundering mobs to reach the Convent of Mowbray with the box of papers There he enquired for Sybil in whose hands and whose hands alone he was enjoined to deposit them She was still absent but faithful to his instructions Mick would deliver his charge to none other and exhausted by the fatigues of the terrible day he remained in the court yard of the Convent lying down with the box for his pillow until Sybil under the protection of Egremont herself returned Then he fulfilled his mission Sybil was too agitated at the moment to perceive all its import but she delivered the box into the custody of Egremont who desiring Mick to follow him to his hotel bade farewell to Sybil who equally with himself was then ignorant of the fatal encounter on Mowbray Moor We must drop a veil over the anguish which its inevitable and speedy revelation brought to the daughter of Gerard Her love for her father was one of those profound emotions which seemed to form a constituent part of her existence She remained for a long period in helpless woe soothed only by the sacred cares of Ursula There was another mourner in this season of sorrow who must not be forgotten and that was Lady Marney All that tenderness and the most considerate thought could devise to soften sorrow and reconcile her to a change of life which at the first has in it something depressing were extended by Egremont to Arabella He supplied in an instant every arrangement which had been neglected by his brother but which could secure her convenience and tend to her happiness Between Marney Abbey where he insisted for the present that Arabella should reside and Mowbray Egremont passed his life for many months until by some management which we need not trace or analyse Lady Marney came over one day to the Convent at Mowbray and carried back Sybil to Marney Abbey never again to quit it until on her bridal day when the Earl and Countess of Marney departed for Italy where they passed nearly a year and from which they had just returned at the commencement of this chapter During the previous period however many important events had occurred Lord Marney had placed himself in communication with mister Hatton who had soon become acquainted with all that had occurred in the muniment room of Mowbray Castle The result was not what he had once anticipated but for him it was not without some compensatory circumstances True another and an unexpected rival had stepped on the stage with whom it was vain to cope but the idea that he had deprived Sybil of her inheritance had ever since he had became acquainted with her been the plague spot of Hatton s life and there was nothing that he desired more ardently than to see her restored to her rights and to be instrumental in that restoration How successful he was in pursuing her claim the reader has already learnt Dandy Mick was rewarded for all the dangers he had encountered in the service of Sybil and what he conceived was the vindication of popular rights Lord Marney established him in business and Mick took Devilsdust for a partner Devilsdust having thus obtained a position in society and become a capitalist thought it but a due homage to the social decencies to assume a decorous appellation and he called himself by the name of the town where he was born The firm of Radley Mowbray and company is a rising one and will probably furnish in time a crop of members of Parliament and Peers of the realm Devilsdust married Caroline and missus Mowbray became a great favorite She was always perhaps a little too fond of junketting but she had a sweet temper and a gay spirit and sustained her husband in the agonies of a great speculation or the despair of glutted markets Julia became missus Radley and was much esteemed no one could behave better She was more orderly than Caroline and exactly suited Mick who wanted a person near him of decision and method As for Harriet she is not yet married Though pretty and clever she is selfish and a screw She has saved a good deal and has a considerable sum in the Savings Bank but like many heiresses she cannot bring her mind to share her money with another The great measures of Sir Robert Peel which produced three good harvests have entirely revived trade at Mowbray The Temple is again open newly painted and re burnished and Chaffing Jack has of course rallied while good missus Carey still gossips with her neighbours round her well stored stall and tells wonderful stories of the great stick out and riots of forty two And thus I conclude the last page of a work which though its form be light and unpretending would yet aspire to suggest to its readers some considerations of a very opposite character A year ago I presumed to offer to the public some volumes that aimed to call their attention to the state of our political parties their origin their history their present position In an age of political infidelity of mean passions and petty thoughts I would have impressed upon the rising race not to despair but to seek in a right understanding of the history of their country and in the energies of heroic youth the elements of national welfare The present work advances another step in the same emprise From the state of Parties it now would draw public thought to the state of the People whom those parties for two centuries have governed The comprehension and the cure of this greater theme depend upon the same agencies as the first it is the past alone that can explain the present and it is youth that alone can mould the remedial future The written history of our country for the last ten reigns has been a mere phantasma giving to the origin and consequence of public transactions a character and colour in every respect dissimilar with their natural form and hue In this mighty mystery all thoughts and things have assumed an aspect and title contrary to their real quality and style Oligarchy has been called Liberty an exclusive Priesthood has been christened a National Church Sovereignty has been the title of something that has had no dominion while absolute power has been wielded by those who profess themselves the servants of the People In the selfish strife of factions two great existences have been blotted out of the history of England the Monarch and the Multitude as the power of the Crown has diminished the privileges of the People have disappeared till at length the sceptre has become a pageant and its subject has degenerated again into a serf It is nearly fourteen years ago in the popular frenzy of a mean and selfish revolution which neither emancipated the Crown nor the People that I first took the occasion to intimate and then to develope to the first assembly of my countrymen that I ever had the honour to address these convictions They have been misunderstood as is ever for a season the fate of Truth and they have obtained for their promulgator much misrepresentation as must ever be the lot of those who will not follow the beaten track of a fallacious custom But Time that brings all things has brought also to the mind of England some suspicion that the idols they have so long worshipped and the oracles that have so long deluded them are not the true ones There is a whisper rising in this country that Loyalty is not a phrase Faith not a delusion and Popular Liberty something more diffusive and substantial than the profane exercise of the sacred rights of sovereignty by political classes That we may live to see England once more possess a free Monarchy and a privileged and prosperous People is my prayer that these great consequences can only be brought about by the energy and devotion of our Youth is my persuasion We live in an age when to be young and to be indifferent can be no longer synonymous We must prepare for the coming hour The claims of the Future are represented by suffering millions and the Youth of a Nation are the trustees of Posterity End of the Project
