PUBLISHER thirty six Cornhill Entered according to the Act of Congress in the year eighteen sixty by G G EVANS in the Clerk s Office of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania INTRODUCTION In preparing a book of etiquette for ladies I would lay down as the first rule Do unto others as you would others should do to you You can never be rude if you bear the rule always in mind for what lady likes to be treated rudely True Christian politeness will always be the result of an unselfish regard for the feelings of others and though you may err in the ceremonious points of etiquette you will never be impolite Politeness founded upon such a rule becomes the expression in graceful manner of social virtues The spirit of politeness consists in a certain attention to forms and ceremonies which are meant both to please others and ourselves and to make others pleased with us a still clearer definition may be given by saying that politeness is goodness of heart put into daily practice there can be no true politeness without kindness purity singleness of heart and sensibility Many believe that politeness is but a mask worn in the world to conceal bad passions and impulses and to make a show of possessing virtues not really existing in the heart thus that politeness is merely hypocrisy and dissimulation Do not believe this be certain that those who profess such a doctrine are practising themselves the deceit they condemn so much Such people scout politeness because to be truly a lady one must carry the principles into every circumstance of life into the family circle the most intimate friendship and never forget to extend the gentle courtesies of life to every one This they find too much trouble and so deride the idea of being polite and call it deceitfulness True politeness is the language of a good heart and those possessing that heart will never under any circumstances be rude They may not enter a crowded saloon gracefully they may be entirely ignorant of the forms of good society they may be awkward at table ungrammatical in speech but they will never be heard speaking so as to wound the feelings of another they will never be seen making others uncomfortable by seeking solely for their own personal convenience they will always endeavor to set every one around them at ease they will be self sacrificing friendly unselfish truly in word and deed polite Give to such a woman the knowledge of the forms and customs of society teach her how best to show the gentle courtesies of life and you have a lady created by God only indebted for the outward polish to the world It is true that society demands this same unselfishness and courtesy but when there is no heart in the work the time is frittered away on the mere ceremonies forms of etiquette and customs of society and this politeness seeks only its own ends to be known as courteous spoken of as lady like and not beloved as unselfish and womanly Etiquette exists in some form in all countries has existed and will exist in all ages From the rudest savage who dares not approach his ignorant barbarous ruler without certain forms and ceremonies to the most polished courts in Europe or the home circles of America etiquette reigns True politeness will be found its basis in the human heart the same in all these varied scenes and situations but the outward forms of etiquette will vary everywhere Even in the same scene time will alter every form and render the exquisite polish of last year obsolete rudeness next year Politeness being based upon real kindness of heart cannot exist where there is selfishness or brutality to warp its growth It is founded upon love of the neighbor and a desire to be beloved and to show love Thus where such pure noble feelings do not exist the mere forms of politeness become hypocrisy and deceit Rudeness will repel where courtesy would attract friends Never by word or action notice the defects of another be charitable for all need charity Remember who said Let him that is without fault cast the first stone Remember that the laws of politeness require the consideration of the feelings of others the endeavor to make every one feel at ease and frank courtesy towards all Never meet rudeness in others with rudeness upon your own part even the most brutal and impolite will be more shamed by being met with courtesy and kindness than by any attempt to annoy them by insolence on your part Politeness forbids any display of resentment The polished surface throws back the arrow Remember that a favor becomes doubly valuable if granted with courtesy and that the pain of a refusal may be softened if the manner expresses polite regret Kindness even to the most humble will never lose anything by being offered in a gentle courteous manner and the most common place action will admit of grace and ease in its execution Let every action while it is finished in strict accordance with etiquette be at the same time easy as if dictated solely by the heart To be truly polite remember you must be polite at all times and under all circumstances CONTENTS PAGE CHAPTER I CONVERSATION eleven CHAPTER II DRESS twenty one CHAPTER III

you must sympathize you must possess at the same time the habit of communicating and of listening attentively The union is rare but irresistible None but an excessively ill bred person will allow her attention to wander from the person with whom she is conversing and especially she will never while seeming to be entirely attentive to her companion answer a remark or question made to another person in another group Unless the conversation be general among a party of friends confine your remarks and attention entirely to the person with whom you are conversing Steele says I would establish but one great general rule in conversation which is this that people should not talk to please themselves but those who hear them This would make them consider whether what they speak be worth hearing whether there be either wit or sense in what they are about to say and whether it be adapted to the time when the place where and the person to whom it is spoken Be careful in conversation to avoid topics which may be supposed to have any direct reference to events or circumstances which may be painful for your companion to hear discussed you may unintentionally start a subject which annoys or troubles the friend with whom you may be conversing in that case do not stop abruptly when you perceive that it causes pain and above all do not make the matter worse by apologizing turn to another subject as soon as possible and pay no attention to the agitation your unfortunate remark may have excited Many persons will for the sake of appearing witty or smart wound the feelings of another deeply avoid this it is not only ill bred but cruel Remember that having all the talk sustained by one person is not conversation do not engross all the attention yourself by refusing to allow another person an opportunity to speak and also avoid the other extreme of total silence or answering only in monosyllables If your companion relates an incident or tells a story be very careful not to interrupt her by questions even if you do not clearly understand her wait until she has finished her relation and then ask any questions you may desire There is nothing more annoying than to be so interrupted I have heard a story told to an impertinent listener which ran in this way I saw a fearful sight When I was about to tell you last Monday on the train What train The train from B We were near the bridge What bridge I will tell you all about it if you will only let me speak I was coming from B Last Monday did you say and so on The story was interrupted at every sentence and the relator condemned as a most tedious story teller when had he been permitted to go forward he would have made the incident interesting and short Never interrupt any one who is speaking It is very ill bred If you see that a person to whom you wish to speak is being addressed by another person never speak until she has heard and replied until her conversation with that person is finished No truly polite lady ever breaks in upon a conversation or interrupts another speaker Never in speaking to a married lady enquire for her husband or if a gentleman ask for his wife The elegant way is to call the absent party by their name ask mister Smith how missus Smith is or enquire of missus Jones for mister Jones but never for your husband or your wife On the other hand if you are married never speak of your husband as your lord husband or good man avoid also unless amongst relatives calling him by his Christian name If you wish others to respect him show by speaking of him in respectful terms that you do so yourself If either your own husband or your friend s is in the army or navy or can claim the doctor Prof or any other prefix to his name there is no impropriety in speaking of him as the colonel doctor or whatever his title may be It is a mark of ill breeding to use French phrases or words unless you are sure your companion is a French scholar and even then it is best to avoid them Above all do not use any foreign word or phrase unless you have the language perfectly at your command I heard a lady once use a Spanish quotation she had mastered that one sentence alone but a Cuban gentleman delighted to meet an American who could converse with him in his own tongue immediately addressed her in Spanish Embarrassed and ashamed she was obliged to confess that her knowledge of the language was confined to one quotation Never anticipate the point or joke of any anecdote told in your presence If you have heard the story before it may be new to others and the narrator should always be allowed to finish it in his own words To take any sentence from the mouth of another person before he has time to utter it is the height of ill breeding Avoid it carefully Never use the phrases What d ye call it Thingummy What s his name or any such substitutes for a proper name or place If you cannot recall the names you wish to use it is better not to tell the story or incident connected with them No lady of high breeding will ever use these substitutes in conversation Be careful always to speak in a distinct clear voice at the same time avoid talking too loudly there is a happy medium between mumbling and screaming Strive to attain it Overlook the deficiencies of others when conversing with them as they may be the results of ignorance and impossible to correct Never pain another person by correcting before others a word or phrase mispronounced or ungrammatically constructed If your intimacy will allow it speak of the fault upon another occasion kindly and privately or let it pass Do not be continually watching for faults that you may display your own superior wisdom in correcting them Let modesty and kind feeling govern your conversation as other rules of life If on the other hand your companion uses words or expressions which you cannot understand do not affect knowledge or be ashamed of your ignorance but frankly ask for an explanation In conversing with professional gentlemen never question them upon matters connected with their employment An author may communicate voluntarily information interesting to you upon the subject of his works but any questions from you would be extremely rude If you meet a physician who is attending a friend you may enquire for their progress but do not expect him to give you a detailed account of the disease and his manner of treating it The same rule applies to questioning lawyers about their clients artists on their paintings merchants or mechanics of their several branches of business Professional or business men when with ladies generally wish for miscellaneous subjects of conversation and as their visits are for recreation they will feel excessively annoyed if obliged to talk shop Still many men can converse on no other subject than their every day employment In this case listen politely and show your interest You will probably gain useful information in such conversation Never question the veracity of any statement made in general conversation If you are certain a statement is false and it is injurious to another person who may be absent you may quietly and courteously inform the speaker that he is mistaken but if the falsehood is of no consequence let it pass If a statement appears monstrous but you do not know that it is false listen but do not question its veracity It may be true though it strikes you as improbable Never attempt to disparage an absent friend It is the height of meanness If others admire her and you do not let them have their opinion in peace you will probably fail if you try to lower her in their esteem and gain for yourself the character of an ill natured envious person In conversing with foreigners if they speak slightingly of the manners of your country do not retort rudely or resentfully If their views are wrong converse upon the subject giving them frankly your views but never retaliate by telling them that some custom of their own country is worse A gentleman or lady of true refinement will always give your words candid consideration and admit that an American may possibly know the customs of her country better than they do and if your opponent is not well bred your rudeness will not improve his manners Let the conversation upon national subjects be candid and at the same time courteous and leave him to think that the ladies in America are well bred however much he may dislike some little national peculiarity Avoid at all times mentioning subjects or incidents that can in any way disgust your hearers Many persons will enter into the details of sicknesses which should be mentioned only when absolutely necessary or describe the most revolting scenes before a room full of people or even at table Others speak of vermin noxious plants or instances of uncleanliness All such conversation or allusion is excessively ill bred It is not only annoying but absolutely sickening to some and a truly lady like person will avoid all such topics I cannot too severely censure the habit of using sentences which admit of a double meaning It is not only ill bred but indelicate and no person of true refinement will ever do it If you are so unfortunate as to converse with one who uses such phrases never by word look or sign show that you understand any meaning beyond the plain outspoken language Avoid always any discussion upon religious topics unless you are perfectly certain that your remarks cannot annoy or pain any one present If you are tete a tete with a friend and such a discussion arise inquire your companion s church and mention your own that you may yourself avoid unpleasant remarks and caution him Never when advancing an opinion assert positively that a thing is so but give your opinion as an opinion Say I think this is so or these are my views but remember that your companion may be better informed upon the subject under discussion or where it is a mere matter of taste or feeling do not expect that all the world will feel exactly as you do Never repeat to a person with whom you converse any unpleasant speech you may have heard concerning her If you can give her pleasure by the repetition of a delicate compliment or token of approval shown by a mutual friend tell her the pleasant speech or incident but do not hurt her feelings or involve her in a quarrel by the repetition of ill natured remarks Amongst well bred persons every conversation is considered in a measure confidential A lady or gentleman tacitly confides in you when he or she tells you an incident which may cause trouble if repeated and you violate a confidence as much in such a repetition as if you were bound over to secrecy Remember this Never criticise a companion s dress or indeed make any remark whatever upon it If a near friend you may if sincere admire any article but with a mere acquaintance let it pass unnoticed If however any accident has happened to the dress of which she is ignorant tell her of it and assist her in repairing the mischief To be able to converse really well you must read much treasure in your memory the pearls of what you read you must have a quick comprehension observe passing events and listen attentively whenever there is any opportunity of acquiring knowledge A quick tact is necessary too in conversation To converse with an entirely uneducated person upon literature interlarding your remarks with quotations is ill bred It places them in an awkward situation and does not add to your popularity In conversing with persons of refinement and intelligence do not endeavor to attract their admiration by pouring forth every item of your own information upon the subject under consideration but listen as well as talk and modestly follow their lead I do not mean to assent to any opinion they may advance if you really differ in your own tastes but do not be too ready to show your superior judgment or information Avoid argument it is not conversation and frequently leads to ill feeling If you are unfortunately drawn into an argument keep your temper under perfect control and if you find your adversary is getting too warm endeavor to introduce some other topic Avoid carefully any allusion to the age or personal defects of your companion or any one who may be in the room and be very careful in your language when speaking of a stranger to another person I have heard a lady inquire of a gentleman who that frightful girl in blue could be and receive the information that the lady in question was the gentleman s own sister Be careful when traveling not to wound the feelings of your friends in another country or city by underrating their native place or attempting to prove the superiority of your own home over theirs Very young girls are apt to suppose from what they observe in older ones that there is some particular manner to be put on in talking to gentlemen and not knowing exactly what it is they are embarrassed and reserved others observe certain airs and looks used by their elders in this intercourse and try to imitate them as a necessary part of company behaviours and so become affected and lose that first of charms simplicity natural grace To such let me say your companions are in error it requires no peculiar manner nothing to be put on in order to converse with gentlemen any more than with ladies and the more pure and elevated your sentiments are and the better cultivated your intellect is the easier will you find it to converse pleasantly with all One good rule can be always followed by young ladies to converse with a lady friend as if there were gentlemen present and to converse with a gentleman as if in the room with other ladies Avoid affectation it is the sure test of a deceitful vulgar mind The best cure is to try to have those virtues which you would affect and then they will appear naturally CHAPTER II DRESS A lady is never so well dressed as when you cannot remember what she wears No truer remark than the above was ever made Such an effect can only be produced where every part of the dress harmonizes entirely with the other parts where each color or shade suits the wearer s style completely and where there is perfect neatness in each detail One glaring color or conspicuous article would entirely mar the beauty of such a dress It is unfortunately too much the custom in America to wear any article or shape in make that is fashionable without any regard to the style of the person purchasing goods If it is the fashion it must be worn though it may greatly exaggerate a slight personal defect or conceal or mar what would otherwise be a beauty It requires the exercise of some judgment to decide how far an individual may follow the dictates of fashion in order to avoid the appearance of eccentricity and yet wear what is peculiarly becoming to her own face or figure Another fault of our fair countrywomen is their extravagance in dress No better advice can be given to a young person than to dress always according to her circumstances She will be more respected with a simple wardrobe if it is known either that she is dependent upon her own exertions for support or is saving a husband or father from unnecessary outlay than if she wore the most costly fabrics and by so doing incurred debt or burdened her relatives with heavy unwarrantable expense If neatness consistency and good taste preside over the wardrobe of a lady expensive fabrics will not be needed for with the simplest materials harmony of color accurate fitting to the figure and perfect neatness she will always appear well dressed GENERAL RULES NEATNESS This is the first of all rules to be observed with regard to dress Perfect cleanliness and careful adjustment of each article in the dress are indispensable in a finished toilet Let the hair be always smooth and becomingly arranged each article exquisitely clean neat collar and sleeves and tidy shoes and stockings and the simplest dress will appear well while a torn or soiled collar rough hair or untidy feet will entirely ruin the effect of the most costly and elaborate dress The many articles required in a lady s wardrobe make a neat arrangement of her drawers and closets necessary and also require care in selecting and keeping goods in proper order A fine collar or lace if tumbled or soiled will lose its beauty when contrasted with the same article in the coarsest material perfectly pure and smooth Each article of dress when taken off should be placed carefully and smoothly in its proper place Nice dresses should be hung up by a loop on the inside of the waistband with the skirts turned inside out and the body turned inside of the skirt Cloaks should hang in smooth folds from a loop on the inside of the neck Shawls should be always folded in the creases in which they were purchased All fine articles lace embroidery and handkerchiefs should be placed by themselves in a drawer always laid out smoothly and kept from dust Furs should be kept in a box alone and in summer carefully packed with a quantity of lump camphor to protect from moths The bonnet should always rest upon a stand in the band box as the shape and trimming will both be injured by letting it lie either on the face sides or crown ADAPTIVENESS Let each dress worn by a lady be suitable to the occasion upon which she wears it A toilet may be as offensive to good taste and propriety by being too elaborate as by being slovenly Never wear a dress which is out of place or out of season under the impression that it will do for once or nobody will notice it It is in as bad taste to receive your morning calls in an elaborate evening dress as it would be to attend a ball in your morning wrapper HARMONY To appear well dressed without harmony both in color and materials is impossible When arranging any dress whether for home street or evening be careful that each color harmonizes well with the rest and let no one article by its glaring costliness make all the rest appear mean A costly lace worn over a thin flimsy silk will only make the dress appear poorer not as some suppose hide its defects A rich trimming looks as badly upon a cheap dress as a mean one does upon an expensive fabric Observe this rule always in purchasing goods One costly article will entirely ruin the harmony in a dress which without it though plain and inexpensive would be becoming and beautiful Do not save on the dress or cloak to buy a more elaborate bonnet but let the cost be well equalized and the effect will be good A plain merino or dark silk with a cloth cloak will look much better than the most expensive velvet cloak over a cheap delaine dress FASHION Do not be too submissive to the dictates of fashion at the same time avoid oddity or eccentricity in your dress There are some persons who will follow in defiance of taste and judgment the fashion to its most extreme point this is a sure mark of vulgarity Every new style of dress will admit of adaptation to individual cases thus producing a pleasing as well as fashionable effect Not only good taste but health is often sacrificed to the silly error of dressing in the extreme of fashion Be careful to have your dress comfortable and becoming and let the prevailing mode come into secondary consideration avoiding always the other extreme of oddity or eccentricity in costume STYLE AND FORM OF DRESS Be always careful when making up the various parts of your wardrobe that each article fits you accurately Not in the outside garments alone must this rule be followed an ill fitting pair of corsets or wrinkles in any other article of the under clothes will make a dress set badly even if it has been itself fitted with the utmost accuracy A stocking which is too large will make the boot uncomfortably tight and too small will compress the foot making the shoe loose and untidy In a dress no outlay upon the material will compensate for a badly fitting garment A cheap calico made to fit the form accurately and easily will give the wearer a more lady like air than the richest silk which either wrinkles or is too tightly strained over the figure Collars or sleeves pinned over or tightly strained to meet will entirely mar the effect of the prettiest dress ECONOMY And by economy I do not mean mere cheapness To buy a poor flimsy fabric merely because the price is low is extravagance not economy still worse if you buy articles because they are offered cheap when you have no use for them In purchasing goods for the wardrobe let each material be the best of its kind The same amount of sewing that is put into a good material must be put into a poor one and as the latter will very soon wash or wear out there must be another one to supply its place purchased and made up when by buying a good article at first this time and labor might have been saved A good strong material will be found cheapest in the end though the actual expenditure of money may be larger at first COMFORT Many ladies have to trace months of severe suffering to an improper disregard of comfort in preparing their wardrobe or in exposure after they are dressed The most exquisite ball costume will never compensate for the injury done by tight lacing the prettiest foot is dearly paid for by the pain a tight boot entails and the most graceful effects will not prevent suffering from exposure to cold A light ball dress and exquisite arrangement of the hair too often make the wearer dare the inclemency of the coldest night by wearing a light shawl or hood to prevent crushing delicate lace or flowers Make it a fixed rule to have the head feet and chest well protected when going to a party even at the risk of a crushed flower or a stray curl Many a fair head has been laid in a coffin a victim to consumption from rashly venturing out of a heated ball room flushed and excited with only a light protection against keen night air The excitement of the occasion may prevent immediate discomfort in such cases but it adds to the subsequent danger DETAILS Be careful always that the details of your dress are perfectly finished in every point The small articles of a wardrobe require constant care to keep in perfect order yet they will wofully revenge themselves if neglected Let the collar handkerchief boots gloves and belts be always whole neat and adapted to the dress A lace collar will look as badly over a chintz dress as a linen one would with velvet though each may be perfect of its kind Attention to these minor points are sure tests of taste in a lady s dress A shabby or ill fitting boot or glove will ruin the most elaborate walking dress while one of much plainer make and coarser fabric will be becoming and lady like if all the details are accurately fitted clean and well put on In arranging a dress for every occasion be careful that there is no missing string hook or button that the folds hang well and that every part is even and properly adjusted Let the skirts hang smoothly the outside ones being always about an inch longer than the under ones let the dress set smoothly carefully hooked or buttoned let the collar fit neatly and be fastened firmly and smoothly at the throat let shoes and stockings be whole clean and fit nicely let the hair be smooth and glossy the skin pure and the colors and fabric of your dress harmonize and be suitable for the occasion and you will always appear both lady like and well dressed HOME DRESSES MORNING DRESS The most suitable dress for breakfast is a wrapper made to fit the figure loosely and the material excepting when the winter weather requires woolen goods should be of chintz gingham brilliante or muslin A lady who has children or one accustomed to perform for herself light household duties will soon find the advantage of wearing materials that will wash A large apron of domestic gingham which can be taken off if the wearer is called to see unexpected visiters will protect the front of the dress and save washing the wrapper too frequently If a lady s domestic duties require her attention for several hours in the morning whilst her list of acquaintances is large and she has frequent morning calls it is best to dress for callers before breakfast and wear over this dress a loose sack and skirt of domestic gingham This while protecting the dress perfectly can be taken off at a moment s notice if callers are announced Married ladies often wear a cap in the morning and lately young girls have adopted the fashion It is much better to let the hair be perfectly smooth requiring no cap which is often worn to conceal the lazy slovenly arrangement of the hair A few moments given to making the hair smooth and presentable without any covering will not be wasted Slippers of embroidered cloth are prettiest with a wrapper and in summer black morocco is the most suitable for the house in the morning DRESS FOR MORNING VISITS A lady should never receive her morning callers in a wrapper unless they call at an unusually early hour or some unexpected demand upon her time makes it impossible to change her dress after breakfast On the other hand an elaborate costume before dinner is in excessively bad taste The dress should be made to fit the figure neatly finished at the throat and wrists by an embroidered collar and cuffs and unless there is a necessity for it in loss of the hair or age there should be no cap or head dress worn A wrapper made with handsome trimming open over a pretty white skirt may be worn with propriety but the simple dress worn for breakfast or in the exercise of domestic duties is not suitable for the parlor when receiving visits of ceremony in the morning EVENING DRESS The home evening dress should be varied according to circumstances If no visitor is expected the dress worn in the morning is suitable for the evening but to receive visitors it should be of lighter material and a light head dress may be worn For young ladies at home ribbon or velvet are the most suitable materials for a head dress Flowers unless they be natural ones in summer are in very bad taste excepting in cases where a party of invited guests are expected Dark silk in winter and thin material in summer make the most suitable dresses for evening and the reception of the chance guests ladies in society may usually expect WALKING DRESSES Walking dresses to be in good taste should be of quiet colors and never conspicuous Browns modes and neutral tints with black and white make the prettiest dresses for the street Above all avoid wearing several bright colors One may be worn with perfect propriety to take off the sombre effect of a dress of brown or black but do not let it be too glaring and wear but little of it Let the boots be sufficiently strong and thick to protect the feet from damp or dust and wear always neat clean nicely fitting gloves The entire effect of the most tasteful costume will be ruined if attention is not paid to the details of dress A soiled bonnet cap untidy strings or torn gloves and collar will utterly spoil the prettiest costume There is no surer mark of vulgarity than over dressing or gay dressing in the street Let the materials be of the costliest kind if you will but do not either wear the exaggerations of the fashion or conspicuous colors Let good taste dictate the limits where fashion may rule and let the colors harmonize well and be of such tints as will not attract attention FOR MORNING CALLS The dress should be plain and in winter furs and dark gloves may be worn FOR BRIDAL CALLS The dress should be of light silk the bonnet dressy and either a rich shawl or light cloak no furs and light gloves In summer a lace or silk mantle and white gloves should be worn SHOPPING DRESSES Should be of such material as will bear the crush of a crowded store without injury and neither lace or delicate fabrics should ever be worn A dress of merino in winter with a cloth cloak and plain velvet or silk bonnet is the most suitable In summer a dress and cloak of plain mode colored Lavella cloth or any other cool but strong fabric with a simply trimmed straw bonnet is the best dress for a shopping excursion STORM DRESSES A lady who is obliged to go out frequently in bad weather will find it both a convenience and economy to have a storm dress Both dress and cloak should be made of a woolen material varying of course with the season which will shed water White skirts are entirely out of place as if the dress is held up they will be in a few moments disgracefully dirty A woolen skirt made quite short to clear the muddy streets is the proper thing Stout thick soled boots and gloves of either silk beaver cloth or lisle thread are the most suitable The bonnet should be either of straw or felt simply trimmed and above all carry a large umbrella The little light umbrellas are very pretty no doubt but to be of any real protection in a storm the umbrella should be large enough to protect the whole dress MARKETING Here a dress of the most inexpensive kind is the best There is no surer mark of vulgarity than a costly dress in the market A chintz is the best skirt to wear and in winter a dark chintz skirt put on over a delaine dress will protect it from baskets and the unavoidable soils contracted in a market while it looks perfectly well and can be washed if required TRAVELING Traveling dresses should be made always of some quiet color perfectly plain with a deep mantle or cloak of the same material When traveling with a young babe a dress of material that will wash is the best but it should be dark and plain A conspicuous traveling dress is in very bad taste and jewelry or ornaments of any kind are entirely out of place Let the dress be made of dark plain material with a simple straw or felt bonnet trimmed with the same color as the dress and a thick barege veil An elastic string run through a tuck made in the middle of the veil will allow one half to fall over the face while the other half falls back covering the bonnet and protecting it from dust If white collars and sleeves are worn they should be of linen perfectly plain Strong boots and thick gloves are indispensable in traveling and a heavy shawl should be carried to meet any sudden change in the weather Corsets and petticoats of dark linen are more suitable than white ones as there is so much unavoidable dust and mud constantly meeting a traveler EVENING DRESSES Must be governed by the number of guests you may expect to meet and the character of the entertainment to which you are invited For small social companies a dark silk in winter and a pretty lawn barege or white muslin in summer are the most appropriate A light head dress of ribbon or velvet or a plain cap are the most suitable with this dress For a larger party low necked short sleeved silk light colored or any of the thin goods made expressly for evening wear with kid gloves either of a color to match the dress or of white black lace mittens are admissible and flowers in the hair A ball dress should be made of either very dressy silk or light thin material made over silk It should be trimmed with lace flowers or ribbon and made dressy The coiffure should be elaborate and match the dress being either of ribbon feather or flowers White kid gloves trimmed to match the dress and white or black satin slippers with silk stockings must be worn MOURNING There is such a variety of opinion upon the subject of mourning that it is extremely difficult to lay down any general rules upon the subject Some wear very close black for a long period for a distant relative whilst others will wear dressy mourning for a short time in a case of death in the immediate family There is no rule either for the depth of mourning or the time when it may be laid aside and I must confine my remarks to the different degrees of mourning For deep mourning the dress should be of bombazine Parramatta cloth delaine barege or merino made up over black lining The only appropriate trimming is a deep fold either of the same material or of crape The shawl or cloak must be of plain black without border or trimming unless a fold of crape be put on the cloak the bonnet should be of crape made perfectly plain with crape facings unless the widow s cap be worn and a deep crape veil should be thrown over both face and bonnet Black crape collar and sleeves and black boots and gloves The next degree is to wear white collar and sleeves a bow of crape upon the bonnet and plain white lace facings leaving off the crape veil and substituting one of plain black net A little later black silk without any gloss trimmed with crape may be worn and delaine or bombazine with a trimming of broad plain ribbon or a bias fold of silk The next stage admits a silk bonnet trimmed with crape and lead color dark purple or white figures on the dress From this the mourning passes into second mourning Here a straw bonnet trimmed with black ribbon or crape flowers or a silk bonnet with black flowers on the outside and white ones in the face a black silk dress and gray shawl or cloak may be worn Lead color purple lavender and white are all admissible in second mourning and the dress may be lightened gradually a white bonnet shawl and light purple or lavender dress being the dress usually worn last before the mourning is thrown aside entirely and colors resumed It is especially to be recommended to buy always the best materials when making up mourning Crape and woolen goods of the finest quality are very expensive but a cheaper article will wear miserably there is no greater error in economy than purchasing cheap mourning for no goods are so inferior or wear out and grow rusty so soon CHAPTER III TRAVELING There is no situation in which a lady is more exposed than when she travels and there is no position where a dignified lady like deportment is more indispensable and more certain to command respect If you travel under the escort of a gentleman give him as little trouble as possible at the same time do not interfere with the arrangements he may make for your comfort It is best when starting upon your journey to hand your escort a sufficient sum of money to cover all your expenses retaining your pocket book in case you should wish to use it Have a strong pocket made in your upper petticoat and in that carry your money only reserving in your dress pocket a small sum for incidental expenses In your traveling satchel carry an oil skin bag containing your sponge tooth and nail brushes and some soap have also a calico bag with hair brush and comb some pins hair pins a small mirror and some towels In this satchel carry also some crackers or sandwiches if you will be long enough upon the road to need a luncheon In your carpet bag carry a large shawl and if you will travel by night or stop where it will be inconvenient to open your trunks carry your night clothes and what clean linen you may require in the carpet bag It is best to have your name and address engraved upon the plate of your carpet bag and to sew a white card with your name and the address to which you are traveling in clear plain letters upon it If you carry a novel or any other reading it is best to carry the book in your satchel and not open the carpet bag until you are ready for the night If you are to pass the night in the cars carry a warm woolen or silk hood that you may take off your bonnet at night No one can sleep comfortably in a bonnet Carry also in this case a large shawl to wrap round your feet One rule to be always observed in traveling is punctuality Rise early enough to have ample time for arranging everything needful for the day s journey If you sleep upon the boat or at a hotel always give directions to the servant to waken you at an hour sufficiently early to allow ample time for preparation It is better to be all ready twenty minutes too soon than five minutes late or even late enough to be annoyed and heated by hurrying at the last moment A lady will always dress plainly when traveling A gay dress or finery of any sort when in a boat stage or car lays a woman open to the most severe misconstruction Wear always neutral tints and have the material made up plainly and substantially but avoid carefully any article of dress that is glaring or conspicuous Above all never wear jewelry unless it be your watch or flowers they are both in excessively bad taste A quiet unpretending dress and dignified demeanor will insure for a lady respect though she travel alone from Maine to Florida If you are obliged to pass the night upon a steamboat secure if possible a stateroom You will find the luxury of being alone able to retire and rise without witnesses fully compensates for the extra charge Before you retire find out the position and number of the stateroom occupied by your escort in case you wish to find him during the night In times of terror from accident or danger such care will be found invaluable You may not be able to obtain a stateroom upon all occasions when traveling and must then sleep in the ladies cabin It is best in this case to take off the dress only merely loosening the stays and skirts and unless you are sick you may sit up to read until quite a late hour Never allow your escort to accompany you into the cabin The saloon is open always to both ladies and gentlemen and the cabin is for ladies alone Many ladies are sufficiently ill bred to ask a husband or brother into the cabin and keep him there talking for an hour or two totally overlooking the fact that by so doing she may be keeping others suffering perhaps with sickness from removing their dresses to lie down Such conduct is not only excessively ill bred but intensely selfish There is scarcely any situation in which a lady can be placed more admirably adapted to test her good breeding than in the sleeping cabin of a steam boat If you are so unfortunate as to suffer from sea sickness your chances for usefulness are limited and patient suffering your only resource In this case never leave home without a straw covered bottle of brandy and another of camphor in your carpet bag If you are not sick be very careful not to keep the chambermaid from those who are suffering should you require her services dismiss her as soon as possible As acquaintances formed during a journey are not recognized afterwards unless mutually agreeable do not refuse either a pleasant word or any little offer of service from your companions and on the other hand be ready to aid them if in your power In every case selfishness is the root of all ill breeding and it is never more conspicuously displayed than in traveling A courteous manner and graceful offer of service are valued highly when offered and the giver loses nothing by her civility When in the car if you find the exertion of talking painful say so frankly your escort cannot be offended Do not continually pester either your companion or the conductor with questions such as Where are we now When shall we arrive If you are wearied this impatience will only make the journey still more tedious Try to occupy yourself with looking at the country through which you are passing or with a book If you are traveling without any escort speak to the conductor before you start requesting him to attend to you whilst in the car or boat under his control Sit quietly in the cars when they reach the depot until the first bustle is over and then engage a porter to procure for you a hack and get your baggage If upon a boat let one of the servants perform this office being careful to fee him for it Make an engagement with the hackman to take you only in his hack and enquire his charge before starting In this way you avoid unpleasant company during your drive and overcharge at the end of it If you expect a friend to meet you at the end of your journey sit near the door of the steam boat saloon or in the ladies room at the car depot that he may find you easily There are many little civilities which a true gentleman will offer to a lady traveling alone which she may accept even from an entire stranger with perfect propriety but while careful to thank him courteously whether you accept or decline his attentions avoid any advance towards acquaintanceship If he sits near you and seems disposed to be impertinent or obtrusive in his attentions or conversation lower your veil and turn from him either looking from the window or reading A dignified modest reserve is the surest way to repel impertinence If you find yourself during your journey in any awkward or embarrassing situation you may without impropriety request the assistance of a gentleman even a stranger and he will probably perform the service requested receive your thanks and then relieve you of his presence Never upon any account or under any provocation return rudeness by rudeness Nothing will rebuke incivility in another so surely as perfect courtesy in your own manner Many will be shamed into apology who would annoy you for hours if you encouraged them by acts of rudeness on your own part In traveling alone choose if possible a seat next to another lady or near an elderly gentleman If your neighbor seems disposed to shorten the time by conversing do not be too hasty in checking him Such acquaintances end with the journey and a lady can always so deport herself that she may beguile the time pleasantly without in the least compromising her dignity Any slight attention or an apology made for crushing or incommoding you is best acknowledged by a courteous bow in silence CHAPTER IV HOW TO BEHAVE AT A HOTEL In America where the mania for traveling extends through all classes from the highest to the lowest a few hints upon deportment at a hotel will not be amiss and these hints are especially addressed to ladies traveling alone When you arrive at the hotel enquire at once for the proprietor Tell him your name and address and ask him to conduct you to a good room naming the length of time you purpose occupying it You may also request him to wait upon you to the table and allot you a seat As the hours for meals at a large hotel are very numerous it is best to mention the time when you wish to breakfast dine or sup If you stay more than one day at the hotel do not tax the proprietor with the duty of escorting you to the table more than once Request one of the waiters always to meet you as you enter and wait upon you to your seat This saves the embarrassment of crossing the room entirely unattended while it shows others that you are a resident at the house The waiter will then take your order for the dishes you wish Give this order in a low tone and do not harass the man by contradicting yourself several times decide what you want before you ask for it and then give your order quietly but distinctly Use always the butter knife salt spoon and sugar tongs though you may be entirely alone in the use of them The attention to the small details of table etiquette is one of the surest marks of good breeding If any trifling civility is offered by the gentleman beside you or opposite to you thank him civilly if you either accept or decline it Thank the waiter for any extra attention he may offer Remember that a lady like deportment is always modest and quiet If you meet a friend at table and converse let it be in a tone of voice sufficiently loud for him to hear but not loud enough to reach ears for which the remarks are not intended A boisterous loud voice loud laughter and bold deportment at a hotel are sure signs of vulgar breeding When you have finished your meal cross the room quietly if you go into the parlor do not attract attention by a hasty entrance or forward manner but take the seat you may select quietly The acquaintances made in a hotel may be dropped afterwards if desirable without rudeness and a pleasant greeting to other ladies whom you may recognize from meeting them in the entries or at table is courteous and well bred be careful however not to force attentions where you see they are not agreeably received A lady s dress when alone at a hotel should be of the most modest kind At breakfast let her wear a close morning dress and never even at supper appear alone at the table with bare arms or neck If she comes in late from the opera or a party in full dress she should not come into the supper room unless her escort accompanies her A traveling or walking dress can be worn with perfect propriety at any meal at a hotel as it is usually travelers who are the guests at the table After breakfast pass an hour or two in the parlor unless you are going out whilst the chambermaid puts your room in order You should before leaving the room lock your trunk and be careful not to leave money or trinkets lying about When you go out lock your door and give the key to the servant to hand to the clerk of the office who will give it to you when you return You may do this even if you leave the room in disorder as the chambermaids all carry duplicate keys and can easily enter your room in your absence to arrange it The door should not be left open as dishonest persons passing along the entry could enter without fear of being questioned If you see that another lady though she may be an entire stranger is losing her collar or needs attention called to any disorder in her dress speak to her in a low tone and offer to assist her in remedying the difficulty Be careful always in opening a door or raising a window in a public parlor that you are not incommoding any one else Never sit down to the piano uninvited unless you are alone in the parlor Do not take any book you may find in the room away from it It is best always to carry writing materials with you but if this is not convenient you can always obtain them at the office In a strange city it is best to provide yourself with a small map and guide book that you may be able to find your way from the hotel to any given point without troubling any one for directions If you wish for a carriage ring and let the waiter order one for you When leaving a hotel if you have been there for several days give the waiter at table and the chambermaid a fee as your unprotected situation will probably call for many services out of their regular routine of duties On leaving ring order your bill pay it state the time at which you wish to leave and the train you will take to leave the city Request a man to be sent to carry your baggage to the hack and if you require your next meal at an unusual hour to be ready for your journey order it then CHAPTER V EVENING PARTIES ETIQUETTE FOR THE HOSTESS The most fashionable as well as pleasant way in the present day to entertain guests is to invite them to evening parties which vary in size from the company sociable soiree to the party par excellence which is but one step from the ball The entertainment upon such occasions may vary with the taste of the hostess or the caprice of her guests Some prefer dancing some music some conversation Small parties called together for dramatic or poetical readings are now fashionable and very delightful In writing an invitation for a small party it is kind as well as polite to specify the number of guests invited that your friends may dress to suit the occasion To be either too much or too little dressed at such times is embarrassing For large parties the usual formula is Miss S s compliments to Miss G and requests the pleasure of her company for Wednesday March eighth at eight o clock Such an invitation addressed either to an intimate friend or mere acquaintance will signify full dress If your party is a musical soiree or your friends meet for reading or conversation alone say so in your invitation as Miss S requests the pleasure of Miss G s company on Thursday evening next at eight o clock to meet the members of the musical club to which Miss S belongs or Miss S expects a few friends on Monday evening next at eight o clock to take part in some dramatic readings and would be happy to have Miss G join the party Always date your note of invitation and put your address in one corner Having dispatched these notes the next step is to prepare to receive your guests If the number invited is large and you hire waiters give them notice several days beforehand and engage them to come in the morning Give them full directions for the supper appoint one to open the door another to show the guests to the dressing rooms and a third to wait in the gentlemen s dressing room to attend to them if their services are required If you use your own plate glass and china show the waiters where to find them as well as the table cloths napkins and other things they may require If you hire the service from the confectioner s or restaurateur s where you order your supper you have only to show your waiters where to spread supper and tell them the hour You will have to place at least four rooms at the disposal of your guests the supper room and two dressing rooms beside the drawing room In the morning see that the fires in your rooms are in good order and in the drawing room it is best to have it so arranged that the heat can be lessened towards evening as the crowd and dancing will make it excessively uncomfortable if the rooms are too warm See that the lights are in good order and if you propose to have music instead of dancing or to use your piano for dancing music have it put in good tune in the morning If you intend to dance and do not wish to take up the carpets you will find it economical as well as much pleasanter to cover them with coarse white muslin or linen be sure it is fastened down smoothly firmly and drawn tightly over the carpets Do not remove all the chairs from the parlor or if this is necessary leave some in the hall for those who wish to rest after dancing In the dining room unless it will accommodate all your guests at once have a silk cord so fastened that when the room is full it can be drawn across the door way those following the guests already in the room will then return to the parlor and wait their turn A still better way is to set the supper table twice inviting the married and elderly people to go into the first table and then after it is ready for the second time let the young folks go up Two dressing rooms must be ready one for the ladies and the other for the gentlemen Have both these rooms comfortably heated and well lighted Nothing can be more disagreeable than cold ill lighted rooms to dress in particularly if your guests come in half frozen by the cold of a winter s night or still worse damp from a stormy one Be sure that there is plenty of water soap and towels on the washstand two or three brushes and combs on the bureau two mirrors one large and one small and a pin cushion well filled with large and small pins In the ladies room have one or if your party is large two women to wait upon your guests to remove their cloaks overshoes and hoods and assist them in smoothing their dresses or hair After each guest removes her shawl and hood let one of the maids roll all the things she lays aside into a bundle and put it where she can easily find it It is an admirable plan and prevents much confusion to pin to each bundle a card or strip of paper previously prepared with the name of the person to whom it belongs written clearly and distinctly upon it Upon the bureau in the ladies room have a supply of hair pins and a workbox furnished with everything requisite to repair any accident that may happen to the dress of a guest It is well also to have Eau de Cologne hartshorn and salts in case of sudden faintness In the gentlemen s room place a clothes brush and boot jack It is best to send out your invitations by your own servant or one hired for that purpose especially It is ill bred to send invitations either by the dispatch or through the post office and besides being discourteous you risk offending your friends as these modes of delivery are proverbially uncertain Be dressed and ready to receive your guests in good season as some in their desire to be punctual may come before the time appointed It is better to be ready too soon than too late as your guests will feel painfully embarrassed if you are not ready to receive them For the early part of the evening take a position in your parlor near or opposite to the door that each guest may find you easily It is not necessary to remain all the evening nailed to this one spot but stay near it until your guests have all or nearly all assembled Late comers will of course expect to find you entertaining your guests As each guest or party enter the room advance a few steps to meet them speaking first to the lady or if there are several ladies to the eldest then to the younger ones and finally to the gentlemen If the new comers are acquainted with those already in the room they will leave you after a few words of greeting to join their friends but if they are strangers to the city or making their first visit to your house introduce them to a friend who is well acquainted in your circle who will entertain them till you can again join them and introduce them to others Do not leave the room during the evening To see a hostess fidgeting constantly going in and out argues ill for her tact in arranging the house for company With well trained waiters you need give yourself no uneasiness about the arrangements outside of the parlors The perfection of good breeding in a hostess is perfect ease of manner for the time she should appear to have no thought or care beyond the pleasure of her guests Have a waiter in the hall to open the front door and another at the head of the first flight of stairs to point out to the ladies and gentlemen their respective dressing rooms Never try to outshine your guests in dress It is vulgar in the extreme A hostess should be dressed as simply as is consistent with the occasion wearing if she will the richest fabrics exquisitely made but avoiding any display of jewels or gay colors such as will be probably more conspicuous than those worn by her guests Remember from the moment your first guest enters the parlor you must forget yourself entirely to make the evening pleasant for others Your duties will call you from one group to another and require constant watchfulness that no one guest is slighted Be careful that none of the company are left to mope alone from being unacquainted with other guests Introduce gentlemen to ladies and gentlemen to gentlemen ladies to ladies It requires much skill and tact to make a party for conversation only go off pleasantly You must invite only such guests as will mutually please and you must be careful about introductions If you have a literary lion upon your list it is well to invite other lions to meet him or her that the attention may not be constantly concentrated upon one person Where you see a couple conversing slowly and wearily stir them up with a few sprightly words and introduce a new person either to make a trio or as a substitute in the duet carrying off the other one of the couple to find a more congenial companion elsewhere Never interrupt an earnest or apparently interesting conversation Neither party will thank you even if you propose the most delightful substitute If your party meet for reading have a table with the books in the centre of the apartment that will divide the room those reading being on one side the listeners on the other Be careful here not to endeavor to shine above your guests leaving to them the most prominent places and taking cheerfully a subordinate place On the other hand if you are urged to display any talent you may possess in this way remember your only desire is to please your guests and if they are really desirous to listen to you comply gracefully and promptly with their wishes If you have dancing and have not engaged a band it is best to hire a pianist for the evening to play dancing music You will find it exceedingly wearisome to play yourself all the evening and it is ill bred to ask any guest to play for others to dance This victimizing of some obliging guest is only too common but no true lady will ever be guilty of such rudeness If there are several members of the family able and willing to play let them divide this duty amongst them or if you wish to play yourself do so If any guest in this case offers to relieve you accept their kindness for one dance only Young people who enjoy dancing but who also play well will often stay on the piano stool all the evening because their own good nature will not allow them to complain and their hostess wilfully or through negligence permits the tax See that your guests are well provided with partners introducing every gentleman and lady who dances to one who will dance well with them Be careful that none sit still through your negligence in providing partners Do not dance yourself when by so doing you are preventing a guest from enjoying that pleasure If a lady is wanted to make up a set then dance or if late in the evening you have but few lady dancers left but do not interfere with the pleasure in others If invited say that you do not wish to take the place of a guest upon the floor and introduce the gentleman who invites you to some lady friend who dances It is very pleasant in a dancing party to have ices alone handed round at about ten o clock having supper set two or three hours later They are very refreshing when it would be too early to have the more substantial supper announced It is very customary now even in large parties to have no refreshments but ice cream lemonade and cake or in summer fruit cake and ices It is less troublesome as well as less expensive than a hot supper and the custom will be a good one to adopt permanently One word of warning to all hostesses You can never know when you place wine or brandy before your guests whom you may be tempting to utter ruin Better far better to have a reputation as strict or mean than by your example or the temptation you offer to have the sin upon your soul of having put poison before those who partook of your hospitality It is not necessary hospitality and generosity do not require it and you will have the approval of all who truly love you for your good qualities if you resolutely refuse to have either wine or any other intoxicating liquor upon your supper table If the evening of your party is stormy let a waiter stand in the vestibule with a large umbrella to meet the ladies at the carriage door and protect them whilst crossing the pavement and steps When your guests take leave of you it will be in the drawing room and let that farewell be final Do not accompany them to the dressing room and never stop them in the hall for a last word Many ladies do not like to display their sortie du soiree before a crowded room and you will be keeping their escort waiting Say farewell in the parlor and do not repeat it If your party is mixed that is conversation dancing and music are all mingled remember it is your place to invite a guest to sing or play and be careful not to offend any amateur performers by forgetting to invite them to favor the company If they decline never urge the matter If the refusal proceeds from unwillingness or inability on that occasion it is rude to insist and if they refuse for the sake of being urged they will be justly punished by a disappointment If you have guests who performing badly will expect an invitation to play sacrifice their desire to the good of the others pass them by It is torture to listen to bad music Do not ask a guest to sing or play more than once This is her fair share and you have no right to tax her too severely to entertain your other guests If however the performance is so pleasing that others ask for a repetition then you too may request it thanking the performer for the pleasure given CHAPTER VI EVENING PARTIES ETIQUETTE FOR THE GUEST Upon receiving an invitation for an evening party answer it immediately that your hostess may know for how many guests she must provide If after accepting an invitation any unforeseen event prevents your keeping the engagement write a second note containing your regrets The usual form is Miss G accepts with pleasure Miss S s polite invitation for Monday next or Miss G regrets that a prior engagement will prevent her accepting Miss S s kind invitation for Monday evening Punctuality is a mark of politeness if your invitation states the hour at which your hostess will be ready to welcome you Do not be more than half an hour later than the time named but if unavoidably detained make no apology when you meet your hostess it will be in bad taste to speak of your want of punctuality When you arrive at your friend s house do not stop to speak to any one in the hall or upon the stairs but go immediately to the dressing room The gentleman who accompanies you will go to the door of the lady s room leave you to remove his own hat and over coat and then return to the door to wait for you In the dressing room do not push forward to the mirror if you see that others are before you there Wait for your turn then perform the needful arrangements of your toilette quickly and re join your escort as soon as possible If you meet friends in the lady s room do not stop there to chat you keep your escort waiting and your friends will join you in the parlor a few moments later Avoid all confidential communications or private remarks in the dressing room You may be overheard and give pain or cause annoyance by your untimely conversation When you enter the parlor go immediately to your hostess and speak to her if the gentleman attending you is a stranger to the lady of the house introduce him and then join the other guests as by delaying to converse too long with your hostess you may prevent her speaking to others who have arrived later than yourself If you have no escort you may with perfect propriety send for the master of the house to wait upon you from the dressing room to the parlor and as soon as you have spoken to the hostess thank your host and release him as the same attention may be required by others Again when alone if you meet a friend in the dressing room you may ask the privilege of entering the parlor with her and her escort or if she also is alone there is no impropriety in two ladies going into the room unattended by a gentleman While you maintain a cheerful deportment avoid loud talking and laughing and still more carefully avoid any action or gesture that may attract attention and make you conspicuous When dressing for a party while you show that you honor the occasion by a tasteful dress avoid glaring colors or any conspicuous ornament or style of costume Avoid long tete a tete conversations they are in bad taste and to hold confidential communication especially with gentlemen is still worse Do not make any display of affection for even your dearest friend kissing in public or embracing are in bad taste Walking with arms encircling waists or such demonstrative tokens of love are marks of low breeding Avoid crossing the room alone and never run even if you feel embarrassed and wish to cross quickly If you are a musician and certain that you will confer pleasure by a display of your talents do not make a show of reluctance when invited to play or sing Comply gracefully and after one piece leave the instrument Be careful to avoid the appearance of wishing to be invited and above all never hint that this would be agreeable If your hostess has requested you to bring your notes and you are dependent upon them bring them and quietly place them on the music stand or still better send them in the afternoon It is a better plan if you are called upon frequently to contribute in this way to the evening s amusement to learn a few pieces so as to play them perfectly well without notes Never attempt any piece before company unless you are certain that you can play it without mistake or hesitation When you have finished your song or piece rise instantly from the piano stool as your hostess may wish to invite another guest to take the place If you have a reason for declining to play do so decidedly when first invited and do not change your decision If your hostess or any of the family play for the guests to dance it is both polite and kind to offer to relieve them and if truly polite themselves they will not take advantage of the offer to over tax your good nature When others are playing or singing listen quietly and attentively to laugh or talk loudly when there is music in the room is rude both toward the performer and your hostess If you are conversing at the time the music begins and you find that your companion is not disposed to listen to the performer at the harp or piano converse in a low tone and take a position at some distance from the instrument If the rooms are not large enough for all the guests to dance at one time do not dance every set even if invited It is ill bred and selfish When you go up to supper do not accept anything from any gentleman but the one who has escorted you from the parlor If others offer you as they probably will any refreshment say that mister naming your escort has gone to get you what you desire He has a right to be offended if after telling him what you wish for he returns to find you already supplied It is quite as rude to offer what he brings to another lady Her escort is probably on the same errand from which yours has just returned It may seem trivial and childish to warn a lady against putting cakes or bon bons in her pocket at supper yet it is often done by those who would deeply resent the accusation of rudeness or meanness It is not only ill bred but it gives rise if seen to suspicions that you are so little accustomed to society or so starved at home that you are ignorant of the forms of etiquette or are forced to the theft by positive hunger If you are obliged to leave the company at an earlier hour than the other guests say so to your hostess in a low tone when you have an opportunity and then stay a short time in the room and slip out unperceived By a formal leave taking you may lead others to suppose the hour later than it is in reality and thus deprive your hostess of other guests who but for your example would have remained longer French leave is preferable to a formal leave taking upon such occasions If you remain until the usual hour for breaking up go to your hostess before you leave the room express the pleasure you have enjoyed and bid her farewell Within the next week you should call upon your hostess if it is the first party you have attended at her house If she is an intimate friend the call should be made within a fortnight

8112-281876-0024	train-other-500	Be careful that she has a hot breakfast ready when she does rise and take a seat at the table to wait upon her After the chambermaid has arranged the guest chamber in the morning

8112-281876-0027	train-other-500	you will entirely destroy the pleasantest part of your guest s visit by reminding her that she is not at home and must not take liberties even in her own room It looks too
8112-281876-0028	train-other-500	as if you were afraid to trust her and thought she would injure the furniture If you have children forbid them to enter the room your friend occupies unless she invites them to do so
8112-281876-0029	train-other-500	or they are sent there with a message If your household duties will occupy your time for some hours in the morning introduce your guest to the piano book case or picture folio
8112-281876-0030	train-other-500	and place all at her service When your duties are finished either join her in her own room or invite her to sit with you and work chatting meanwhile together
8112-281876-0031	train-other-500	If you keep your own carriage place it at her disposal as soon as she arrives If she is a stranger in the city accompany her to the points of interest she may wish to visit
8112-281876-0032	train-other-500	and also offer to show her where to find the best goods should she wish to do any shopping Enquire of your visitor if there is any particular habit she may wish to indulge in
8112-281876-0033	train-other-500	such as rising late retiring early lying down in the daytime or any other habit that your family do not usually follow If there is

8112-281876-0034	train-other-500	If there is any dish which is distasteful to her avoid placing it upon the table during her visit and if she mentions in conversation any favorite dish
8112-281876-0035	train-other-500	have it frequently placed before her If she is accustomed to eat just before retiring and your family do not take supper see that something is sent to her room every night
8112-281876-0036	train-other-500	If your friend has intimate friends in the same city beside yourself it is an act of kindly courtesy to invite them to dinner tea or to pass a day
8112-281876-0037	train-other-500	and when calls are made and you see that it would be pleasant invite the caller to remain to dinner or tea Never accept any invitation either to a party
8112-281876-0038	train-other-500	ball or public entertainment that does not include your guest In answering the invitation give that as your reason for declining
8112-281876-0039	train-other-500	when another note will be sent enclosing an invitation for her If the invitation is from an intimate friend say in answering it that your guest is with you and that she will accompany you
8112-281876-0040	train-other-500	It is a mistaken idea to suppose that hospitality and courtesy require constant attention to a guest There are times when she may prefer to be alone
8112-281876-0041	train-other-500	either to write letters to read or practice Some ladies follow a guest from one room to another never leaving them alone for a single instant
8112-281876-0042	train-other-500	when they would enjoy an hour or two in the library or at the piano but do not like to say so The best rule is to make your guest feel that she is heartily welcome
8112-281876-0043	train-other-500	and perfectly at home When she is ready to leave you see that her trunks are strapped in time by the servants have a carriage ready to take her to the station
8112-281876-0044	train-other-500	have the breakfast or dinner at an hour that will suit her prepare a luncheon for her to carry and let some gentleman in the family escort her to the wharf
8112-281876-0045	train-other-500	check her trunks and procure her tickets If your guest is in mourning decline any invitations to parties or places of amusement whilst she is with you
none	none	 Show her by such little attentions that you sympathize in her recent affliction and that the pleasure of her society and the love you bear her make such sacrifices of gayety trifling compared with the sweet duty of comforting her CHAPTER VIII VISITING ETIQUETTE FOR THE GUEST As a first rule with regard to paying a visit the best one is never to accept a general invitation Instances are very common where women I cannot say ladies have upon a slight acquaintance and a When you are in C I should be very happy to have you visit me actually gone to C from their own home and with bag and baggage quartered themselves upon the hospitality of their newly made friend for weeks at a time Even where there is a long standing friendship it is not well to visit uninvited It is impossible for you in another city to know exactly when it will be convenient for your friend to have you visit her unless she tells you and that will of course be a special invitation If your friends are really desirous to have you pay them a visit they will name a time when it will be convenient and agreeable to have you come and you may accept the invitation with the certainty that you will not incommode them Self proposed visits are still worse You in a manner force an invitation from your friend when you tell her that you can come at a certain time unless you have previously arranged to let her know when you can be her guest In that case your own time is understood to be the most agreeable for her If whilst traveling you pass through a town where you have friends whom you wish to visit and who would be hurt if you omitted to do so go first to a hotel and either call or send word that you are there Then it is optional with them to extend their hospitality or not Do not be offended if it is not done The love for you may be undiminished and the desire to entertain you very great yet family reasons may render such an invitation as you expect impossible Your friend may have engagements or duties at the time that would prevent her making the visit pleasant for you and wish to postpone the invitation until she can entertain you as she wishes To drive trunks and all in such a case to your friend s house without a word of warning is unkind as well as ill bred You force her to invite you to stay when it may be inconvenient and even if she is really glad to see you and wishes you to make a prolonged visit you may feel certain she would have preferred to know you were coming If she really loves you her natural desire would be to have everything ready to give you a comfortable reception and not have to leave you perhaps with your traveling costume on for an hour or two while she prepares a room for you It is not enough to say at such a time Don t mind me or Treat me as one of the family However much her politeness or love may conceal annoyance be sure in her secret heart she does mind you and remember you are not one of her private family To take the liberty of going to the house of a mere acquaintance for a night or two while traveling without invitation is making a convenience of them and wears the appearance of wishing to save the customary hotel bill so while it is extremely ill bred and impertinent it is also excessively mean In case of relationship or long intimate friendship an unexpected visit may be pardoned and give pleasure but it is better to avoid it as the pleasure will surely be increased if your relative or friend has time to prepare for your reception as her love will prompt and arrange her duties and engagements to really enjoy your company When you receive an invitation by letter to visit a friend answer it immediately thanking her for her proffered hospitality and say decidedly then whether you can accept or decline If you accept the invitation state in your letter by what train and at what hour you will arrive that she may meet you and let nothing but positive necessity keep you from being punctually at the time and place appointed To linger by the way for mere pleasure and make her come several times to meet you is unkind as well as ill bred If you are unavoidably detained write to her state the reason that will prevent your keeping the appointment and name another time when you can come It is well in answering a letter of invitation to state the limits of your visit and then to keep them If she is unwilling to let you go and you are tempted to stay that very fact promises well for the pleasure of a second visit It is better to leave while all will regret you than to linger on until you have worn out your welcome Inquire as soon as possible after your arrival what are the regular habits of the family the hours for rising for meals and for retiring and then be punctual in your attendance Many ladies are very ceremonious about waiting for a guest and by delay in your room or inattention to the time when you are out you will keep the whole family waiting If you do not wake early enough for the usual breakfast hour request the chambermaid to knock at your door in time for you to be ready to go down with the family Before you leave your room in the morning take the clothes off your bed throw the upper bed over the foot board and then open all the windows unless it storms that room and bed may be thoroughly aired before you sit there again After breakfast ask your hostess if you can be of any assistance to her in the household duties If she declines your services do not follow her from room to room whilst she is thus engaged but take your work books or music to the sitting room or parlor until your own room is ready for you By thus proving that you can occupy yourself pleasantly while she is away you make it less annoying to her to feel the obligation to leave you As soon as you see that she is ready to sew and chat leave your book or if in your own room come to the sitting room where she is and work with her It is polite and kind if you see that she has a large supply of family sewing to offer to assist her but if she positively declines your aid then have some work of your own on hand that you may sew with her Many pleasant mornings may be spent while visiting by one lady reading aloud whilst the other sews alternating the work It is a pretty compliment to repay the hospitality of your hostess by working whilst with her upon some piece of fancy work a chair cover sofa cushion or pair of ottomans presenting them to her when finished as a keepsake They will be duly appreciated and remind her constantly of the pleasures of your visit If you pass the morning out of the house remember your time is hers and have no engagement to interfere with the plans she has laid for entertaining you Observe this rule during your whole visit and do not act independent of her plans By constantly forming engagements without her knowledge going out without her or staying in when she has made some excursion or party for your pleasure you insult her by intimating that her house is no more to you than a hotel to sleep and eat in while your pleasures lie elsewhere After dinner retire for an hour to your own room that your hostess may lie down if she is accustomed to do so If the hours kept are later than you have been accustomed to or if the gayety of the family keeps you out at party or opera it is best to sleep after dinner even if you do not always do it To give signs of weariness in the evening will be excessively rude implying want of enjoyment and making your hostess feel hurt and annoyed If you have shopping to do find out where the best stores are and then go to them alone unless your hostess will accompany you upon similar business of her own Do not tax her good nature to go merely for the sake of aiding you as guide If one of the children in the family is familiar with the stores and streets ask her to accompany you and be careful to acknowledge the kindness by buying something especially for the child whilst she is out with you if it is only some cakes or bonbons Choose an hour when you are certain your hostess has made no other engagement for you or while she is busy in her domestic duties for these shopping excursions Offer when you are going to attend to any shopping she may want and ask if there is any commission you can execute for her while you are out While on a visit to one friend do not accept too many invitations from others and avoid spending too much time in paying calls where your hostess is not acquainted You owe the greater portion of your time and society to the lady whose hospitality you are accepting and it is best to decline invitations from other houses unless they inclose one for your hostess also Avoid paying any visits in a family not upon good terms with your hostess If such a family are very dear friends of your own or you can claim an acquaintance pleasant upon both sides with them write and state candidly the reason why you cannot visit them and they will appreciate your delicacy If while on a visit to one friend you receive an invitation to spend some time with another friend in the same place accept it for the period which you have named as the termination of your first visit You insult your hostess by shortening your visit to her to accept another invitation and quite as much of an insult is it to take the time from the first visit to go to pay another and then return to your first hostess unless such an arrangement has been made immediately upon your arrival Never invite any friend who may call upon you to stay to dinner or tea you will be taking a most unwarrantable liberty in so doing This is the right of your hostess and if by her silence she tacitly declines extending this courtesy you will be guilty of impertinence in usurping her privilege Never take any one who calls upon you into any room but the parlor unless invited to do so by your hostess You have of course the entree of other rooms but you have no right to extend this privilege to others If you have many gentlemen visiters check too frequent calls and make no appointments with them If they show you any such attention as to offer to drive you to places of interest or visit with you picture galleries or public places always consult your hostess before accepting such civilities and decline them if she has made other engagements for you If you receive an invitation to visit any place of public amusement decline it unless one of the family with whom you are staying is also invited In that case you may accept If the gentleman who invites you is a stranger to the family introduce him to your hostess or mention her name in conversation He will then if he really desires you to accept his proffered attention include her in the invitation When visiting in a family where the members are in mourning decline all invitations to parties or places of public amusement It is an insult to them to leave them to join in pleasure from which their recent affliction excludes them Your visit at such a time will be prompted by sympathy in their trouble and for the time it is thoughtful and delicate to make their sorrows yours If sudden sickness or family trouble come to your friend whilst you are with her unless you can really be useful shorten your visit In time of trouble families generally like to be alone all in all to each other and a visitor is felt a constant restraint If death comes while you are with your friend endeavor to take from her as much of the care as you can a really sympathizing friend is an inexpressible comfort at such a time as the trying details which must be taken in charge by some one will be less trying to her than to a member of the family Do the necessary shopping for your friend and relieve her of as much family care as you can Let her feel that you are really glad that you are near her in her affliction and repay the hospitality she offered in her season of joy by showing her that her sorrow makes her still more dear and that while you can enjoy the gayety of her house you will not flee from its mourning When your presence can be of no further service then leave her Put out your washing and ironing when on a visit It is annoying and ill bred to throw your soiled clothes into the family wash Take with you from home all the writing and sewing materials you may require while paying your visit It is annoying to be constantly requested by a visitor to lend her scissors pins needles or paper no lady should be without her own portfolio and work box Be very careful not to injure any article of furniture in your sleeping apartment and if unfortunately anything suffers from your carelessness have the accident repaired or the article replaced at your own expense When your visit is over give a present to each of the servants varying its value according to the length of your visit or the services you may have required You will add to the pleasure by presenting such gifts yourself with a few pleasant words Never compare the house you may be visiting with your own or any other you may visit Avoid also speaking of any house where you may have been a guest in terms of overpraise giving glowing pictures of its splendor Your hostess may imagine you are drawing comparisons unfavorable to your present residence Also avoid speaking unfavorably of any former visit as your hostess will naturally conclude that her turn for censure will come as soon as your visit is over If any family secret comes to your knowledge while you are on a visit in that family remember the hospitality extended to you binds you to the most inviolable secrecy It is mean contemptible rude and ill bred to make your entertainers regret their hospitality by betraying any such confidence for it is as sacred a confidence as if you were bound over to silence in the most solemn manner After paying a visit you should write to your hostess as soon as you reach home again thank her in this letter for her hospitality speak warmly of the enjoyment you have had in your recent visit and mention by name every member of the family desiring to be remembered to all CHAPTER IX MORNING RECEPTIONS OR CALLS ETIQUETTE FOR THE HOSTESS If your circle of visiting acquaintance is very large while at the same time your time is fully occupied or your home duties make it inconvenient to dress every morning to receive visitors it is a good plan to set aside one morning in the week for a reception day Upon your own visiting cards below the name put the day when it will be proper to return the visit thus missus JAMES HUNTER AT HOME WEDNESDAYS No seventeen eighteen C saint Your friends will unless there is some especial reason for a call in the interval pay their visit upon the day named Let nothing but the most imperative duty call you out upon your reception day Your callers are in a measure invited guests and it will be an insulting mark of rudeness to be out when they call Neither can you be excused except in case of sickness Having appointed the day when you will be at home to see your friends you must for that day prepare to give your time wholly to them The usual hours for morning receptions are from twelve to three and you should be dressed and ready for callers at least half an hour before that time To come in flushed from a hurried toilette to meet your first callers is unbecoming as well as rude Your dress should be handsome but not showy A silk or cashmere wrapper richly trimmed over an embroidered skirt with a pretty cap or the hair neatly arranged without head dress is a becoming and appropriate dress Still better is a rich but plain silk made high in the neck with long sleeves Wear a handsomely embroidered or lace collar and sleeves and a rather dressy cap or still better the hair alone prettily arranged As each visitor arrives rise and advance part of the way to meet her If gentlemen rise but do not advance It is not customary now to introduce callers at these morning receptions though you can do so with perfect propriety where you know such an introduction will be agreeable to both parties In introducing a gentleman to a lady address her first as Miss Jones permit me to introduce mister Lee and when introducing a young lady to a matron you introduce the younger one to the elder as missus Green allow me to introduce to you my friend Miss Brown In introducing strangers in the city it is well to name the place of their residence as mister James of Germany or mister Brown of New York or if they have recently returned from abroad it is well to say so as mister Lee lately from India this is useful in starting conversation Be careful when introducing your friends to pronounce the name of each one clearly and distinctly that there may be no mistake or necessity for repetition It is a good plan if your receptions are usually largely attended to have books and pictures on the centre table and scattered about your parlors You must of course converse with each caller but many will remain in the room for a long time and these trifles are excellent pastime and serve as subjects for conversation It requires much tact to know when to introduce friends when to take refuge under the shield fashion offers and not make them acquainted with each other It is a positive cruelty to force a talented witty person to converse with one who is ignorant and dull as they will of course be obliged to do if introduced A well bred lady who is receiving several visitors at a time pays equal attention to all and attempts as much as possible to generalize the conversation turning to all in succession The last arrival however receives a little more attention at first than the others If it is not agreeable to you to set aside a day for the especial reception of callers and you have a large circle of acquaintances be ready to receive them each day that you are at home If you are engaged let the servant say so when she opens the door and do not send down that message after your friend has been admitted If she is told when she arrives that you are engaged she will understand that you are denied to all callers but if that message comes after she has sent up her card she may draw the inference that you will not see her though you may see other friends Never keep a caller waiting whilst you make an elaborate toilette If you are not ready for visitors it is best to enter the parlor in your wrapper apologizing for it than to keep your friend waiting whilst you change your dress If a stranger calls bringing a letter of introduction and sends the letter you may read it before going down stairs but if they wait till you are in the parlor before presenting the letter merely glance at the signature and at the name of your caller do not read the letter through unless it is very short or you are requested by the bearer to do so If you have a friend staying with you invite her to join you in the parlor when you have callers and introduce her to your friends If you wish to invite a caller to stay to luncheon or dinner give the invitation as soon as you have exchanged greetings not after she has been seated for some time In the latter case it appears like an after thought not as in the former as if from a real desire to have the pleasure of her company If you have but one caller at a time rise when she does and accompany her to the vestibule but if there are several in the room rise when each one does but only accompany them to the parlor door there take leave of them and return to those who still remain seated If after affliction your friends call before you are able to see them do not fear to give offence by declining to receive them They will respect your sorrow and the call is made more to show their sympathy than from a desire to converse with you Visits of condolence paid between the death of one of your family and the day of the funeral you may always excuse yourself from with perfect propriety They are made in kindness and show interest but if you decline seeing such callers there is no offence given In parting from a gentleman caller rise when he does and remain standing until he leaves the room but do not go towards the door When a gentleman calls in the morning he will not remove his outside coat and will hold his hat in his hand Never offer to take the latter and do not invite him to remove his coat Take no notice of either one or the other If strangers in the city call upon you enquire at what hotel they are staying and how long they will be there that you may return their call before they leave town CHAPTER X MORNING RECEPTIONS OR CALLS ETIQUETTE FOR THE CALLER The usual hours for paying morning calls are between eleven and two or twelve and three and all calls of ceremony should be made between these hours Never in paying a ceremonious call stay more than twenty minutes or less than ten If your hostess has several other visitors at the same time that you are in her parlor make your visit short that she may have more attention to bestow upon others After you have received an invitation to a party call within a week or fortnight after the evening whether you have accepted or declined the invitation If you have declined on account of mourning the excuse extends also to the call When the servant answers your ring hand in your card If your friend is out or engaged leave the card and if she is in send it up Never call without cards You may offend your friend as she may never hear of your call if she is out at the time and you trust to the memory of the servant If your friend is at home after sending your card up to her by the servant go into the parlor to wait for her Sit down quietly and do not leave your seat until you rise to meet her as she enters the room To walk about the parlor examining the ornaments and pictures is ill bred It is still more unlady like to sit down and turn over to read the cards in her card basket If she keeps you waiting for a long time you may take a book from the centre table to pass away the interval Never while waiting in a friend s parlor go to the piano and play till she comes This is a breach of good breeding often committed and nothing can be more ill bred You may be disturbing an invalid unawares or you may prevent your friend if she has children from coming down stairs at all by waking the baby If you are a stranger in the city and bring a letter of introduction to your hostess send this letter up stairs with your card that she may read it and know how to welcome you when she comes down stairs In this case write upon the card the name of the hotel at which you are staying and mention in the course of conversation how long you will be in the city If you have a visitor and desire to introduce her to your friends you may invite her to accompany you when paying calls In making a call for condolence it is sufficient to leave a card with your enquiries for the health of your friend and offers of service The same if calling upon invalids if they are too ill to see you In visits of congratulation go in and be hearty in your expressions of interest and sympathy Pay visits both of condolence and congratulation within a week after the event which calls for them occurs It is proper when you have already made your call of the usual length and another caller is announced to rise and leave not immediately as if you shunned the new arrival but after a moment or two Never out sit two or three parties of visitors unless you have private business with your hostess which cannot be postponed Many denounce the system of morning calls as silly frivolous and a waste of time They are wrong It may be carried to an excess and so admit of these objections but in moderation the custom is a good and pleasant one You have then an opportunity of making friends of mere acquaintances and you can in a pleasant chat with a friend at home have more real enjoyment in her society than in a dozen meetings in large companies with all the formality and restraint of a party thrown around you There are many subjects of conversation which are pleasant in a parlor tete a tete with a friend which you would not care to discuss in a crowded saloon or in the street Personal inquiries private affairs can be cosily chatted over In paying your visits of condolence show by your own quiet gravity that you sympathize in the recent affliction of your friend Though you may endeavor to comfort and cheer her you must avoid a gay or careless air as it will be an insult at such a time Avoid any allusion to the past that may be trying for her to hear or answer yet do not ignore the subject entirely as that appears like a want of interest in it Though you may feel happy avoid parading your own joyousness at such a time whatever your own feeling may be respect the sorrow of another Never sit gazing curiously around the room when paying a call as if taking a mental inventory of the furniture It is excessively rude It is still worse to appear to notice any disorder or irregularity that may occur If while paying a call you perceive that any unforeseen matter in the family calls for the attention of the lady of the house leave instantly no matter how short your call has been Your friend may not appear to notice the screams of a child a noise in the kitchen or the cry from the nursery that the fire board has caught fire but you may be sure she does hear it and though too well bred to speak of it will heartily rejoice to say good bye Do not take a child with you to pay calls until it is old enough to behave quietly and with propriety To have a troublesome child constantly touching the parlor ornaments balancing itself on the back of a chair leaning from a window or performing any of the thousand tricks in which children excel is an annoyance both to yourself and your hostess Make no remark upon the temperature of the room or its arrangement when you enter it Never open or shut a window or door without asking permission and unless really suffering from excessive heat or cold refrain from asking leave to take this liberty If you are invited to go up stairs to your friend s private apartment you will of course accept the invitation but never go up stairs uninvited When you reach her door if the servant has not preceded and announced you knock and await her invitation to enter Then once in take no notice of the room but go instantly to your friend If she is sewing do not speak of the nature of her work but request her to continue as if you were not present In cases of long standing friendship you will not of course stand upon the ceremony of waiting for each and every one of your calls to be returned before paying another but be careful that you are not too lavish of your visits The most cordial welcome may be worn threadbare if it is called into use too often If you are visiting an invalid or one confined by physical infirmity to one apartment while you are cheerful and ready to impart all the news that will interest them do not by too glowing descriptions of out door pleasures make them feel more keenly their own deprivations It is well when making such calls to converse upon literature or such general subjects as will not remind them of their misfortune In cases where from long illness or other infirmity a gentleman friend is confined entirely to his room you may with perfect propriety call upon him It is both polite and kind to do so as otherwise he would be deprived entirely of the society of his lady friends Many thus unfortunately situated from study and reading while so shut out from the world become the most delightful companions If when you make a call you unfortunately intrude upon an early dinner hour do not go in but leave your card and say that you will call again If you call upon two ladies who are boarding at the same house do not send up your card to both at the same time If one is out send a card to her room and then send up for the other If the first one is in wait till she comes down and then chat as long as a call usually lasts When you rise as if to take leave accompany your friend to the parlor door then tell her that you are going to send up for your other friend She will bid you good morning and go to her own room ring the bell after she leaves you and send your card by the waiter to your other friend In calling at a hotel enter by the ladies door and send your card to the room of your friend by the waiter It is well if you are calling upon an entire stranger to choose a seat and tell the waiter to say to the lady exactly where she will find you She will probably enter with your card in her hand then rise greet her by name and introduce yourself If you speak to another stranger upon the same errand as the one you expect the error will be instantly perceived by the difference in name If a stranger bringing a letter of introduction sends the letter with her card instead of calling courtesy requires you to make the first call immediately the same day that you receive the letter if possible if not the day after CHAPTER XI DINNER COMPANY ETIQUETTE FOR THE HOSTESS In issuing invitations for a large dinner party the usual form is Mr and missus G request the favor of mister and missus L s company to dinner on Wednesday March eighth at o clock If your husband is giving a party to gentlemen only he will have a card printed or written for the occasion but your duties as hostess if he wishes you to preside will still be as arduous as if your own friends were included in the invitation The directions given in the chapter on Evening parties for the arrangement of the parlor and the dressing rooms will apply here equally well but the dining room in this case the centre of attraction requires still more careful attention Any fault here will mar your own comfort and the pleasure of your guests and must be carefully avoided Send out your invitations by a servant or man hired for the purpose do not trust them to despatch or penny post Be careful in selecting the guests for a dinner party Remember that conversation will be the sole entertainment for several hours and if your guests are not well chosen your dinner no matter how perfect or costly the viands will prove a failure The most agreeable dinners are those whose numbers will allow all the guests to join in a common conversation and where the host has spirit and intelligence to take the lead and start a new subject when the interest in the old one begins to flag Dinners where the guests depend entirely upon the person next them for conversation are apt to be stupid as it requires marvelous tact to pair off all the couples so that every one will be entertaining in tete a tete conversation To give a good dinner your means room and establishment must all be taken into consideration when you are preparing for a dinner company If you invite a large number you must increase your establishment for the occasion as to sit down to a dinner badly served with a scarcity of waiters is tiresome and shows little tact or grace on the part of the hostess One cook cannot prepare dinner properly for more than ten persons and three waiters will find ample employment in waiting upon the same number More than this number will require a table too large for general easy conversation and throw your company into couples or trios for entertainment Have your table spread in a room that will accommodate all the guests comfortably at the same time avoid putting a small social party in a large room where they will appear lost in the space around them Let the room be comfortably warmed and if your dinner is late have the apartments well lighted If you sit down by daylight but will remain in the room until after dark have the shutters closed and the lights lit before the dinner is announced as nothing can be more awkward than to do this in the middle of the meal The shape of a table is a point of more importance than some people think If you wish your dinner to be social not a mere collection of tete a tetes the table should be of a shape which will make it easy for each guest to address any one at the table The long parallelogram with the host at one end and the hostess at the other is stiff too broad too long and isolates the givers of the feast from the guests The round table if large enough to accommodate many guests has too large a diameter each way for easy conversation The best table is the oval and the host and hostess should sit in the middle of each side facing each other The dining room even in the heat of summer should be carpeted to deaden the noise of the servants feet The chairs should be easy without arms and with tall slanting backs It adds much to the comfort if each person is provided with a foot stool You must have besides the waiters one servant to carve and he must be an adept No dish should be carved upon the table and that no guest shall wait too long for his meat you must engage a rapid and dexterous carver For a party of ten two waiters and the carver are amply sufficient If you have too many servants they will only interfere with each other and stand staring at the guests Give your orders before dinner and through the meal never speak to the servants Your whole attention must be given to the guests Even if you see that matters are going wrong do not let your annoyance appear but gracefully ignore the painful facts Let each servant have his regular position at the table One should take the guests at the right of the hostess and the left of the host the other the guests on the other side They should wear light noiseless shoes and white gloves and each one carry a folded napkin over his right arm The main point in the arrangement of the table itself is to secure beauty without interfering with conversation The table cover and napkins must be of snowy damask the glass clear as crystal and taste must preside over each detail Let nothing high be placed on the table that will effectually separate the guests from each other There should be first a handsome centre piece and this may be of glass silver or china and not too high or large and must be elegant as a work of art or it is better omitted altogether Preserve or fruit stands tastefully decorated with the fruit on fresh green leaves and flowers mingled with them form exquisite centre pieces A pyramid of flowers or tasty vase or basket forms too a beautiful ornament for the centre of the table In addition to this the French scatter vases of flowers all over the table at the corners and in the centre Some place a small fragrant bouquet before the plate of each guest Nothing can be more beautiful than this arrangement Glasses of celery dishes of clear transparent jellies or preserves exquisite little glass plates of pickles should stand in order on the table Place before each guest the plate knife fork spoon four wine glasses of various sizes the goblet for water napkin small salt cellar salt spoon and roll of bread Place none of the meats or vegetables upon the large table These should all be served at a side table each guest selecting his own to be handed by the servants The first course is soup As this is not meant to destroy the appetite for other viands it should be light not too rich or thick Let the servant hand one ladlefull to each person If you have more than one kind he must first inquire which each guest prefers If you have wines let them be handed round after the soup Next comes the fish If you have large fish let a slice cut smoothly not made into a hash by awkward carving be placed upon the plate of the guest with a slice of egg and drawn butter If the fish are small one should be placed upon each plate Then come the patties of oysters minced veal or lobster or instead of these you may have poultry or game Next the roast With the meats have vegetables served on a separate plate that the guest may take as much as he wishes with meat You will of course have a variety of vegetables but scarcely any guest will choose more than two The pastry and puddings come next in order and these too are better served from a side table Between the pastry and the dessert have salad and cheese placed before each guest If you eat dessert in the same room that you dine in it should be placed upon the table with the exception of the ices before the guests are seated and this comes after the pastry has been discussed It should consist of fruit and ices A pleasanter and more elegant way is to have the fruit and ices spread in a separate room and leave the dining room after the pastry has been eaten The change of position the absence of the meat flavor in the atmosphere make the dessert much more delightful than if it is eaten in the same room as the dinner In summer especially the change to a cool fresh room where the ices and fruits are tastefully spread and flowers are scattered profusely about the room delights every sense Coffee follows the dessert and when this enters if your guests are gentlemen only your duty is at an end You may then rise leave the room and need not re appear If you have lady guests you give the signal for rising after coffee and lead the way to the parlor where in a few moments the gentlemen will again join you Suppose your guests invited servants instructed every arrangement made and the important day arrived The next point to consider is the reception of your guests Be dressed in good season as many seem to consider an invitation to dinner as one to pass the day and come early Take a position in your drawing room where each guest will find you easily and remain near it until every guest has arrived As each one enters advance to meet him and extend your hand Have plenty of chairs ready in the drawing room as an invitation to dinner by no means argues a stand up party As you have already arranged every detail your duty as hostess consists in receiving your guests gracefully conversing and looking as charmingly as possible Flowers in the drawing room are as great a proof of taste as in the dining room As the time just before dinner is very apt to be tiresome you should bring forward all the armor against stupidity that you possess Display upon tables arranged conveniently about the room curiosities handsome books photographs engravings stereoscopes medallions any works of art you may own and have the ottomans sofas and chairs so placed that your guests can move easily about the room or rooms The severest test of good breeding in a lady is in the position of hostess receiving dinner guests Your guests may arrive all at once yet you must make each one feel that he or she is the object of your individual attention and none must be hurt by neglect They may arrive very early yet your duty is to make the time fly until dinner is announced They may come late and risk the ruin of your choicest dishes yet you must not upon pain of a breach of etiquette show the least annoyance If you know that the whole kitchen is in arms at the delay you must conceal the anguish as the Spartan boy did his pangs to turn a cheerful smiling face upon the tardy guests When dinner is announced you will lead the way to the dining room upon the arm of one of your gentlemen guests having paired off the company in couples The host comes in last with a lady upon his arm You may indicate to each couple as they enter the dining room the seats they are to occupy standing until all are seated or you may allow them to choose their own places The English fashion of placing a card upon each plate with the name of the person to take that seat upon it is a good one It enables the hostess to place those whom she is certain will be mutually entertaining next each other Place the gentleman who escorts you from the parlor at your right hand Having once taken your seat at table you have nothing to do with the dinner but to partake of it Not a word or even a glance will a well bred hostess bestow upon the servants nor will she speak to the guests of the dishes Their choice rests between themselves and the waiters and you must take no notice of what they eat how much or how little Nay should they partake of one dish only you must ignore the fact The greatest tact is displayed where the hostess makes each guest feel perfectly at ease She will aid her husband both in leading and supporting the conversation and will see that no guest is left in silence from want of attention Whilst she ignores every breach of etiquette her guests may commit she must carefully observe every rule herself and this she must do in an easy natural manner avoiding every appearance of restraint Her deportment she may be sure is secretly watched and criticised by each guest yet she must appear utterly unconscious that she is occupying any conspicuous position To watch the servants or appear uneasy lest something should go wrong is excessively ill bred and if any accident does occur you only make it worse by noticing it To reprove or speak sharply to a servant before your guests manifests a shocking want of good breeding The rules given above are only applicable to large dinner parties and where the guests are few and the host himself carves these rules will not apply In this case as you will only require the services of your own household domestics you must of course attend personally to the wants of your guests Dinner not being served from a side table you must while putting tasteful ornaments upon it be careful not to crowd them and leave room for the substantial dishes You must watch the plate of each guest to see that it is well provided and you will invite each one to partake of the various dishes Have a servant to pass the plates from you to each guest and from the host to you after he has put the meat upon them that you may add gravy and vegetables before they are set before your visitors At these smaller dinner companies avoid apologizing for anything either in the viands or the arrangement of them You have provided the best your purse will allow prepared as faultlessly as possible you will only gain credit for mock modesty if you apologize for a well prepared well spread dinner and if there are faults they will only be made more conspicuous if attention is drawn to them by an apology Ease of manner quiet dignity cheerful intelligent conversation and gentle lady like deportment never appear more charming than when they adorn a lady at the head of her own table CHAPTER XII DINNER COMPANY ETIQUETTE FOR THE GUEST When you receive an invitation to join a dinner party answer it immediately as by leaving your hostess in doubt whether you intend to accept or decline her hospitality you make it impossible for her to decide how many she must prepare for If you accept at first and any unforeseen event keeps you from fulfilling your engagement write a second note that your hostess may not wait dinner for you Such a note if circumstances render it necessary to write it may be sent with perfect propriety an hour before the time appointed for dinner though if you are aware that you cannot attend earlier you must send the information in good season You should enter the house of your hostess from a quarter to half an hour earlier than the time appointed for dining Proceed at once to the dressing room and arrange your dress and hair and then enter the drawing room By going to the house too early you may hasten or interrupt the toilet arrangements of your hostess while by being late you will establish a most disagreeable association in the minds of all present as the lady who kept dinner waiting at missus L s Immediately upon entering the parlor find your hostess and speak to her first It is very rude to stop to chat with other guests before greeting the lady of the house You may bow to any one you know in passing but do not stop to speak Having exchanged a few words with your hostess turn to the other guests unless you are the first arrival In that case converse with your host and hostess until others come in Be careful if dinner is delayed by the tardiness of the guests or from any other cause that you do not show by your manner that you are aware of such delay To look towards the door often consult your watch or give tokens of weariness are all marks of ill breeding Your hostess will probably be sufficiently annoyed by the irregularity itself do not add to her discomfort by allowing her to suppose that her guests perceive the deficiencies Look over the books and pictures with an air of interest converse cheerfully and in every way appear as if dinner were a matter of secondary importance as indeed it should be compared with the pleasure of the society around you When the signal for dinner is given your hostess will probably name your escort to the table If he is a stranger bow in acknowledgement of the introduction take his arm and fall into your place in the stream of guests passing from the parlor to the dining room Take the seat pointed out by your hostess or the waiter as soon as it is offered Each one will do this upon entering and it prevents the confusion that will result if those first entering the room remain standing until all the other guests come in When you take your seat be careful that your chair does not stand upon the dress of the lady next you as she may not rise at the same instant that you do and so you risk tearing her dress Sit gracefully at the table neither so close as to make your movements awkward nor so far away as to drag your food over your dress before it reaches your mouth It is well to carry in your pocket a small pincushion and having unfolded your napkin to pin it at the belt You may do this quietly without its being perceived and you will thus really save your dress If the napkin is merely laid open upon your lap it will be very apt to slip down if your dress is of silk or satin and you risk the chance of appearing again in the drawing room with the front of your dress soiled or greased If by the carelessness or awkwardness of your neighbors or the servants you have a plate of soup glass of wine or any dish intended for your mouth deposited upon your dress do not spring up or make any exclamation You may wipe off the worst of the spot with your napkin and then let it pass without further notice If an apology is made by the unlucky perpetrator of the accident try to set him at his ease by your own lady like composure He will feel sorry and awkward enough without reproach sullenness or cold looks from you Gloves and mittens are no longer worn at table even at the largest dinner parties To make remarks upon the guests or the dishes is excessively rude If the conversation is general speak loudly enough to be heard by those around you but at the same time avoid raising your voice too much If the company is very large and you converse only with the person immediately beside you speak in a distinct but low tone that you may not interrupt other couples but carefully avoid whispering or a confidential air Both are in excessively bad taste To laugh in a suppressed way has the appearance of laughing at those around you and a loud boisterous laugh is always unlady like Converse cheerfully laugh quietly but freely if you will and while you confine your attention entirely to your neighbor still avoid any air of secrecy or mystery Never use an eye glass either to look at the persons around you or the articles upon the table Eat your soup quietly To make any noise in eating it is simply disgusting Do not break bread into your soup Break off small pieces and put into your mouth if you will but neither bite it from the roll nor break it up and eat it from your soup plate with a spoon In eating bread with meat never dip it into the gravy on your plate and then bite the end off If you wish to eat it with gravy break off a small piece put it upon your plate and then with a fork convey it to your mouth When helped to fish remove with knife and fork all the bones then lay down the knife and with a piece of bread in your left hand and a fork in your right eat the flakes of fish Need I say that the knife is to cut your food with and must never be used while eating To put it in your mouth is a distinctive mark of low breeding If you have selected what you will eat keep the plate that is placed before you never pass it to the persons next you as they may have an entirely different choice of meat or vegetables Never attempt to touch any dish that is upon the table but out of your reach by stretching out your arms leaning forward or still worse standing up Ask the waiter to hand it if you wish for it or if the gentleman beside you can easily do so you may ask him to pass it to you Do not press those near you to take more or other things than are upon their plate This is the duty of the hostess or if the company is large the servants will attend to it For you to do so is officious and ill bred When conversing let your knife and fork rest easily upon your plate even if still in your hand Avoid holding them upright Keep your own knife fork and spoon solely for the articles upon your own plate To use them for helping yourself to butter or salt is rude in the extreme When you do not use the salt spoon sugar tongs and butter knife you may be sure that those around you will conclude that you have never seen the articles and do not know their use You need not fear to offend by refusing to take wine with a gentleman even your host If you decline gracefully he will appreciate the delicacy which makes you refuse If however you have no conscientious scruples and are invited to take wine bow and merely raise the glass to your lips then set it down again You may thus acknowledge the courtesy and yet avoid actually drinking the wine No lady should drink wine at dinner Even if her head is strong enough to bear it she will find her cheeks soon after the indulgence flushed hot and uncomfortable and if the room is warm and the dinner a long one she will probably pay the penalty of her folly by having a headache all the evening If offered any dish of which you do not wish to partake decline it but do not assign any reason To object to the dish itself is an insult to your entertainers and if you assert any reason for your own dislike it is ill bred Do not bend too much forward over your food and converse easily To eat fast or appear to be so much engrossed as to be unable to converse is ill bred and it makes those around you suspect that you are so little accustomed to dining well that you fear to stop eating an instant lest you should not get enough It is equally ill bred to accept every thing that is offered to you Never take more than two vegetables do not take a second plate of soup pastry or pudding Indeed it is best to accept but one plate of any article Never use a spoon for anything but liquids and never touch anything to eat excepting bread celery or fruit with your fingers In the intervals which must occur between the courses do not appear to be conscious of the lapse of time Wear a careless air when waiting conversing cheerfully and pleasantly and avoid looking round the room as if wondering what the waiters are about Never eat every morsel that is upon your plate and surely no lady will ever scrape her plate or pass the bread round it as if to save the servants the trouble of washing it Take such small mouthfulls that you can always be ready for conversation but avoid playing with your food or partaking of it with an affectation of delicate appetite Your hostess may suppose you despise her fare if you appear so very choice or eat too sparingly If your state of health deprives you of appetite it is bad enough for you to decline the invitation to dine out Never examine minutely the food before you You insult your hostess by such a proceeding as it looks as if you feared to find something upon the plate that should not be there If you find a worm on opening a nut or in any of the fruit hand your plate quietly and without remark to the waiter and request him to bring you a clean one Do not let others perceive the movement or the cause of it if you can avoid so doing Never make a noise in eating To munch or smack the lips are vulgar faults Sit quietly at table avoid stiffness but at the same time be careful that you do not annoy others by your restlessness Do not eat so fast as to be done long before others nor so slowly as to keep them waiting When the finger glasses are passed round dip the ends of your fingers into them and wipe them upon your napkin then do not fold your napkin but place it beside your plate upon the table To carry away fruit or bonbons from the table is a sign of low breeding Rise with the other ladies when your hostess gives the signal After returning to the parlor remain in the house at least an hour after dinner is over If you have another engagement in the evening you may then take your leave but not before You will insult your hostess by leaving sooner as it appears that you came only for the dinner and that being over your interest in the house for the time has ceased It is only beggars who eat and run CHAPTER XIII TABLE ETIQUETTE In order to appear perfectly well bred at table when in company or in public as at a hotel you must pay attention three times a day to the points of table etiquette If you neglect these little details at home and in private they will be performed awkwardly and with an air of restraint when you are in company By making them habitual they will become natural and appear easily and sit gracefully upon you Even when eating entirely alone observe these little details thus making the most finished and elegant manners perfectly familiar and thus avoiding the stiff awkward air you will wear if you keep your politeness only for company when you will be constantly apprehensive of doing wrong At breakfast or tea if your seat is at the head of the table you must before taking anything upon your own plate fill a cup for each one of the family and pass them round being careful to suit each one in the preparation of the cup that none may return to you for more tea water sugar or milk If you have a visitor pass the cup with the tea or coffee alone in it and hand with the cup the sugar bowl and cream pitcher that these may be added in the quantity preferred After all the cups have been filled and passed round you may take the bread butter and other food upon your own plate Train your children so that they will pass these things to you as soon as they see you are ready to receive them If you are yourself at the side of the table pass the bread butter et cetera to the lady at the head when you see that she has sent the cups from the waiter before her to those seated at the table If you occupy the place of head of the table you must watch the cups offer to fill them when empty and also see that each one of the family is well helped to the other articles upon the table Avoid making any noise in eating even if each meal is eaten in solitary state It is a disgusting habit and one not easily cured if once contracted to make any noise with the lips when eating Never put large pieces of food into your mouth Eat slowly and cut your food into small pieces before putting it into your mouth Use your fork or spoon never your knife to put your food into your mouth At dinner hold in your left hand a piece of bread and raise your meat or vegetables with the fork holding the bread to prevent the pieces slipping from the plate If you are asked at table what part of the meat you prefer name your favorite piece but do not give such information unless asked to do so To point out any especial part of a dish and ask for it is ill bred To answer when asked to select a part that it is a matter of indifference or I can eat any part is annoying to the carver as he cares less than yourself certainly and would prefer to give you the piece you really like best Do not pour coffee or tea from your cup into your saucer and do not blow either these or soup Wait until they cool Use the butter knife salt spoon and sugar tongs as scrupulously when alone as if a room full of people were watching you Otherwise you may neglect to do so when the omission will mortify you Never put poultry or fish bones or the stones of fruit upon the table cloth but place them on the edge of your plate Do not begin to eat until others at the table are ready to commence too Sit easily in your chair neither too near the table nor too far from it and avoid such tricks as putting your arms on the table leaning back lazily in your chair or playing with your knife fork or spoon Never raise your voice when speaking any higher than is necessary The clear articulation and distinct pronunciation of each word will make a low tone more agreeable and more easily understood than the loudest tone if the speech is rapid or indistinct Never pass your plate with the knife or fork upon it and when you pass your cup put the spoon in the saucer Never pile up the food on your plate It looks as if you feared it would all be gone before you could be helped again and it will certainly make your attempts to cut the food awkward if your plate is crowded If there is a delicacy upon the table partake of it sparingly and never help yourself to it a second time If you wish to cough or use your handkerchief rise from the table and leave the room If you have not time to do this cover your mouth and turn your head aside from the table and perform the disagreeable necessity as rapidly and quietly as possible Avoid gesticulation at the table Indeed a well bred lady will never gesticulate but converse quietly letting the expression and animation of her features give force to her words Never when at the home table leave it until the other members of the family are also ready to rise CHAPTER XIV CONDUCT IN THE STREET A lady s conduct is never so entirely at the mercy of critics because never so public as when she is in the street Her dress carriage walk will all be exposed to notice every passer by will look at her if it is only for one glance every unlady like action will be marked and in no position will a dignified lady like deportment be more certain to command respect Let me start with you upon your promenade my friend and I will soon decide your place upon the list of well bred ladies First your dress Not that scarlet shawl with a green dress I beg and oh spare my nerves you are not so insane as to put on a blue bonnet That s right If you wish to wear the green dress don a black shawl and that white bonnet will do very well One rule you must lay down with regard to a walking dress It must never be conspicuous Let the material be rich if you will the set of each garment faultless have collar and sleeves snowy white and wear neatly fitting whole clean gloves and boots Every detail may be scrupulously attended to but let the whole effect be quiet and modest Wear a little of one bright color if you will but not more than one Let each part of the dress harmonize with all the rest avoid the extreme of fashion and let the dress suit you If you are short and plump do not wear flounces because they are fashionable and avoid large plaids even if they are the very latest style If tall and slight do not add to the length of your figure by long stripes a little mantilla and a caricature of a bonnet with long streaming ribbons A large round face will never look well staring from a tiny delicate bonnet nor will a long thin one stand the test much better Wear what is becoming to yourself and only bow to fashion enough to avoid eccentricity To have everything in the extreme of fashion is a sure mark of vulgarity Wear no jewelry in the street excepting your watch and brooch Jewelry is only suited for full evening dress when all the other details unite to set it off If it is real it is too valuable to risk losing in the street and if it is not real no lady should wear it Mock jewelry is utterly detestable What are you doing Sucking the head of your parasol Have you not breakfasted Take that piece of ivory from your mouth To suck it is unlady like and let me tell you excessively unbecoming Rosy lips and pearly teeth can be put to a better use Why did you not dress before you came out It is a mark of ill breeding to draw your gloves on in the street Now your bonnet strings and now your collar Pray arrange your dress before you leave the house Nothing looks worse than to see a lady fussing over her dress in the street Take a few moments more in your dressing room and so arrange your dress that you will not need to think of it again whilst you are out Do not walk so fast you are not chasing anybody Walk slowly gracefully Oh do not drag one foot after the other as if you were fast asleep set down the foot lightly but at the same time firmly now carry your head up not so you hang it down as if you feared to look any one in the face Nay that is the other extreme Now you look like a drill major on parade So that is the medium Erect yet at the same time easy and elegant Now my friend do not swing your arms You don t know what to do with them Your parasol takes one hand hold your dress up a little with the other Not so No lady should raise her dress above the ankle Take care don t drag your dress through that mud puddle Worse and worse If you take hold of your dress on both sides in that way and drag it up so high you will be set down as a raw country girl So Raise it just above the boot all round easily letting it fall again in the old folds Don t shake it down it will fall back of itself Stop don t you see there is a carriage coming Do you want to be thrown down by the horses You can run across Very lady like indeed Surely nothing can be more ungraceful than to see a lady shuffle and run across a street Wait until the way is clear and then walk slowly across Do not try to raise your skirts It is better to soil them You were very foolish to wear white skirts this muddy day They are easily washed and you cannot raise all You will surely be awkward in making the attempt and probably fail in spite of your efforts True they will be badly soiled and you expose this when you raise the dress but the state of the streets must be seen by all who see your share of the dirt and they will apologize for your untidy appearance in a language distinctly understood Don t hold your parasol so close to your face nor so low down You cannot see your way clear and you will run against somebody Always hold an umbrella or parasol so that it will clear your bonnet and leave the space before your face open that you may see your way clearly If you are ever caught in a shower and meet a gentleman friend who offers an umbrella accept it if he will accompany you to your destination but do not deprive him of it if he is not able to join you Should he insist return it to his house or store the instant you reach home with a note of thanks If a stranger offers you the same services decline it positively but courteously at the same time thanking him Never stop to speak to a gentleman in the street If you have anything important to say to him allow him to join and walk with you but do not stop It is best to follow the same rule with regard to ladies and either walk with them or invite them to walk with you instead of stopping to talk A lady who desires to pay strict regard to etiquette will not stop to gaze in at the shop windows It looks countrified If she is alone it looks as if she were waiting for some one and if she is not alone she is victimizing some one else to satisfy her curiosity Remember that in meeting your gentlemen friends it is your duty to speak first therefore do not cut them by waiting to be recognized Be sure however that they see you before you bow or you place yourself in the awkward position of having your bow pass unreturned You are not expected to recognize any friend on the opposite side of the street Even if you see them do not bow Avoid cutting any one It is a small way of showing spite and lowers you more than your enemy If you wish to avoid any further intercourse bow coldly and gravely but do not look at any one to whom you are in the habit of bowing and pass without bowing If you do this they may flatter themselves that they were really unrecognized but a distant cold bow will show them that you speak from civility only not from friendship In the street a lady takes the arm of a relative her affianced lover or husband but of no other gentleman unless the streets are slippery or in the evening When a lady walks with two gentlemen she should endeavor to divide her attention and remarks equally between them If you do stop in the street draw near the walls that you may not keep others from passing Loud talking and laughing in the street are excessively vulgar Not only this but they expose a lady to the most severe misconstruction Let your conduct be modest and quiet If a gentleman although a stranger offers his hand to assist you in leaving a carriage omnibus or to aid you in crossing where it is wet or muddy accept his civility thank him bow and pass on If you wish to take an omnibus or car see that it is not already full If it is do not get in You will annoy others and be uncomfortable yourself It is best to carry change to pay car or omnibus fare as you keep others waiting whilst the driver is making change and it is apt to fall into the straw when passing from one hand to another If a gentleman gives you his seat hands your fare or offers you any such attention thank him It is not countrified it is lady like If you do not speak bow Be careful not to be alone in the streets after night fall It exposes you to insult If you are obliged to go out have a servant or another lady if you cannot procure the escort of a gentleman which is of course the best Walk slowly do not turn your head to the right or left unless you wish to walk that way and avoid any gesture or word that will attract attention Never look back It is excessively ill bred Make no remarks upon those who pass you while there is even a possibility that they may hear you Never stare at any one even if they have peculiarities which make them objects of remark In taking your place in an omnibus or car do so quietly and then sit perfectly still Do not change your place or move restlessly Make room for others if you see that the opposite side is full If you walk with a gentleman when he reaches your door invite him in but if he declines do not urge him If you are returning from a ball or party and the hour is a very late or early one you are not bound in politeness to invite your escort to enter the hour will be your apology for omitting the ceremony CHAPTER XV LETTER WRITING There is no branch of education called so universally into requisition as the art of letter writing no station high or low where the necessity for correspondence is not felt no person young or old who does not at some time write cause to be written and receive letters From the President in his official capacity with the busy pens of secretaries constantly employed in this branch of service to the Irish laborer who unable to guide a pen writes also by proxy to his kinsfolks across the wide ocean all at some time feel the desire to transmit some message word of love business or sometimes enmity by letter Yet in spite of the universal need and almost universal habit there are really but very few persons who write a good letter a letter that is at the same time long enough to interest yet not long enough to tire sufficiently condensed to keep the attention and not tedious and yet detailed enough to afford satisfaction that is correct in grammatical construction properly punctuated written in a clear legible hand with the date address signature all in the proper place no words whose letters stand in utter defiance to spelling book rules in short a well written letter Thousands millions are sent from post to post every day The lightning speed of the telegraph takes its messages from city to city the panting steamer carries from continent to continent its heavy mail bags laden with its weight of loving messages the iron horse drags behind it its measure of the many missives while in the far distant Western wilds the lumbering wagon bears its paper freight with its pen eloquence to cheer and comfort or sadden and crush the waiting emigrants longing for news of home To some who with hearts desolated by the separation from the home circle could read with an eager interest volumes of the most common place trivial incidents if only connected with the loved ones there will come pages from the pen of the dearest relative full of learning wit and wisdom wholly uninteresting to the receiver Why is this Not from any desire upon the part of the writer to display learning or talent but because writing a letter being to them a great undertaking and the letter being destined to go a long distance they look upon it as an event too unusual to be wasted in detailing the simple every day details of domestic life and ransack memory and learning for a subject worthy of the long journey and unusual labor Others will have from mere acquaintances long tedious details of uninteresting trivialities and from the near relatives short dry epistles which fall like stones upon the heart longing for little affectionate expressions and home memories From some letter writers who are in the midst of scenes and events of the most absorbing interest letters arrive only a few lines long without one allusion to the interesting matter lying so profusely around them while others with the scantiest of outward subjects will from their own teeming brain write bewitching absorbing epistles read with eagerness laid aside with the echo of Oliver Twist s petition in a sigh the reader longing for more It is of course impossible to lay down any distinct rule for the style of letter writing Embracing as it does all subjects and all classes all countries and associations and every relation in which one person can stand to another what would be an imperative rule in some cases becomes positive absurdity in others Every letter will vary from others written before in either its subject the person addressed or the circumstances which make it necessary to write it Letter writing is in fact but conversation carried on with the pen when distance or circumstances prevent the easier method of exchanging ideas by spoken words Write therefore as you would speak were the person to whom your letter is addressed seated beside you As amongst relatives and intimate friends you would converse with a familiar manner and in easy language so in your letters to such persons let your style be simple entirely devoid of effort Again when introduced to a stranger or conversing with one much older than yourself your manner is respectful and dignified so let the letters addressed to those on these terms with yourself be written in a more ceremonious style but at the same time avoid stiffness and above all pedantry A letter of advice to a child would of course demand an entirely different style from that written by a young lady to a friend or relative advanced in life yet the general rule write as you would converse applies to each and every case Neatness is an important requisite in a letter To send a fair clean sheet with the words written in a clear legible hand will go a great way in ensuring a cordial welcome for your letter Avoid erasures as they spoil the beauty of your sheet If it is necessary to correct a word draw your pen through it and write the word you wish to use as a substitute above the one erased do not scratch out the word and write another over it it is untidy and the second word is seldom legible Another requisite for a good letter is a clear concise style Use language that will be easily understood and avoid the parenthesis Important passages in letters are often lost entirely by the ambiguous manner in which they are worded or rendered quite as unintelligible by the blots erasures or villainously bad hand writing A phrase may by the addition or omission of one word or by the alteration of one punctuation mark convey to the reader an entirely different idea from that intended by the writer so while you write plainly use good language you must also write carefully and punctuate properly If you are in doubt about the correct spelling of a word do not trust to chance hoping it may be right but get a dictionary and be certain that you have spelt it as it ought to be Simplicity is a great charm in letter writing What you send in a letter is as a general rule intended for the perusal of one person only Therefore to cumber your epistles with quotations similes flowery language and a stilted pedantic style is in bad taste You may use elegant language yet use it easily If you use a quotation let it come into its place naturally as if flowing in perfect harmony with your ideas and let it be short Long quotations in a letter are tiresome Make no attempt at display in a correspondence You will err as much in such an attempt as if when seated face to face with your correspondent alone in your own apartment you were to rise and converse with the gestures and language of a minister in his pulpit or a lecturer upon his platform As everything in style depends upon the subject of the letter and the person to whom it is addressed some words follow relating to some of the various kinds of correspondence BUSINESS LETTERS should be as brief as is consistent with the subject clear and to the point Say all that is necessary in plain distinct language and say no more State in forcible words every point that it is desirable for your correspondent to be made acquainted with that your designs and prospects upon the subject may be perfectly well understood Write in such a letter of nothing but the business in hand other matters will be out of place there Nowhere is a confused style or illegible writing more unpardonable than in a business letter nowhere a good style and hand more important Avoid flowery language too many words all pathos or wit any display of talent or learning and every merely personal matter in a business letter LETTERS OF COMPLIMENT must be restricted confined entirely to one subject If passing between acquaintances they should be written in a graceful at the same time respectful manner Avoid hackneyed expressions commonplace quotations and long labored sentences but while alluding to the subject in hand as if warmly interested in it at the same time endeavor to write in a style of simple natural grace LETTERS OF CONGRATULATION demand a cheerful pleasant style and an appearance of great interest They should be written from the heart and the cordial warm feelings there will prompt the proper language Be careful while offering to your friend the hearty congratulations her happy circumstances demand that you do not let envy at her good fortune creep into your head to make the pen utter complaining words at your own hard lot Do not dampen her joy by comparing her happiness with the misery of another There are many clouds in the life of every one of us While the sun shines clearly upon the events of your friend s life let her enjoy the brightness and warmth unshadowed by any words of yours Give her to the full your sympathy in her rejoicing cheerful words warm congratulations and bright hopes for the future Should there be at the time of her happiness any sad event you wish to communicate to her of which it is your duty to inform her write it in another letter If you must send it the same day do so but let the epistle wishing her joy go alone unclouded with the news of sorrow At the same time avoid exaggerated expressions of congratulation lest you are suspected of a desire to be satirical and avoid underlining any words If the language is not forcible enough to convey your ideas you will not make it better by underlining it If you say to your friend upon her marriage that you wish her joy in her new relations and hope she may be entirely happy in her domestic life you make her doubt your wishes and think you mean to ridicule her chances of such happiness LETTERS OF CONDOLENCE are exceedingly trying both to read and to write If the affliction which calls for them is one which touches you nearly really grieving and distressing you all written words must seem tame and cold compared with the aching sympathy which dictates them It is hard with the eyes blinded by tears and the hand shaking to write calmly and it is impossible to express upon paper all the burning thoughts and words that would pour forth were you beside the friend whose sorrow is yours If you do not feel the trial your task is still more difficult for no letters demand truth spoken from the heart more than letters of condolence Do not treat the subject for grief too lightly Write words of comfort if you will but do not appear to consider the affliction as a trifle Time may make it less severe but the first blow of grief must be heavy and a few words of sincere sympathy will outweigh pages of mere expressions of hope for comfort or the careless lines that show the letter to be one of mere duty not feeling Let your friend feel that her sorrow makes her dearer to you than ever before and that her grief is yours To treat the subject with levity or to wander from it into witticisms or every day chit chat is a wanton insult unworthy of a lady and a friend Do not magnify the event or plunge the mourner into still deeper despondency by taking a despairing gloomy view of the sorrow under which she is bent Show her the silver lining of her cloud try to soothe her grief yet be willing to admit that it is a cloud and that she has cause for grief To throw out hints that the sorrow is sent as a punishment to an offender to imply that neglect or imprudence on the part of the mourner is the cause of the calamity to hold up the trial as an example of retribution or a natural consequence of wrong doing is cruel and barbarous Even if this is true indeed if this is the case it only aggravates the insult avoid such retrospection It is as if a surgeon called in to a patient suffering from a fractured limb sat down inattentive to the suffering to lecture his patient upon the carelessness which caused the accident One of the most touching letters of condolence ever written was sent by a literary lady well known in the ranks of our American authoresses to her sister who had lost her youngest child The words were few merely SISTER DARLING I cannot write what is in my heart for you to day it is too full Filled with a double sorrow for you for my own grief Tears blind me my pen trembles in my hand Oh to be near you to clasp you in my arms to draw your head to my bosom and weep with you Darling God comfort you I cannot S That was all Yet the sorrowing mother said that no other letter though she appreciated the kind motive that dictated all yet none comforted her as did these few lines Written from the heart their simple eloquence touched the heart for which they were intended Early stages of great grief reject comfort but they long with intense longing for sympathy LETTERS WRITTEN TO GENTLEMEN should be ceremonious and dignified If the acquaintance is slight write in the third person if there is a necessity for a letter If a business letter be respectful yet not servile It is better to avoid correspondence with gentlemen particularly whilst you are young as there are many objections to it Still if a friend of long standing solicits a correspondence and your parents or husband approve and permit compliance with the request it would be over prudish to refuse Write however such letters as if they were printed in the newspapers would cause you no annoyance If the acquaintance admits of a frank friendly style be careful that your expressions of good will do not become too vehement and avoid any confidential communications When he begins to ask you to keep such and such passages secret believe me it is quite time to drop the correspondence LETTERS OF ENQUIRY especially if they request a favor should contain a few lines of compliment If the letter is upon a private subject such as enquiry with regard to the illness or misfortune of a friend avoid making it too brief To write short careless letters upon such subjects is unfeeling and they will surely be attributed to motives of obligation or duty not to interest Letters of enquiry referring to family matters should be delicately worded and appear dictated by interest not mere curiosity If the enquiry refers to matters interesting only to yourself enclose a postage stamp for the reply In answering such letters if they refer to your own health or subjects interesting to yourself thank the writer for the interest expressed and answer in a satisfactory manner If the answer interests your correspondent only do not reply as if the enquiry annoyed you but express some interest in the matter of the letter and give as clear and satisfactory reply as is in your power LETTERS OFFERING FAVORS Be careful in writing to offer a favor that you do not make your friend feel a heavy weight of obligation by over rating your services The kindness will be duly appreciated and more highly valued if offered in a delicate manner Too strong a sense of obligation is humiliating so do not diminish the real value of the service by forcing the receiver to acknowledge a fictitious value Let the recipient of your good will feel that it affords you as much pleasure to confer the favor as it will give her to receive it A letter accompanying a present should be short and gracefully worded The affectionate spirit of such little epistles will double the value of the gift which they accompany Never refer to a favor received in such a letter as that will give your gift the appearance of being payment for such favor and make your letter of about as much value as a tradesman s receipted bill LETTERS OF THANKS for enquiries made should be short merely echoing the words of the letter they answer and contain the answer to the question with an acknowledgement of your correspondent s interest If the letter is your own acknowledgement of a favor conferred let the language be simple but strong grateful and graceful Fancy that you are clasping the hand of the kind friend who has been generous or thoughtful for you and then write even as you would speak Never hint that you deem such a favor an obligation to be returned at the first opportunity although this may really be the case it is extremely indelicate to say so In your letter gracefully acknowledge the obligation and if at a later day you can return the favor then let actions not words prove your grateful recollection of the favor conferred upon you If your letter is written to acknowledge the reception of a present speak of the beauty or usefulness of the gift and of the pleasant associations with her name it will always recall LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION should be truthful polite and carefully considered Such letters may be business letters or they may be given to servants and they must be given only when really deserved Do not be hasty in giving them remember that you are in some measure responsible for the bearer therefore never sacrifice truth and frankness to a mistaken idea of kindness or politeness LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION must be left unsealed They must not contain any allusion to the personal qualities of the bearer as such allusion would be about as sure a proof of ill breeding as if you sat beside your friend and ran over the list of the virtues and talents possessed by her The fact that the person bearing the letter is your friend will be all sufficient reason for cordial reception by the friend to whom the letter is addressed The best form is PHILADELPHIA June eighteenth eighteen MY DEAR MARY This letter will be handed to you by missus C to whom I am pleased to introduce you certain that the acquaintance thus formed between two friends of mine of so long standing and so much beloved will be pleasant to both parties Any attention that you may find it in your power to extend to missus C whilst she is in your city will be highly appreciated and gratefully acknowledged by Your sincere friend A LETTERS OF ADVICE should not be written unsolicited They will in all probability even when requested be unpalatable and should never be sent unless they can really be of service Write them with frankness and sincerity To write after an act has been committed and is irrevocable is folly and it is also unkind You may inform your friend that had you been consulted a different course from the one taken would have been recommended and you may really believe this yet it will probably be false Seeing the unfavorable result of the wrong course will enable you fully to appreciate the wisdom of the right one but had you been consulted when the matter was doubtful you would probably have been as much puzzled as your friend to judge the proper mode of action You should word a letter of advice delicately stating your opinion frankly and freely but giving it as an opinion not as a positive law If the advice is not taken do not feel offended as others more experienced than yourself upon the point in question may have also been consulted Let no selfish motive govern such a letter Think only of the good or evil to result to your friend and while you may write warmly and earnestly let the motive be a really disinterested one LETTERS OF EXCUSE should be frank and graceful They must be written promptly as soon as the occasion that calls for them admits If delayed they become insulting If such a letter is called forth by an act of negligence on your own part apologize for it frankly and show by your tone that you sincerely desire to regain the confidence your carelessness has periled If you have been obliged by positive inability to neglect the fulfilment of any promise you have given or any commission you have undertaken then state the reason for your delay and solicit the indulgence of your friend Do not write in such stiff formal language that the apology will seem forced from you but offer your excuse frankly as if with a sincere desire to atone for an act of negligence or remove a ground of offence LETTERS OF INTELLIGENCE are generally the answer to letters of enquiry or the statement of certain incidents or facts interesting both to the writer and reader of the letter Be careful in writing such a letter that you have all the facts in exact accordance with the truth Remember that every word is set down against you if one item of your information prove to be false and do not allow personal opinion or prejudice to dictate a single sentence Never repeat anything gathered from mere hearsay and be careful in such a letter that you violate no confidence nor force yourself upon the private affairs of any one Do not let scandal or a mere love of gossip dictate a letter of intelligence If your news is painful state it as delicately as possible and add a few lines expressive of sympathy If it is your pleasant task to communicate a joyful event make your letter cheerful and gay If you have written any such letter and after sending it find you have made any error in a statement write and correct the mistake immediately It may be a trivial error yet there is no false or mistaken news so trifling as to make a correction unnecessary INVITATIONS are generally written in the third person and this form is used where the acquaintance is very slight for formal notes and cards of compliment The form is proper upon such occasions but should be used only in the most ceremonious correspondence If this style is adopted by a person who has been accustomed to write in a more familiar one to you take it as a hint that the correspondence has for some reason become disagreeable and had better cease AUTOGRAPH LETTERS should be very short merely acknowledging the compliment paid by the request for the signature and a few words expressing the pleasure you feel in granting the favor If you write to ask for an autograph always inclose a postage stamp for the answer Date every letter you write accurately and avoid postscripts Politeness kindness both demand that every letter you receive must be answered Nothing can give more pleasure in a correspondence than prompt replies Matters of much importance often rest upon the reply to a letter and therefore this duty should never be delayed In answering friendly letters it will be found much easier to write what is kind and interesting if you sit down to the task as soon as you read your friend s letter Always mention the date of the letter to which your own is a reply Never write on a half sheet of paper Paper is cheap and a half sheet looks both mean and slovenly If you do not write but three lines still send the whole sheet of paper Perfectly plain paper thick smooth and white is the most elegant When in mourning use paper and envelopes with a black edge Never use the gilt edged or fancy bordered paper it looks vulgar and is in bad taste You may if you will have your initials stamped at the top of the sheet and on the seal of the envelope but do not have any fancy ornaments in the corners or on the back of the envelope You will be guilty of a great breach of politeness if you answer either a note or letter upon the half sheet of the paper sent by your correspondent even though it may be left blank Never write even the shortest note in pencil It looks careless and is rude Never write a letter carelessly It may be addressed to your most intimate friend or your nearest relative but you can never be sure that the eye for which it is intended will be the only one that sees it I do not mean by this that the epistle should be in a formal studied style but that it must be correct in its grammatical construction properly punctuated with every word spelt according to rule Even in the most familiar epistles observe the proper rules for composition you would not in conversing even with your own family use incorrect grammar or impertinent language therefore avoid saying upon paper what you would not say with your tongue Notes written in the third person must be continued throughout in the same person they are frequently very mysterious from the confusion of pronouns yet it is a style of correspondence much used and very proper upon many occasions For compliment inquiry where there is no intimacy between the parties from superiors to inferiors the form is elegant and proper If you receive a note written in the third person reply in the same form but do not reply thus to a more familiar note or letter as it is insulting and implies offence taken If you wish to repel undue familiarity or impertinence in your correspondent then reply to the epistle in the most formal language and in the third person It is an extraordinary fact that persons who have received a good education and who use their pens frequently will often in writing notes commence in the third person and then use the second or first personal pronoun and finish by a signature thus Miss Claire s compliments to mister James and wishes to know whether you have finished reading my copy of Jane Eyre as if mister James had finished it I would like to lend it to another friend Sincerely yours ELLA CLAIRE The errors in the above are too glaring to need comment yet with only the alteration of names it is a copy verbatim of a note written by a well educated girl Never sign a note written in the third person if you begin the note with your own name It is admissible if the note is worded in this way Will mister James return by bearer the copy of Jane Eyre he borrowed if he has finished reading it and oblige his sincere friend ELLA CLAIRE If you use a quotation never omit to put it in quotation marks otherwise your correspondent may however unjustly accuse you of a desire to pass off the idea and words of another for your own Avoid postscripts Above all never send an inquiry or compliment in a postscript To write a long letter upon various subjects and in the postscript desire to be remembered to your friend s family or inquire for their welfare instead of a compliment becomes insulting It is better if you have not time to write again and place such inquiries above your signature to omit them entirely Nobody likes to see their name mentioned as an afterthought Punctuate your letters carefully The want of a mark of punctuation or the incorrect placing of it will make the most woful confusion I give an instance of the utter absurdity produced by the alteration of punctuation marks turning a sensible paragraph to the most arrant nonsense Caesar entered on his head his helmet on his feet armed sandals upon his brow there was a cloud in his right hand his faithful sword in his eye an angry glare saying nothing he sat down By using precisely the same words merely altering the position of the punctuation marks we have Caesar entered on his head his helmet on his feet armed sandals upon his brow there was a cloud in his right hand his faithful sword in his eye an angry glare saying nothing he sat down Be careful then to punctuate properly that you may convey to the reader the exact sense of what is in your mind If you receive an impertinent letter treat it with contempt do not answer it Never answer a letter by proxy when you are able to write yourself It is a mark of respect and love to answer in your own hand all letters addressed to you If you are obliged to write to a friend to refuse to grant a favor asked you will lessen the pain of refusal by wording your letter delicately Loving words if it is a near friend respectful kind ones if a mere acquaintance will make the disagreeable contents of the letter more bearable Try to make the manner smooth and soften the hardness of the matter Every letter must embrace the following particulars first The date twod The complimentary address threed The body of the letter fourth The complimentary closing fifth The signature sixth The address There are two ways of putting the date and the address The first is to place them at the top of the sheet the other is to place them after the signature When at the top you write the name of your residence or that of the city in which you reside with the day of the month and the year at the right hand of the first line of the sheet Then at the left hand of the next line write the address then the complimentary address below the name thus WILLOW GROVE NEW YORK June twenty seventh eighteen fifty nine missus E C HOWELL My dear Madam I received your letter et cetera At the end of the letter on the right hand of the sheet put the complimentary closing and then the signature thus I remain my dear Madam With much respect Yours sincerely S E LAW If you place the date and address after the signature put it at the left of the sheet thus I remain my dear Madam With much respect Yours sincerely S E LAW missus E C HOWELL June twenty seventh eighteen fifty nine For a long letter it is better to put the date and address at the top of the page For a letter of only a few lines which ends on the first page the second form is best In a letter written to a person in the same city you need not put the address under the signature if not write it S E LAW WILLOW GROVE NEW YORK In writing to a dear friend or relative where there is no formality required you may omit the name at the top of the letter put the date and address thus WILLOW GROVE NEW YORK June twenty seventh eighteen fifty nine DEAR ANNA I write et cetera It is best however to put the full name at the bottom of the last page in case the letter is mislaid without the envelope thus E C LAW MISS ANNA WRIGHT If you use an envelope and this custom is now universal fold your letter neatly to fit into it then direct on the envelope Put first the name then the name of the person to whose care the letter must be directed then the street the city and State If the town is small put also the county This is the form MISS ANNA WRIGHT Care of mister John C Wright No forty Lexington street Greensburg Lee County Mass If the city is a large one New York Philadelphia Baltimore or any of the principal cities of the Union you may omit the name of the county If your letter is to go abroad add the name of the country as England or France in full under that of the city The name of the state is usually abbreviated and for the use of my readers I give the names of the United States with their abbreviations Maine Me New Hampshire N H Vermont Vt Massachusetts Mass Rhode Island R I Connecticut Conn New York N Y New Jersey N J Pennsylvania Pa or Penn Delaware Del Maryland Md Virginia Va North Carolina N C South Carolina S C Georgia Ga or Geo Alabama Ala Mississippi Miss Missouri Mo Louisiana La Tennessee Tenn Kentucky Ky Indiana Ind Ohio O Michigan Mich Illinois Ill Wisconsin Wis Arkansas Ark Texas Tex Iowa Io Florida Flo Oregon O California Cal Minnesota Minn District of Columbia D C If you are writing from another country to America put United States of America after the name of the state On the upper right hand corner of your envelope put your postage stamp If you send a letter by private hand write the name of the bearer in the lower left hand corner thus missus E A HOWELL Clinton Place Boston mister G G Lane In directing to any one who can claim any prefix or addition to his proper name do not omit to put that republican title For a clergyman reverend for Reverend is put before the name thus reverend JAMES C DAY For a bishop RIGHT REVEREND E BANKS For a physician doctor JAMES CURTIS or JAMES CURTIS M D For a member of Congress honorable E C DELTA For an officer in the navy captain HENRY LEE U S N For an officer in the army colonel EDWARD HOLMES U S A For a professor PROF E L JAMES If the honorary addition LL D A M or any such title belongs to your correspondent add it to his name on the envelope thus J L PETERS LL D If you seal with wax it is best to put a drop under the turn over and fasten this down firmly before you drop the wax that is to receive the impression Cards of compliment are usually written in the third person I give a few of the most common and proper forms For a party Miss Lee s compliments to mister Bates for Wednesday evening Nov eighteenth at eight o clock Addressed to a lady Miss Lee requests the pleasure of Miss Howard s company on Wednesday evening Nov eighteenth at eight o clock For a ball the above form with the word Dancing in the left hand corner Invitations to dinner or tea specify the entertainment thus missus Garret s compliments to mister and missus Howard and requests the pleasure of their company to dine or take tea on Wednesday Nov sixth at six o clock The form for answering is Miss Howard accepts with pleasure Miss Lee s polite invitation for Wednesday evening or Miss Howard regrets that a prior engagement will prevent her accepting Miss Lee s polite invitation for Wednesday evening mister and missus Howard s compliments to missus Garret and accept with pleasure her kind invitation for Wednesday or missus Howard regrets that the severe illness of mister Howard will render it impossible for either herself or mister Howard to join missus Garret s party on Wednesday next Upon visiting cards left when the caller is about to leave the city the letters p p c are put in the left hand corner they are the abbreviation of the French words pour prendre conge or may with equal propriety stand for presents parting compliments Another form p d a pour dire adieu may be used No accomplishment within the scope of human knowledge is so beautiful in all its features as that of epistolary correspondence Though distance absence and circumstances may separate the holiest alliances of friendship or those who are bound together by the still stronger ties of affection yet the power of interchanging thoughts words feelings and sentiments through the medium of letters adds a sweetness to the pain of separation renovating to life and adding to happiness The wide ocean may roll between those who have passed the social years of youth together or the snow capped Alps may rise in sublime grandeur separating early associates still young remembrances may be called up and the paradise of memory made to bloom afresh with unwithered flowers of holy recollection Though we see not eye to eye and face to face where the soft music of a loved voice may fall with its richness upon the ear yet the very soul and emotions of the mind may be poured forth in such melody as to touch the heart that s far away and melt down the liveliest eye into tears of ecstatic rapture Without the ability to practice the refined art of epistolary correspondence men would become cold and discordant an isolated compound of misanthropy They would fall off in forsaken fragments from the great bond of union which now adorns and beautifies all society Absence distance and time would cut the silken cords of parental brotherly and even connubial affection Early circumstances would be lost in forgetfulness and the virtues of reciprocal friendship waste their sweetness on the desert air Since then the art and practice of letter writing is productive of so much refined and social happiness a laudable indulgence in it must ever be commendable While it elevates the noble faculties of the mind it also chastens the disposition and improves those intellectual powers which would otherwise remain dormant and useless Notwithstanding the various beauties and pleasures attendant upon the accomplishment yet there are many who have given it but a slight portion of their attention and have therefore cause to blush at their own ignorance when necessity demands its practice There is no better mode by which to test the acquirements of either a young lady or gentleman than from their letters Letters are among the most useful forms of composition There are few persons who can read or write at all who do not frequently have occasion to write them and an elegant letter is much more rare than an elegant specimen of any other kind of writing The more rational and elevated the topics are on which you write the less will you care for your letters being seen or for paragraphs being read out of them and where there is no need of any secrecy it is best not to bind your friend by promises but to leave it to her discretion CHAPTER XVI POLITE DEPORTMENT AND GOOD HABITS Lord Chesterfield says Good sense and good nature suggest civility in general but in good breeding there are a thousand little delicacies which are established only by custom It is the knowledge and practice of such little delicacies which constitutes the greatest charm of society Manner may be and in most cases probably is the cloak of the heart this cloak may be used to cover defects but is it not better so to conceal these defects than to flaunt and parade them in the eyes of all whom we may meet Many persons plead a love of truth as an apology for rough manners as if truth was never gentle and kind but always harsh morose and forbidding Surely good manners and a good conscience are no more inconsistent with each other than beauty and innocence which are strikingly akin and always look the better for companionship Roughness and honesty are indeed sometimes found together in the same person but he is a poor judge of human nature who takes ill manners to be a guarantee of probity of character Some persons object to politeness that its language is unmeaning and false But this is easily answered A lie is not locked up in a phrase but must exist if at all in the mind of the speaker In the ordinary compliments of civilized life there is no intention to deceive and consequently no falsehood Polite language is pleasant to the ear and soothing to the heart while rough words are just the reverse and if not the product of ill temper are very apt to produce it The plainest of truths let it be remembered can be conveyed in civil speech while the most malignant lies may find utterance and often do in the language of the fishmarket Many ladies say Oh I am perfectly frank and outspoken I never stop to mince words or there is no affectation about me all my actions are perfectly natural and upon the ground of frankness will insult and wound by rude language and defend awkwardness and ill breeding by the plea of natural manners If nature has not invested you with all the virtues which may be desirable in a lady do not make your faults more conspicuous by thrusting them forward upon all occasions and at all times Assume a virtue if you have it not and you will in time by imitation acquire it By endeavoring to appear generous disinterested self sacrificing and amiable the opposite passions will be brought into subjection first in the manner afterwards in the heart It is not the desire to deceive but the desire to please which will dictate such a course When you hear one who pretends to be a lady boast that she is rough capricious and gluttonous you may feel sure that she has never tried to conquer these faults or she would be ashamed not proud of them The way to make yourself pleasing to others is to show that you care for them The whole world is like the miller at Mansfield who cared for nobody no not he because nobody cared for him And the whole world will serve you so if you give them the same cause Let every one therefore see that you do care for them by showing them what Sterne so happily calls the small sweet courtesies of life those courtesies in which there is no parade whose voice is too still to tease and which manifest themselves by tender and affectionate looks and little kind acts of attention giving others the preference in every little enjoyment at the table in the field walking sitting or standing Thus the first rule for a graceful manner is unselfish consideration of others By endeavoring to acquire the habit of politeness it will soon become familiar and sit on you with ease if not with elegance Let it never be forgotten that genuine politeness is a great fosterer of family love it allays accidental irritation by preventing harsh retorts and rude contradictions it softens the boisterous stimulates the indolent suppresses selfishness and by forming a habit of consideration for others harmonizes the whole Politeness begets politeness and brothers may be easily won by it to leave off the rude ways they bring home from school or college Sisters ought never to receive any little attention without thanking them for it never to ask a favor of them but in courteous terms never to reply to their questions in monosyllables and they will soon be ashamed to do such things themselves Both precept and example ought to be laid under contribution to convince them that no one can have really good manners abroad who is not habitually polite at home If you wish to be a well bred lady you must carry your good manners everywhere with you It is not a thing that can be laid aside and put on at pleasure True politeness is uniform disinterestedness in trifles accompanied by the calm self possession which belongs to a noble simplicity of purpose and this must be the effect of a Christian spirit running through all you do or say or think and unless you cultivate it and exercise it upon all occasions and towards all persons it will never be a part of yourself It is not an art to be paraded upon public occasions and neglected in every day duties nor should it like a ball dress be carefully laid aside at home trimmed ornamented and worn only when out Let it come into every thought and it will show forth in every action Let it be the rule in the homeliest duties and then it will set easily when in public not in a stiff manner like a garment seldom worn I wish it were possible to convince every woman that politeness is a most excellent good quality that it is a necessary ingredient in social comfort and a capital assistant to actual prosperity Like most good things however the word politeness is often misunderstood and misapplied and before urging the practical use of that which it represents it may be necessary to say what it means and what it does not mean Politeness is not hypocrisy cold heartedness or unkindness in disguise There are persons who can smile upon a victim and talk smoothly while they injure deceive or betray And they will take credit to themselves that all has been done with the utmost politeness that every tone look and action has been in perfect keeping with the rules of good breeding The words of their mouth are smoother than butter but war is in their heart their words are softer than oil yet are they drawn swords Perish for ever and ever such spurious politeness as this Politeness is not servility If it were so a Russian serf would be a model of politeness It is very possible for persons to be very cringing and obsequious without a single atom of politeness and it often happens that men of the most sturdy independence of character are essentially polite in all their words actions and feelings It were well for this to be fully understood for many people will abstain from acts of real politeness and even of common civility for fear of damaging their fancied independence True politeness as I understand it is kindness and courtesy of feeling brought into every day exercise It comprehends hearty good will towards everybody thorough and constant good humor an easy deportment and obliging manners Every person who cultivates such feelings and takes no pains to conceal them will necessarily be polite though she may not exactly know it while on the other hand a woman essentially morose and selfish whatever may be her pretensions must be very far from truly polite It is very true there are those whose position in society compels them to observe certain rules of etiquette which pass for politeness They bow or courtesy with a decent grace shake hands with the precise degree of vigor which the circumstances of the case require speak just at the right time and in the required manner and smile with elegant propriety Not a tone look or gesture is out of place not a habit indulged which etiquette forbids and yet there will be wanting after all the secret charm of sincerity and heart kindness which those outward signs are intended to represent and wanting which we have only the form without the essence of politeness Let me recommend therefore far beyond all the rules ever penned by teachers of etiquette the cultivation of kind and loving feelings Throw your whole soul into the lesson and you will advance rapidly towards the perfection of politeness for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and the movements of your form and the words you utter will follow faithfully the hidden springs of action within There cannot be genuine good breeding to any happy degree where there is not self respect It is that which imparts ease and confidence to our manners and impels us for our own sake as well as for the sake of others to behave becomingly as intelligent beings It is a want of true politeness that introduces the discord and confusion which too often make our homes unhappy A little consideration for the feelings of those whom we are bound to love and cherish and a little sacrifice of our own wills would in multitudes of instances make all the difference between alienation and growing affection The principle of genuine politeness would accomplish this and what a pity it is that those whose only spring of rational enjoyment is to be found at home should miss that enjoyment by a disregard of little things which after all make up the sum of human existence What a large amount of actual discomfort in domestic life would be prevented if all children were trained both by precept and example to the practice of common politeness If they were taught to speak respectfully to parents and brothers and sisters to friends neighbors and strangers what bawlings and snarlings would be stilled If their behavior within doors and especially at the table were regulated by a few of the common rules of good breeding how much natural and proper disgust would be spared If courtesy of demeanor towards all whom they meet in field or highway were instilled how much more pleasant would be our town travels and our rustic rambles Every parent has a personal interest in this matter and if every parent would but make the needful effort a great degree of gross incivility and consequent annoyance would soon be swept away from our hearths and homes Whilst earnestly endeavoring to acquire true politeness avoid that spurious imitation affectation It is to genuine politeness and good breeding what the showy paste is to the pure diamond It is the offspring of a sickly taste a deceitful heart and a sure proof of low breeding The certain test of affectation in any individual is the looking speaking moving or acting in any way different when in the presence of others especially those whose opinion we regard and whose approbation we desire from what we should do in solitude or in the presence of those only whom we disregard or who we think cannot injure or benefit us The motive for resisting affectation is that it is both unsuccessful and sinful It always involves a degree of hypocrisy which is exceedingly offensive in the sight of God which is generally detected even by men and which when detected exposes its subject to contempt which could never have been excited by the mere absence of any quality or possession as it is by the false assumption of what is not real The best cure for affectation is the cultivation on principle of every good virtuous and amiable habit and feeling not for the sake of being approved or admired but because it is right in itself and without considering what people will think of it Thus a real character will be formed instead of a part being assumed and admiration and love will be spontaneously bestowed where they are really deserved Artificial manners are easily seen through and the result of such observations however accomplished and beautiful the object may be is contempt for such littleness Many ladies moving too in good society will affect a forward bold manner very disagreeable to persons of sense They will tell of their wondrous feats when engaged in pursuits only suited for men they will converse in a loud boisterous tone laugh loudly sing comic songs or dashing bravuras in a style only fit for the stage or a gentleman s after dinner party they will lay wagers give broad hints and then brag of their success in forcing invitations or presents interlard their conversation with slang words or phrases suited only to the stable or bar room and this they think is a dashing fascinating manner It may be encouraged admired in their presence by gentlemen and imitated by younger ladies but be sure it is looked upon with contempt and disapproval by every one of good sense and that to persons of real refinement it is absolutely disgusting Other ladies taking quite as mistaken a view of real refinement will affect the most childish timidity converse only in whispers move slowly as an invalid faint at the shortest notice and on the slightest provocation be easily moved to tears and profess never to eat drink or sleep This course is as absurd as the other and much more troublesome as everybody dreads the scene which will follow any shock to the dear creature s nerves and will be careful to avoid any dangerous topics Self respect and a proper deference for our superiors in age or intellect will be the best safeguards against either a cringing or insolent manner Without self respect you will be apt to be both awkward and bashful either of which faults are entirely inconsistent with a graceful manner Be careful that while you have sufficient self respect to make your manner easy it does not become arrogance and so engender insolence Avoid sarcasm it will unconsciously to yourself degenerate into pertness and often downright rudeness Do not be afraid to speak candidly but temper candor with courtesy and never let wit run into that satire that will wound deeply whilst it amuses only slightly Let your carriage be at once dignified and graceful There are but few figures that will bear quick motion with almost every one its effect is that of a jerk a most awkward movement Let the feet in walking or dancing be turned out slightly when you are seated rest them both on the floor or a footstool To sit with the knees or feet crossed or doubled up is awkward and unlady like Carry your arms in walking easily never crossing them stiffly or swinging them beside you When seated if you are not sewing or knitting keep your hands perfectly quiet This whilst one of the most difficult accomplishments to attain is the surest mark of a lady Do not fidget playing with your rings brooch or any little article that may be near you let your hands rest in an easy natural position perfectly quiet Never gesticulate when conversing it looks theatrical and is ill bred so are all contortions of the features shrugging of shoulders raising of the eyebrows or hands When you open a conversation do so with a slight bow and smile but be careful not to simper and not to smile too often if the conversation becomes serious Never point It is excessively ill bred Avoid exclamations they are in excessively bad taste and are apt to be vulgar words A lady may express as much polite surprise or concern by a few simple earnest words or in her manner as she can by exclaiming Good gracious Mercy or Dear me Remember that every part of your person and dress should be in perfect order before you leave the dressing room and avoid all such tricks as smoothing your hair with your hand arranging your curls pulling the waist of your dress down or settling your collar or sleeves Avoid lounging attitudes they are indelicate except in your own private apartment Nothing but ill health will excuse them before company and a lady had better keep her room if she is too feeble to sit up in the drawing room Let your deportment suit your age and figure to see a tiny fairy like young girl marching erect stiff and awkwardly like a soldier on parade is not more absurd than to see a middle aged portly woman aping the romping hoydenish manners of a school girl Let the movements be easy and flexible and accord with the style of the lady Let your demeanor be always marked by modesty and simplicity as soon as you become forward or affected you have lost your greatest charm of manner You should be quite as anxious to talk with propriety as you are to think work sing paint or write according to the most correct rules Always select words calculated to convey an exact impression of your meaning Let your articulation be easy clear correct in accent and suited in tone and emphasis to your discourse Avoid a muttering mouthing stuttering droning guttural nasal or lisping pronunciation Let your speech be neither too loud nor too low but adjusted to the ear of your companion Try to prevent the necessity of any person crying What What Avoid a loquacious propensity you should never occupy more than your share of the time or more than is agreeable to others Beware of such vulgar interpolations as You know You see I ll tell you what Pay a strict regard to the rules of grammar even in private conversation If you do not understand these rules learn them whatever be your age or station Though you should always speak pleasantly do not mix your conversation with loud bursts of laughter Never indulge in uncommon words or in Latin and French phrases but choose the best understood terms to express your meaning Above all let your conversation be intellectual graceful chaste discreet edifying and profitable CHAPTER XVII CONDUCT IN CHURCH In entering a church of a different denomination from the one you have been in the habit of frequenting ask the sexton to show you to a seat It is the height of rudeness to enter a pew without invitation as the owner may desire if her family do not require all the seats to invite her own personal friends to take the vacant places If you are not perfectly familiar with the manner of conducting the worship observe those around you rise kneel and sit as you see they do It is a mark of disrespect for the pastor as well as irreverence for the Most High to remain seated through the whole service unless you are ill or otherwise incapacitated from standing and kneeling Enter the sacred edifice slowly reverentially and take your seat quietly It is not required of you to bow to any friend you may see in passing up the aisle as you are supposed yourself to be and suppose her to be entirely absorbed in thought proper for the occasion To stare round the church or if you are not alone to whisper to your companion is irreverent indelicate and rude If your own feelings will not prompt you to silence and reverence pay some regard to the feelings of others Be careful not to appear to notice those around you If others are so rude as to talk or conduct improperly fix your own mind upon the worship which you come to pay and let the impertinence pass unheeded If there is another person in the same pew with yourself who more familiar with the service hands you the book or points out the place acknowledge the civility by a silent bow it is not necessary to speak In your own pew extend this courtesy to a stranger who may come in beside you and even if it is a gentleman you may with perfect propriety hand him a book or if there is but one offer him a share of your own Endeavor always to be in your seat before the service commences and after it is over do not hurry away and above all do not begin your preparations for departure by shutting up your book or putting on any article of dress you have removed before the benediction If you are invited to accompany a friend to church be sure you are ready in good season that you may not keep her waiting when she calls or cause her to lose any part of the service by detaining her at your house If you invite a friend to take a seat in your pew call for her early give her the most comfortable place and be sure she has a prayer and hymn book If you are invited to stand as god mother to a friend s child be at the house of the parents in season to accompany the family to church and send the day before the gift you design for the babe A silver cup is the usual present with your little namesake s initials or full name engraved upon it In assisting at a wedding at church if you are one of the bridesmaids wear white a white bonnet but no veil If you occupy the first place the bride s it is in better taste to be married in a simple dress and bonnet and don your full dress when you return home to receive your friends In such ceremonies the wedding party all meet in the vestry and go to the altar together A A For further particulars see chapter on Bridal Etiquette At a funeral enter the church quietly and unless you belong to the mourners wait until they leave the church before you rise from your seat Never attempt to speak to any of the afflicted family However heartfelt your sympathy it will not be welcome at that time If when entering a crowded church a gentleman sees you and offers his seat acknowledge his civility whether accepted or declined by a bow and a whispered thank you Many who claim the name of lady and think they are well bred will accept such an act of politeness without making the slightest acknowledgement If the service has commenced do not speak a courteous inclination of the head will convey your sense of obligation Remember as an imperative general rule in whatever church you may be whether at home or abroad conform to the mode of worship whilst you are in that church If you find in these modes forms which are disagreeable to you or which shock your own ideas of religion avoid a second visit but do not insult the congregation by showing your contempt or disapproval whilst you are among them Silence quiet attention and a grave reverential demeanor mark the Christian lady in church CHAPTER XVIII BALL ROOM ETIQUETTE FOR THE HOSTESS When you have decided upon what evening you will give your ball send out your invitations a fortnight before the evening appointed To ladies word them missus L requests the pleasure of Miss G s company on Wednesday evening Jan seventeenth at nine o clock Dancing The favor of an early answer is requested To gentlemen missus L s compliments to mister R for Wednesday evening Jan seventeenth at nine o clock Dancing The favor of an early answer is requested If you are unmarried put your mother s name with your own upon the cards If you have a father or grown up brother let the invitations to the gentlemen go in his name In making your list for a ball do not set down all of your dear five hundred friends The middle aged unless they come as chaperons the serious and the sober minded will not accept your invitation and the two last named may consider it insulting to be invited to so frivolous an amusement By the way I do not agree with the straight laced people who condemn all such amusements I agree with Madame Pilau When the cure of her parish told her he was writing a series of sermons against dancing she said to him You are talking of what you do not understand You have never been to a ball I have and I assure you there is no sin in the matter worthy of mention or notice If you really wish for dancing you will accommodate your guests to your rooms inviting one third more than they will hold as about that number generally disappoint a ball giver If you wish to have a rush of people and do not mind heat crowding and discomfort to insure an immense assembly a ball to be talked about for its size only then you may invite every body who figures upon your visiting list Over one hundred is a large ball under that a ball unless there are less than fifty guests when it is merely a dance The directions given in chapter fifth for the arrangement of the dressing rooms will apply here but your parlor or ball room requires some attention Have the carpets taken up two days before the evening of the ball and the floor waxed A smooth polished floor is an absolute necessity for pleasant dancing At one end of your ball room have a space partitioned off for the musicians Leave for their use plenty of room as silence or discord will come from a crowded orchestra If your house is double and you use the rooms on each side place the musicians in the hall Four pieces of music is enough for a private ball unless your rooms are very large For one room a piano violin and violoncello makes a good band You must have your rooms well ventilated if you wish to avoid fainting and discomfort To secure a really brilliant ball pay considerable attention to the arrangement of your ball room In Paris this arrangement consists in turning the room for the evening into a perfect garden Every corner is filled with flowers Wreaths bouquets baskets and flowering plants in moss covered pots With brilliant light and taste in the details of arranging them this profusion of flowers produces an exquisitely beautiful effect and harmonizes perfectly with the light dresses cheerful faces and gay music The pleasure of your guests as well as the beauty of the rooms will be increased by the elegance of your arrangements their beauty will be heightened by brilliant light and by judicious management a scene of fairy like illusion may be produced Not only in the ball room itself but in the hall supper room and dressing rooms place flowers A fine effect is produced by placing a screen covered with green and flowers before the space set apart for the musicians To hear the music proceeding from behind this floral embankment and yet have the scraping and puffing men invisible adds very much to the illusion of the scene In the dressing rooms have at least two servants for each Let them take the cloaks and hoods and put a numbered ticket upon each bundle handing the duplicate number to the lady or gentleman owning it It is best to have the supper room upon the same floor as the ball room The light dresses worn upon such occasions suffer severely in passing up and down a crowded staircase Have a number of double cards written or printed with a list of the dances arranged in order upon one side and a space for engagements upon the other Attach a small pencil to each Let a waiter stand at the entrance to the ball room and hand a card to each guest as they pass in The first strain of music must be a march then follows a quadrille then a waltz Other dances follow in any order you prefer until the fourteenth which should be the march which announces supper If you throw open the supper room early and the guests go out when they wish the march may be omitted Twenty one to twenty four dances are sufficient Have an interval of ten minutes after each one The supper room should be thrown open at midnight and remain open until your last guest has departed Let it be brilliantly lighted and have plenty of waiters in attendance There can be no rule laid down for the supper It may be hot or heavily iced It may consist entirely of confectionary or it may include the bill of fare for a hotel table One rule you must observe have abundance of everything Other entertainments may be given upon economical principles but a ball cannot Light attendance supper every detail must be carefully attended to and a ball must be an expensive luxury At a ball supper every one stands up The waiters will hand refreshment from the tables to the gentlemen who in turn wait upon the ladies You must bring forth your whole array of smiles when you perform the part of hostess in a ball room As your guests will come dropping in at all hours you must hover near the door to greet each one entering There will be many strangers amongst the gentlemen Miss G will bring her fiancee Miss L her brother just returned after ten years absence from India Miss R introduces her cousin in the city for a week Miss M as a belle will perhaps take the liberty of telling some ten or twelve of her most devoted admirers where she may be seen on the evening of your ball and though strangers they will one after another bow over your hand To each and every one you must extend the amiable greeting due to an invited guest If you are the only lady of the house your duties will indeed be laborious You must be everywhere at the same moment Not a guest must pass unwelcomed You must introduce partners to all the wall flowers You must see that every set is made up before the music commences Each guest must be introduced to a proper partner for every dance and not one frown one pettish word one look of fatigue one sigh of utter weariness must disturb your smiling serenity You must be ready to chat cheerfully with every bore who detains you when crossing the room to make up a set of quadrilles in a minute s time listen patiently to the sighing lover whose fair one is engaged fifty times during twenty dances secure a good dancer for each longing belle do the same for the beaux yet you must never be hurried worried or fatigued If there are several ladies a mother and two or three daughters for instance divide the duties Let one receive the guests another arrange the sets a third introduce couples and a fourth pair off the talkers A brother or father will be a treasure in a ball room as the standing of sets can be better managed by a gentleman than a lady None of the ladies who give the ball should dance until every fair guest has a partner One of your duties will be to see that no young ladies lose their supper for want of an escort to ask them to go out You may give the hint to an intimate gentleman friend if there is no brother or father to take the duty introduce him to the disconsolate damsel and send her off happy If all the guests go to the supper room when it is first thrown open you must be the last to leave the ball room For the hostess to take the lead to the supper room leaving her guests to pair off and follow as they please is in very bad taste If you announce supper by a march many of your guests will remain in the ball room to promenade avoid the crowd at the first table and indulge in a tete a tete conversation These will afterwards go out in pairs when the first crush in the refreshment room is over If by accident or negligence you miss an introduction to any of your gentlemen guests you may still speak to them if you wish It is your privilege as hostess to introduce yourself and invite any gentleman to dance with you or offer to introduce him to a partner In the latter case he ought to mention his name but if he omits to do so you may ask it There has been a custom introduced in some of our large cities lately which is an admirable one for a private ball It is to hire for the evening a public hall This includes the dressing room supper room every comfort and saves you from the thousand annoyances which are certain to follow a ball in a private house You hire the hall and other rooms the price including light hire a band of music and order a supper at a confectioners hiring from his establishment all the china glass and silver you will want In this case you must enclose in every invitation a ticket to admit your friend s party to prevent loungers from the street coming in uninvited You will perhaps find the actual outlay of money greater when you thus hire your ball room but you will save more than the difference in labor annoyance and the injury to your house You secure a better room than any parlor you have the floor waxed and polished without the trouble of taking up your carpets You save all the dreadful labor of cleaning up the house the next day as well as that of preparation You can if you wish invite a few friends to a late dinner with you and all proceed to the ball room together You must be the first to enter the room the last to leave it and every duty is the same as if you were at home the ball room is in fact your own house for the evening If you wish your guests to come in costume for a fancy ball name the character of the entertainment in your invitation CHAPTER XIX BALL ROOM ETIQUETTE FOR THE GUEST As in every other case where hospitality is extended to you by invitation you must send your answer as soon as possible

8112-281888-0003	train-other-500	white silk plain or lace over satin make an exquisite toilette Jewels are perfectly appropriate also feathers in the coiffure For the young lady
8112-281888-0004	train-other-500	pure white or light colors should be worn and the most appropriate dress is of some thin material made over silk white or the same color as the outer dress
8112-281888-0005	train-other-500	Satin or velvet are entirely out of place on a young lady Let the coiffure be of flowers or ribbons never feathers and but very little jewelry is becoming to an unmarried lady

8112-281888-0008	train-other-500	and the coiffure properly adjusted Nothing is more annoying than to have the hair loosen or the head dress fall off in a crowded ball room
8112-281888-0009	train-other-500	Your first duty upon entering the room is to speak to your hostess After a few words of greeting turn to the other guests At a private ball
8112-281888-0010	train-other-500	no lady will refuse an introduction to a gentleman It is an insult to her hostess implying that her guests are not gentlemen It is optional with the lady
8112-281888-0011	train-other-500	whether to continue or drop the acquaintance after the ball is over but for that evening however disagreeable etiquette requires her to accept him for one dance
8112-281888-0012	train-other-500	if she is disengaged and her hostess requests it At a public ball it is safest to decline all introductions made by the master of ceremonies though as before
8112-281888-0013	train-other-500	such acquaintances are not binding after the evening is over Be very careful how you refuse to dance with a gentleman A prior engagement will of course excuse you
8112-281888-0014	train-other-500	but if you plead fatigue or really feel it do not dance the set with another gentleman it is most insulting though sometimes done On the other hand
8112-281888-0015	train-other-500	be careful that you do not engage yourself twice for the same quadrille
8112-281888-0016	train-other-500	In a polka or valse you may do this saying I will dance the second half with you but have a prior engagement for the first Then after a few rounds with your first partner
8112-281888-0017	train-other-500	say to him that you are engaged for the remainder of the dance resume your seat and your second partner will seek you Let your manner in a ball room be quiet
8112-281888-0018	train-other-500	It looks very badly to see a lady endeavoring to attract attention by her boisterous manner loud talking or over active dancing Do not drag through dances
8112-281888-0019	train-other-500	as if you found them wearisome it is an insult to your partner but while you are cheerful and animated be lady like and dignified in your deportment
8112-281888-0020	train-other-500	At the end of each dance your partner will offer his arm and conduct you to a seat then bow and release him from further attendance
8112-281888-0021	train-other-500	as he may be engaged for the next dance When invited to dance hand your ball card to the gentleman who will put his name in one of the vacant places If you wish to go to the supper room
8112-281888-0022	train-other-500	accept the invitation that will be made after the dances whilst it is open but do not remain there long You may be keeping your escort from other engagements
8112-281888-0023	train-other-500	If you are accompanied by a gentleman besides your father or brother remember he has the right to the first dance and also will expect to take you in to supper
8112-281888-0024	train-other-500	Do not let any one else interfere with his privilege If you wish during the evening to go to the dressing room to arrange any part of your dress request the gentleman
8112-281888-0025	train-other-500	with whom you are dancing to escort you there He will wait for you at the door and take you back to the ball room Do not detain him any longer than is necessary
8112-281888-0026	train-other-500	Never leave the ball room for any such purpose alone as there are always gentlemen near and round the door and it looks very badly to see a lady unattended
8112-281888-0027	train-other-500	going through a crowd of gentlemen It is best at a ball to dance only every other dance as over fatigue and probably a flushed face will follow too much dancing
8112-281888-0028	train-other-500	Decline the intermediate ones on the plea of fatigue or fear of fatigue Never go into the supper room with the same gentleman twice You may go more than once
8112-281888-0029	train-other-500	if you wish for an ice or glass of water surely no lady wants two or three suppers but do not tax the same gentleman more than once even if he invites you
8112-281888-0030	train-other-500	after each dance No lady of taste will carry on a flirtation in a ball room so as to attract remark Be careful unless you wish your name coupled with his
8112-281888-0031	train-other-500	how you dance too often with the same gentleman If you are so unfortunate as forgetting a prior engagement to engage yourself to two gentlemen for the same dance
8112-281888-0032	train-other-500	decline dancing it altogether or you will surely offend one of them Never press forward to take the lead in a quadrille and if others not understanding the figures
8112-281888-0033	train-other-500	make confusion try to get through without remark It is useless to attempt to teach them as the music and other sets will finish the figure long before you can teach
8112-281888-0034	train-other-500	and dance it Keep your temper refrain from all remark and endeavor to make your partner forget in your cheerful conversation the annoyances of the dance
8112-281888-0035	train-other-500	There is much that is exhilarating in the atmosphere of a ball room The light music company and even dancing itself are all conducive
8112-281888-0036	train-other-500	to high spirits be careful that this flow of spirits does not lead you into hoydenism and rudeness Guard your actions and your tongue
8112-281888-0037	train-other-500	that you may leave the room as quietly and gracefully as you enter it Avoid confidential conversation in a ball room It is out of season
8112-281888-0038	train-other-500	and in excessively bad taste Be modest and reserved but avoid bashfulness It looks like a school girl and is invariably awkward
8112-281888-0039	train-other-500	Never allow your partner though he may be your most intimate friend to converse in a low tone or in any way assume a confidential or lover like air at a ball
8112-281888-0040	train-other-500	It is in excessively bad taste and gives annoyance frequently as others suppose such low toned remarks may refer to them
8112-281888-0041	train-other-500	Dance as others do It has a very absurd look to take every step with dancing school accuracy and your partner will be the first one to notice it
8112-281888-0042	train-other-500	A quadrille takes no more steps than a graceful walk Never stand up to dance in a quadrille unless you are perfectly familiar with the figures
8112-281888-0043	train-other-500	depending upon your partner to lead you through You will probably cause utter confusion in the set annoy the others forming it and make yourself appear absurd
8112-281888-0044	train-other-500	No young lady should go to a ball without the protection of a married lady or an elderly gentleman Never cross a ball room alone
8112-281888-0045	train-other-500	Never remain in a ball room until all the company have left it or even until the last set It is ill bred and looks as if you were unaccustomed to such pleasures
8112-281888-0046	train-other-500	and so desirous to prolong each one Leave while there are still two or three sets to be danced Do not accept any invitation for these late dances
8112-281888-0047	train-other-500	as the gentleman who invites you may find out your absence too late to take another partner
none	none	 and you will thus deprive him of the pleasure of dancing CHAPTER XX PLACES OF AMUSEMENT Do not accept an invitation to visit any place of public amusement with a gentleman with whom you are but slightly acquainted unless there is another lady also invited You may as a young lady go with a relative or your fiancee without a chaperon but not otherwise Having received an invitation which it is proper for you to accept write an answer immediately appointing an hour for your escort to call for you and be sure that you are ready in good season To arrive late is not only annoying to those near your seat whom you disturb when you enter but it is ill bred you will be supposed to be some one who is unable to come early instead of appearing as a lady who is mistress of her own time If the evening is cloudy or it rains your escort will probably bring a carriage and let me say a few words here about entering and leaving a carriage How to get in is difficult but of less importance than getting out because if you stumble in no one sees you but some one who may happen to be in the carriage but how to get out is so important that I will illustrate it by a short diplomatic anecdote The Princess of Hesse Darmstadt says M Mercy d Argenteau an ambassador of the last century having been desired by the Empress of Austria to bring her three daughters to court in order that her Imperial Majesty might choose one of them for a wife to one of her sons drove up in her coach to the palace gate Scarcely had they entered the presence when before even speaking to them the empress went up to the second daughter and taking her by the hand said I choose this young lady The mother astonished at the suddenness of her choice inquired what had actuated it I watched the young ladies get out of their carriage said the empress Your eldest daughter stepped on her dress and only saved herself from falling by an awkward scramble the youngest jumped from the coach to the ground without touching the steps the second just lifting her dress in front so as she descended to show the point of her shoe calmly stepped from the carriage to the ground neither hurriedly nor stiffly but with grace and dignity she is fit to be an empress her eldest sister is too awkward her youngest too wild THE THEATRE Here you must wear your bonnet though you may throw aside your cloak or shawl if you desire it Your escort will pass to your seats first and then turn and offer his hand to lead you to your own Once seated give your attention entirely to the actors whilst the curtain is up to your companion when it is down Do not look round the house with your glass A lady s deportment should be very modest in a theatre Avoid carefully every motion or gesture that will attract attention To flirt a fan converse in whispers indulge in extravagant gestures of merriment or admiration laugh loudly or clap your hands together are all excessively vulgar and unlady like Never turn your head to look at those seated behind you or near you If you speak to your companion while the curtain is up lower your voice that you may not disturb others interested in the conversation on the stage THE OPERA Here you should wear full dress an opera cloak and either a head dress or dressy bonnet of some thin material Your gloves must be of kid white or some very light tint to suit your dress Many dress for the opera as they would for the theatre but the beauty of the house is much enhanced by each lady contributing her full dress toilette to the general effect If you go to the dressing room leave your hood and shawl in the care of the woman in waiting whom you must fee when she returns them to you If you do not wish to go to the dressing room allow your escort to take off your shawl or cloak and throw it over the back of the seat As your opera cloak must be light enough to keep on all the evening though you may throw it open you must wear over it a heavier cloak or a shawl Throw this off in the lobby just before you enter your box Your gloves you must keep on all the evening Avoid handling the play bills as the printing ink will soil your gloves in a few minutes making your hands appear very badly for the rest of the evening You should be in your seat at the opera before the overture commences Never converse during the performance Even the lowest toned remark will disturb a real lover of music and these will be near you on all sides Exclamations of admiration Exquisite Beautiful or Lovely are in the worst taste Show your appreciation by quiet attention to every note and avoid every exclamation or gesture In our new opera houses there are rooms for promenade and between the acts your escort may invite you to walk there You may accept the invitation with perfect propriety He will leave the box first and then offer his hand to you In the lobby take his arm and keep it until you return to the box If you have taken your cloak or shawl to your seat leave them there during your promenade Return to your seat when the gong sounds the recall that you may not disturb others after the next act commences In walking up and down in the promenading saloon you may pass and repass friends Bow the first time you meet them but not again If you meet your gentlemen friends there bow but do not stop to speak They may join you for once round the room then allow them to leave you Your escort will feel justly offended if you allow any other gentlemen to engross your attention entirely when he has invited you to the entertainment CONCERTS Here as at the opera you may wear a bonnet or not as you will Go early to the hall unless you have secured a seat and then be in time for the first song If you are unavoidably late enter quietly and take a seat near the door It is very rude to push forward to the front of the hall and either crowd those upon the benches or force some gentleman to offer you his place If the hall is so crowded that even the back seats are full and a gentleman offers you his place you should thank him before accepting it Again I repeat do not converse or disturb those around you by exclamations or gesticulations LECTURES Two ladies may attend a lecture unaccompanied by a gentleman without attracting attention The dress bonnet and cloak worn in the street should be worn in a lecture room as these are by no means occasions for full dress If you return at an early hour from any place of amusement invite your escort into the house upon your arrival there and lay aside your bonnet and shawl If you keep them on he will conclude that you expect him to shorten his visit If it is late when you reach home he will probably decline your invitation to enter If however he accepts it do not lay aside your shawl and he will soon leave you If he asks permission to call in the morning you must unless prevented by an imperative engagement remain at home to see him Upon your way home from the theatre concert or opera speak warmly of the pleasure of the evening and at parting thank him for that pleasure Show by your manner that you have heartily enjoyed the entertainment you owe to his civility If you are weary do not allow him to see it If disappointed conceal that also You will be able to find some good points in the performance speak of these and ignore the bad ones If at the theatre opera or in a concert room you see an acquaintance you are not expected to recognize her unless near enough to speak A lady must not bow to any one even her own sister across a theatre or concert room CHAPTER XXI ACCOMPLISHMENTS In the present age when education is within the reach of all both rich and poor every lady will endeavor to become not only well educated but accomplished It is not as some will assert a waste of time or money Not only the fingers voice and figure are improved but the heart and intellect will become refined and the happiness greatly increased Take the young lady after a solid basis has been laid in her mind of the more important branches of education and rear upon that basis the structure of lighter education the accomplishments To cultivate these disregarding the more solid information is to build your castle without any foundation and make it not only absurd but unsteady The pleasure of hearing from a lady a cavatina executed in the most finished manner will be entirely destroyed if her first spoken words after the performance are vulgar or her sentence ungrammatical A lady without her piano or her pencil her library of French German or Italian authors her fancy work and tasteful embroideries is now rarely met with and it is right that such arts should be universal No woman is fitted for society until she dances well for home unless she is perfect mistress of needlework for her own enjoyment unless she has at least one accomplishment to occupy thoughts and fingers in her hours of leisure First upon the list of accomplishments comes the art of conversing well It is always ready Circumstances in society will constantly throw you into positions where you can use no other accomplishment You will not have a musical instrument within reach singing would be out of place your fancy work at home on many occasions and then you can exert your most fascinating as well as useful accomplishment the art of conversing well Little culture unfortunately is bestowed upon this accomplishment which beyond all others promotes the happiness of home enlivens society and improves the minds of both speaker and listener How many excellent women are deficient in the power of expressing themselves well or indeed of expressing themselves at all How many minds cream and mantle from the want of energy to pour themselves out in words On the other hand how some equally well intentioned drown the very senses in their torrent of remarks which dashes like a water fall into a sombre pool of ennui below One lady will enter society well dressed well looking polite she does not intend to chill it by her presence yet her absence is found a relief She takes her place as if she considered it sufficient to dress and look well She brings no stock to the community of ideas Her eyes return no response to the discourse which is going on When you have once glanced at her she becomes a mere expletive in the company Another one will be found a talker She is like a canary bird when others begin to speak she hurries in her remarks in an accompaniment Her voice must be uppermost conversation becomes a contest who can speak the most rapidly The timid and modest retire from the encounter she has the field to herself She goes on without mercy the voice of a syren would fatigue if heard continually Others revolt at the injustice of the monopoly and the words fall on ears that would be deaf if they could These are extreme cases there are many other minor errors The higher qualities of conversation must undoubtedly be based upon the higher qualities of the mind then it is indeed a privilege to commune with others To acquire the power of thus imparting the highest pleasure by conversational powers attention must be paid to literature I am supposing the solid foundation of a good education already laid but by literature I do not mean only that class of it which is taught at school Reading at the present day is too much confined to light literature I would not speak against this The modern novels and the poets of all ages are good reading but let them be taken in moderation and varied by something more solid Let them be the dessert to the more substantial dinner of history travels and works of a like nature Independent of the strength and polish given to the mind by a thorough course of reading there is another reason why a lady should devote some portion of her time to it she cannot do without it She may lacking this pass through life respectably even elegantly but she cannot take her part in a communing with superior minds she may enjoy in wondering the radiance of their intelligence but the wondering must be composed in part of amazement at her own folly in not having herself sought out the treasure concealed in the fathomless depths of books She cannot truly enjoy society with this art neglected She may for a few brief years be the ornament of the drawing room but it must be like many other ornaments there in still life she can never be the companion of the intellectual and the time is gone by when women with all their energies excited will be contented to be the mere plaything of brother husband or father Still it is not to the erudite nor to the imaginative only that it is given to please in conversation The art of imparting our ideas easily and elegantly to others may be improved by ourselves if there are opportunities of mingling in good society with little study The mind must first be cultivated but it should not abash those who are conscious of moderate talents or imperfect cultivation from taking a due part in conversation on account of their inferiority It is a very different thing to shine and to please to shine in society is more frequently attempted than compassed to please is in the power of all The effort to shine when fruitless brings a certain disgrace and engenders mortification all good people are inclined to take the will for the deed when they see a desire to please A gentle deferential kind manner will disarm even the most discerning from criticising too severely the deficiencies of the inexperienced confidence disrespect of others volubility eagerness to dispute must irritate the self love of others and produce an averseness to acknowledge talent or information where they may even happen to exist It is wiser and safer for a young lady in general to observe the good old fashioned rule of being addressed first but then she must receive the address readily meeting it half way repaying it by enlarging a little upon the topic thus selected and not sinking into a dull silence the moment after a reply is given Some young ladies start as if thunderstruck when spoken to and stare as if the person who pays them that attention had no right to awaken them from their reverie Others look affronted possibly from shyness and begin a derogatory attack upon the beauty of their dress by twitching the front breadth or move from side to side in evident distress and consternation Time remedies these defects but there is one less curable and less endurable that of pertness and flippancy the loud remarks and exclamations the look of self sufficiency and confidence But these offensive manifestations spring from some previous and deep seated defects of character and are only to be repelled by what I fear they will frequently encounter the mortification of inspiring disgust Neither is the lengthy prosy didactic reply consistent with the submission and simplicity of youth egotism and egotism once removed that is the bringing into the topic one s own family and relations are also antidotes to the true spirit of conversation In general it is wiser more in good taste safer more becoming certainly more in accordance with good breeding to avoid talking of persons There are many snares in such topics not merely the danger of calumniating but that of engendering a slippery conscience in matters of fact A young girl shy and inexpert states a circumstance she feels her deficiency as a narrator for the power of telling a story is a power to be acquired only by practice She is sometimes tempted to heighten a little the incidents in order to get on a little better and to make more impression She must of course defend her positions and then she perils the sanctity of truth Besides few things narrow the intellect more than dwelling on the peculiarities natural or incidental of that small coterie of persons who constitute our world It is in general a wise rule and one which will tend much to insure your comfort through life to avoid disclosures to others of family affairs I do not mean to recommend reserve or art to friends and relations too great frankness can hardly be practised but with acquaintance the less our own circumstances are discussed the happier and the more dignified will our commerce with them continue On the same principle let the concerns of others be touched upon with delicacy or if possible passed over in silence more especially those details which relate to strictly personal or family affairs Public deeds are of course public property But personal affairs are private and there is a want of true good breeding a want of consideration and deference in speaking freely of them even if your friend is unconscious of the liberty taken It seems paradoxical to observe that the art of listening well forms a part of the duty of conversation To give up the whole of your attention to the person who addresses himself to you is sometimes a heavy tax but it is one which we must pay for the privileges of social life and an early practice will render it an almost involuntary act of good breeding whilst consideration for others will give this little sacrifice a merit and a charm To listen well is to make an unconscious advance in the power of conversing In listening we perceive in what the interest in what the failure of others consists we become too aware of our own deficiencies without having them taught through the medium of humiliation We find ourselves often more ignorant than we could have supposed possible We learn by a very moderate attention to the sort of topics which please to form a style of our own The art of conversation is an unpleasant phrase The power of conversing well is least agreeable when it assumes the character of an art In listening a well bred lady will gently sympathize with the speaker or if needs must be differ as gently Much character is shown in the act of listening Some people appear to be in a violent hurry whilst another speaks they hasten on the person who addresses them as one would urge on a horse with incessant Yes yes very good indeed proceed Others sit on the full stare eyes fixed as those of an owl upon the speaker Others will receive every observation with a little hysterical giggle But all these vices of manner may be avoided by a gentle attention and a certain calm dignity of manner based upon a reflective cultivated mind Observation reading and study will form the groundwork for good powers of conversation and the more you read study and see the more varied and interesting will be your topics A young lady should consider music as one branch of her education inferior in importance to most of those studies which are pointed out to her but attainable in a sufficient degree by the aid of time perseverance and a moderate degree of instruction Begun early and pursued steadily there is ample leisure in youth for the attainment of a science which confers more cheerfulness and brings more pleasure than can readily be conceived A young lady should be able to play with taste correctness and readiness upon the general principle that a well educated woman should do all things well This I should suppose is in the power of most persons and it may be attained without loss of health of time or any sacrifice of an important nature She should consider it as an advantage a power to be employed for the gratification of others and to be indulged with moderation and good sense for her own resource as a change of occupation Consider in this light music is what Providence intended it to be a social blessing The whole creation is replete with music a benignant Power has made the language of the feathered tribe harmony let us not suppose that He condemns his other creatures to silence in the song Music has an influence peculiar to itself It can allay the irritation of the mind it cements families and makes a home which might sometimes be monotonous a scene of pleasant excitement Pursued as a recreation it is gentle rational lady like Followed as a sole object it loses its charm because we perceive it is then over rated The young lady who comes modestly forward when called upon as a performer would cease to please were she for an instant to assume the air and confidence of a professional musician There is a certain style and manner confined now to second rate performers for the highest and most esteemed dispense with it there is an effort and a dash which disgust in the lady who has bad taste enough to assume them And whilst I am on this topic let me remark that there is a great deal in the choice of music in the selection of its character its suitability to your feelings style and taste and this especially with respect to vocal music There is no doubt that a good Italian style is the best for instruction and that it produces the most careful and accomplished singers Suppose a case Your parents most fair reader have paid a high price to some excellent professor to instruct you and with a fair ear and a sufficient voice you have been taught some of those elaborate songs which are most popular at the opera A party is assembled music is one of the diversions Forth you step and with a just apprehension of the difficulties of your task select one of those immortal compositions which the most eminent have made their study you execute it wonderfully only just falling a little short of all the song should be only just provoking a comparison in every mind with a high standard present in the memory of every cultivated musician near you A cold approval or a good natured bravo with believe me though you do not hear it a thorough and often expressed conviction that you had better have left the thing alone follows the effort which has merely proclaimed the fact that spite of time and money spent upon the cultivation of your voice you are but a second rate singer But choose a wiser a less pretending a less conspicuous path Throw your knowledge into compositions of a less startling less aspiring character Try only what you can compass Be wise enough not to proclaim your deficiencies and the critics will go away disarmed even if they are not charmed But if there be any voice any feeling any science the touching melody made vocal by youth and taste will obtain even a far higher degree of encomium than perhaps it actually merits You will please you will be asked to renew your efforts People will not be afraid of cadenzas five minutes long or of bravuras every note of which makes one hope it may be the last It is true that to a person who loves music the performance of one of the incomparable songs of Bellini Rosini Flotow or Mozart is an actual delight but when attempted by a young amateur it should be like many other delights confined to the private circle and not visited upon society in general Do not suppose that I mean to recommend poor music or feeble ephemeral compositions What is good need not of necessity be always difficult Ballad music is rich in songs adapted for the private performer and there are many in Italian of great beauty which though they would not be selected for a concert room or for brilliant display are adapted for ladies Music is the greatest best substitute for conversation It has many merits in this light It can never provoke angry retort it can never make enemies it can injure no one s character by slander and in playing and singing one can commit no indiscretion Music is a most excellent amusement and in society an indispensable one It aids conversation by occasionally interrupting it for a short period to be renewed with a new impetus It makes the most delightful recreation for the home circle varying the toil and trouble of the father s or husband s working day by the pleasures of the evening made by music s power to glide smoothly and swiftly There are but few persons who are entirely without a love for music even if they do not understand it They will be borne along upon the waves of a sweet melody to high pure thoughts often to delicious memories The piano is at the present day the most popular instrument in society The harp has ceased to be fashionable though it is sometimes heard The latter is a most beautiful accompaniment for the voice but requires a large room as in a small one it will sound stringy and harsh The guitar while it makes a very pleasant accompaniment for the voice has also the advantage of being easily carried from place to place It requires as much judgment to select proper instrumental pieces for a parlor performance as you would display in a choice of songs Page after page of black closely printed notes will drive those who see them from the piano They may be executed in the most finished style but they are not suited to general society In their place for practice or for a musical soiree where every one puts forth her best musical powers they are appropriate and will give pleasure but they are not suited for a mixed party When asked to play choose if you will a brilliant showy piece but let it be short It is better still to make no attempt at display but simply try to please selecting the music your own judgment tells you is best suited to your audience Avoid the loud thumping style and also the over solemn style Be sure before you accept any invitation to play that you know perfectly the piece you undertake It is better to play the simplest airs in a finished faultless manner than to play imperfectly the most brilliant variations Avoid movement at the piano Swinging the body to and fro moving the head rolling the eyes raising the hands too much are all bad tricks and should be carefully abstained from With respect to drawing modeling or any pursuits of the same nature so much depends on taste and opportunity and they are so little the accomplishments of society that they require but few of those restrictions which music in its use and abuse demands Drawing like music should be cultivated early Its advantages are the habits of perseverance and occupation which it induces and the additional delight which it gives to the works both of nature and of art Like music it gives independence independence of society The true lover of the arts has a superiority over the indifferent and if she be not better prepared for society is much better fitted for retirement than those who are not so happily endowed with tastes when in moderation so innocent and beneficial There is no accomplishment more graceful pleasing healthy and lady like than that of riding well Avoiding at the same time timidity and the fast style keeping within the bounds of elegant propriety gracefully yielding to the guidance of your escort and keeping your seat easily yet steadily are all points to be acquired To ride well is undoubtedly an admirable qualification for a lady as she may be as feminine in the saddle as in the ball room or home circle It is a mistaken idea to suppose that to become an accomplished horse woman a lady must unsex herself But she must have a reserve in her manner that will prevent contamination from the intercourse which too much riding may lead to To hunt or follow the field sports in a pursuit which is the track of blood disgusts the true admirer of gentle breeding And such diversions will certainly result in a coarseness of manner and expression growing upon the fair equestrian slowly but surely A harsh voice loud tone expressions suited only to manly lips but unconsciously copied will follow her devotion to the unfeminine pursuit Nothing is more revolting than a woman who catches the tone and expressions of men To hear the slang of jockeyism from female lips is very offensive yet ladies who mix in field sports are liable nay almost certain to fall into a style of conversation which is ten times worse than the coarsest terms from the lips of a man Instances there are of the fairest of our sex from a fondness for such diversions and a habitual participation in such society becoming hard bold and disgusting even whilst retaining all their female loveliness of person A lady unless she lives in the most retired parts of the country should never ride alone and even then she will be awkwardly placed in case of accident without an escort In the cities not only is it unfeminine but positively dangerous for a lady to ride unaccompanied by a gentleman or a man servant Although it is impossible within the limits of this little volume to give many hints upon riding a few may not be amiss Like many other accomplishments a teacher is necessary if you wish to attain perfection and no written directions can make you a finished horse woman unless you have had tuition and practice one In mounting you are desired gentle Amazon to spring gracefully into your saddle with the slight assistance of a hand placed beneath the sole of the shoe instead of scrambling uncouthly to your wandering throne as Miss Fanshawe wittily calls it from a high chair as is frequently done by those who have not been properly instructed To mount in the orthodox manner you should stand nearly close to the horse level with the front of the saddle and taking the reins slackly in your right hand you should place that hand on the nearest pommel to secure your balance in rising and with your left hand gather up the front of the habit so as to leave the feet clear The gentleman should place himself firmly near but not so near to you as to impede your rising and with the same view must hold his head well back as should he lose his hat from a whisk of your habit the effect produced is not good You should then present your left foot and the gentleman placing one hand beneath its sole and the other above so as to possess a safe hold should with nice judgment give just such assistance as will enable you easily with a spring to vault gracefully into the saddle You will then arrange your right leg comfortably over the pommel your cavalier will then place your left foot in the stirrup and arrange the flow of the habit skirt and all is complete All this though so seemingly simple and easy requires some little practice to effect neatly and gracefully two Secondly when riding with a gentleman remember that you are best placed on the left side because in that position the graceful flow of your habit is seen to the greatest advantage while it does not inconvenience the gentleman by getting entangled with his stirrup nor does it receive the splashes of his horse three But when you have a double attendance of cavaliers if you be at all a timid rider it may become discreet to pack you forgive the homely phrase between the two since in this position you are the most thoroughly protected from your own horse s shying or from other horses or vehicles approaching you too closely being thus forced to take that part of the road to which the better judgment of your companions inevitably guides you If you be an accomplished equestrian you will prefer being outside and as has been said to the left Sit erect in the middle of your saddle turning your face full towards the head of your horse Cling as closely as possible to the saddle but avoid stooping forward or using your hands to keep you in your seat Nervous motions on horseback are not only ungraceful but dangerous as your horse will not make any allowance for the delicacy of your nerves and may prove his objections to a jerking hand or a twitching rein in a most decided and disagreeable manner The riding dress or habit is best made to fit the figure tightly with tight sleeves It may be open in the front over a neatly fitting chemisette or buttoned close to the throat with a neat linen collar and cuffs The loose sacque is ungraceful but a basque is most becoming on horseback Gauntlet gloves of leather are the most suitable and must be loose enough to give your hand perfect freedom yet not so loose as to interfere with its motions Do not wear the skirt too long it will be dangerous in case of accident and it may prove annoying to your horse Your habit must be made of a material sufficiently heavy to hang gracefully and not move too much with the wind For a winter habit a warmly lined basque trimmed at the throat and hands with fur is an elegant and appropriate dress and a round cap of the same cloth as the habit with a band and pieces to cover the ears of fur to match the dress trimmings makes a handsome and appropriate dress In summer your hat should be of fine straw and slouched to shade the face in winter of felt or if you prefer a close cap of cloth The hat may be trimmed with feathers or knots of ribbon and the shape should be one to protect the complexion at the same time graceful and becoming Avoid any display in a riding dress Choose a material of some dark or neutral tint and never use showy trimmings Curls or any flowing loose style of wearing the hair will be found exceedingly troublesome on horseback Arrange it neatly and compactly under your hat for if a stray curl or lock annoys you or is blown across your eyes by the wind your hands will be too fully occupied to remedy the difficulty Your whip should be light and small tasteful if you will but not showy At the period for which these hints are intended the Modern Languages should form a portion of acquirement As in music an intelligent and assiduous girl may I believe acquire an adequate degree of proficiency in French German and Italian without having been abroad though a foreign tour will be of the greatest use in the acquisition of the accent and niceties of each tongue With respect to French it is no doubt essential to comfort to understand it it is one of the attributes of a lady to speak it well still it is not indispensable to speak it so well that the American lady is mistaken for a Parisian This which but seldom happens can only be acquired in most cases by a residence abroad But French is thoroughly and grammatically taught in America It is only the habit of speaking the idioms and niceties which cannot be acquired except by converse with a native There are hundreds of competent instructors in this country French ladies and gentlemen amongst the number who form classes for conversation and familiarizing their pupils with these very idioms After availing herself of such advantages a young lady will find that a very short residence abroad will improve and facilitate her French conversation Much however will depend upon how you use the opportunities within your reach There are many opportunities of practice in large towns and foreigners give all facilities by their readiness to converse their good nature in listening and in helping the beginner by kind hints If a young lady with simplicity good breeding and good taste endeavors to speak whenever she has an opportunity words will come as if by intuition Do not think of by standers and lookers on think only of the individual to whom you are addressing yourself If possible be not abashed by one or two errors at the first plunge swim on till you have confidence The effort I grant is great and it may be obviated by a foreign education but where this is impossible the freedom acquired will more than repay the exertion In foreign literature walk carefully and if you have an older wiser head than your own to point out the best paths improve the advantage One cannot help deeming it a great era in education that German is cultivated as well as Italian and French and that stores of literature are opened to vary the delights of intellect and to give freshness and interest to the studies of youth The rapture with which the works of Schiller are perused in the original seems to repay the hours devoted to German and I am sure the perusal of Tasso or of the Aristodemo of Monti would reward the study of Italian were not the acquisition of that exquisite language of itself a source of poetic pleasure The modern French writers have increased an everlasting responsibility in corrupting the sources of amusement open to the young readers and it is remarkable that most of the distinguished French authors seem to have felt that they had erred and to have retrieved in some of their works the tendencies of their other productions Take for instance Madame de Stael her books cannot be judged altogether the effect of some of her eloquent and almost incomparable writings varies in an extraordinary degree Whilst Delphine is unfit for the perusal of a modest woman her L Allemagne is finely written throughout and her criticisms and analyses of German writers are full of instruction as well as interest Still the works open to readers of French are numerous The tragedies of Corneille and Racine are forcible and finished and should be read because classical The Alzire of Voltaire and his Zaire with the dramas of Casimir de la Vigne are also worthy of perusal It is not an inspiriting kind of reading but it is rich in sentiment and perfectly unexceptionable in moral tone Although the scepticism of most German writers renders this literature dangerous to a young mind there are fields of pure noble writing open in that language The works of Schiller for example His mind was originally noble his heart good his love to mankind and his enquiry after truth were sincere In early life he wavered and the besetting scepticism of the Germans dimmed for a time his perceptions of all that is most sublime as well as true in our finite knowledge He was chastened he suffered he believed He died an early but a bright instance that great genius may exist with true and humble piety and that the mind is never so powerful as when illumined by divine light His works are a magnificent library in themselves and I could almost say be contented to learn German and to read Schiller Some of his works are open to objection his Bride of Messina portions of The Robbers are better omitted from your collection but Wallenstein and Maria Stuart are noble and admirable productions On this subject and indeed on the whole of German literature Madame de Stael is an excellent guide in her L Allemagne to which I refer the young German student who is sincerely desirous of gleaning the good and avoiding the evil in German compositions Italian literature furnishes a delightful theme for comment It is singular that an enslaved and during many ages a depraved and degraded people should have possessed the purest poetry the least exceptionable drama in Europe There is little to exclude and much to recommend in this beautiful language The works of Tasso abound with high sentiment the Inferno of Dante is a sublime picture of eternal retribution softened with most touching pictures of human woe Happy are those who have leisure to pursue extensively the acquisition of Italian literature they may read and commit to memory without fear of an insidious meaning beneath the polished verse or the prose which has all the charm of poetry Spanish literature will require the same judicious pruning which is necessary in French and German but of all languages it is the most musical for speech and singing A lady in society must if she would not grow utterly weary in company know how to dance It has been the practice among many excellent people to represent the ball room as a pitfall covered with flowers a sheet of breaking ice above all gayety and motion below all darkness and danger It may be that to some minds the ball room may be replete with temptations but there are minds which find temptations everywhere The innocent may be innocent nay the pious may feel devout even in a ball room There is nothing immoral or wrong in dancing it is the tendency of youth to dance it is the first effort of a child the first natural recreation It seems so natural that I confess I am always doubtful of the sincerity of those young ladies who profess to dislike the ball room In the present day you must understand how to move gracefully through quadrilles to dance polka Schottische Varsovienne and waltz To these you may add great variety of dances each season probably bringing a new one Dancing says mister Sheldrake is one of the most healthy as well as one of the most pleasing amusements that can be practised by the young If it is learned from those who are well qualified to teach it and practised as it ought to be consistently with the instructions given it will contribute more to improve the health as well as the form of the human frame than any other exercise For the discovery and promulgation of the true and correct principles according to which dancing should be taught the world is indebted to France a country which has long taken the lead in the elegant arts In France dancing was first raised to the dignity of a science a royal academy being founded for the purpose of teaching and perfecting it in the reign of Louis Quatorze In this academy were trained many of the most distinguished dancers of both sexes One of the most celebrated Madame Simonet gave the following account to mister Sheldrake of the mode of instruction pursued in the academy All the pupils before they were permitted to attempt to dance were completely instructed in what were called the preparatory exercises that is a system of exercises which endued all their limbs with strength firmness elasticity and activity when they had acquired these properties they began to dance In these preparatory exercises the motions were of the most simple kind the object being to teach the pupil gradually and separately all those movements which when combined and rapidly executed constitute dancing Madame Simonet thus described those elementary instructions as gone through by herself She successively learned to stand flat and firm upon both her feet with her limbs quite straight and the whole person perfectly upright but not stiff then to lift one foot from the ground and to keep it so for some time without moving any part of her body she then replaced that foot on the ground and raised the other in the same manner These simple actions were repeated till the pupils were quite familiar with them they were then directed to keep the body quite erect but not stiff and bearing firmly upon one leg to raise the other from the ground gradually and slowly by bending the upper joint of the limb at the same time making the knee straight and putting the toe to its proper extent but no more The foot after it had been kept in this state for some time was returned to the ground from whence it was taken and the other foot treated in the same manner when quite familiarized to these actions they were directed to walk march as some people will call it slowly performing the same motions with the feet alternately The exercises which followed these were upon the turning out of the feet the balancing of the body and other attitudes which need not be particularized mister Sheldrake gives several examples of persons trained upon these initiatory principles to the profession of dancing who have lived in health to a great age This says he is not the chance lot of a few for I have through life been accustomed to see many persons of the same profession I have communicated my own observations to many others and all have agreed in remarking that those who follow this profession have very generally excellent health which very many of them carry into extreme old age This indisputable fact can only be accounted for by supposing that the preparatory exercises which these persons go through are a modification of what I have called regulated muscular tension or action and the early and constant practice of which lays a firm foundation for that high health which accompanies them through life It is upon the same principle that a soldier is never seen with spinal curvature or other personal deformity or a stage dancer of either sex with a deformed person it is perhaps impossible that such things should exist for the plain reason that the exercises which they begin to practice early in life and continue regularly through its whole course render it impossible for them to become so The inference to be drawn from these incontrovertible facts is that if we in very early life teach young children to practice similar exercises and follow them steadily afterwards we shall confirm them in excellent health and prevent the accession of those evils which so often cause deformity to the figure and destruction to the constitution at later periods of life I do not propose to make every boy a soldier or every girl a dancer upon the stage but to adopt the principles by the application of which those persons are trained to the successful practices of their several occupations and so to modify them that they may qualify other classes of society to follow their different pursuits with equal success and I am not without hopes that this undertaking will contribute something towards producing this desirable effect Dancing is an exercise which has been practiced by mankind from the most remote ages With the Egyptians Assyrians and Persians the founders of the three great empires of the ancient world dancing was the favorite exercise or accomplishment and the practice was not less prevalent among their successors in power and importance the Greeks and Romans The Jews also we learn from Scripture were strongly attached to the exercise at all periods of their history At the present day almost every people that exist whether barbarous or civilized has its own form of dancing It is this universality of the exercise that makes dancing a subject of importance Being so extensively practiced it must be the instrument either of good or evil to the human race It is one of the most healthful and elegant amusements and cannot be too highly recommended Among a rude and dissolute people it may degenerate into something worthy of condemnation but all the blessings we have are similarly liable to abuse and it would be most unjust to condemn a cheerful domestic amusement merely because it has at times been degraded by people of low vulgar immoral tastes By all physicians dancing when pursued in moderation is recommended as highly conducive to bodily health and it may be truly said that allied with music nothing is more conducive to mental health more calculated to drive away melancholy and put the whole temper into good humor Dancing is the poetry of motion It must be performed with ease and grace and always with a perfect regard for propriety of movement As an art it is taught by professed masters and one of the leading rules given to the learner is to raise and lower herself gracefully on the elastic part of her feet and to keep perfect time to the music Dancing is really a simple and elegant gliding on the toes which bend more or less to accommodate the steps and prevent harsh ungraceful motion The most popular dances of the present day are first the quadrille These are of French origin comparatively tranquil in their character and generally danced once or more in every party They are danced by four couples one standing on each side of a square There are many sets of quadrilles the figures in each varying from the others But there are five figures in each set The plain fancy Lancers Polka Mazourka and German are among the most popular In plain quadrilles a lady takes no steps merely walking gracefully through the figures but her feet must keep perfect time to the music and she must know the changes of position perfectly A quadrille may be very properly described as a conversation dance as there are long pauses between the figures when the dancers must have a fund of small talk ready for their partners When moving in the figures hold out your skirt a little with the right hand merely to clear the ground and prevent the possibility of treading upon it Next come the round dances the Valse Polka Schottische Varsovienne and Redowa The Waltz is danced both a troistemps and deuxtemps In the waltz the position is a most important point You may so lean upon your partner s arm and so carry your figure that the prudish can find but little fault but you can also make the dance a most immodest one I cannot within the limits of my book go into a long argument as to the propriety of these round dances Opinions differ and I am not writing a sermon but giving as far as is in my power hints to ladies in society It is therefore enough for me to know that these dances are tolerated and that even were I so inclined I could not exclude them To return to the position Stand a little to the right of your partner that in clasping your waist he may draw you upon his arm to his shoulder not his breast the last position is awkward By observing the first you have your head free turn it a little towards the left shoulder need I say never lay it upon your partner s shoulder Throw the head and shoulders a little back not too much to be consistent with easy grace place one hand upon your partner s shoulder and the other in his disengaged hand So you are ready to start The waltz may be danced to very fast time or to slow music The last is the most graceful and there is not so much danger of giddiness Grace can only be gained by a perfect timing of the steps to the music and also evenness of step It is when properly timed with perfect step and easy gliding motion the most graceful of dances The Germans who dance for the sake of dancing will only allow a certain number of waltzers on the floor at one time and these waltz in streams all going down one side of the room and up the other thus rendering collisions impossible An English writer in a recent work published on etiquette speaks of waltzing thus It is perhaps useless to recommend flat foot waltzing in this country where ladies allow themselves to be almost hugged by their partners and where men think it necessary to lift a lady almost off the ground but I am persuaded that if it were introduced the outcry against the impropriety of waltzing would soon cease Nothing can be more delicate than the way in which a German holds his partner It is impossible to dance on the flat foot unless the lady and gentleman are quite free of one another His hand therefore goes no further round her waist than to the hooks and eyes of her dress hers no higher than to his elbow Thus danced the waltz is smooth graceful and delicate and we could never in Germany complain of our daughter s languishing on a young man s shoulder On the other hand nothing is more graceless and absurd than to see a man waltzing on the tips of his toes lifting his partner off the ground or twirling round and round with her like the figures on a street organ The test of waltzing in time is to be able to stamp the time with the left foot The waltz is of German origin but where it is still danced in Germany in the original manner as for instance among the peasants of the Tyrol it is a very different dance It is there very slow and graceful the feet are thrown out in a single long step which Turveydrop I presume would call a jete After a few turns the partners waltz alone in the same step the man keeping the time by striking together his iron shod heels until with a shout and clapping of hands he again clasps his partner and continues in the same slow measure with her The position for the polka redowa and other round dances should be the same as that for the waltz and for the steps they can only be acquired from a dancing teacher and are impossible to describe properly One of the most delightful accomplishments which a lady can possess and one which is unfortunately but little cultivated is the art of reading aloud well reading with expression taste animation and correctness and this art once acquired let her also be able to recite well Long lectures may be given upon elocution but the advice can be condensed into two directions First be sure you pronounce accent and enunciate every word correctly then throw your whole soul into the words Study your author carefully that you may know precisely what he means by each expression and then try to bury your personal identity to become for the time the character you represent One of the most delightful ways to spend a social evening is to devote it to dramatic literature Invite only guests who read well or who are really interested listeners and select a play or scenes from several plays and cast the parts among your guests All jealousy must be put aside and to night s Hamlet must condescend to direct Richard to Stand by my lord and let the coffin pass to morrow After a few meetings the peculiar talent of each reader will be recognized and you can select your tragedy hero comedy hero queen chambermaid and other members of the force with a view to the display of each one s best powers Vary the entertainment by reciting monologues and dialogues A whole play will often be found tiresome it is best to select several scenes keeping up the thread of the plot and introducing the best characters and leave out what is mere interlude and dispense with some of the subordinate characters Leave one end of the room entirely vacant for the readers You will find it more interesting to have the readers stand and use some little motion the words will flow more easily the expressions come more forcibly if the appropriate gesture is made Love scenes will of course require delicate handling and embracing can be easily omitted neither would I recommend the action of a dueling scene or a murder but merely to add gesture enough to give interest to both readers and audience You will find some little difficulty from bashfulness and the don t like to people at first but soon you will discover with delight how many of your friends possess the talent for reading well and never knew it themselves You will do well to take a few lessons in elocution but you need not fear to read if you have never made the accomplishment a study With a correct knowledge of your own language and a love for fine writing you will soon read well Give to every part you undertake the full effect intended by the writer Do not throw all your energy your whole soul into a leading part at one time and slight a subordinate character at another If you have but five words to read read them as they would be spoken were you the character you represent for the time To hear a splendidly written tragic burst of passion read in a weak whining voice is no worse than to have a few simple words from a servant s lips delivered with the gesture and emphasis suited to a Medea or Lady Macbeth I shall be condemned by many serious and well judging persons if I say one word in favor of private theatricals yet as it appears to me there are in these diversions some advantages which are not to be found to excuse the waltz or the polka or the ballet or the hunting field In private theatricals there is the possibility of some benefit The study of the finest dramatists especially of Shakespeare is not likely to demoralize the mind or to cool the enthusiasm for what is good We can scarcely know too well those works which have tended more to form character than any collection of any kind whatsoever Shakespeare Sheridan Bulwer but I cannot go through the list of fine dramatic writers whose works elevate the mind and taste The plays of Sheridan Knowles and Bulwer are in most instances well adapted for private representations the most exquisite delineations of female character may be found in the dramatic library and high pure manly thoughts may be traced line after line to the same source Private theatricals should however be regulated with much judgment I see no reason to restrict too severely talent of this kind where it exists any more than to crush a dawning taste for the other fine arts What we have to do is to raise and direct it never to let it occupy too much time nor to become the business of life never to let it infringe upon duties never to allow it to lead us into an unreasonable and therefore criminal expense Our ancestors were content to strew their stage at the end of their halls with rushes and to hang up the name of the scene instead of a scene before each act The best preparations which generally render private theatricals both laborious and expensive add but little to the pleasure of the beholders whose attention is fixed upon the actors and who can always see far finer scenes at a minor theatre than at any private theatricals Were we content with greater simplicity in our amusements how much vain ostentation heart sickening expense self recrimination and trouble might be avoided As a valid objection to private theatricals it has been urged that they are apt to encourage a taste for the green room of the public theatre in young men and boys in women the risk is less for few women are ever known to go on the stage except from necessity I own this objection to theatricals is the greatest that can be urged It can only be answered in mitigation that where there exists a taste of the kind it is better that it should be indulged at home instead of at the theatre with the modest inmates of a well governed house instead of with professional actors Like all other amusements the abuse is probable but the power of restraint rests within ourselves Under the same head as private theatricals may come dramatized charades and proverbs so much in fashion at the present time These last have some great advantages over the standard plays they are better suited to a parlor they do not provoke comparison between the young actors and the favorite public idols they require but little scenery and arrangement they are short and they do not require so many subordinate characters Impromptu charades and proverbs are delightful and are the occasion for much merriment the mistakes the absurd contrasts between character and costume the scenery a deep hanging wood the court of Louis Quatorze or the deck of a man of war being improvised at a moment s notice only add to the merry enjoyment One rule you must observe if you join in these amusements never to carry your gayety into romping Merry and laughing you may be yet never forget you are a lady You may personate a newly caught Irish chambermaid use the broadest brogue wear the commonest dress throw yourself heartily and thoroughly into the part losing your personal identity almost entirely and yet you may retain that nameless charm which will place you in the mind of each of the audience as a lady of refinement You must also be perfectly good natured and self sacrificing ready to play the smallest parts with the same interest you would throw into the principal ones Try to throw out all the good points in the parts taken by the other members of the company If you play an insignificant part play it well with all the grace you can make the most of it but do not try to raise it to the first place Yield gracefully the prominent position to those who claim it in the plot of the play and never try by conspicuous dress or by play to go beyond the position set down for you Another delightful accomplishment and one which will aid you if you are studying drawing and painting is that of arranging tableaux vivants missus Severn gives the following hints upon this subject Perhaps there is no intellectual amusement in fashionable life the nature of which is so little understood as the tableau vivant it being generally considered as only a vehicle for display whereas its real purpose is to arrange scientifically a combination of natural objects so as to make a good picture according to the rules of art A tableau vivant is literally what its name imports a living picture composed of living persons and when skilfully arranged and seen at a proper distance it produces all the effect of a real picture It is said that the first living picture was contrived by a profligate young German nobleman who having during the absence of his father sold one of the celebrated pictures belonging to the old castle which was an heir loom to conceal the deficiency placed some of his companions behind the frame so as to imitate the missing picture and to deceive his father who passed through the room without being conscious of his loss A tableau vivant may be formed in two ways it may consist of a group of persons who take some well known subject in history or fiction to illustrate and who form a group to tell the story according to their own taste or it may be a copy as exact as circumstances will permit of some celebrated picture The first plan it may be easily imagined is very rarely effective since as we find that even the best masters are often months or even years before they can arrange a group satisfactorily on canvas it is not probable that persons who are not artists should succeed in making good impromptu pictures Indeed it has been observed that artists themselves when they have to arrange a tableau vivant always prefer copying a picture to composing one Copying a real picture by placing living persons in the positions of the figures indicated in the picture appears at first sight an easy task enough and the effect ought to be easily attained as there can be no bad drawing and no confused light and shade to destroy the effect of the grouping There are however many difficulties to conquer which it requires some knowledge of art to be aware of Painting being on a flat surface every means are taken to give roundness and relief to the figures which qualities of course are found naturally in a tableau vivant In a picture the light is made effective by a dark shadow placed near it diminished lights or demi tints are introduced to prevent the principal light appearing a spot and these are linked together by artful shades which show the outline in some places and hide it in others The colors must also be carefully arranged so as to blend or harmonize with each other A want of attention to these minute points will be sufficient to destroy the effect of the finest picture even to those who are so unacquainted with art as to be incapable of explaining why they are dissatisfied except by an involuntary liking or disliking of what they see The best place for putting up a tableau vivant is in a door way with an equal space on each side or at least some space on both sides is necessary and if there is a room or a passage between the door selected for the picture and the room the company is to see it from so much the better as there should be a distance of at least four yards between the first row of the spectators and the picture It must be remembered that while the tableau is being shown nearly all the lights must be put out in the room where the company is assembled and perhaps only one single candle properly placed in the intervening space between the company and the tableau must be left slightly to illuminate the frame In the above mentioned door way a frame somewhat smaller than the original picture must be suspended three four or even five feet from the floor as may suit the height of the door or if the door is not very high the frame may be put one or two feet behind to gain space but care must be taken to fill up the opening that would in that case show between the door way and the frame also a piece of dark cloth ought to be put from the bottom of the frame to the ground to give the appearance of the picture hanging on the wall The most important thing is that the chairs or tables ought to be placed behind the frame so that the persons who are to represent the tableau may sit or stand as nearly in the position with regard to the frame as the figures appear to do in the real picture they are trying to imitate and at about two feet from the frame so that the light which is attached to the back of the frame may fall properly on the figures In order to accomplish this great study and contrivance are required so that the shades may fall in precisely the same places as in the original picture and sometimes the light is put on one side sometimes on the other and often on the top and sometimes shades of tin or paper are put between the lights and the tableaux to assist in throwing a shadow over any particular part The background is one of the most important parts and should be made to resemble that of the picture as nearly as possible if it is dark coarse cloth absorbs the light best but whether it is to be black blue or brown must depend on the tint of the picture should the background be a light one colored calico turned on the wrong side is generally used If trees or flowers form the background of course real branches or plants must be introduced to imitate those in the picture Even rocks have been imitated and spun glass has often successfully represented water A thin black gauze black muslin or tarlatan veil should be fastened to the top of the frame on the outside of it through which the tableau is to be seen Care ought to be taken to conceal the peculiarities of the different materials used in the draperies and it is even sometimes necessary to cover the stuffs used for the purpose with a gauze of a different color so as to imitate the broken and transparent colors found in most good pictures This carefully attended to will give a quietness and simplicity to the whole which will greatly add to the illusion The next subject upon the list of accomplishments should be filled by some words upon fancy sewing Under this head will come Crochet Knitting Tapestry work Embroidery Chenille work Netting Canvas work Berlin wool work Frame work Braiding Bead work et cetera Small social gatherings will be much more entertaining the time will pass much more quickly and the conversation flows more freely if the fingers are employed with some light work Pretty presents nay beautiful ones may be made in this way when the fingers would otherwise be idle and these will have an additional value in being the work of your own hands From the most remote ages needlework has been not only a source of pecuniary advantage for poor women but also of pleasant pastime for the rich It is one of the most elegant of the imitative art and from time immemorial it has been an amusement for otherwise idle fingers from the cottage to the palace I have not space for a long disquisition upon the uses and pleasures of fancy work every woman has moments when such pretty playwork will be a valuable recreation The taste for fancy work increases daily and can be made not only ornamental but useful A ladies wardrobe consists of so many and such varied objects that the evenings of an entire winter may be spent in making various useful garments which are at the same time suitable for company sewing Opera hoods wool shawls sleeves Sontags and other ladies articles may be varied by embroidering smoking caps slippers or handkerchiefs for gentlemen Embroidering on canvas or tapestry work opens a large field for taste and skill in execution Beautiful articles for presents chair covers sofa cushions slippers may be worked in the otherwise idle moments spent in familiar society and the fingers will soon acquire skill and astonishing rapidity The German ladies have constantly on hand a piece of netting or other fancy work which they carry from place to place and take out when conversing and so far from entirely engrossing their thoughts they chat more readily and freely with their fingers thus employed American ladies will find the custom worth imitating Many tedious hours will be smoothly pleasantly passed with the mind free but the fingers pleasantly occupied An evening passed in sewing or knitting with one good reader to entertain the industrious workers will be found very pleasant I have known a circle of young people meet every week to work in this way the reader being changed twice or three times in the course of the evening and these meetings have proved so pleasant that scarcely any member failed to plead prior engagement if invited out upon the evening appointed to read and sew It was formerly objected by the adversaries to mental cultivation in women that the acquirement of book learning would make them neglect needlework but so far from this being the case the present which is often called the age of learning is preeminently a working age Never were fingers more actively engaged than those of the rising female generation braiding embroidery Berlin work knitting netting and crochet are all in full play A long neglected work has been recently revived called by the French La Frivolite It is very pretty evening work partly because it does not impede conversation for it may be carried on almost without looking at it and partly because no other work shows to so much advantage the grace and delicacy of the hands The most simple form of this work was anciently known under the name of Tatting but that only consisted of a series of loops in a straight line which were used for trimming linen articles and which was not so pretty as La Frivolite which has varieties which are a good imitation of point and may be used for collars and sleeves I give a few specimens of pretty work for evening sewing and refer the reader to The Ladies Handbook of Embroidery published by G G Evans for a full complete description of every kind of fancy work with specimens patterns and clear plain directions NETTED CUFFS These cuffs are very pretty and easy to make They are in plain netting and will require white and five shades of scarlet wool Set on thirty five stitches of the white wool Net five rows then take a mesh a very little larger and widen by netting two stitches in every stitch Then net with the smallest mesh the two lightest shades one row of each and two rows of the other three shades Then graduate the shades back again to white narrowing the first row of white with the larger mesh Net ten rows with the smaller mesh widen again repeat the shades of red narrow again and finish with the five rows of white KNITTED OPERA CAP MATERIALS REQUIRED Half an ounce of white and half an ounce of shaded Berlin wool will be sufficient Cast on a hundred stitches with white wool and knit and pearl alternately for four rows Shaded wool Knit one row plain next row bring forward and take two together to the end White wool Knit and pearl alternately four rows Shaded wool Knit plain six rows White wool Knit a row decreasing it by taking the first two stitches together and the last two Pearl a row Knit a row decreasing it as before Pearl a row Shaded wool Knit a row decreasing at the beginning and end Next row bring

row White wool Knit and pearl alternately for four rows decrease at the beginning and ending of the two plain rows Knit eighteen plain stitches run a piece of cotton through the remaining sixty two stitches Pearl and knit alternately decreasing at the beginning and ending of every plain row until you have four stitches remaining cast them off then take up eighteen stitches on the opposite sides and work a piece to correspond leaving forty four centre stitches on the cotton Take up the centre stitches on a needle pointed at both ends draw the cotton out then pick up fourteen stitches at each end of the needle Shaded wool Knit two plain rows White wool Knit one plain row Next row wool forward knit two together to the end of the row Shaded wool Knit two plain rows and cast off Join the two points together at the back of the cap Fold the front at the first pattern row and hem it to form the scallop at the edge Pick up eighty stitches at the back of the cap AN ECONOMICAL POINT COLLAR It is well known that worked muslin collars particularly if the work is good very soon wear out as the work is too heavy for the muslin which when it has been washed two or three times becomes full of slits and holes though the work is still as good as ever When this is the case cut the muslin off the work with a pair of sharp scissors and lay the work on the pattern of a collar cut in paper so as to fill the whole of the pattern The work may be taken from two or three collars the arrangement of it must depend upon taste When the cut out work is properly arranged it must be tacked or basted to the paper pattern and this is best done with colored thread that no mistake may arise when the basting threads are to be drawn out Four or six threads are then drawn from one piece of work to another with a needle and cotton so as to attach them together and the loose threads are then overcast like button holes so as to imitate the uniting threads of point lace When well done with a sufficient quantity of the uniting threads to make the work firm these collars are handsome and will wash and wear well KNITTED VEILS It is now customary to knit white veils of what is called Lady Betty s wool for babies to put over their faces when they are carried out in cold weather instead of pocket handkerchiefs which were formerly used for the purpose though they were very unfit for it Knitted veils in black silk or worsted are also worn by grown up persons The veils for babies are very simple in their construction they consist of oblong pieces of knitting of any width and depth that may be required with knitted lace at the bottom and sides and a string case at the top The following pattern is the most common Knit and pearl alternately four rows so that there may be two of each then bring forward and take two together an entire row This pattern is repeated through the entire veil and it must be observed that as many stitches must be cast on as will make it of the necessary width The needles should be of the smallest size of bone Any lace will do but the following pattern though not new is both pretty and suitable and has besides the important recomendation of being very easy Cast on eleven stitches and knit a row plain then begin the pattern first row Knit three bring forward and take two together knit one take two together put the thread twice round the needle take two together and knit one second row Knit two pearl one knit one put the thread twice round the needle take two together bring forward and knit five third row Knit three bring forward take two together knit one bring forward knit two pearl one bring forward take two together and knit two fourth row Knit two bring forward knit five bring forward take two together knit five fifth row Knit three bring forward and take two together knit the rest plain sixth row Cast off four and knit the rest plain HINTS TO CROCHET WORKERS Examine carefully the form of the needle and try the hook to ascertain that it is perfectly smooth Some are so sharp and ill made as to tear the cotton Select those which are not of uniform thickness up to the hook the best are those which are thinner there than an inch farther up Where the needle is not proportionally fine near the hook it is almost impossible to keep the work even Chain stitch ought to be done rather loosely as working on it afterwards contracts it and is apt to give it a puckered appearance It is often advisable to use a needle one size larger for making the chain than for the rest of the work especially in edgings It will be found much easier to work the succeeding rows when this precaution is taken Crochet needles should be kept in a housewife similar to those used for ordinary needles The slightest soil or rust should be effaced with fine sandpaper ORNAMENTAL NET FOR THE HAIR Take two pieces of fine silk braid scarlet or royal blue and a No three bone crochet hook Make a chain of eight stitches unite the ends and then D C the first round putting two stitches into each loop there will now be sixteen stitches and in the next round one long must be worked into every stitch and two chain between each long the round will now consist of forty eight stitches and we commence the pattern or diamonds third round Three long two chain four long with two chain after each and these long put into every second loop repeat fourth round Five long two chain five long with two chain after each and these long put into every second loop with the exception of the fifth or last of them which must skip two stitches instead of one repeat fifth round Seven long two chain seven long with two chain after each and each of these long put into every second stitch repeat sixth round Five long two chain five long with two chain after each and each of these long put into every other stitch three long two chain five long again with two chain after each and each put into every second stitch repeat from beginning seventh round Three long two chain five long with two chain after each and worked in every third loop five long two chain five long again with two chain after each and these long worked as aforesaid in every third loop repeat from beginning eighth round One long two chain five long with two chain after each and these long put into every third stitch seven long two chain again five long c c repeat from beginning ninth round Six long with two chain after each and work in every third stitch five long twelve long with two chain after each these long put in every third stitch repeat the pattern in brackets tenth round Nine long with two chain after them these long being worked in every second loop three long two chain nineteen long with two chain after them and the long worked in every second loop repeat the pattern in brackets eleventh twelfth and thirteenth rounds A long and two chain all round and the long being worked alternately in every second and third loop care being taken to bring one into the position to complete each diamond as it is come to A crochet edging begun with braid and the last two or three rows worked with gold twist as nearly the size of the braid as may be and a cord and tassels finish off this elegant head dress The cord should be run in and out through the thirteenth round We however prefer a single crochet band of some fifty stitches long and six or eight wide worked in the same material as the net to a cord and this band may be finished off with a piece of gold fringe instead of tassels at the ends or with a scallop of edging crocheted in gold twist DRESS GLOVE BANDS FULL OR FRILLED SHAPE Take three pieces of fine embroidery chenille and a No three bone crochet hook Make a chain of about forty stitches or one long enough to go round the wrist Dc one row third row Two long one chain and miss a stitch repeat this all along Then one row Dc sixth row Long crochet worked very loosely so much so as to leave these stitches at least half an inch high two stitches to be put into every second or third loop and one in each of the others all the way along fasten off Join the chenille now on to the first row and work a similar row or frill to the one just directed so that there be one on each side Run a narrow velvet through the holes of the third row and affix wider velvet ends or chenille tassels to each extremity Finish off with a button and loop and flute the frill on each side over the finger to make it set We need scarcely say that the chenille used should be selected to match or agree with the evening dress and that the velvet must match the chenille These bands may be made to look very handsome by working a row of Dc loosely and evenly along the edge of each frill with gold or silver twist and running a band of gold or silver braid or trimming through the holes in the third row instead of velvet Then small bullion tassels to match the twist will form a suitable and elegant finish These bands may be worked round and slid over the hand like muffatees or made open as we have directed and buttoned like the glove The buttons should be covered with crochet and the loops crocheted KNITTED UNDER HABIT SHIRT Three ounces of Three thread White Fleecy Wool Pair of No ten Bone Knitting Pins Cast on forty five stitches Knit three rows fourth row Knit ten X make two and knit two together knit one X knit the last six stitches fifth row Knit dropping the second of each of the two made stitches all along Knit eight rows fourteenth row Knit ten X make one and knit two together X repeat until six remain knit three make one knit three fifteenth row Knit six X make one and knit two together X repeat until ten remain which knit Repeat these two rows three times more each only not enlarging one as in the end of row fourteen every time but only once in four rows merely knitting the six in the intervening rows twenty second row Knit Knit the next seven rows thirtieth row Same as fourteenth thirty first row Same as fifteenth Keep on alternately knitting eight open and then eight knitted rows and enlarging one stitch at the end in every fourth row until there are a hundred and twenty four rows Then decrease one stitch at the beginning or front in every other row for thirty two rows still continuing the pattern as before and still enlarging one stitch in every fourth row at the end or back This shapes one side of the neck Now knit forty eight rows without increase or decrease at either end continuing the pattern or alternation of eight open and eight plain knitted rows This forms the back of the neck and the bottom of the back of the habit shirt In the next thirty two rows we diminish one in every fourth row by knitting two together at the back while at the same time in every fourth row at the back we knit two together and make one in order to form a series of holes or pattern parallel to that on the other side caused by enlarging in every fourth row We also cast on one at the opposite end in every other row to shape the second side of the neck We then knit one hundred and twelve rows having each ten knitted stitches in the front of the habit shirt as on the opposite side and six at the back and decreasing one in every fourth row at the back and continuing the pattern and also the series of holes at the back Knit eight rows Knit ten stitches X make two and knit two together X knit six at end Knit all dropping the second of each of the two made stitches Knit two rows cast off Now with same needles pick up the stitches all along the right front of the habit shirt knit two rows and cast off Do the same on the left front Then pick up those of the neck and do the same shaping it if necessary by knitting two together occasionally These finishing off rows look pretty done in pale pink or blue wool Button holes may be made thus in the front or where the ten stitches are and about once in thirty rows knit three cast off four knit three instead of knitting the ten as usual Next row when we get back to the ten stitches knit three cast on four knit three INFANT S KNITTED SOCKS Half an ounce of White Lamb s Wool Three No thirteen Knitting Needles Cast on Thirty stitches

times more each of them twelfth row Knit two make a stitch according to directions above given knit rest until four remain knit two together knit two thirteenth row Knit Repeat these two rows alternately three times more each twentieth row Knit two enlarge one as before directed knit rest until two remain enlarge one knit two twenty first row Knit Repeat these two rows alternately three more times each twenty eighth row Knit twenty ninth row Knit fourteen stitches and leave the other upon the needle Take up the third needle and knit twenty rows more of fourteen stitches each forty ninth row Knit two together knit twelve on same needle and with same wool cast on twenty seven stitches fiftieth row Knit fifty first row Knit two knit two together knit rest until four remain knit two together knit two fifty second row Knit Repeat these two rows alternately twice more each fifty seventh row Knit two make one in manner directed knit rest until four remain knit two together knit two fifty eighth row Knit Repeat these two rows alternately three times more each sixty fifth row Knit all until four remain knit two together knit two sixty sixth row Knit Repeat these two rows alternately four more times each seventy fifth row Knit seventy sixth row Cast off This completes the slipper portion of the sock We now begin the instep piece Take the wool and knit off ten stitches from the needle on which the twenty seven stitches were left knit these ten from the toe end or that where the twenty rows of fourteen stitches each has been made leave the remaining seventeen stitches still on the same needle Knit twenty rows of ten stitches and in every other one pick up the edge stitch of the toe piece and knit it with the tenth stitch so as to unite these two portions viz the toe and the instep With each stitch of the twentieth row an edge stitch of the side at the toe end of the slipper must be picked up knitted and cast off and a neat and entire union of the toe of the slipper and the instep piece formed This instep piece is to be ribbed in rows of four viz four rows in which the plain side is uppermost and four rows in which the pearled side is uppermost We now commence the leg portion of the sock With the needle which has been left in the first side of the slipper carefully pick up the edge stitches all along the instep piece and side of the slipper when this is done there should be about fifty on the needle Take the wool and knit all along including the picked up stitches and the seventeen originally on the needle Knit two rows fourth row Knit two X make two not by picking up but in the ordinary way by passing the wool twice over the needle and knit two together knit one X repeat fifth row Knit all casting off one of each of the double made stitches Now knit twenty rows ribbed like the instep piece twenty sixth row X Knit one make one and knit two together X repeat all round twenty seventh row Knit twenty eighth row Knit two X make one and knit two together knit one X repeat twenty ninth thirtieth and thirty first rows Knit thirty second row Cast off Take a wool needle thread it with wool and sew up the sock neatly stitch for stitch from the top of the leg to the point of the sole then sew the toe turn it put on a little rosette of raveled wool run a ribbon in and out through the holes at rows four and five of the leg portion and it is completed As this is intended for an Infant s Sock we have ordered white wool that being most useful should it however be wished to knit socks for an older baby the slipper may be made of Cerise Scarlet Pale Blue Green or Straw colored wool and the twenty sixth twenty seventh and twenty eighth rows of the leg portion and the casting off done in the color of the slipper while the instep piece and the rest of the sock are made in white wool The sock may also be enlarged by casting on extra stitches in the beginning and adding a couple of rows to each of the divisions of the slipper part and enough to the toe to preserve its form and symmetry Almost any of the open anti maccassar patterns may be used for knitting the sock and instep piece if a light lace like appearance is desired The well known rose leaf pattern looks particularly pretty CHAPTER XXII SERVANTS An English writer speaking of servants says There is no question but that we should seek to perform all our duties without hope of recompense and yet as regards our treatment of servants we should be especially careful that in endeavoring to make their bodily comfort and mental improvement an object of consideration we do not allow ourselves to dwell on the hope of gratitude or affection from them in return Many have done so and having with that view been tempted to accord unwise indulgences and to overlook serious faults they have found that far from gaining the love of their servants they have incurred their contempt and when they have perceived that their favors unappreciated have led but to new encroachments they have hardened their hearts and rushed into an opposite extreme Then they have considered their servants as mere machines from which labor must be extorted by all available means A man servant is rarely grateful and seldom attached He is generally incapable of appreciating those advantages which with your cultivated judgment you know to be the most conducive to his welfare Do you accord to him regular hours a stated allowance of work do you refrain from sending him out because it is wet and he is unwell do you serve yourself rather than ring for him at dinner time he will rarely have the grace to thank you in his heart for your constant consideration Hear him He will thus describe a comfortable place There were very few in the family when they went out of a night we made it up of a morning we had nice hot suppers and the cook made a good hash for breakfast and we always got luncheon between that and dinner and we were all very comfortable together and had a friend in when we liked Master swore at us sometimes but often made us a present for it when he had been very violent a good hearted man as ever lived and mistress was quite the lady and never meddled with servants It was a capital place Servants sympathies are with their equals They feel for a poor servant run off his legs and moped to death they have no feeling for a pains taking mistress economical both from principle and scanty means they would most of them see her property wasted and her confidence abused without compunction It is the last effort of a virtue in a servant if without any private reason he should discharge his duty by informing you of the injury which you are enduring at the hands of his fellow servant It is an effort of virtue for it will bring down many a bitter taunt and hard word upon his faithful head I never got a servant out of a place by telling tales on him will be said to him Directly a servant departs we all know tongues tied before are loosed to gain our favor by apparent candor When it can avail us nothing we are told We all know this and have said Be silent now you should have mentioned this at the time Supposing then you have the rara avis the servant that speaks at the time be chary of him or let me say her the best servants are women Oh as you value her let her not suppose you cannot part with her Treat her with confidence but with strict impartiality reprove when necessary mildly but decidedly lest she should presume power is so tempting and compel you if you would retain your freedom to let her go There is one thing a man servant values beyond all that your kindness and your consideration can do for him his liberty liberty to eat drink and be merry with your things in the company of his own friends liberty to get the housemaid to clean his candlesticks and bring up his coals and the housemaid wishes for liberty to lie in bed in the morning because she was up so late talking to John in the pantry liberty to wear flounces and flowers The cook desires liberty too For this liberty if you grant it they will despise you if you deny it they will respect you Aim at their esteem despair of their love or gratitude make your place what the best class of servants will value and though in their heart they may not thank you for it you will gain perhaps one servant out of twenty who will keep gross imposition and gross immorality at bay These remarks can never be intended to deny the warm attachment of female servants to the children of their employers Deep love no doubt is lavished by many a woman on the babe she has nursed There is a great deal to be said on the chapter of nurses which would require to be dealt with by itself Much wisdom is required in the administration of a nursery to which few general rules would apply Cruel is the tyranny the nurse frequently practises on the parent who often refrains from entering her nursery not from want of love to her children but positive dread of the sour looks which greet her Let her be firm let no shrinking from grieving her darling who would break his heart if his Nanna went deter her from discharging the encroaching servant I know a lady who was quietly informed by her nurse that she must have a specified hour for visiting her children for that her entering without ceremony was most inconvenient The poor young lady who was fully persuaded her delicate infant would die if removed to a stranger s hands meekly obeyed and though tortured by the cries of the poor sickly baby never dared to intrude lest the nurse should abandon it This is a true history and the sequel may as well be given that the nurse remained seven years at the end of which time having become insupportable though really devoted to the children she gave warning and though it cost her mistress bitter tears and much resolution she was suffered to depart and then peace entered that house On the choice of servants much of the comfort of the young housekeeper depends It often happens that her choice has been determined by appearance rather than the value of character If such be the case she will have many difficulties to encounter It is in the present day hardly safe to take a servant if there be a single objection to character however it may be glossed over by the person referred to on this point for there is now an unhealthy disposition to pass over the failings of servants who have left their places and to make them perfect in the eyes of others In respect to sobriety many people will not acknowledge that a servant had had the vice of drinking but will cover the unpleasant truth in such gentle and plausible terms that it becomes difficult to comprehend how far the hint is grounded or not Be assured when a lady or gentleman hesitates on this point or on that of honesty it is wiser not to engage a servant Nor are you deviating from Christian charity in not overlooking a dereliction of so material a sort The kindest plan to the vast community of domestic servants is to be rigid in all important points and having after a due experience a just confidence in them to be somewhat indulgent to errors of a more trivial nature If all young housekeepers were strict upon the subject of dress much misery to servants would be saved much temptation avoided and self reproach prevented Instead of this kind and wise and matronly particularity a type of the good old fashioned common sense of our grandmothers ladies now countenance their ladies maids in discontinuing caps or if they have caps in wearing flowers and lace flowered gowns and other items of little apparent moment in detail but of much importance to a community as serviceable to the public when well managed and respectable as they are odious and noxious when immoral or insolent After these cruel indulgences ladies marvel when they find servants rise above their station and that they will not bear even a mild reproof they wonder that a plain useful servant is nowhere to be met with There is now no medium between the fine lady with mittens and flowers who dresses your hair and the dirty sloven of a lodging house All housemaids must now be upper housemaids cooks must be cooks and housekeepers The homely housemaid that invaluable character in her way is indeed difficult to be found and at a time when cleanliness is at its zenith the rarity is to discover any one who will clean All except the raw country girl expect to have deputies and if we go on to perfection in this unhealthy system we shall soon have no working servants above twenty years of age The consequence is that a greater number of servants are kept in every household than formerly in similar families many of these menials are corrupted by congregating together and by idleness The loud and crying complaints of the worthlessness of this class are but too justly founded That they are more mercenary than ever is owing to the pernicious system which lifts them up above their condition but fails to elevate them in the moral standard In the scale of virtue they sink every day lower and lower in the outward attributes they are as they consider it raised in character and improved in appearance But is it so The beauty of every thing is fitness Is the half fine unlady like yet lady like creature who answers to your dressing room bell half so respectable as the old fashioned plainly dressed careful homely maiden of your young days Is it not with a feeling of disgust that you turn from the attempted finery and sigh for plain collars and caps undecked by flowers again I think among the best bred the most sensible and indeed the most highly born people of a superior stamp this disgust is so strong that in some families a grave and suitable costume is introduced for the female servants and the effect is satisfactory both on the appearance and on the mode of thinking of these persons But this wise and therefore kind plan is far from being general and I have heard that a lady s maid complained to her mistress that she found herself the subject of ridicule owing to her not wearing silks and indeed satins as the other ladies maids did It becomes the duty of ladies of influence to rise above the silly vanity which I fear affects some of them of seeing their ladies maids as smart as ladies and to oppose innovations on the decencies of society so pernicious to the class upon whom much of our comfort depends In setting out in life a young married lady ought to be more than ordinarily strict in these matters for her inexperience will certainly be taken advantage of to some extent If she be rich enough to have a housekeeper let her endeavor to select one of strict religious faith plain in attire grave but kind and of good sense and even intelligence for cultivation of mind will never whatever may be stated detract from the utility of a servant It is absurd to attribute to the diffusion of knowledge the deterioration of servants it is rather owing to the scanty amount of knowledge among them Most superficial is the education about which so much is said and written were servants more thoroughly grounded in many branches of knowledge they would be wiser less rapacious more systematic and better contented than they are They are wretched reasoners generally losing sight of their own true interest and grasping at that which is unreal and visionary If they were better educated this would not be the case they would be less vain less credulous they would know what qualities to respect they would weigh better the advantage of their lot and they would work better as servants They would give mind where now they only give hands and their acquirements taken from school as they are in very early youth are not ever likely to be such as to make the routine of their work distasteful to them from over refinement or cultivation It is always desirable to have if possible servants of one faith But if it so happens that you have a Roman Catholic servant and a Protestant in your service you are bound to allow each the free exercise of her religion and you ought not to respect them if out of interest they will conform to yours An exercise of authority on this point amounts in my opinion to an act of tyranny and it can only tend to promote insincerity and perhaps engender scepticism in its object Nothing is indeed so dangerous as to unsettle the faith of the lower classes who have neither time nor opportunity of fairly considering subjects of religious controversy While on the subject of servants I must deprecate the over indulgence of the present system towards them Formerly they were treated with real kindness but it was the kindness that exacted duty in return and took a real interest in the welfare of each servant The reciprocal tie in former times between servant and master was strong now it is wholly gone The easy rule of masters and mistresses proceeds far more from indifference than from kindness of heart for the real charity is to keep servants steadily to their duties They are a class of persons to whom much leisure is destruction the pursuits of their idle hours are seldom advantageous to them and theirs are not minds which can thrive in repose Idleness to them is peculiarly the root of all evil for if their time is not spent in vicious amusements it is often passed in slander discontent or vanity In writing thus I do not recommend a hard or inconsiderate system to servants They require and in many instances they merit all that can be done to alleviate a situation of servitude They ought not to be the slaves of caprice or the victims of temper Their work should be measured out with a just hand but it should be regularly exacted in as much perfection as can be expected in variable and erring human nature Another point on which I would recommend firmness is that of early hours In this respect example is as important as precept but however uncertain you may be yourself I would not relax a rule of that kind For every comfort during the day depends upon the early rising of your servants Without this all their several departments are hurried through or neglected in some important respect Your mode of address to servants must be decisive yet mild The authoritative tone I do not recommend It is very unbecoming to any young person and it rarely attains the end desired but there is a quiet dignity of deportment which few servants ever can resist This should be tempered with kindness when circumstances call it forth but should never descend to familiarity For no caution is more truly kind than which confines servants strictly to their own sphere Much evil results from the tendency more especially of very young or of very old mistresses of families to partiality Commonly one servant becomes the almost avowed favorite and it is difficult to say whether that display of partiality is the more pernicious to the servant who is the object of it or to the rankling and jealous minds of the rest of the household It is true that it is quite impossible to avoid entertaining a greater degree of confidence in some servants than in others but it should be shown with a due regard to the feelings of all It is of course allowable towards those who take a decidedly responsible and confidential situation in a household Still never let such persons assume the reins of government let them act the part of helmsman to the vessel but not aspire to the control of the captain It is generally wise and right after a due experience of the principles and intentions of servants to place confidence in their honesty and to let them have the comfort of knowing that you do so At the same time never cease to exercise a system of supervision The great principle of housekeeping is regularity and without this one of the most difficult of the minor virtues to practice all efforts to promote order must be ineffectual I have seen energetic women clever and well intentioned fail in attaining a good method owing to their being uncertain in hours governed by impulse and capricious I have seen women inferior in capacity slow and apathetic make excellent heads of families as far as their household was concerned from their steadiness and regularity Their very power of enduring monotony has been favorable to their success in this way especially if they are not called upon to act in peculiar and difficult cases in which their actual inferiority is traceable But these are not the ordinary circumstances of life In closing these remarks on the management of servants let me exhort you never to forget that they are fellow laborers in the life of probation with ourselves let us not embitter their lives by harshness or proffer to them temptation from carelessness and over indulgence Since all that is given us of this world s goods is but in trust let us regard our servants as beings for whose conduct while under our control we are more or less responsible It is true that if they come to us with morals wholly depraved it is not likely that the most strenuous exertions can amend them but many waver between good and evil Let us endeavor to excite in their minds a respect for virtue to give them motives for industry inducements to save their wages Those who have large households should not deem the morals of the meanest of their servants beneath their investigation or too obscure for their influence to reach Some attention is absolutely necessary in this country to the training of servants as they come here from the lowest ranks of English and Irish peasantry with as much idea of politeness as the pig domesticated in the cabin of the latter Opening the door seems a simple act yet few servants perform it in a proper respectful manner Let your servant understand that the door must be opened immediately after the bell rings Visitors from neglect of this rule will often ring several times and finally leave the door I have known an instance when in a case of severe illness the patient lost the visit of the doctor who after ringing some minutes was obliged to pay other visits and could not return to the sufferer s house until several hours later When opening the door some servants hold it ajar and hold a long parley with the person on the steps as if afraid they wished to enter for the purpose of murder or theft Train them to answer the door promptly speak politely to any one who may be there excuse you if necessary to visitors in courteous terms or if you are in show the callers into the parlor take their card and come back quickly with your answer CHAPTER XXIII ON A YOUNG LADY S CONDUCT WHEN CONTEMPLATING MARRIAGE The following chapter met with in a recent perusal of an English work for young ladies strikes me as so admirable and so appropriate in this place that I quote the chapter entire The difficulties and trials of life have only just begun when a young lady fancies herself to be of sufficient importance to become the theme of animadversion She knows little of the true importance of self control until she experiences the first indications of preference shown her by the other sex Such indications are often manifested whilst she to whom they are directed is wholly unprepared to analyze her own feelings before her opinions upon what she has seen are by any means developed before she has even considered adequately on what her happiness depends before she has discernment to reject what is frivolous or wisdom to prefer what is good This is more especially the case in the highest and lowest classes in which by a strange analogy they either rush into the marriage state whilst children or wait until the bloom and hopes of youth have forever passed away in order to form interested matches The matured period of five and twenty to thirty is passed by the lower classes in the single state in labor to gain subsistence after thirty or even forty we often find them marrying But the majority have sealed their own fate before the age of twenty In high life the same haste to dispose of daughters prevails as among the lowest classes At seventeen most of our belles of fashion expect to receive proposals If they do not marry within a few years after their introduction they have a mortified sense of having lost time that the expectations of friends and of parents have not been fulfilled that others have gone off before them The next ten years are often a period of subdued vexation and the sweetness and contentment of the original character is impaired About seven or eight and twenty the views of life are sobered the expectations chastened a renovation takes place women again become agreeable their minds must in the lapse of time even with a miserable store of observation have improved They then often marry and if the union be not a mere effort of despair if it be based on sound and holy principles and on good sense there is for both parties engaged a great likelihood of happiness But it may be naturally contended that there come not to all young ladies the opportunities of which I write that indications of preference arrive not to all I am inclined to believe that with good temper pleasing manners and respectable connections there exists in modern society very few young ladies who have not received under various circumstances some marks of preference more or less decided Beauty and plainness are arbitrary not positive terms Unless there be any actual deformity any great infirmity in which case I think it were cruel to pre suppose the likelihood of such indications there is no one that I hardly ever met with who has not had on some grounds her partizans and admirers The plain are often particularized as elegant tastes vary even a sour look I have heard admired as sensible cold manners eulogized as correct Opinion however it may generally verge to the correct springs from so many sources it is so governed by association of ideas such trifles may guide it that I am never surprised at the latitude given to personal encomium nor at the endless variety and incongruity of human judgment It is well that all have a chance of being approved admired beloved and it remains for them to avail themselves of those possibilities which contribute so much to happiness For we are sympathizing beings and a law of our nature makes us look for a return of sympathy We are sent here to form ties and to love and to be loved whether the term applies to parental or filial or fraternal love or whether it respects the less sure and more fitful experiences of love in its ordinary sense I do not blame the parents who instil into their children of both sexes a desire to be married I think those who teach the young a different lesson deceive them Marriage with all its chances its infelicities its sacrifices is seldom so infelicitous so uncertain so full of sacrifice as the single state Life must have some objects and those objects must be progressive The mind is happier and healthier with such interests even if sorrow comes along with them than in its solitude its desolate freedom from care when having as the phrase is no troubles of the conjugal sort to disturb its tranquillity I therefore do not censure those who desire to see their daughters happily and suitably established in life It is the indiscreet and vulgar haste the indelicacy the low mercenary views and the equally low ambition to compass a splendid match which is blameable and revolting in the parental conduct Many are however blessed with guides and guardians of very different characters with parents whose lofty natures not only reject such unworthy notions but somewhat incline to the extreme of repelling all advances for their daughters In either case the conduct of a young lady may be the same It is she who must form her own destiny in points on which none can effectually aid her It is she who is to be the happy wife or the wretched victim and it is to her that these observations of admonition and of warning are addressed Let us suppose her young of course attractive in appearance of good birth and some fortune I here except heiresses who being anomalies deserve a particular paragraph for themselves But let us suppose that no obstacle of family or connection interferes to check the approach of a suitor The eyes of her family and of her young friends are upon her when a young lady receives the first indications of preference She is generally ashamed of it This is the first sentiment of a modest and ingenuous mind and it is one indication in my opinion of the impropriety of early marriages Nature seems still to wish to keep the young and blushing girl apart from that connection which entails grave and arduous duties But Nature s voice is far less often heard than that of her adversary expediency I must therefore shape my injunctions to that which exists not to that which we would wish to exist Almost sinking under this painful sense of shame this novel disturbance of her usual set of feelings a young girl catches at the first reed to save herself from observation and detection I mean detection of her perception of that which others may or may not see She seizes upon ridicule She pretends to laugh at one whom sometimes her youthful romantic fancy dwells upon in a very different sense She laughs at the foibles supposed or real of her admirer she plays a dangerous game If any of those to whom she imparts her witticisms are malevolently disposed or thoughtless she runs a risk either of wounding the feelings of a man whom she does not like or of losing the regard of one whom she might in time not only esteem but love Another effect of such attentions as awaken a consciousness in a young lady s mind is the gratification of vanity perhaps until then latent in her heart The first preference is apt to upset the reason of its object as of him who shows it The word vanity does not seem to imply danger Vanity is generally considered an innocent failing but it is innocent only as some kinds of food are to a healthy subject On a weak or even on an inexperienced mind it acts sometimes fatally for the vain A girl is either carried away by admiration so as to be flippant and foolish or she is blinded by her vanity to the failings of the man who first admires her She is intoxicated with the notion of an offer of marriage she imagines in her simplicity effervesced as it is by the infusion of flattered vanity that she has inspired such an attachment as will never be recovered should she prove adverse to it Many an engagement has been formed under this conviction and fulfilled only to prove its fallacy for the love which was supposed too strong to survive disappointment has expired in the fruition of its hopes To guard against either of these risks to happiness a well educated girl should endeavor in this to exercise her judgment She should be sincere She is blameable to ridicule the attentions which are meant as complimentary to her They ought to be at least regarded with respect Should they not be acceptable she is inexcusable to requite them with levity and disdain Let her reflect how she would like such conduct herself Besides she is often making a bitter enemy perhaps she is exciting fierce and unamiable sentiments in one who otherwise might have been regarded as a mild and worthy individual Let her be undeceived if she supposes that in thus doing she is carrying herself with dignity or acquiring any added admiration from others She ceases in thus acting to support the characteristics of a gentlewoman which are mildness courtesy and reserve If she cherishes in spite of her pretended disgust a secret partiality for the individual who distinguishes her if she is lowering the esteem of a man whom she prefers she not only incurs the hazard of losing his regard but she is scattering ridicule on one whom she afterwards avows as her choice In that case she is lowering herself or she is sowing the seeds of distrust in the minds of those who know her she is perhaps frustrating and delaying her own happiness Let her act with candor with consideration with good sense and all this web which her folly would weave around her will not embarrass her Let her not madly and obstinately resist the advice of those on whose affection to her and on whose good judgment experience has taught her to rely Let her be a child in nothing except humility let her listen to counsels yet her own heart must decide for her none can know so well as herself its secret throbs or the impression of dislike or of regard which has been made upon it I am I confess an enemy to trying to like a person as I have rarely seen such a mental process end in happiness to either party If an advantageous proposal offer itself it is wiser decidedly to refuse it than to trust to the slow growth of affection upon a foundation of original dislike And the trials of married life are such its temptations to irritability and contention are so manifold its anxieties so unforseen and so complicated that few can steer their difficult course safely and happily unless there be a deep and true attachment to contend with all the storms which may arise in the navigation Deeply impressed with this conviction should it be the lot of any young lady in whom I were interested to form a real well grounded attachment to a man whose circumstances were indifferent I should counsel her provided she can depend on the character and exertions of the object so beloved to risk the event of an engagement to trust to time and Providence and to marry whenever means were afforded convinced as I am that patience and trust and true affection raise the character and are acceptable in the eyes of our Heavenly Father But in such a case she must school her mind to meet the anxieties which attend limited means She must prepare herself by habits of diligence and economy to become a poor man s wife She must learn the difficult art of doing well upon a little She must not be she in any rank of life think to indulge with impunity to herself in every refinement and luxury when she is single and upon her marriage imagine that she can attain the practice of economy by wishing it Such metamorphoses are out of reason out of nature She must endeavor before the bond which ties her to poverty is framed to understand the duties of housekeeping the mysteries of needle work She must lay down to herself rules of expenditure suitable in part to her future condition in life Many a wife thus commencing has laid the foundations of future fortune at least independence to her husband by keeping his mind at peace during his progress up the steep ascent to professional or clerical or literary fame Many a home has been cheered by domestic forbearance and placid submission to circumstances even in the higher classes during the life time of a father or in the course of those long expectancies in which the fortitude and principle of many of the aristocracy are tried and proved But the self denial the cheerfulness the good management the strict principle are formed at an earlier period than that in which a young lady gives her hand to him whom she has chosen in spite of the frown of fortune as her husband Of this let the young be assured there are few situations in life in which a man young and in health cannot meliorate his circumstances if he possess energy and if he be stimulated by a true affection The clergyman with humble stipend often hopeless from want of interest has leisure he has had education He may if he desires to assist himself have recourse to literary labor or to tuition If he make not such exertion during the course of an engagement what hope can there be of him in future life The young lawyer however tedious his advancement however few his opportunities may also distinguish himself in a literary career Innumerable are the subjects open to one of such a profession How few avail themselves of the chance Upon this rely the man truly in love will make the effort To the military man though perhaps he may be less qualified the same course is open in a degree Some of our best travels some of our most amusing literary productions have been the compositions of military men And the advantage of this mode of aiding a small fortune is that a man not only does not lower but he raises his position by it if his works are moral written in a gentlemanly spirit and affording information However deep the attachment however agreeable the object if a man be indisposed to help himself to independence and competence I should counsel no woman to continue an engagement formed in the expectation of times mending When I advocate the indulgence of attachment it is to worthy not to unworthy objects I now come to speak of moral character Hard is the contest between affection and expediency when it is raised by the question of circumstances But harder still is it when its result is to be decided upon an inquiry into moral conduct I know not a more cruel situation than that when the heart is bestowed on one whom the judgment could not approve I know not one which should be more strictly guarded against not only by parents and friends but for I would impress on every young lady how much she may prove the best guardian of her own happiness by the female heart itself With every vigilance with little to blame little to repent such cases will occur in this world The feelings are interested but the judgment distrusts Happy is it for those who know the combat between affection and principle only in single life and have not the misery of encountering so severe a destiny when it can no longer be remedied who know not how to fulfill the vow to honor what is proved to be unworthy and yet still must love for the affections once given are little in our own power In such a case occurring to the young in perhaps a first attachment I think they must be guided by friends I am not an advocate for the interference of friends where it is much a question of a long and contingent engagement a question of being married at once or of waiting in some uncertainty a question of ease or discomfort of limited means or luxury in such instances if the moral character be unexceptionable it is the duty of parents to point out all the risk all the disadvantages but to leave the heart to form its own decisions Let them not seek to wrench the affections from the channel in which they flowed when fresh from their source They cannot know how deep the channel is they cannot know if ever those pure and beautiful waters will flow in peace again when once hastily turned aside But in cases of moral character of right or wrong the affair is wholly different and the strictest parental authority ought upon due inquiry to be exercised Submission and self control are then the duty of the young sufferer for a sufferer she truly is no page of her after history could unfold a bitterer pang But peace and hope come at last the struggle though violent leaves behind it none of that corroding sorrow which would have accompanied the acquiescence of parents in a union unblessed by a Providence whose will is that all should be pure even as He above is pure Had your fond wishes been granted young and trusting being how fearful would have been your condition For there is no suspicion so revolting to an innocent mind as that which unseats love from his throne in our affections and places another in his stead Be assured of this little can you know of the moral conduct of the other sex little is it desirable that you should know But whenever improprieties are so flagrant as to be matters of conversation when the good shun and the pitying forbear to excuse be assured some deeper cause than you can divine exists for the opprobrium Think not that your empire over affections thus wasted can be a real one It is transient it will not last it will not bring reformation it will never be adequately requited Throw yourself on the judgment of those whose interest in you has been life long or of such as you know truly regard your happiness conquer the unhallowed preference pray for support and guidance trust in Him who catereth for the sparrow But when the commencement of life is chilled by so cruel a sorrow when the blight has fallen on the bud we must not only look up to heavenly aid we must take every means of care for an unfortunate and when once the judgment is convinced of the unworthiness of the object a blameable attachment How often in the Psalms in the Gospels the word Help is reiterated We are to help ourselves we must work for our heavenly peace on earth the mental discipline to prosper must be aided by divine grace but its springs must be from our own hearts And to fulfill the will of God in this as in the other events of life let us take such means as may aid us in the work of self government In the first place let employment be resorted to by the sorrowing do not indulge in tears do not sit alone abstain for a time from music abstain from the perusal of poetry or works of imagination They still more soften the feelings and open up the sources of grief Read works of fact endeavor to occupy yourself with the passing events of the world And when the overburdened heart cannot be comforted or its thoughts diverted for there will be moments too mournful to be resisted go forth into the fields go to the houses of the poor see the goodness and mercy of God see too the patience and long suffering of the poor who may often set the rich an example of fortitude Occupy yourself if you can with children their freshness their joyful unconsciousness the elasticity of their spirits will sustain and draw you from yourself or have recourse to the soothing calmness of the aged Hear them converse upon the affairs of life how they appreciate the importance of each passing event as a traveler does the ruts and inequalities of the road he has traversed How their confidence in the effect of time sustains you and you turn from them reflecting on all that the happiest of them must necessarily have endured Be assured of your own recovery under an influence so certain Avoid young persons of your own age If possible except to a sister whose deep interest in you will probably teach her a superior lesson never confide in young friends a similar trial as that to which I have referred In general your resolution will be weakened your feelings re excited your confidence in your best advisers will be shaken For the young usually take the part of the rejected lover they delight in that dangerous species of sympathy which flatters with hope They are naturally incredulous as to the delinquencies of a man who is agreeable and in love they incline to the notion of the hard heartedness of fathers uncles and elder brothers and even if they happen to possess good sense or to exercise the rare quality of prudence in such matters the very communication of any sorrow or the recital of any feelings gives not only a merely temporary relief but deadens that sorrow and strengthens those feelings which grow every time they are imparted If you wish to recover and if you have a sound and well disposed mind you will wish to recover you must after the first burst of grief is over speak but rarely of a theme too painful and delicate to bear the contact of rude minds too dangerous to dwell upon with those of a kindlier and loftier nature To your female relations to your mother more especially too great an openness cannot be practiced on these points but openness does not imply a perpetual recurrence to a theme which must wear out patience and exhaust all but maternal sympathy in time For maternal sympathy is exhaustless be generous and restrain from that very reflection the continual demand upon its flow The first person to consult the last to afflict a mother should not be the victim of her daughter s feelings Her judgment should not be weakened by the incessant indulgence of a daughter s sorrows I would on many grounds caution the young against hasty engagements It seems extraordinary that the welfare of a life should often be determined upon the acquaintance of a few weeks The principles it is true may be ascertained from the knowledge of others the manners may please the means and expectations may all be clearly understood But the temper that word of unspeakable import the daily habits the power of constancy these are not to be known without a long and severe examination of the motives and a daily observation of the conduct of others Very little suffices to mar the happiness of married life if that little proceed in the character of a man from a rooted selfishness It is true in regard to this defect that much may be done by a wife to meliorate a vice of character which is in some only the result of never having had their feelings developed But if there exist not this excuse if in spite of ties which are dearer to an affectionate mind than existence you find a man preferring his own comfort to that of those whom he professes to love if you find him imperious to his servants dictatorial to sisters on cool terms with brothers there is little hope that the mental disease will ever be rooted out so as to leave a healthy character of mind Examine well into this point for a hasty temper may be remedied and even endured but the deep slow sullen course of a selfish nature wears away hope imparts a cankering care and with it often disgust No defect is so little to be resisted as selfishness It creeps into every detail it infects the minutest affairs of life as well as the greatest concerns It depresses the humble sufferer from its baneful effects it irritates the passions of the unamiable Study well the character in trifles nor venture to risk your bark on the sea of matrimony unless you know well how far this man whom you might prefer is free from this deadly infection View him if possible in his home before you pledge your faith with his or if that be not practicable reflect upon the general course of his actions of his sentiments and endeavor dispassionately to judge them as best you may CHAPTER XXIV BRIDAL ETIQUETTE In preparing a bridal outfit it is best to furnish the wardrobe for at least two years in under clothes and one year in dresses though the bonnet and cloak suitable for the coming season are all that are necessary as the fashions in these articles change so rapidly If you are going to travel have a neat dress and cloak of some plain color and a close bonnet and veil Avoid as intensely vulgar any display of your position as a bride whilst traveling Take first the weddings at church In this case none are invited to the ceremony excepting the family and the reception is at the house of the bride s mother or nearest relative either on the wedding day or upon her return from the bridal tour In sending out the invitations let the card of the bridegroom and that of the bride be tied together with a white ribbon and folded in the note paper upon which is printed the name of the bride s mother with the date of the reception day thus missus JOHN SAUNDERS At home Thursday Oct sixteenth from eleven till two No two hundred eighteen saint of course the hours and dates vary but the form is the same If there is no bridal reception upon the wedding day the cards are worded mister AND missus JAMES SMITH At home Wednesdays On and after June sixth No seventeen saint Tie the card with the bride s maiden name upon it to this one Enclose the invitation in a white envelope and tie it with white satin ribbon If you send cake have it put in a white box and place the note outside the cover tying it fast with white satin ribbon The bride s dress must be of white entirely If she is married in the morning a plain white silk white mantle and white bonnet full trimmed with orange flowers with a plain veil is the most suitable dress and she may wear a richer one at her reception when she returns from her bridal tour As soon as the carriages come let the bridesmaids and relatives set off first Last the bride with her parents The bride her parents and the bridesmaids go immediately to the vestry where they meet the bridegroom and the groomsmen The father of the bride gives her his arm and escorts her to the altar the bridegroom walking on the other side Then follow the bridesmaids and groomsmen in couples When they reach the altar the bridegroom removes his right hand glove but the bride keeps hers on until the clergyman takes the ring The first bridesmaid then removes the left hand glove and it is not resumed The bridesmaids should wear white dresses white mantles and bonnets but not veils or orange flowers The bride and groom leave the church first after the ceremony is over and take the carriage with the parents of the bride and the others follow in the order in which they came If there is a breakfast or morning reception the bride will not change her dress until she retires to put on her traveling attire If the wedding takes place in the evening at church to be followed by a full dress reception at home the bride should wear a white lace dress over satin or any other material to suit her own taste a veil falling from her head to her feet fastened to the hair by a coiffure of orange flowers white kid gloves and white satin slippers A bouquet if carried should contain only white flowers The bridesmaids may wear white or some thin light colored material over white a head dress of flowers and carry bouquets of mixed flowers When the wedding takes place at home let the company assemble in the front drawing room and close the doors between that and the back room In the back room let the bride bridegroom bridesmaids and groomsmen the parents of the bride and the clergyman assemble The clergyman should stand in the centre of the room the bride and groom before him the bridesmaids ranged beside the bride the groomsmen beside the bridegroom Then open the doors and let the ceremony begin This arrangement saves that awkwardness attendant upon entering the room and taking the position before a large company After the ceremony is over the parents of the bride speak to her first then her near relatives and not until then the other members of the company It is not usual now to have dancing or even music at a wedding and the hour is named upon the cards at which the guests are expected to retire A very pretty effect is produced in the wedding group if the bride wears pure white and the bridesmaids white with flowers and trimmings of a different color Thus one in white with a head dress and trimming of green leaves another white with blue ribbons and forget me nots another white with pink roses and ribbons If the wedding is in the morning the bride and family may wear full dress in that case the shutters should be closed and the rooms lighted as in the evenings Let the supper be laid early and ready when the ceremony is over that the guests may pass into the dining room if they wish as soon as they have spoken to the bride If a morning wedding let the table be set as for an evening wedding If the bride gives a reception at her own house after her return from her bridal tour she should not wear her wedding dress If in the evening a supper should be set If a morning reception let her wear a handsome light silk collar and sleeves of lace Wine and cake are sufficient to hand to each guest at a morning reception At an evening reception let the bride wear full dress but not her wedding dress At parties given to a newly married couple the bridesmaids and groomsmen are always invited and the whole party are expected to wear the same dresses as at the wedding CHAPTER XXV HINTS ON HEALTH The universal remark of travelers visiting America as well as the universal complaint of Americans themselves relates to the ill health of the fairer portion of the community Look where you will go to any city in the vast Union the remark and complaint will be made everywhere With every natural advantage of climate yet from North to South East to West the cry resounds Foreigners admiring the dark eyed girls of the southern states or the blondes of the northern ones will remark with comments upon beauty But she looks delicate poor thing Not strong Ah I thought not none of the American women are and how soon these young beauties fade It seems to me amongst the subjects treated of in my present work that a few words on health will not come amiss Light and sunshine are needful for your health Get all you can keep your windows clean Do not block them up with curtains plants or bunches of flowers these last poison the air in small rooms Fresh air is needful for your health As often as you can open all your windows if only for a short time in bad weather in fine weather keep them open but never sit in draughts When you get up open the windows wide and throw down the bed clothes that they may be exposed to fresh air some hours daily before they are made up Keep your bed clothes clean hang them to the fire when you can Avoid wearing at night what you wear in the day Hang up your day clothes at night Except in the severest weather in small crowded sleeping rooms a little opening at the top of the window sash is very important or you will find one window pane of perforated zinc very useful You will not catch cold half so easily by breathing pure air at night Let not the beds be directly under the windows Sleeping in exhausted air creates a desire for stimulants Pure water is needful for your health Wash your bodies as well as your faces rubbing them all over with a coarse cloth If you cannot wash thus every morning pray do so once a week Crying and cross children are often pacified by a gentle washing of their little hands and faces it soothes them Babies heads should be washed carefully every morning with soap No scurf should be suffered to remain upon them Get rid of all slops and dirty water at once Disease and even death is often the consequence of our own negligence Wash your rooms and passages at least once a week use plenty of clean water but do not let your children stay in them while they are wet it may bring on croup or inflammation of the chest If you read your Bibles which it is earnestly hoped you do you will find how cleanliness both as to the person and habitation was taught to the Jews by God himself and we read in the fourth chapter of Nehemiah that when they were building their second temple and defending their lives against their foes having no time for rest they contrived to put off their clothes for washing It is a good old saying that cleanliness is next to godliness See Heb x twenty two Wholesome food is needful for your health Buy the most strengthening Pieces of fresh beef and mutton go the farthest Eat plenty of fresh salt with food it prevents disease Pray do not let your children waste their pennies in tarts cakes bull s eyes hardbake sour fruit c they are very unwholesome and hurt the digestion People would often at twenty years of age have a nice little sum of money to help them on in the world if they had put in the savings bank the money so wasted Cocoa is cheaper and much more nourishing than tea None of these liquids should be taken hot but lukewarm when hot they inflame the stomach and produce indigestion We are all made to breathe the pure air of heaven and therefore much illness is caused by being constantly in doors Let all persons make a point whenever it is possible of taking exercise in the open air for at least an hour and a half daily Time would be saved in the long run by the increased energy and strength gained and by the warding off of disease Let it not be supposed that it is not the duty of every young lady to take due care of her health and to preserve in all its power of utility every portion of vigor which has been bestowed on her With many young ladies it appears to be a maxim to do everything in their power to destroy the health which is so much wanted in the real business of life and which forms so important a requisite to happiness In the first place as to hours they never leave the ball room until utterly exhausted and scarcely fit to crawl to bed The noon day sleep the scarcely touched breakfast that most important meal are followed by preparations for the succeeding night s pleasures or in head aching morning calls driving about in a close carriage or lounging on a sofa in an over heated room reading novels Dressing follows the warm wrapper or dress is thrown aside over the tightly drawn corsets is fastened a flimsy dress with an inch of sleeve the neck laid bare thin stockings drawn on in place of thick ones and the consumption seeker goes forth to the ball room again At times you miss from the gay assemblage some former ornament you inquire about her she has taken cold Inflammation of the lungs caught it in an accidental draught of air by one of these fair half dressed beings carried off not long since one of the gayest and fairest of the belles of the season after an illness of three days Preservation of the health ought from an early stage of existence to be enforced as a duty upon the young To walk daily to have daily recourse in summer even twice a day to the sponging with cold water or the shower bath to eat sufficiently of plain nutritious food to keep the mind calm these are duties they should be habitually exercised Care should be taken not to come out heated with a shawl just pinned across the shoulders from a heated room Where there is delicacy of the lungs or windpipe yet not sufficient to render a withdrawal from evening parties necessary the use of a respirator at night is desirable It is usual to have recourse to this valuable invention only when disease is actually existing as a preventive it is neglected Yet preserving the temperature of a warm room it is an excellent precaution and can easily be assumed when the shawl or cloak is put on The atmosphere of a city is destructive where there is any pulmonary delicacy and who shall say where there is not pulmonary delicacy In this climate there is a tendency to it more or less in almost every family at all events it is too easily induced in our predisposed constitutions by cold aided by the debilitating effect of heated rooms and an artificial mode of existence and accelerated also most decidedly by bared shoulders For in this climate it is scarcely ever safe to lay bare that portion of the frame the back and chest in which the lungs are seated and although custom may greatly lead to diminish the injurious effects the sudden chill may strike and may never be recovered During every season certain people have head colds coughs and feverish colds These are produced by certain states of climate acting on certain states of constitution At particular seasons such complaints abound at others they abound still more and again from some singularity they prevail so much that people say there is an Influenza Influenza has been long known in the world It has often visited Europe and made its appearance on our shores with greater severity than at present It has sometimes been very severe and left many persons ill for a year or two The symptoms of influenza need not be dwelt on as they have been so generally felt by our readers or their friends It varies in different people to be sure both in kind and in degree Considering the number of people it attacks it may be looked on as an innocent disease but on the other hand looking at the increase it has made in the number of deaths it is an exceedingly serious one after all In simple cases confinement to a pure and temperate air warm drinks and a warm bath or at least a warm foot bath with an extra blanket and a little more rest than usual keeping to mild food and toast and water and taking if necessary a dose of aperient medicine is all that is required In serious cases the domestic treatment must become professional Mustard plasters to the back relieve the headache Squills find other medicines loosen the outstanding cough Bark and wine and even cold baths are sometimes requisite for the weakness left behind But these things can only be used with discrimination by a regular professional man Supposing that the seeds of disease have not been laid in childhood and that there is no particular predisposition to any malady in the constitution a young woman enters life with every fair prospect of enjoying tolerable health yet how variable and delicate and complaining do the majority of women become What a vast expense is incurred during the course of their lives in physicians medicine change of air baths abroad and at home and journeys How few women can walk or can suppress nervous feelings or can eat like reasonable beings how many suffer or say they suffer from debility headaches dyspepsia a tendency to colds eternal sore throats rheumatic attacks and the whole list of polite complaints With all our modern wisdom with all our books on health our smatterings of physiological science our open carriages sponging baths and attention to diet women now are a far more feeble race than our grandmothers or even our mothers were What daughter can walk half as far as her mother can What young woman can take the active part that her mother did In most families the order of things is reversed It is not a child trembling for her mother s health and fearing lest her parent no longer young should be fatigued but it is the mother who is always striving to spare her child exertions which she can herself perfectly well undergo but which the enfeebled child of modern self indulgence dare not encounter Yes we are a self indulgent race this present generation Witness our easily excited feelings witness our late hours of rising our sofas and easy chairs our useless days and dissipated nights Witness our pallid faces our forms sometimes attenuated and repulsive while yet in early life age marching not creeping on before his time or witness our over fed and over expanded forms enfeebled by indolence and suffering the worst species of debility the debility of fat Witness our doing those things by deputy which our grandmothers did themselves witness our host of scents and perfumed waters on our dressing tables our over refinement which amounts to an enervating puerility and our incapacity of parting with one accustomed indulgence even at the bidding of the learned and disinterested adviser In the education of women writes a modern physician too little attention is given to subdue the imaginative faculty and to moderate sensibility on the contrary they are generally fostered and instead of a vigorous intellect and healthy condition of mind we find imagination and sentiment predominant over the reasoning faculties and laying the foundation of hysterical hypochondriacal and even maniacal diseases B It is in fact this want of judgment in the management of early life that produces so much misery when women are called upon to perform an important part in society and when all that exertion can do is required at their hands B The Sick Room by doctor A T Thomson The duration of sleep should not in the adult exceed six or eight hours women injure their health greatly by excess in this respect On rising all women should use some mode of cold or tepid bath and indeed in this respect the practice of the present day is admirable there is every facility for the bath To some the use of the shower bath is deleterious and to all inconvenient and not likely to be resorted to except when positively ordered doctor Combe recommends for general use the tepid or warm bath as being much more suitable than the cold bath especially in the winter for those who are not robust and full of animal heat When the constitution is not sufficiently vigorous to ensure reaction after the cold bath by producing a warm glow over the surface its use observes the same admirable writer inevitably does harm But he enforces that in order to promote a due exhalation from the skin the warm the tepid or the shower bath as a means of preserving health ought to be in as common use as a change of apparel for it is equally a measure of necessary cleanliness He inclines to the use of the tepid bath as likely to be the most generally efficacious I have known the most beneficial effects from a modification of this advice namely from using a sponging bath into which you pour a jug of warm water and in which you stand whilst you sponge the body and limbs profusely with cold water A strong friction should be employed after this process either with horsehair gloves or with a large coarse towel and few persons will find the use of the sponging bath disagree with them when thus employed It is indeed incredible when we consider the importance of the exhalation performed by the skin to what extent ablution is neglected not only as doctor Combe specifies in charitable institutions and seminaries for the young but by ladies in ordinary circumstances to whom the use of the bath could be productive of no inconvenience In nervous complaints which are more or less the besetting evil of womankind the bath in its various forms becomes an invaluable aid In the formation of those habits which are necessary for the preservation of health another circumstance which from its importance to health cannot be deemed trifling should be mentioned It is a general practice that beds should be made as soon as the occupants have left their rooms and before the air has been freely admitted to play upon the recent depositary of the human frame but this should be avoided The bed linen and blankets should be taken off and the windows opened so that for an hour or more a thorough ventilation should be procured Upon another point the inconsistency and mental blindness of women are almost inconceivable the insufficiency of their dress to resist the attacks of our variable climate How few women clothe themselves like rational beings Although in latter years they have wisely adopted the use of warm dresses and more especially of the valuable Scottish plaid yet how commonly they neglect the aid of flannel in preserving them not only from cold but in securing a necessary circulation of vitality in the skin The necessary effect of deficient circulation in the skin remarks doctor Combe is to throw a disproportionate mass of blood inwards and when this condition exists insufficient clothing perpetuates the evil until internal disease is generated and health is irrecoverably lost How common is the complaint among young women especially those of sedentary habits of chilliness cold feet and other symptoms of deficient circulation and yet how impossible would it often be for women are usually obstinate on this head to induce them to exchange the thin silk stocking for a warm merino one or to substitute a proper walking shoe for the paper like articles which they designate by that name Hence arise many diseases which are by insensible degrees fostered in the system by the unequal distribution of the blood oppressing the internal organs The habitual tendency to that chilliness which has been referred to should never be disregarded laying as it does says doctor Combe the foundation of tubercles in the lungs and other maladies which show themselves only when arrived at an incurable stage All those who value health and have common sense will therefore take warning from signs like these and never rest until equilibrium of action be restored Warm clothing exercise in the open air sponging with tepid water and vinegar or the warm bath the use of a flesh brush or hair glove are adapted to remedy these serious and threatening evils But whilst insufficiency of clothing is to be deprecated excessive wrapping up should also be avoided Great differences exist between the power of generating heat and resisting cold in individuals and it is therefore impossible to prescribe general rules upon the subject of clothing The best maxim is not to dress in an invariable way in all cases but to put on clothing sufficient in the individual case to protect the body effectively against the sensation of cold C C doctor Combe The insufficiency of warmth in the clothing of females constitutes only one part of its injurious effects The tightness of dress obstructs the insensible perspiration hurtfully and produces an irregular circulation Every part and function of the human frame are linked together so closely that we cannot act wrongly towards one organ without all suffering nor act rightly without all sharing the benefit of our judgment and good sense The mischief arising from cold or wet feet is admitted by all persons who have given the subject of health even the most casual consideration In conversing with very aged people you will generally find a disregard of diet and very different notions and practices upon the subject of exercise and ablution but they all agree in the necessity of keeping the feet dry I remember inquiring of a venerable clergyman who up to the age of ninety six had enjoyed a fair proportion of health after a youth of delicacy I asked him what system he pursued Now was his reply I never took much care what I ate I have always been temperate I never minded the weather but I always took care to keep my feet dry and well shod Wet and damp are indeed more unwholsome when applied to the feet than when they affect other parts because they receive a greater supply of blood to carry on a high degree of perspiration and because their distance from the heart or centre of circulation diminishes the force with which this is carried on and thus leaves them more susceptible from external causes D D doctor Combe God in his infinite benevolence has given to his creatures other means of acquiring a healthy warmth than by clothing he has endowed us with the power of exercise that blessing which women of weak judgment and indolent natures are so prone to neglect and disparage Most ladies appear to think that the privilege of walking is only intended for persons of inferior condition They busy themselves in their in door occupations all the morning take a hearty luncheon and drive out in their carriages until dinner time It is partly owing to such customs as these that a rapid deterioration takes place in the physical state of our sex in their looks and in their power of utility and enjoyment of happiness God never intended us to be inactive The chief purpose of the muscles with which we are endowed is to enable us to carry into effect the volitions of the mind and whilst fulfilling this grand object the active exercise of the muscles is conducive to the well being of many other important functions The processes of digestion respiration secretion absorption and nutrition are promoted and the healthful condition of the whole body influenced The mind also is depressed or exhilarated by the proper or improper use of muscular exercise for man is intended for a life of activity nor can his functions ever go on so properly as when he duly exercises those organs with which Nature has endowed him The evils arising from want of exercise are numerous the circulation from the absence of due stimulus becomes languid the appetite and digestion are weakened the respiration is imperfect and the blood becomes so ill conditioned that when distributed through the body it is inadequate to communicate the necessary stimulus to healthy and vigorous action These points being established it now becomes a consideration in what mode or at what periods ladies in society can most advantageously avail themselves of that privilege which is granted to so many denied comparatively to so few Much is said on the benefits of walking before breakfast and to a person in full vigor it may there is no doubt be highly salutary whilst to the delicate it will prove more hurtful than beneficial producing a sense of weariness which destroys all the future pleasures of the day I am disposed to think however from observation that walking before breakfast may be rendered beneficial almost to any one by degrees Most persons walk too far the first day they are proud of the effort become nevertheless exhausted and dare not repeat it A first walk before breakfast should not exceed a quarter of a mile it should be extended very gradually and in delicate women with great care lest over fatigue should ensue It is however so valuable a habit such a saving of time so refreshing so soothing that many sacrifices of inclination should be made to procure it in a gay season the freshness and seclusion of a morning s walk is peculiarly needed and when it becomes so difficult to take exercise in the subsequent part of the day the afternoon being too short and the evening too much occupied And the morning s walk stolen from the hour given to a species of repose which seldom rests may be without the reproach of indolence followed by the afternoon s siesta a practice much to be commended and greatly conducive to rest of nerves and invigoration of the frame when used in moderation Exercise may be taken by the robust at any time even after eating heartily but the delicate ought to avoid that risk they should resort to it only when the frame is vigorous enough to bear it and this is usually from one to four or five hours after eating The morning is therefore the best time but exercise ought not to be delayed until some degree of exhaustion has taken place from want of food as in that case it dissipates rather than renovates the remaining strength and impairs digestion Exercise immediately before meals is therefore unless very gentle injurious if it has been violent before eating rest should intervene Appetite says doctor Combe revives after repose Of all modes of exercise that which nature has bestowed upon us walking is decidedly the most salutary and the prevailing system of substituting horse and carriage exercise almost entirely for it is far from being advantageous to the present generation Walking which has for its aim some pleasing pursuit and therefore animates the mind is efficacious to the majority Gardening which is a modification of walking offers many advantages both to the delicate and the strong and it is a species of exercise which we can adjust to our powers In a continued walk you must go on you must return there is no appeal even if you have gone too far and would willingly give up any further exertion But while gardening you are still at home your exertions are devoted to objects the most interesting because progressive hope and faith form a part of your stimulus The happy future when flowers shall bloom around you supersedes in your thoughts the vexatious present or the mournful past About you are the budding treasures of spring or the gorgeous productions of summer or the rich hues of those beauties which autumn pours forth most lavishly before it departs and is succeeded by winter Above you are the gay warblers who seem to hail you as you mingle in the sylvan scenes which are not all theirs but which you share and appropriate The ruffled temper the harassed mind may find a solace in the occupation of gardening which aids the effect of exercise and the benign influence of fresh air Stores of future and never dying interest are buried in the earth with every seed only to spring up again redoubled in their value A lady as a writer in the Quarterly Review observes should not only have but know her plants And her enjoyment of those delights is truly enhanced by that personal care without which few gardens however superintended by the scientific gardener can prosper and which bless as they thrive her plants bestow health on the frame which is bowed down to train them they give to her the blessing of a calm and rational pleasure they relieve her from the necessity of excitement they promote alike in the wealthy and the poor these gentle exertions which are coupled with the most poetical and the sweetest of associations Exercise on horseback is not equally attainable with the two modes which I have just specified when it is the accelerated circulation the change of scene and of ideas are highly beneficial Where the lungs are weak it is thought by the learned to possess a great advantage over walking as it does not hurry the breathing The gentleness of the exercise enables a delicate person to enjoy the advantage of open air and motion for a much longer period than could be endured in the action of walking From the tendency of horse exercise to equalize the circulation and stimulate the skin it is invaluable too for the nervous and dyspeptic portion of young women among whom unhappily such complaints are but too prevalent Dancing which is the most frequent mode of exercise with ladies in great cities practiced as it is in heated rooms and exhausting from its violence often does more harm than good from producing languor and over fatigue Unhappily there are but few modes of exercise in doors adapted for women If from any circumstances they are confined to their homes and they become feverish and languid from want of exercise it never occurs to them to throw open the windows and to walk about or to make use of battledore and shuttlecock or any other mode of exertion They continue sitting reading or walking or lounging or sleeping or gossiping whilst the bloom of health is rapidly giving place to the wanness and debility of the imprisoned frame It is often the custom of young women to declare that they cannot walk sometimes from indolence no doubt and want of habit occasionally from real inability But if we investigate the causes of this real inability we shall often find it to proceed from an improper choice of time in taking exercise or from a defective judgment in the manner of taking it Many women exhaust and fatigue themselves with the duties of their house and by a thousand trying occupations including that which forms a serious item in the day s work namely running up and down stairs and then discover that they cannot walk Others go to extremes and walk for a certain distance whether they feel fatigued or not by such exertions It is only observes doctor Combe by a diffusion of the laws of exercise as a part of useful education that individuals can be enabled to avoid such mistakes To be beneficial exercise should always be proportioned to the strength and to the constitution of an individual When it causes extreme fatigue or exhaustion it is hurtful it ought to be resumed always after a period of rest and adopted regularly not as too many persons are in the habit of doing once in four or five days The average walk which a young woman in good health and in ordinary circumstances may take without undue and injurious fatigue is from four to five miles a day From this rule I except the very young It has been found by experience that until twenty two or three the strength is not completely matured The rate of mortality as it has been proved by statistical tables increases in all classes of society from fourteen until the age of twenty three when it begins to decrease Another precaution which I would recommend to those who have the regulation of families under their care relates to the subject of ventilation The heated state of our rooms in ordinary occupation is one great source of all those mischiefs which arise from catching cold a subject on which mister Abernethy was wont to declare that a very useful book might be written There are some houses into which one can never enter with impunity from the want of due ventilation Housemaids more especially have an insupportable objection to opening windows on account of the dust which flies in and settles upon the furniture This evil for the soiling of furniture certainly may be called an evil may easily be obviated by fastening a muslin blind against the open window or by pinning a large piece of coarse muslin against it so that the dusty particles will be excluded Generally our ordinary sitting rooms are tolerably well ventilated by the opening and shutting of doors the size of the fire place c but in our bed rooms the vitiation of the air is far greater owing to these rooms being wholly closed during the seven or eight hours in which we sleep in them and also owing to the mass of curtains with which we usually take care to surround our beds In this respect we are indeed improved by the introduction of French bedsteads which are among the most valuable of modern suggestions But notwithstanding this improvement and many others which reflection and science have contributed to introduce we incur much suffering from our ignorance and prejudice on the subject of ventilation For generations society has experienced the evil effects of the want of ventilation and has felt in towns its results in the form of fevers general ill health cutaneous and nervous diseases and yet the most direful ignorance continues on this subject Hospitals are among the few well ventilated buildings which are erected because an idea prevails that ventilation is essential for the sick but it seems to have been forgotten that what is essential for the recovery of health is equally necessary for its preservation Were says doctor Combe a general knowledge of the structure of man to constitute a regular part of a liberal education such inconsistencies as this would soon disappear and the scientific architect would speedily devise the best means for supplying our houses with pure air as he has already supplied them with pure water CHAPTER XXVI MISCELLANEOUS There are many little pieces of rudeness only too common which while they evince ill breeding and are many of them extremely annoying yet they are met with every day and in persons otherwise well bred As they come under no particular head they will merely be mentioned here as habits carefully to avoid It is rude to look over the shoulder of a person who is either reading or writing yet it is done every day To stand with the arms a kimbo the hands on the hips or with the arms crossed while conversing is exceedingly unlady like Avoid restless movements either with the hands or feet to sit perfectly quiet without stiffness easily yet at the same time almost motionless is one of the surest proofs of high breeding If you wish to make yourself agreeable to any one talk as much as you please about his or her affairs and as little as possible about your own Avoid passing before persons seated in the same room with yourself If you must rise to move from place to place endeavor to pass behind the chairs of your companions Above all never pass between two persons who are conversing together Avoid personal remarks they evince a want of judgment good taste kindness and politeness To exchange glances or significant smiles with a third person whilst engaged in a conversation with a second is a proof of low breeding Suppressed laughter shrugging of the shoulders rolling of the eyes and significant glances are all marks of ill breeding If you meet a gentleman at the foot of a flight of stairs do not go up before him Stop bow and motion to him to precede you He will return your bow and run up leaving you to follow him Never whisper or make any confidential communication in company Keep private remarks for private occasions Accepting presents from gentlemen is a dangerous thing It is better to avoid any such obligations and if you make it a rule never to accept such presents you will avoid hurting any one s feelings and save yourself from all further perplexity In meeting your elderly friends in the street look at them long enough to give them an opportunity of recognizing you and if they do so return their salutations respectfully not with the familiar nod you would give to one of your own age Never remain seated whilst a person older than yourself is standing before you talking to you Never lounge on a sofa while there are those in the room whose years give them a better claim to this sort of indulgence Never tease a person to do what she has once declined Never refuse a request or invitation in order to be urged and accept afterwards Comply at once If the request is sincere you will thus afford gratification if not the individual making it deserves to be punished for insincerity by being taken at her word It is not polite when asked what part of a dish you will have to say Any part it is quite indifferent to me it is hard enough to carve for one s friends without choosing for them It is not polite to entertain a visitor with your own family history or the events of your own household It is not polite for married ladies to talk in the presence of gentlemen of the difficulty they have in procuring domestics and how good for nothing they are when procured It is not polite to put food upon the plate of a guest without asking leave or to press her to eat more than she wants It is not polite to stare under ladies bonnets as if you suspected they had stolen the linings from you or wore something that was not their own Never affect a foolish reserve in a mixed company keeping aloof from others as if in a state of mental abstraction If your brain is so full and so busy that you cannot attend to the little civilities cheerful chit chat and light amusements of society keep out of it Never read in company You may open a book to look over the engravings if you will but do not attend to the letter press until you are alone Never jest upon serious subjects Avoid scandal If another person attempts to open a conversation upon scandalous matters check her Say gravely that it is painful for you to hear of the faults or misfortunes of others where your counsel and assistance can be of no service Many persons whose tongues never utter a scandalous word will by a significant glance a shrug of the shoulders a sneer or curl of the lip really make more mischief and suggest harder thoughts than if they used the severest language This is utterly detestable If you have your tongue under perfect control you can also control your looks and you are cowardly contemptible and wicked when you encourage and countenance slander by a look or gesture Never speak of gentlemen by their first name unless you are related to them It is very unlady like to use the surname without the prefix mister To hear a lady speak of Smith Brown Anderson instead of mister Anderson or mister Smith sounds extremely vulgar and is a mark of low breeding Avoid eccentricity either in dress conversation or manner It is a form of vanity as it will attract attention and is therefore in bad taste Never act as if in a hurry Ease of action need not imply laziness but simply polite self possession Never laugh at your own wit That is the part of those who hear you and if you take their duty from them they may omit to join you in your laugh Do not indulge in ridicule It is coarse and unlady like as well as unfeeling Like every other personality it should be carefully avoided Never handle any ornament or article of furniture in the room in which you are a visitor Do not lean your head against the wall You leave an indelible mark upon the paper or if the wall is whitewashed you give your hair a dingy dusty look by bringing it into contact with the lime Never lean forward upon a table Let neither hands nor arms rest there heavily To bestow flattery upon a person to his face betrays a want of delicacy yet not less so rudely to rebuke his errors or mention his faults and not have a tender regard for his feelings It is not improper and may sometimes be very kind to mention to an individual what yourself and others think of his conduct or performances when it is for his interest or usefulness to know it To express to a friend deserved approbation is generally proper Nothing but a quick perception of the feelings of others and a ready sympathy with them can regulate the thousand little proprieties that belong to visits of condolence and congratulation There is one hint however as regards the former which may perhaps be useful and that is not to touch upon the cause of affliction unless the mourner leads the way to it and if a painful effort is made to appear cheerful and to keep aloof from the subject do not make the slightest allusion that could increase this feeling When at table to press your guests to take more than they have inclination for is antiquated and rude This does not however prevent your recommending particular dishes to their attention Everything like compulsion is quite exploded It is a great mistake to suppose that the best music is the most difficult of execution The very reverse generally speaking is the case Music of a high order certainly demands high gifts and attainments on the part of the performer But the gifts of nature may be possessed by the amateur as well as by the professor and the attainments of art may be the result of moderate study and application A young lady possessed of a sweet and tunable voice a good ear intelligence and feeling may cultivate music in its grandest and most beautiful forms and may render its practice a source of the purest enjoyment not only to herself but to her domestic and social circle The various ceremonies observed in refined society are very useful in settling little points on which there might otherwise be much doubt and perplexity but they should never be so strenuously insisted upon as to make an accidental omission of them a ground of resentment and an apology should always be accepted in their place Your enjoyment of a party depends far less on what you find there than on what you carry with you The vain the ambitious the designing will be full of anxiety when they go and of disappointment when they return A short triumph will be followed by a deep mortification and the selfishness of their aims defeats itself If you go to see and to hear and to make the best of whatever occurs with a disposition to admire all that is beautiful and to sympathize in the pleasures of others you can hardly fail to spend the time pleasantly The less you think of yourself and your claims to attention the better If you are much attended to receive it modestly and consider it as a happy accident if you are little noticed use your leisure in observing others It were unjust and ungrateful to conceive that the amusements of life are altogether forbidden by its beneficent Author They serve on the contrary important purposes in the economy of human life and are destined to produce important effects both upon our happiness and character They are in the first place in the language of the Psalmist the wells of the desert the kind resting places in which toil may relax in which the weary spirit may recover its tone and where the desponding mind may resume its strength and its hopes It is not therefore the use of the innocent amusements of life which is dangerous but the abuse of them it is not when they are occasionally but when they are constantly pursued and when from being an occasional indulgence it becomes an habitual desire Women in the middle rank are brought up with the idea that if they engage in some occupations they shall lose their position in society Suppose it to be so surely it is wiser to quit a position we cannot honestly maintain than to live dependent upon the bounty and caprice of others better to labor with our hands than eat the bread of idleness or submit to feel that we must not give utterance to our real opinions or express our honest indignation at being required to act a base or unworthy part And in all cases however situated every female ought to learn how all household affairs are managed were it only for the purpose of being able to direct others There cannot be any disgrace in learning how to make the bread we eat to cook our dinners to mend our clothes or even to clean the house Better to be found busily engaged in removing the dust from the furniture than to let it accumulate there until a visitor leaves palpable traces where his hat or his arm have been laid upon a table Never put temptation in a servant s way never be severe for trifling offences such as accidentally breaking anything but reserve your severity for those offences which are moral evils such as a want of truth general laxity of principle c The orders given to servants should be clear and definite and they should be trained as much as possible to perform their duties regularly so that every morning they may know pretty nearly what will be expected of them during the day It is a great point to live when you are alone as if you expected company that is to say to have everything so neat and orderly that you need not be ashamed of any one seeing your table It is very little more trouble and certainly no more expense and the advantages in point of comfort are unspeakable If a foolish girl by dint of squeezing and bracing with busk and bones secures the conventional beauty of a wasp waist she is tolerably certain to gain an addition she by no means bargained for a red nose which in numberless instances is produced by no other cause than the unnatural girth obstructing circulation and causing stagnation of the blood in that prominent and important feature Often in assemblages of the fair we have seen noses faultless in form but tinged with the abhorred hue to which washes and cosmetics have been applied in wild despair but in vain If the lovely owners had known the cause how speedily the effect would have vanished for surely the most perverse admirer of a distorted spine and compressed lungs would deem the acquisition of a dram drinker s nose too heavy a condition to be complied with A well bred woman will not demand as a right what she may have a claim to expect from the politeness of the other sex nor show dissatisfaction and resentment if she fancies herself neglected For want of good breeding some females are exorbitant in their expectations and appear unthankful even when everything is done which true politeness demands Young women should guard against this unamiable defect A well bred person will take care not to use slang words and expressions There never has been a time at least in late years when there have not been some two or three cant vulgarisms in vogue among all the blackguards of the country Sometimes these phrases have been caught up from some popular song or farce sometimes we believe they have had their origin where assembles the collective wisdom of the country A dozen of these terse but meaningless sayings now dance before our recollection for who has not heard them even to loathing But from whatever source they may have been drawn or whatever wit there might be in their original position the obtrusion of them into decent society is an unwarrantable piece of impertinence A habit of inserting into familiar conversation such phrases as You know You perceive You understand Says he Says she is so far as those matters extend a sign of a want of good breeding With regard to any specific rules for dressing we do not pretend to arbitrate in such matters Let a true sense of propriety of the fitness of things regulate all your habits of living and dressing and it will produce such a beautiful harmony and consistency of character as will throw a charm around you that all will feel though few may comprehend Always consider well whether the articles of dress which you wish to purchase are suited to your age your condition your means to the climate to the particular use to which you mean to put them and let the principles of good taste keep you from the extremes of the fashion and regulate the form so as to combine utility and beauty whilst the known rules of harmony in colors save you from shocking the eye of the artist by incongruous mixtures Manners says the eloquent Edmund Burke are of more importance than laws Upon them in a great measure the laws depend The law can touch us here and there now and then Manners are what vex or sooth corrupt or purify exalt or debase barbarise or refine by a constant steady uniform insensible operation like that of the air we breathe in They give their whole form and colors to our lives According to their quality they aid morals they supply them or they totally destroy them FOUR IMPORTANT RULES Order is heaven s first law one A suitable place for everything and everything in its place two A proper time for everything and everything done in its time three A distinct name for everything and everything called by its name four A certain use for everything and everything put to its use Much time would be saved many disputes avoided numerous articles kept from being lost or injured and constant confusion and disorder prevented by the strict observance of these four important rules Dispense with ornaments altogether rather than wear mock jewelry Depend upon it silvery hair is better adapted to the faded cheeks of middle age than are tresses of nut brown or coal black or any of the mysterious shades produced by a dirty decoction called Hair dye The habitual use of very thin shoes invariably makes the feet tender and a host of other inconveniences arise therefrom If you are tempted to purchase tight shoes don t for several reasons but one may suffice you will not wear them more than twice If you are not quite certain of the line between neatness and the reverse be over scrupulous about your under garments The edge of a soiled petticoat or the glimpse of a rent stocking is singularly disenchanting Men of sense I speak not of boys of eighteen to five and twenty during their age of detestability men who are worth the trouble of falling in love with and the fuss and inconvenience of being married to and to whom one might after some inward conflicts and a course perhaps of fasting and self humiliation submit to fulfil those ill contrived vows of obedience which are exacted at the altar such men want for their wives companions not dolls and women who would suit such men are just as capable of loving fervently deeply as the Ringlettina full of song and sentiment who cannot walk cannot rise in the morning cannot tie her bonnet strings faints if she has to lace her boots never in her life brushed out her beautiful hair would not for the world prick her delicate finger with plain sewing but who can work harder than a factory girl upon a lamb s wool shepherdess dance like a dervise at balls ride like a fox hunter and whilst every breath of air gives her cold in her father s house and she cannot think how people can endure this climate she can go out to parties in February and March with an inch of sleeve and half a quarter of boddice All circumstances well examined there can be no doubt Providence has willed that man should be the head of the human race even as woman is its heart that he should be its strength as she is its solace that he should be its wisdom as she is its grace that he should be its mind its impetus and its courage as she is its sentiment its charm and its consolation Too great an amelioration could not be effected in our opinion in the system generally adopted which far from correcting or even compensating the presumed intellectual inequality of the two sexes generally serves only to increase it By placing for example dancing and needle work at the extreme poles of female study the one for its attraction and the other for its utility and by not filling the immense interval with anything more valuable than mere monotonous imperfect superficial and totally unphilosophical notions this system has made of the greater number of female seminaries establishments which may be compared alike to nursery grounds for coquettes and sempstresses It is never remembered that in domestic life conversation is of more importance than the needle or choregraphy that a husband is neither a pacha nor a lazzarone who must be perpetually intoxicated or unceasingly patched that there are upon the conjugal dial many long hours of calm intimacy of cool contemplation of cold tenderness and that the husband makes another home elsewhere if his own hearth offers him only silence or what is a hundred times worse merely frivolous and monotonous discourse Let the woman play the gossip at a given moment that is all very well let her superintend the laundry or the kitchen at another that is also very well but these duties only comprise two thirds of her mission Ought care not to be taken that during the rest of her time she could also be capable of becoming to her husband a rational friend a cheerful partner an interesting companion or at least an efficient listener whose natural intelligence even if originally inferior to his own shall by the help of education have been raised to the same level Pascal says Kind words do not cost much They never blister the tongue or lips And we have never heard of any mental trouble arising from this quarter Though they do not cost much one They help one s own good nature Soft words soften our own soul Angry words are fuel to the flame of wrath and make it blaze more fiercely two Kind words make other people good natured Cold words freeze people and hot words scorch them and bitter words make them bitter and wrathful words make them wrathful There is such a rush of all other kinds of words in our days that it seems desirable to give kind words a change among them There are vain words and idle words and hasty words and spiteful words and silly words and empty words and profane words and boisterous words and warlike words Kind words also produce their own image on men s souls And a beautiful image it is They smooth and quiet and comfort the hearer They shame him out of his sour morose unkind feelings We have not yet begun to use kind words in such abundance as they ought to be used A writer in the New York Observer speaking of the necessity of guarding the tongue says It is always well to avoid saying everything that is improper but it is especially so before children And here parents as well as others are often in fault Children have as many ears as grown persons and they are generally more attentive to what is said before them What they hear they are very apt to repeat and as they have no discretion and not sufficient knowledge of the world to disguise anything it is generally found that children and fools speak the truth See that boy s eyes glisten while you are speaking of a neighbor in a language you would not wish to have repeated He does not fully understand what you mean but he will remember every word and it will be strange if he does not cause you to blush by the repetition A gentleman was in the habit of calling at a neighbor s house and the lady had always expressed to him great pleasure from his calls One day just after she had remarked to him as usual her happiness from his visit her little boy entered the room The gentleman took him on his knee and asked Are you not glad to see me George No sir replied the boy Why not my little man he continued Because mother don t want you to come said George Indeed how do you know that George Here the mother became crimson and looked daggers at her little son But he saw nothing and therefore replied Because she said yesterday she wished that old bore would not call here again That was enough The gentleman s hat was soon in requisition and he left with the impression that great is the truth and it will prevail Another little child looked sharply in the face of a visitor and being asked what she meant by it replied I wanted to see if you had a drop in your eye I heard mother say you had frequently A boy once asked one of his father s guests who it was that lived next door to him and when he heard his name inquired if he was not a fool No my little friend replied the guest he is not a fool but a very sensible man But why did you ask that question Because replied the boy mother said the other day that you were next door to a fool and I wanted to know who lived next door to you The best way to overcome the selfishness and rudeness you sometimes meet with on public occasions is by great politeness and disinterestedness on your part overcome evil with good and you will satisfy your own conscience and perhaps touch theirs Contending for your rights stirs up the selfish feelings in others but a readiness to yield them awakens generous sentiments and leads to mutual accommodation The more refined you are and the greater have been your advantages the more polite and considerate you should be toward others the more ready to give place to some poor uneducated girl who knows no better than to push herself directly in your way Politeness is as necessary to a happy intercourse with the inhabitants of the kitchen as with those of the parlor it lessens the pains of service promotes kind feelings on both sides and checks unbecoming familiarity always thank them for what they do for you and always ask rather than command their services Of late years the wearing of jewelry in season and out of season both by matrons and unmarried females has increased vastly It is an indication that the growing wealth of the people is not accompanied by a corresponding refinement but that the love of vulgar show the low pride of ostentation takes the place of a pure and elevated taste The emulation with fashionable dames now a days so far from being as with the Spartan women to excel each other in household virtues is to wear the largest diamonds And in this ambition they forget fitness beauty taste everything but the mere vulgar desire to shine To be gracefully and elegantly attired in short is secondary to the desire to be a sort of jeweler s walking show card We do not oppose the use of diamonds and pearls altogether as some persons might imagine from these remarks A few diamonds judiciously worn look well on proper occasions on married women But young girls rarely or never improve their appearance by the use of these dazzling jewels and as a general rule the simpler the costume of a woman in her teens the better Women are usually pretty up to the age of twenty at least Consequently at this period of life there are few whom an elaborate attire does not injure a simple dress or a rose bud in the hair is frequently all that is required and more only spoils that combination of youthfulness grace and modesty which it should be the highest ambition of the girl to attain because if she did but know it it is her highest charm Instead of this however we see gay females scarcely freed from the nursery wearing enormous jeweled ear drops or sporting on the finger a diamond ring as large as a sixpence Sometimes too ladies pretending to be well bred descend to receive a morning visitor of their own sex glittering like a jeweler s case with costly gems In all this we repeat there is neither refinement nor elegance but simply vulgar ostentation Female dress has ceased to be a means of beautifying the person or displaying the wearer s taste and has become instead a mere brag of the husband s or father s wealth A knowledge of domestic duties is beyond all price to a woman Every one of the sex ought to know how to sew and knit and mend and cook and superintend a household In every situation of life high or low this sort of knowledge is of great advantage There is no necessity that the gaining of such information should interfere with intellectual acquirement or even elegant accomplishment A well regulated mind can find time to attend to all When a girl is nine or ten years old she should be accustomed to take some regular share in household duties and to feel responsible for the manner in which her part is performed such as her own mending washing the cups and putting them in place cleaning silver or dusting and arranging the parlor This should not be done occasionally and neglected whenever she finds it convenient she should consider it her department When older than twelve girls should begin to take turns in superintending the household making puddings pies cakes c To learn effectually they should actually do these themselves and not stand by and see others do them Many a husband has been ruined for want of these domestic qualities in a wife and many a husband has been saved from ruin by his wife being able to manage well the household concerns It is a mark not only of ill breeding but of positive want of feeling and judgment to speak disparagingly of a physician to one of his patients Many persons visiting an invalid friend will exclaim loudly against the treatment pursued recommend a different doctor and add to the sufferings of the patient by their injudicious remarks upon the medicines or practice used It is too much the fashion in conversation to use exaggerated expressions which are opposed to truth without the person employing them being aware of it from the mere force of habit Why need we say splendid for pretty magnificent for handsome horrid for unpleasant immense for large thousands or myriads for any number more than two This practice is pernicious for the effect is to deprive the person who is guilty of it from being believed when she is in earnest No one can trust the testimony of an individual who in common conversation is indifferent to the import and regardless of the value of words Politeness is very essential to the right transaction of that great business of woman s life shopping The variety afforded by the shops of a city renders people difficult to please and the latitude they take in examining and asking the price of goods which they have no thought of buying is so trying to the patience of those who attend upon them that nothing but the most perfect courtesy of demeanor can reconcile them to it Some persons behave in shopping as if no one had any rights or any feelings but the purchasers as if the sellers of goods were mere automatons put behind the counter to do their bidding they keep them waiting whilst they talk of other things with a friend they call for various goods ask the price and try to cheapen them without any real intention of buying A lady who wants decision of character after hesitating and debating till the poor trader s patience is almost exhausted will beg him to send the article to her house for her to examine it there and after giving him all this trouble she will refuse to purchase it without any scruple or apology Some think they have a right to exchange articles at the place where they were bought whereas that privilege should be asked as a favor only by a good customer and then but rarely RECEIPTS FOR THE COMPLEXION COLD CREAM one Take two one two ounces of sweet oil of

animal food is taken second Once daily run the brush lightly two or three times over soap then dip it in salt and with it clean the teeth working the brush up and down rather than or as well as backwards and forwards This is a cheap safe and effectual dentrifice third Eat freely of common cress the sort used with mustard under the name of small salad it must be eaten with salt only If thus used two or three days in succession it will effectually loosen tartar even of long standing The same effect is produced though perhaps not in an equal degree by eating strawberries and raspberries especially the former A leaf of common green sage rubbed on the teeth is useful both in cleansing and polishing and probably many other common vegetable productions also CARE OF THE TEETH The water with which the teeth are cleansed should be what is called lukewarm They should be well but gently brushed both night and morning the brush should be neither too hard nor too soft The best tooth powders are made from cuttle fish prepared chalk and orris root commingled together in equal quantities SIMPLE MEANS OF REMOVING TARTAR FROM THE TEETH In these summer months tartar may be effectually

spoonful of spirits of camphor bottle the mixture for use One wine glassful of this solution added to half a pint of tepid water is sufficient for each application FOR THE HAIR LOSS OF HAIR The most simple remedy for loss of hair is friction to the scalp of the head using for the purpose an old tooth brush or one of which the bristles have been softened by soaking in boiling water The shape of the instrument adapts it to be inserted readily and effectually between the hair where it should be rubbed backwards and forwards over the space of an inch or so at a time In addition to the friction which should be used once or twice a day the head may be showered once a day with cold water carefully drying it with soft spongy towels POMATUM Take of white mutton suet four pounds well boiled in hot water three quarts and washed to free it from salt Melt the suet when dried with one one two pounds of fresh lard and two pounds of yellow wax Pour into an earthen vessel and stir till it is cold

brushing or combing Such cases as these will generally be found remedial Wilson recommends women with short hair to dip their heads into cold water every morning and afterwards apply the brush until a glow of warmth is felt all over the scalp Those who have long hair are to brush it till the skin beneath becomes red when a lotion is to be applied as here specified Eau de Cologne two oz Tincture of

one oz Boiling distilled Vinegar one two pint Let this infusion stand for a week and then strain through muslin for use If irritating to the skin these lotions can be made weaker or less frequently applied than might otherwise be necessary Either of them or distilled vinegar alone may be rubbed into a bald patch with a tooth brush The same lotions may also be used if the hair is disposed to become gray too early as they invigorate the apparatus situated beneath the skin and enable it to take up coloring matter Dyeing of the hair is a practice which ought never to be resorted to Those who are unwilling or unable to discontinue the practice of applying some kind of dressing to the hair should at least content themselves with a simple yet good material The best olive oil is most suitable for the purpose scented with otto of roses or bergamot the latter as many persons know is the essence of a species of mint The same scents may also be used for pomatum which should be made of

through a thin doubled muslin and stir to it from twelve to twenty drops of essential oil of roses and pour it into small gallipots from which it can easily be turned out when cold and then be rubbed against the lips which is the most pleasant way of using it as it is much firmer than common lip salve and will be found more healing and infinitely more agreeable When butter cannot be had direct from the churn any which is quite fresh may be substituted for it after the salt has been well washed and soaked out of it by working it with a strong spoon in cold water in which it should remain for a couple of days or more the water being frequently changed during the time ROSE LIP SALVE eight ounces sweet almond oil four ounces prepared mutton suet one one two ounces white wax two ounces

successively in a pretty strong solution of common soda The alkali dissolves the indurated cuticle and the corn falls out spontaneously leaving a small excavation which soon fills up TO REMOVE CORNS Get four ounces of white diachylon plaster four ounces of shoemaker s wax and sixty drops of muriatic acid or spirits of salt Boil them for a few minutes in an earthen pipkin and when cold roll the mass between the hands and apply a little on a piece of white leather A CERTAIN CURE FOR SOFT CORNS Dip a piece of soft linen rag in turpentine and wrap it round the toe on which the soft corn is

CLEAN KID GLOVES Make a strong lather with curd soap and warm water in which steep a small piece of new flannel Place the glove on a flat clean and unyielding surface such as the bottom of a dish and having thoroughly soaped the flannel when squeezed from the lather rub the kid till all dirt be removed cleaning and resoaping the flannel from time to time Care must be taken to omit no part of the glove by turning the fingers c The gloves must be dried in the sun or before a moderate fire and will present the appearance of old parchment When quite dry they must be gradually pulled out and will look new ANOTHER First see that your hands are clean then put on the gloves and wash them as though you were washing your hands in a basin of spirits of turpentine until quite clean then hang them up in a warm place or where there is a good current of air which will carry off all smell of the turpentine This method was brought from Paris and thousands of dollars have been made by it TO CLEAN COLORED KID GLOVES Have ready on a table a clean towel folded three or four times a saucer of new milk and another saucer with a piece of brown soap Take one glove at a time and spread it smoothly on the folded towel Then dip in the milk a piece of clean flannel rub it on the soap till you get off a tolerable quantity and then with the wet flannel commence rubbing the glove Begin at the wrist and rub lengthways towards the end of the fingers holding the glove firmly in your right hand Continue this process until the glove is well cleaned all over with the milk and soap When done spread them out and pin them on a line to dry gradually When nearly dry pull them out evenly the crossway of the leather When quite dry stretch them on your hands White kid gloves may also be washed in this manner provided they have never been cleaned with India rubber TO CLEAN WHITE OR COLORED KID GLOVES Put the glove on your hand then take a small piece of flannel dip it in camphene and well but gently rub it over the glove taking care not to make it too wet when the dirt is removed dip the flannel or another piece if that is become too dirty into pipe clay and rub it over the glove take it off and hang it up in a room to dry and in a day or two very little smell will remain and if done carefully they will be almost as good as new In colored ones if yellow use gamboge after the pipe clay and for other colors match it in dry paint TO CLEAN WHITE KID GLOVES Stretch the gloves on a clean board and rub all the soiled or grease spots with cream of tartar or magnesia Let them rest an hour Then have ready a mixture of alum and Fuller s earth both powdered and rub it all over the gloves with a brush a clean tooth brush or something similar and let them rest for an hour or two Then sweep it all off and go over them with a flannel dipped in a mixture of bran and finely powdered whiting Let them rest another hour then brush off the powder and you will find them clean TO CLEAN LIGHT KID GLOVES Put on one glove and having made a strong lather with common brown soap apply it with a shaving brush wiping it off immediately with a clean towel then blow into the glove and leave it to dry AN EXCELLENT PASTE FOR GLOVES Liquor of ammonia half an ounce chloride of potash ten ounces curd soap one pound water half a pint dissolve the soap in the water with a gentle heat then as the mixture cools stir in the other ingredients Use it by rubbing it over the gloves until the dirt is removed TO WASH THREAD LACE Rip off the lace carefully pick out the loose bits of thread and roll the lace very smoothly and securely round a clean black bottle previously covered with old white linen sewed tightly on Tack each end of the lace with a needle and thread to keep it smooth and be careful in wrapping not to crumple or fold in any of the scallops or pearlings After it is on the bottle take some of the best sweet oil and with a clean sponge wet the lace thoroughly to the inmost folds Have ready in a wash kettle a strong cold lather of clear water and white Castile soap Fill the bottle with cold water to prevent its bursting cork it well and stand it upright in the suds with a string round the neck secured to the ears or handle of the kettle to prevent its knocking about and breaking while over the fire Let it boil in the suds for an hour or more till the lace is clean and white all through Drain off the suds and dry it on the bottle in the sun When dry remove the lace from the bottle and roll it round a wide ribbon block or lay it in long folds place it within a sheet of smooth white paper and press it in a large book for a few days TO WASH A WHITE LACE VEIL Put the veil into a strong lather of white soap and very clear water and let it simmer slowly for a quarter of an hour Take it out and squeeze it well but be sure not to rub it Rinse it in two cold waters with a drop or two of liquid blue in the last Have ready some very clear and weak gum arabic water or some thin starch or rice water Pass the veil through it and clear it by clapping Then stretch it out even and pin it to dry on a linen cloth making the edge as straight as possible opening out all the scallops and fastening each with pins When dry lay a piece of thin muslin smoothly over it and iron it on the wrong side TO WASH A BLACK LACE VEIL Mix bullock s gall with sufficient hot water to make it as warm as you can bear your hand in Then pass the veil through it It must be squeezed and not rubbed It will be well to perfume the gall with a little musk Next rinse the veil through two cold waters tinging the last with indigo Then dry it Have ready in a pan some stiffening made by pouring boiling water on a very small piece of glue Pat the veil into it squeeze it out stretch it and clap it Afterwards pin it out to dry on a linen cloth making it very straight and even and taking care to open and pin the edge very nicely When dry iron it on the wrong side having laid a linen cloth over the ironing blanket Any article of black lace may be washed in this manner TO CLEAN WHITE SATIN AND FLOWERED SILKS one Mix sifted stale bread crumbs with powder blue and rub it thoroughly all over then shake it well and dust it with clean soft cloths Afterwards where there are any gold or silver flowers take a piece of crimson ingrain velvet rub the flowers with it which will restore them to their original lustre two Pass them through a solution of fine hard soap at a hand heat drawing them through the hand Rinse in lukewarm water dry and finish by pinning out Brush the flossy or bright side with a clean clothes brush the way of the nap Finish them by dipping a sponge into a size made by boiling isinglass in water and rub the wrong side Rinse out a second time and brush and dry near a fire or in a warm room Silks may be treated in the same way but not brushed TO CLEAN WHITE SILK Dissolve some of the best curd soap in boiling water and when the solution is as hot as the hand can bear pass the silk through it thoroughly handling it gently not to injure the texture If there are any spots these may be rubbed carefully until they disappear The article must then be rinsed in lukewarm water TO IRON SILK Silk cannot be ironed smoothly so as to press out all the creases without first sprinkling it with water and rolling it up tightly in a towel letting it rest for an hour or two If the iron is in the least too hot it will injure the color and it should first be tried on an old piece of the same silk TO WASH SILK Half a pint of gin four ounces of soft soap and two ounces of honey well shaken then rub the silk with a sponge wetted with the above mixture upon a table and wash through two waters in which first put two or three spoonfuls of ox gall which will brighten the colors and prevent their running The silks should not be wrung but well shaken and hung up smoothly to dry and mangled while damp The writer has had green silk dresses washed by this receipt and they have looked as well as new TO RENOVATE BLACK SILK Slice some uncooked potatoes pour boiling water on them when cold sponge the right side of the silk with it and iron on the wrong TO KEEP SILK Silk articles should not be kept folded in white paper as the chloride of lime used in bleaching the paper will probably impair the color of the silk Brown or blue paper is better the yellowish smooth India paper is best of all Silk intended for a dress should not be kept in the house long before it is made up as lying in the folds will have a tendency to impair its durability by causing it to cut or split particularly if the silk has been thickened by gum We knew an instance of a very elegant and costly thread lace veil being found on its arrival from France cut into squares and therefore destroyed by being folded over a pasteboard card A white satin dress should be pinned up in blue paper with coarse brown paper outside sewed together at the edges TO RESTORE VELVET When velvet gets plushed from pressure holding the reverse side over a basin of boiling water will raise the pile and perhaps it may also succeed in the case of wet from rain TO IRON VELVET Having ripped the velvet apart damp each piece separately and holding it tightly in both hands stretch it before the fire the wrong side of the velvet being towards the fire This will remove the creases and give the surface of the material a fresh and new appearance Velvet cannot be ironed on a table for when spread out on a hard substance the iron will not go smoothly over the pile TO CLEAN ERMINE AND MINIVAR FUR Take a piece of soft flannel and rub the fur well with it but remember that the rubbing must be always against the grain then rub the fur with common flour until clean Shake it well and rub again with the flannel till all the flour is out of it I have had a Minivar boa for four years It has never been cleaned with anything but flour and is not in the least injured by the rubbing It was a school companion who told me that her aunt a Russian lady always cleaned her white furs with flour and that they looked quite beautiful It has one advantage the lining does not require to be taken out and it only requires a little trouble Ermine takes longer than Minivar The latter is very easily done TO PERFUME LINEN Rose leaves dried in the shade or at about four feet from a stove one pound cloves carraway seeds and allspice of each one ounce pound in a mortar or grind in a mill dried salt a quarter of a pound mix all these together and put the compound into little bags TO RESTORE SCORCHED LINEN Take two onions peel and slice them and extract the juice by squeezing or pounding Then cut up half an ounce of white soap and two ounces of fuller s earth mix with them the onion juice and half a pint of vinegar Boil this composition well and spread it when cool over the scorched part of the linen leaving it to dry thereon Afterwards wash out the linen TO WHITEN LINEN THAT HAS TURNED YELLOW Cut up a pound of fine white soap into a gallon of milk and hang it over the fire in a wash kettle When the soap has entirely melted put in the linen and boil it half an hour Then take it out have ready a lather of soap and warm water wash the linen in it and then rinse it through two cold waters with a very little blue in the last TO WASH CHINA CRAPE SCARFS c If the fabric be good these articles of dress can be washed as frequently as may be required and no diminution of their beauty will be discoverable even when the various shades of green have been employed among other colors in the patterns In cleaning them make a strong lather of boiling water suffer it to cool when cold or nearly so wash the scarf quickly and thoroughly dip it immediately in cold hard water in which a little salt has been thrown to preserve the colors rinse squeeze and hang it out to dry in the open air pin it at its extreme edge to the line so that it may not in any part be folded together the more rapidly it dries the clearer it will be TO CLEAN EMBROIDERY AND GOLD LACE For this purpose no alkaline liquors are to be used for while they clean the gold they corrode the silk and change its color Soap also alters the shade and even the species of certain colors But spirit of wine may be used without any danger of its injuring either color or quality and in many cases proves as effectual for restoring the lustre of the gold as the corrosive detergents But though spirits of wine is the most innocent material employed for this purpose it is not in all cases proper The golden covering may be in some parts worn off or the base metal with which it has been alloyed may be corroded by the air so as to leave the particles of the gold disunited while the silver underneath tarnished to a yellow hue may continue a tolerable color to the whole so it is apparent that the removal of the tarnish would be prejudicial and make the lace or embroidery less like gold than it was before It is necessary that care should be taken TO REMOVE STAINS OF WINE OR FRUIT FROM TABLE LINEN A wine stain may sometimes be removed by rubbing it while wet with common salt It is said also that sherry wine poured immediately on a place where port wine has been spilled will prevent its leaving a stain A certain way of extracting fruit or wine stains from table linen is to tie up some cream of tartar in the stained part so as to form a sort of bag and then to put the linen into a lather of soap and cold water and boil it awhile Then transfer it wet to a lukewarm suds wash and rinse it well and dry and iron it The stains will disappear during the process Another way is to mix in equal quantities soft soap slackened lime and pearl ash Rub the stain with this preparation and expose the linen to the sun with the mixture plastered on it If necessary repeat the application As soon as the stain has disappeared wash out the linen immediately as it will be injured if the mixture is left in it STAIN MIXTURE Take an ounce of sal ammoniac or hartshorn and an ounce of salt of tartar mix them well put them into a pint of soft water and bottle it for use keeping it very tightly corked Pour a little of this liquid into a saucer and wash in it those parts of a white article that have been stained with ink mildew fruit or red wine When the stains have by this process been removed wash the article in the usual manner CHEMICAL RENOVATING BALLS for taking out grease paint pitch tar from silks stuffs linen woolen carpets hats coats c without fading the color or injuring the cloth one four ounce of fuller s earth one four ounce of pipe clay one ounce salt of tartar one ounce beef gall one ounce spirits of wine Pound the hard parts and mix the ingredients well together Wet the stain with cold water rub it well with this ball then sponge it with a wet sponge and the stain will disappear TO PREVENT COLORED THINGS FROM RUNNING Boil one four pound of soap till nearly dissolved then add a small piece of alum and boil with it Wash the things in this lather but do not soap them If they require a second water put alum to that also as well as to the rinsing and blue water This will preserve them TO REMOVE STAINS FROM MOURNING DRESSES Take a good handful of fig leaves and boil them in two quarts of water until reduced to a pint Squeeze the leaves and put the liquor into a bottle for use The articles whether of bombasin crape cloth c need only be rubbed with a sponge dipped in the liquor when the effect will be instantly produced If any reason exists to prevent the substance from being wetted then apply French chalk which will absorb the grease from the finest texture without injury TO SHRINK NEW FLANNEL New flannel should always be shrunk or washed before it is made up that it may be cut out more accurately and that the grease which is used in manufacturing it may be extracted First cut off the list along the selvage edges of the whole piece Then put it into warm not boiling water without soap Begin at one end of the piece and rub it with both hands till you come to the other end this is to get out the grease and the blue with which new white flannel is always tinged Then do the same through another water Rinse it through a clean lukewarm water wring it lengthways and stretch it well In hanging it out on a line do not suspend it in festoons but spread it along the line straight and lengthways If dried in festoons the edges will be in great scollops making it very difficult to cut out It must be dried in the sun When dry let it be stretched even clapped with the hands and rolled up tight and smoothly till wanted GUM ARABIC STARCH Get two ounces of fine white gum arabic and pound it to powder Next put it into a pitcher and pour on it a pint or more of boiling water according to the degree of strength you desire and then having covered it let it set all night In the morning pour it carefully from the dregs into a clean bottle cork it and keep it for use A table spoonful of gum water stirred into a pint of starch that has been made in the usual manner will give to lawns either white or printed a look of newness to which nothing else can restore them after washing It is also good much diluted for thin white muslin and bobinet TO WASH WHITE THREAD GLOVES AND STOCKINGS These articles are so delicate as to require great care in washing and they must not on any account be rubbed Make a lather of white soap and cold water and put it into a saucepan Soap the gloves or stockings well put them in and set the saucepan over the fire When they have come to a hard boil take them off and when cool enough for your hand squeeze them in the water Having prepared a fresh cold lather boil them again in that Then take the pan off the fire and squeeze them well again after which they can be stretched dried and then ironed on the wrong side TO CLEAN SILK STOCKINGS First wash the stockings in the usual manner to take out the rough dirt After rinsing them in clean water wash them well in a fresh soap liquor Then make a third soap liquor which color with a little stone blue then wash the stockings once more take them out wring them and particularly dry them Now stove them with brimstone and draw on a wooden leg two stockings one upon the other observing that the two fronts or outsides are face to face Polish with a glass bottle The two first liquors should be only lukewarm but the third as hot as you can bear your hand in Blondes and gauzes may be whitened in the same manner but there should be a little gum put in the last liquor before they are stoved TO TAKE OUT MILDEW FROM CLOTHES Mix some soft soap with powdered starch half as much salt and the juice of a lemon lay it on the part with a brush let it be exposed in the air day and night until the stain disappears Iron moulds may be removed by the salt of lemons Many stains in linen may be taken out by dipping linen in sour buttermilk and then drying it in the sun afterwards wash it in cold water several times Stains caused by acids may be removed by tying some pearlash up in the stained part scrape some soap in cold soft water and boil the linen till the stain is out BLEACHING STRAW Straw is bleached and straw bonnets cleaned by putting them into a cask into which a few brimstone matches are placed lighted The fumes of the sulphur have the effect of destroying the color or whitening the straw The same effect may be produced by dipping the straw into the chloride of lime dissolved in water TO WASH MOUSELINE DE LAINE Boil a pound of rice in five quarts of water and when cool enough wash in this using the rice for soap Have another quantity ready but strain the rice from this and use it with warm water keeping the rice strained off for a third washing which at the same time stiffens and also brightens the colors TO BLEACH A FADED DRESS Wash the dress in hot suds and boil it until the color appears to be gone then rinse it and dry it in the sun Should it not be rendered white by these means lay the dress in the open air and bleach it for several days If still not quite white repeat the boiling INDELIBLE MARKING INK WITHOUT PREPARATION one one two drachms
