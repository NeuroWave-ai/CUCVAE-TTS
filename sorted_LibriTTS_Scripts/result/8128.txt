of sunset that they came to the foot of the mountain There was in that place no sign of life neither token of water nor trace of plant nor shadow of flying bird nothing but desolation rising to desolation And the summit was lost in heaven Then the Bodhisattva said to his young companion What you have asked to see will be shown to you But the place of the Vision is far and the way is rude Follow after me and do not fear strength will be given you Twilight gloomed about them as they climbed There was no beaten path nor any mark of former human visitation and the way was over an endless heaping of tumbled fragments that rolled or turned beneath the foot Sometimes a mass dislodged would clatter down with hollow echoings sometimes the substance trodden would burst like an empty shell Stars pointed and thrilled and the darkness deepened Do not fear my son said the Bodhisattva guiding danger there is none though the way be grim Under the stars they climbed fast fast mounting by help of power superhuman High zones of mist they passed and they saw below them ever widening as they climbed a soundless flood of cloud like the tide of a milky sea Hour after hour they climbed and forms invisible yielded to their tread with dull soft crashings and faint cold fires lighted and died at every breaking And once the pilgrim youth laid hand on a something smooth that was not stone and lifted it and dimly saw the cheekless gibe of death Linger not thus my son urged the voice of the teacher the summit that we must gain is very far away On through the dark they climbed and felt continually beneath them the soft strange breakings and saw the icy fires worm and die till the rim of the night turned grey and the stars began to fail and the east began to bloom Yet still they climbed fast fast mounting by help of power superhuman About them now was frigidness of death and silence tremendous A gold flame kindled in the east Then first to the pilgrim s gaze the steeps revealed their nakedness and a trembling seized him and a ghastly fear For there was not any ground neither beneath him nor about him nor above him but a heaping only monstrous and measureless of skulls and fragments of skulls and dust of bone with a shimmer of shed teeth strown through the drift of it like the shimmer of scrags of shell in the wrack of a tide Do not fear my son cried the voice of the Bodhisattva only the strong of heart can win to the place of the Vision Behind them the world had vanished Nothing remained but the clouds beneath and the sky above and the heaping of skulls between up slanting out of sight Then the sun climbed with the climbers and there was no warmth in the light of him but coldness sharp as a sword And the horror of stupendous height and the nightmare of stupendous depth and the terror of silence ever grew and grew and weighed upon the pilgrim and held his feet so that suddenly all power departed from him and he moaned like a sleeper in dreams Hasten hasten my son cried the Bodhisattva the day is brief and the summit is very far away But the pilgrim shrieked I fear I fear unspeakably and the power has departed from me The power will return my son made answer the Bodhisattva Look now below you and above you and about you and tell me what you see I cannot cried the pilgrim trembling and clinging I dare not look beneath Before me and about me there is nothing but skulls of men And yet my son said the Bodhisattva laughing softly and yet you do not know of what this mountain is made The other shuddering repeated I fear unutterably I fear there is nothing but skulls of men A mountain of skulls it is responded the Bodhisattva But know my son that all of them ARE YOUR OWN Each has at some time been the nest of your dreams and delusions and desires Not even one of them is the skull of any other being All all without exception have been yours in the billions of your former lives FURISODE Recently while passing through a little street tenanted chiefly by dealers in old wares I noticed a furisode or long sleeved robe of the rich purple tint called murasaki hanging before one of the shops It was a robe such as might have been worn by a lady of rank in the time of the Tokugawa I stopped to look at the five crests upon it and in the same moment there came to my recollection this legend of a similar robe said to have once caused the destruction of Yedo Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago the daughter of a rich merchant of the city of the Shoguns while attending some temple festival perceived in the crowd a young samurai of remarkable beauty and immediately fell in love with him Unhappily for her he disappeared in the press before she could learn through her attendants who he was or whence he had come But his image remained vivid in her memory even to the least detail of his costume The holiday attire then worn by samurai youths was scarcely less brilliant than that of young girls and the upper dress of this handsome stranger had seemed wonderfully beautiful to the enamoured maiden She fancied that by wearing a robe of like quality and color bearing the same crest she might be able to attract his notice on some future occasion Accordingly she had such a robe made with very long sleeves according to the fashion of the period and she prized it greatly She wore it whenever she went out and when at home she would suspend it in her room and try to imagine the form of her unknown beloved within it Sometimes she would pass hours before it dreaming and weeping by turns And she would pray to the gods and the Buddhas that she might win the young man s affection often repeating the invocation of the Nichiren sect Namu myo ho renge kyo But she never saw the youth again and she pined with longing for him and sickened and died and was buried After her burial the long sleeved robe that she had so much prized was given to the Buddhist temple of which her family were parishioners It is an old custom to thus dispose of the garments of the dead The priest was able to sell the robe at a good price for it was a costly silk and bore no trace of the tears that had fallen upon it It was bought by a girl of about the same age as the dead lady She wore it only one day Then she fell sick and began to act strangely crying out that she was haunted by the vision of a beautiful young man and that for love of him she was going to die And within a little while she died and the long sleeved robe was a second time presented to the temple Again the priest sold it and again it became the property of a young girl who wore it only once Then she also sickened and talked of a beautiful shadow and died and was buried And the robe was given a third time to the temple and the priest wondered and doubted Nevertheless he ventured to sell the luckless garment once more Once more it was purchased by a girl and once more worn and the wearer pined and died And the robe was given a fourth time to the temple Then the priest felt sure that there was some evil influence at work and he told his acolytes to make a fire in the temple court and to burn the robe So they made a fire into which the robe was thrown But as the silk began to burn there suddenly appeared upon it dazzling characters of flame the characters of the invocation Namu myo ho renge kyo and these one by one leaped like great sparks to the temple roof and the temple took fire Embers from the burning temple presently dropped upon neighbouring roofs and the whole street was soon ablaze Then a sea wind rising blew destruction into further streets and the conflagration spread from street to street and from district into district till nearly the whole of the city was consumed And this calamity which occurred upon the eighteenth day of the first month of the first year of Meireki sixteen fifty five is still remembered in Tokyo as the Furisode Kwaji the Great Fire of the Long sleeved Robe According to a story book called Kibun Daijin the name of the girl who caused the robe to be made was O Same and she was the daughter of Hikoyemon a wine merchant of Hyakusho machi in the district of Azabu Because of her beauty she was also called Azabu Komachi or the Komachi of Azabu one The same book says that the temple of the tradition was a Nichiren temple called honorable myoji in the district of Hongo and that the crest upon the robe was a kikyo flower But there are many different versions of the story and I distrust the Kibun Daijin because it asserts that the beautiful samurai was not really a man but a transformed dragon or water serpent that used to inhabit the lake at Uyeno Shinobazu no Ike one After more than a thousand years the name of Komachi or Ono no Komachi is still celebrated in Japan She was the most beautiful woman of her time and so great a poet that she could move heaven by her verses and cause rain to fall in time of drought Many men loved her in vain and many are said to have died for love of her But misfortunes visited her when her youth had passed and after having been reduced to the uttermost want she became a beggar and died at last upon the public highway near Kyoto As it was thought shameful to bury her in the foul rags found upon her some poor person gave a wornout summer robe katabira to wrap her body in and she was interred near Arashiyama at a spot still pointed out to travellers as the Place of the Katabira Katabira no Tsuchi Incense I see rising out of darkness a lotos in a vase Most of the vase is invisible but I know that it is of bronze and that its glimpsing handles are bodies of dragons Only the lotos is fully illuminated three pure white flowers and five great leaves of gold and green gold above green on the upcurling under surface an artificial lotos It is bathed by a slanting stream of sunshine the darkness beneath and beyond is the dusk of a temple chamber I do not see the opening through which the radiance pours but I am aware that it is a small window shaped in the outline form of a temple bell The reason that I see the lotos one memory of my first visit to a Buddhist sanctuary is that there has come to me an odor of incense Often when I smell incense this vision defines and usually thereafter other sensations of my first day in Japan revive in swift succession with almost painful acuteness It is almost ubiquitous this perfume of incense It makes one element of the faint but complex and never to be forgotten odor of the Far East It haunts the dwelling house not less than the temple the home of the peasant not less than the yashiki of the prince Shinto shrines indeed are free from it incense being an abomination to the elder gods But wherever Buddhism lives there is incense In every house containing a Buddhist shrine or Buddhist tablets incense is burned at certain times and in even the rudest country solitudes you will find incense smouldering before wayside images little stone figures of Fudo Jizo or Kwannon Many experiences of travel strange impressions of sound as well as of sight remain associated in my own memory with that fragrance vast silent shadowed avenues leading to weird old shrines mossed flights of worn steps ascending to temples that moulder above the clouds joyous tumult of festival nights sheeted funeral trains gliding by in glimmer of lanterns murmur of household prayer in fishermen s huts on far wild coasts and visions of desolate little graves marked only by threads of blue smoke ascending graves of pet animals or birds remembered by simple hearts in the hour of prayer to Amida the Lord of Immeasurable Light But the odor of which I speak is that of cheap incense only the incense in general use There are many other kinds of incense and the range of quality is amazing A bundle of common incense rods they are about as thick as an ordinary pencil lead and somewhat longer can be bought for a few sen while a bundle of better quality presenting to inexperienced eyes only some difference in color may cost several yen and be cheap at the price Still costlier sorts of incense veritable luxuries take the form of lozenges wafers pastilles and a small envelope of such material may be worth four or five pounds sterling But the commercial and industrial questions relating to Japanese incense represent the least interesting part of a remarkably curious subject II Curious indeed but enormous by reason of it infinity of tradition and detail I am afraid even to think of the size of the volume that would be needed to cover it Such a work would properly begin with some brief account of the earliest knowledge and use of aromatics in Japan I would next treat of the records and legends of the first introduction of Buddhist incense fron Korea when King Shomyo of Kudara in five hundred fifty one A D sent to the island empire a collection of sutras an image of the Buddha and one complete set of furniture for a temple Then something would have to be said about those classifications of incense which were made during the tenth century in the periods of Engi and of Tenryaku and about the report of the ancient state councillor Kimitaka Sangi who visited China in the latter part of the thirteenth century and transmitted to the Emperor Yomei the wisdom of the Chinese concerning incense Then mention should be made of the ancient incenses still preserved in various Japanese temples and of the famous fragments of ranjatai publicly exhibited at Nara in the tenth year of Meiji which furnished supplies to the three great captains Nobunaga Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu After this should fol low an outline of the history of mixed incenses made in Japan with notes on the classifications devised by the luxurious Takauji and on the nomenclature established later by Ashikaga Yoshimasa who collected one hundred and thirty varieties of incense and invented for the more precious of them names recognized even to this day such as Blossom Showering Smoke of Fuji and Flower of the Pure Law Examples ought to be given likewise of traditions attaching to historical incenses preserved in several princely families together with specimens of those hereditary recipes for incense making which have been transmitted from generation to generation through hundreds of years and are still called after their august inventors as the Method of Hina Dainagon the Method of Sento In et cetera Recipes also should be given of those strange incenses made to imitate the perfume of the lotos the smell of the summer breeze and the odor of the autumn wind Some legends of the great period of incense luxury should be cited such as the story of Sue Owari no Kami who built for himself a palace of incense woods and set fire to it on the night of his revolt when the smoke of its burning perfumed the land to a distance of twelve miles Of course the mere compilation of materials for a history of mixed incenses would entail the study of a host of documents treatises and books particularly of such strange works as the Kun Shu Rui Sho or Incense Collector s Classifying Manual containing the teachings of the Ten Schools of the Art of Mixing Incense directions as to the best seasons for incense making and instructions about the different kinds of fire to be used for burning incense one kind is called literary fire and another military fire together with rules for pressing the ashes of a censer into various artistic designs corresponding to season and occasion A special chapter should certainly be given to the incense bags kusadama hung up in houses to drive away goblins and to the smaller incense bags formerly carried about the person as a protection against evil spirits Then a very large part of the work would have to be devoted to the religious uses and legends of incense a huge subject in itself There would also have to be considered the curious history of the old incense assemblies whose elaborate ceremonial could be explained only by help of numerous diagrams One chapter at least would be required for the subject of the ancient importation of incense materials from India China Annam Siam Cambodia Ceylon Sumatra Java Borneo and various islands of the Malay archipelago places all named in rare books about incense And a final chapter should treat of the romantic literature of incense the poems stories and dramas in which incense rites are mentioned and especially those love songs comparing the body to incense and passion to the eating flame Even as burns the perfume lending thy robe its fragance Smoulders my life away consumed by the pain of longing

none	none	 The common incense everywhere burned by poor people before Buddhist icons is called an soku ko 
5727_47030_000011_000001	train-clean-360	This is very cheap 
none	none	Great quantities of it are burned by pilgrims in the bronze censers set before the entrances of famous temples and in front of roadside images you may often see bundles of it These are for the use of pious wayfarers who pause before every Buddhist image on their path to repeat a brief prayer and when possible to set a few rods smouldering at the feet of the statue But in rich temples and during great religious ceremonies much more expensive incense is used Altogether three classes of perfumes are employed in Buddhist rites ko or incense proper in many varieties the word literally means only fragrant substance dzuko an odorous ointment and makko a fragrant powder Ko is burned dzuko is rubbed upon the hands of the priest as an ointment of purification and makko is sprinkled about the sanctuary This makko is said to be identical with the sandalwood powder so frequently mentioned in Buddhist texts But it is only the true incense which can be said to bear an important relation to the religious service Incense declares the Soshi Ryaku one is the Messenger of Earnest Desire 
5727_47030_000012_000001	train-clean-360	When the rich Sudatta wished to invite the Buddha to a repast he made use of incense 
none	none	He was wont to ascend to the roof of his house on the eve of the day of the entertainment and to remain standing there all night holding a censer of precious incense And as often as he did thus the Buddha never failed to come on the following day at the exact time desired This text plainly implies that incense as a burnt offering symbolizes the pious desires of the faithful But it symbolizes other things also and it has furnished many remarkable similes to Buddhist literature Some of these and not the least interesting occur in prayers of which the following from the book called Hoji san two is a striking example Let my body remain pure like a censer let my thought be ever as a fire of wisdom purely consuming the incense of sila and of dhyana three that so may I do homage to all the Buddhas in the Ten Directions of the Past the Present and the Future Sometimes in Buddhist sermons the destruction of Karma by virtuous effort is likened to the burning of incense by a pure flame sometimes again the life of man is compared to the smoke of incense In his Hundred Writings Hyaku tsu kiri kami the Shinshu priest Myoden says quoting from the Buddhist work Kujikkajo or Ninety Articles In the burning of incense we see that so long as any incense remains so long does the burning continue and the smoke mount skyward Now the breath of this body of ours this impermanent combination of Earth Water Air and Fire is like that smoke And the changing of the incense into cold ashes when the flame expires is an emblem of the changing of our bodies into ashes when our funeral pyres have burnt themselves out He also tells us about that Incense Paradise of which every believer ought to be reminded by the perfume of earthly incense In the Thirty Second Vow for the Attainment of the Paradise of Wondrous Incense he says it is written That Paradise is formed of hundreds of thousands of different kinds of incense and of substances incalculably precious the beauty of it incomparably exceeds anything in the heavens or in the sphere of man the fragrance of it perfumes all the worlds of the Ten Directions of Space and all who perceive that odor practise Buddha deeds In ancient times there were men of superior wisdom and virtue who by reason of their vow obtained perception of the odor but we who are born with inferior wisdom and virtue in these later days cannot obtain such perception Nevertheless it will be well for us when we smell the incense kindled before the image of Amida to imagine that its odor is the wonderful fragrance of Paradise and to repeat the Nembutsu in gratitude for the mercy of the Buddha one Short or Epitomized History of Priests two The Praise of Pious Observances three By sila is meant the observance of the rules of purity in act and thought Dhyana called by Japanese Buddhists Zenjo is one of the higher forms of meditation IV But the use of incense in Japan is not confined to religious rites and ceremonies indeed the costlier kinds of incense are manufactured chiefly for social entertainments Incense burning has been an amusement of the aristocracy ever since the thirteenth century Probably you have heard of the Japanese tea ceremonies and their curious Buddhist history and I suppose that every foreign collector of Japanese bric a brac knows something about the luxury to which these ceremonies at one period attained a luxury well attested by the quality of the beautiful utensils formerly employed in them But there were and still are incense ceremonies much more elaborate and costly than the tea ceremonies and also much more interesting Besides music embroidery poetical composition and other branches of the old fashioned female education the young lady of pre Meiji days was expected to acquire three especially polite accomplishments the art of arranging flowers ikebana the art of ceremonial tea making cha no yu or cha no e one and the etiquette of incense parties ko kwai or ko e Incense parties were invented before the time of the Ashikaga shoguns and were most in vogue during the peaceful period of the Tokugawa rule With the fall of the shogunate they went out of fashion but recently they have been to some extent revived It is not likely however that they will again become really fashionable in the old sense partly because they represented rare forms of social refinement that never can be revived and partly because of their costliness In translating ko kwai as incense party I use the word party in the meaning that it takes in such compounds as card party whist party chess party for a ko kwai is a meeting held only with the object of playing a game a very curious game There are several kinds of incense games but in all of them the contest depends upon the ability to remember and to name different kinds of incense by the perfume alone That variety of ko kwai called Jitchu ko ten burning incense is generally conceded to be the most amusing and I shall try to tell you how it is played The numeral ten in the Japanese or rather Chinese name of this diversion does not refer to ten kinds but only to ten packages of incense for Jitchu ko besides being the most amusing is the very simplest of incense games and is played with only four kinds of incense One kind must be supplied by the guests invited to the party and three are furnished by the person who gives the entertainment Each of the latter three supplies of incense usually prepared in packages containing one hundred wafers is divided into four parts and each part is put into a separate paper numbered or marked so as to indicate the quality Thus four packages are prepared of the incense classed as No one four of incense No two and four of incense No three or twelve in all But the incense given by the guests always called guest incense is not divided it is only put into a wrapper marked with an abbreviation of the Chinese character signifying guest Accordingly we have a total of thirteen packages to start with but three are to be used in the preliminary sampling or experimenting as the Japanese term it after the following manner 
5727_47030_000023_000000	train-clean-360	We shall suppose the game to be arranged for a party of six though there is no rule limiting the number of players 
none	none	The six take their places in line or in a half circle if the room be small but they do not sit close together for reasons which will presently appear Then the host or the person appointed to act as incense burner prepares a package of the incense classed as No one kindles it in a censer and passes the censer to the guest occupying the first seat two with the announcement This is incense No one The guest receives the censer according to the graceful etiquette required in the ko kwai inhales the perfume and passes on the vessel to his neighbor who receives it in like manner and passes it to the third guest who presents it to the fourth and so on When the censer has gone the round of the party it is returned to the incense burner One package of incense No two and one of No three are similarly prepared announced and tested 
5727_47030_000023_000006	train-clean-360	But with the guest incense no experiment is made 
none	none	The player should be able to remember the different odors of the incenses tested and he is expected to identify the guest incense at the proper time merely by the unfamiliar quality of its fragrance The original thirteen packages having thus by experimenting been reduced to ten each player is given one set of ten small tablets usually of gold lacquer every set being differently ornamented The backs only of these tablets are decorated and the decoration is nearly always a floral design of some sort thus one set might be decorated with chrysanthemums in gold another with tufts of iris plants another with a spray of plum blossoms et cetera 
5727_47030_000024_000002	train-clean-360	But the faces of the tablets bear numbers or marks and each set comprises three tablets numbered one three numbered two three numbered three and one marked with the character signifying guest After these tablet sets have been distributed a box called the tablet box is placed before the first player and all is ready for the real game 
none	none	The incense burner retires behind a little screen shuffles the flat packages like so many cards takes the uppermost prepares its contents in the censer and then returning to the party sends the censer upon its round This time of course he does not announce what kind of incense he has used As the censer passes from hand to hand each player after inhaling the fume puts into the tablet box one tablet bearing that mark or number which he supposes to be the mark or number of the incense he has smelled If for example he thinks the incense to be guest incense he drops into the box that one of his tablets marked with the ideograph meaning guest or if he believes that he has inhaled the perfume of No two he puts into the box a tablet numbered two When the round is over tablet box and censer are both returned to the incense burner 
5727_47030_000025_000004	train-clean-360	He takes the six tablets out of the box and wraps them up in the paper which contained the incense guessed about 
none	none	The tablets themselves keep the personal as well as the general record since each player remembers the particular design upon his own set The remaining nine packages of incense art consumed and judged in the same way according to the chance order in which the shuffling has placed them When all the incense has been used the tablets are taken out of their wrappings the record is officially put into writing and the victor of the day is announced I here offer the translation of such a record it will serve to explain almost at a glance all the complications of the game According to this record the player who used the tablets decorated with the design called Young Pine made but two mistakes while the holder of the White Lily set made only one correct guess 
5727_47030_000027_000001	train-clean-360	But it is quite a feat to make ten correct judgments in succession 
5727_47030_000027_000002	train-clean-360	The olfactory nerves are apt to become somewhat numbed long before the game is concluded and therefore it is customary during the Ko kwai to rinse the mouth at intervals with pure vinegar by which operation the sensitivity is partially restored

5727_47030_000047_000005	train-clean-360	Finally I may observe that while judging the incense a player is expected to take not less than three inhalations or more than five 
5727_47030_000048_000000	train-clean-360	In this economical era the Ko kwai takes of necessity a much humbler form than it assumed in the time of the great daimyo of the princely abbots and of the military aristocracy

They are the ghosts of men who anciently for the sake of gain made or sold bad incense and by the evil karma of that action they now find themselves in the state of hunger suffering spirits and compelled to seek their only food in the smoke of incense one Among the curious Tokyo inventions of eighteen ninety eight was a new variety of cigarettes called Hangon so or Herb of Hangon a name suggesting that their smoke operated like the spirit summoning incense As a matter of fact the chemical action of the tobacco smoke would define upon a paper fitted into the mouth piece of each cigarette the photographic image of a dancing girl A Story of Divination I once knew a fortune teller who really believed in the science that he professed He had learned as a student of the old Chinese philosophy to believe in divination long before he thought of practising it During his youth he had been in the service of a wealthy daimyo but subsequently like thousands of other samurai found himself reduced to desperate straits by the social and political changes of Meiji It was then that he became a fortune teller an itinerant uranaiya travelling on foot from town to town and returning to his home rarely more than once a year with the proceeds of his journey As a fortune teller he was tolerably successful chiefly I think because of his perfect sincerity and because of a peculiar gentle manner that invited confidence His system was the old scholarly one he used the book known to English readers as the Yi King also a set of ebony blocks which could be so arranged as to form any of the Chinese hexagrams and he always began his divination with an earnest prayer to the gods The system itself he held to be infallible in the hands of a master He confessed that he had made some erroneous predictions but he said that these mistakes had been entirely due to his own miscomprehension of certain texts or diagrams To do him justice I must mention that in my own case he told my fortune four times his predictions were fulfilled in such wise that I became afraid of them You may disbelieve in fortune telling intellectually scorn it but something of inherited superstitious tendency lurks within most of us and a few strange experiences can so appeal to that inheritance as to induce the most unreasoning hope or fear of the good or bad luck promised you by some diviner Really to see our future would be a misery Imagine the result of knowing that there must happen to you within the next two months some terrible misfortune which you cannot possibly provide against He was already an old man when I first saw him in Izumo certainly more than sixty years of age but looking very much younger Afterwards I met him in Osaka in Kyoto and in Kobe More than once I tried to persuade him to pass the colder months of the winter season under my roof for he possessed an extraordinary knowledge of traditions and could have been of inestimable service to me in a literary way But partly because the habit of wandering had become with him a second nature and partly because of a love of independence as savage as a gipsy s I was never able to keep him with me for more than two days at a time Every year he used to come to Tokyo usually in the latter part of autumn Then for several weeks he would flit about the city from district to district and vanish again But during these fugitive trips he never failed to visit me bringing welcome news of Izumo people and places bringing also some queer little present generally of a religious kind from some famous place of pilgrimage On these occasions I could get a few hours chat with him Sometimes the talk was of strange things seen or heard during his recent journey sometimes it turned upon old legends or beliefs sometimes it was about fortune telling The last time we met he told me of an exact Chinese science of divination which he regretted never having been able to learn Any one learned in that science he said would be able for example not only to tell you the exact time at which any post or beam of this house will yield to decay but even to tell you the direction of the breaking and all its results I can best explain what I mean by relating a story The story is about the famous Chinese fortune teller whom we call in Japan Shoko Setsu and it is written in the book Baikwa Shin Eki which is a book of divination While still a very young man Shoko Setsu obtained a high position by reason of his learning and virtue but he resigned it and went into solitude that he might give his whole time to study For years thereafter he lived alone in a hut among the mountains studying without a fire in winter and without a fan in summer writing his thoughts upon the wall of his room for lack of paper and using only a tile for his pillow One day in the period of greatest summer heat he found himself overcome by drowsiness and he lay down to rest with his tile under his head Scarcely had he fallen asleep when a rat ran across his face and woke him with a start Feeling angry he seized his tile and flung it at the rat but the rat escaped unhurt and the tile was broken Shoko Setsu looked sorrowfully at the fragments of his pillow and reproached himself for his hastiness Then suddenly he perceived upon the freshly exposed clay of the broken tile some Chinese characters between the upper and lower surfaces Thinking this very strange he picked up the pieces and carefully examined them He found that along the line of fracture seventeen characters had been written within the clay before the tile had been baked and the characters read thus In the Year of the Hare in the fourth month on the seventeenth day at the Hour of the Serpent this tile after serving as a pillow will be thrown at a rat and broken Now the prediction had really been fulfilled at the Hour of the Serpent on the seventeenth day of the fourth month of the Year of the Hare Greatly astonished Shoko Setsu once again looked at the fragments and discovered the seal and the name of the maker At once he left his hut and taking with him the pieces of the tile hurried to the neighboring town in search of the tilemaker He found the tilemaker in the course of the day showed him the broken tile and asked him about its history After having carefully examined the shards the tilemaker said This tile was made in my house but the characters in the clay were written by an old man a fortune teller who asked permission to write upon the tile before it was baked Do you know where he lives asked Shoko Setsu He used to live the tilemaker answered not very far from here and I can show you the way to the house But I do not know his name Having been guided to the house Shoko Setsu presented himself at the entrance and asked for permission to speak to the old man A serving student courteously invited him to enter and ushered him into an apartment where several young men were at study As Shoko Setsu took his seat all the youths saluted him Then the one who had first addressed him bowed and said We are grieved to inform you that our master died a few days ago But we have been waiting for you because he predicted that you would come to day to this house at this very hour Your name is Shoko Setsu And our master told us to give you a book which he believed would be of service to you Here is the book please to accept it Shoko Setsu was not less delighted than surprised for the book was a manuscript of the rarest and most precious kind containing all the secrets of the science of divination After having thanked the young men and properly expressed his regret for the death of their teacher he went back to his hut and there immediately proceeded to test the worth of the book by consulting its pages in regard to his own fortune The book suggested to him that on the south side of his dwelling at a particular spot near one corner of the hut great luck awaited him He dug at the place indicated and found a jar containing gold enough to make him a very wealthy man My old acquaintance left this world as lonesomely as he had lived in it Last winter while crossing a mountain range he was overtaken by a snowstorm and lost his way Many days later he was found standing erect at the foot of a pine with his little pack strapped to his shoulders a statue of ice arms folded and eyes closed as in meditation Probably while waiting for the storm to pass he had yielded to the drowsiness of cold and the drift had risen over him as he slept Hearing of this strange death I remembered the old Japanese saying Uranaiya minouye shiradzu The fortune teller knows not his own fate Silkworms I was puzzled by the phrase silkworm moth eyebrow in an old Japanese or rather Chinese proverb The silkworm moth eyebrow of a woman is the axe that cuts down the wisdom of man So I went to my friend Niimi who keeps silkworms to ask for an explanation
5727_47032_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it possible he exclaimed that you never saw a silkworm moth 
5727_47032_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The silkworm moth has very beautiful eyebrows 
none	none	Eyebrows I queried in astonishment
5727_47032_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 Well call them what you like returned Niimi the poets call them eyebrows 
none	none	Wait a moment and I will show you 
5727_47032_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He left the guest room and presently returned with a white paper fan on which a silkworm moth was sleepily reposing 
none	none	We always reserve a few for breeding he said this one is just out of the cocoon 
5727_47032_000007_000001	train-clean-360	It cannot fly of course none of them can fly 
5727_47032_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Now look at the eyebrows 
none	none	I looked and saw that the antennae very short and feathery were so arched back over the two jewel specks of eyes in the velvety head as to give the appearance of a really handsome pair of eye brows 
5727_47032_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Then Niimi took me to see his worms 
none	none	In Niimi s neighborhood where there are plenty of mulberrytrees many families keep silkworms the tending and feeding being mostly done by women and children The worms are kept in large oblong trays elevated upon light wooden stands about three feet high It is curious to see hundreds of caterpillars feeding all together in one tray and to hear the soft papery noise which they make while gnawing their mulberry leaves 
5727_47032_000010_000003	train-clean-360	As they approach maturity the creatures need almost constant attention 
none	none	At brief intervals some expert visits each tray to inspect progress picks up the plumpest feeders and decides by gently rolling them between forefinger and thumb which are ready to spin These are dropped into covered boxes where they soon swathe themselves out of sight in white floss A few only of the best are suffered to emerge from their silky sleep the selected breeders They have beautiful wings but cannot use them 
5727_47032_000010_000008	train-clean-360	They have mouths but do not eat 
5727_47032_000010_000009	train-clean-360	They only pair lay eggs and die 
none	none	For thousands of years their race has been so well cared for that it can no longer take any care of itself It was the evolutional lesson of this latter fact that chiefly occupied me while Niimi and his younger brother who feeds the worms were kindly explaining the methods of the industry They told me curious things about different breeds and also about a wild variety of silkworm that cannot be domesticated it spins splendid silk before turning into a vigorous moth which can use its wings to some purpose But I fear that I did not act like a person who felt interested in the subject for even while I tried to listen I began to muse II First of all I found myself thinking about a delightful revery by M Anatole France in which he says that if he had been the Demiurge he would have put youth at the end of life instead of at the beginning and would have otherwise so ordered matters that every human being should have three stages of development somewhat corresponding to those of the lepidoptera Then it occurred to me that this fantasy was in substance scarcely more than the delicate modification of a most ancient doctrine common to nearly all the higher forms of religion Western faiths especially teach that our life on earth is a larval state of greedy helplessness and that death is a pupa sleep out of which we should soar into everlasting light They tell us that during its sentient existence the outer body should be thought of only as a kind of caterpillar and thereafter as a chrysalis and they aver that we lose or gain according to our behavior as larvae the power to develop wings under the mortal wrapping Also they tell us not to trouble ourselves about the fact that we see no Psyche imago detach itself from the broken cocoon this lack of visual evidence signifies nothing because we have only the purblind vision of grubs Our eyes are but half evolved Do not whole scales of colors invisibly exist above and below the limits of our retinal sensibility Even so the butterfly man exists although as a matter of course we cannot see him But what would become of this human imago in a state of perfect bliss From the evolutional point of view the question has interest and its obvious answer was suggested to me by the history of those silkworms which have been domesticated for only a few thousand years Consider the result of our celestial domestication for let us say several millions of years I mean the final consequence to the wishers of being able to gratify every wish at will 
5727_47032_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Those silkworms have all that they wish for even considerably more 
none	none	Their wants though very simple are fundamentally identical with the necessities of mankind food shelter warmth safety and comfort Our endless social struggle is mainly for these things Our dream of heaven is the dream of obtaining them free of cost in pain and the condition of those silkworms is the realization in a small way of our imagined Paradise I am not considering the fact that a vast majority of the worms are predestined to torment and the second death for my theme is of heaven not of lost souls I am speaking of the elect those worms preordained to salvation and rebirth Probably they can feel only very weak sensations they are certainly incapable of prayer But if they were able to pray they could not ask for anything more than they already receive from the youth who feeds and tends them He is their providence a god of whose existence they can be aware in only the vaguest possible way but just such a god as they require And we should foolishly deem ourselves fortunate to be equally well cared for in proportion to our more complex wants Do not our common forms of prayer prove our desire for like attention Is not the assertion of our need of divine love an involuntary confession that we wish to be treated like silkworms to live without pain by the help of gods Yet if the gods were to treat us as we want we should presently afford fresh evidence in the way of what is called the evidence from degeneration that the great evolutional law is far above the gods An early stage of that degeneration would be represented by total incapacity to help ourselves then we should begin to lose the use of our higher sense organs later on the brain would shrink to a vanishing pin point of matter still later we should dwindle into mere amorphous sacs mere blind stomachs Such would be the physical consequence of that kind of divine love which we so lazily wish for The longing for perpetual bliss in perpetual peace might well seem a malevolent inspiration from the Lords of Death and Darkness All life that feels and thinks has been and can continue to be only as the product of struggle and pain only as the outcome of endless battle with the Powers of the Universe And cosmic law is uncompromising Whatever organ ceases to know pain whatever faculty ceases to be used under the stimulus of pain must also cease to exist 
5727_47032_000017_000006	train-clean-360	Let pain and its effort be suspended and life must shrink back first into protoplasmic shapelessness thereafter into dust 
none	none	Buddhism which in its own grand way is a doctrine of evolution rationally proclaims its heaven but a higher stage of development through pain and teaches that even in paradise the cessation of effort produces degradation With equal reasonableness it declares that the capacity for pain in the superhuman world increases always in proportion to the capacity for pleasure There is little fault to be found with this teaching from a scientific standpoint since we know that higher evolution must involve an increase of sensitivity to pain In the Heavens of Desire says the Shobo nen jo kyo the pain of death is so great that all the agonies of all the hells united could equal but one sixteenth part of such pain one The foregoing comparison is unnecessarily strong but the Buddhist teaching about heaven is in substance eminently logical The suppression of pain mental or physical in any conceivable state of sentient existence would necessarily involve the suppression also of pleasure and certainly all progress whether moral or material depends upon the power to meet and to master pain 
5727_47032_000019_000001	train-clean-360	In a silkworm paradise such as our mundane instincts lead us to desire the seraph freed from the necessity of toil and able to satisfy his every want at will would lose his wings at last and sink back to the condition of a grub 
none	none	one This statement refers only to the Heavens of Sensuous Pleasure not to the Paradise of Amida nor to those heavens into which one enters by the Apparitional Birth But even in the highest and most immaterial zones of being in the Heavens of Formlessness the cessation of effort and of the pain of effort involves the penalty of rebirth in a lower state of existence III I told the substance of my revery to Niimi He used to be a great reader of Buddhist books Well he said I was reminded of a queer Buddhist story by the proverb that you asked me to explain The silkworm moth eyebrow of a woman is the axe that cuts down the wisdom of man According to our doctrine the saying would be as true of life in heaven as of life upon earth This is the story When Shaka one dwelt in this world one of his disciples called Nanda was bewitched by the beauty of a woman and Shaka desired to save him from the results of this illusion So he took Nanda to a wild place in the mountains where there were apes and showed him a very ugly female ape and asked him Which is the more beautiful Nanda the woman that you love or this female ape Oh Master exclaimed Nanda how can a lovely woman be compared with an ugly ape Perhaps you will presently find reason to make the comparison yourself answered the Buddha and instantly by supernatural power he ascended with Nanda to the San Jusan Ten which is the Second of the Six Heavens of Desire There within a palace of jewels Nanda saw a multitude of heavenly maidens celebrating some festival with music and dance and the beauty of the least among them incomparably exceeded that of the fairest woman of earth O Master cried Nanda what wonderful festival is this Ask some of those people responded Shaka So Nanda questioned one of the celestial maidens and she said to him This festival is to celebrate the good tidings that have been brought to us There is now in the human world among the disciples of Shaka a most excellent youth called Nanda who is soon to be reborn into this heaven and to become our bridegroom because of his holy life We wait for him with rejoicing This reply filled the heart of Nanda with delight Then the Buddha asked him Is there any one among these maidens Nanda equal in beauty to the woman with whom you have been in love Nay Master answered Nanda even as that woman surpassed in beauty the female ape that we saw on the mountain so is she herself surpassed by even the least among these Then the Buddha immediately descended with Nanda to the depths of the hells and took him into a torture chamber where myriads of men and women were being boiled alive in great caldrons and otherwise horribly tormented by devils Then Nanda found himself standing before a huge vessel which was filled with molten metal and he feared and wondered because this vessel had as yet no occupant An idle devil sat beside it yawning Master Nanda inquired of the Buddha for whom has this vessel been prepared Ask the devil answered Shaka Nanda did so and the devil said to him There is a man called Nanda now one of Shaka s disciples about to be reborn into one of the heavens on account of his former good actions But after having there indulged himself he is to be reborn in this hell and his place will be in that pot I am waiting for him two one Sakyamuni two I give the story substantially as it was told to me but I have not been able to compare it with any published text My friend says that he has seen two Chinese versions one in the Hongyo kyo the other in the Zoichi agon kyo Ekottaragamas In mister Henry Clarke Warren s Buddhism in Translations the most interesting and valuable single volume of its kind that I have ever seen there is a Pali version of the legend which differs considerably from the above This Nanda according to mister Warren s work was a prince and the younger half brother of Sakyamuni A Passional Karma One of the never failing attractions of the Tokyo stage is the performance by the famous Kikugoro and his company of the Botan Doro or Peony Lantern This weird play of which the scenes are laid in the middle of the last century is the dramatization of a romance by the novelist Encho written in colloquial Japanese and purely Japanese in local color though inspired by a Chinese tale I went to see the play and Kikugoro made me familiar with a new variety of the pleasure of fear Why not give English readers the ghostly part of the story asked a friend who guides me betimes through the mazes of Eastern philosophy It would serve to explain some popular ideas of the supernatural which Western people know very little about And I could help you with the translation I gladly accepted the suggestion and we composed the following summary of the more extraordinary portion of Encho s romance Here and there we found it necessary to condense the original narrative and we tried to keep close to the text only in the conversational passages some of which happen to possess a particular quality of psychological interest This is the story of the Ghosts in the Romance of the Peony Lantern I There once lived in the district of Ushigome in Yedo a hatamoto one called Iijima Heizayemon whose only daughter Tsuyu was beautiful as her name which signifies Morning Dew Iijima took a second wife when his daughter was about sixteen and finding that O Tsuyu could not be happy with her mother in law he had a pretty villa built for the girl at Yanagijima as a separate residence and gave her an excellent maidservant called O Yone to wait upon her O Tsuyu lived happily enough in her new home until one day when the family physician Yamamoto Shijo paid her a visit in company with a young samurai named Hagiwara Shinzaburo who resided in the Nedzu quarter Shinzaburo was an unusually handsome lad and very gentle and the two young people fell in love with each other at sight Even before the brief visit was over they contrived unheard by the old doctor to pledge themselves to each other for life And at parting O Tsuyu whispered to the youth Remember If you do not come to see me again I shall certainly die Shinzaburo never forgot those words and he was only too eager to see more of O Tsuyu But etiquette forbade him to make the visit alone he was obliged to wait for some other chance to accompany the doctor who had promised to take him to the villa a second time Unfortunately the old man did not keep this promise He had perceived the sudden affection of O Tsuyu and he feared that her father would hold him responsible for any serious results Iijima Heizayemon had a reputation for cutting off heads And the more Shijo thought about the possible consequences of his introduction of Shinzaburo at the Iijima villa the more he became afraid Therefore he purposely abstained from calling upon his young friend Months passed and O Tsuyu little imagining the true cause of Shinzaburo s neglect believed that her love had been scorned Then she pined away and died Soon afterwards the faithful servant O Yone also died through grief at the loss of her mistress and the two were buried side by side in the cemetery of Shin Banzui In a temple which still stands in the neighborhood of Dango Zaka where the famous chrysanthemum shows are yearly held one The hatamoto were samurai forming the special military force of the Shogun The name literally signifies Banner Supporters These were the highest class of samurai not only as the immediate vassals of the Shogun but as a military aristocracy II Shinzaburo knew nothing of what had happened but his disappointment and his anxiety had resulted in a prolonged illness He was slowly recovering but still very weak when he unexpectedly received another visit from Yamamoto Shijo The old man made a number of plausible excuses for his apparent neglect Shinzaburo said to him I have been sick ever since the beginning of spring even now I cannot eat anything Was it not rather unkind of you never to call I thought that we were to make another visit together to the house of the Lady Iijima and I wanted to take to her some little present as a return for our kind reception Of course I could not go by myself Shijo gravely responded I am very sorry to tell you that the young lady is dead Dead repeated Shinzaburo turning white did you say that she is dead The doctor remained silent for a moment as if collecting himself then he resumed in the quick light tone of a man resolved not to take trouble seriously My great mistake was in having introduced you to her for it seems that she fell in love with you at once I am afraid that you must have said something to encourage this affection when you were in that little room together At all events I saw how she felt towards you and then I became uneasy fearing that her father might come to hear of the matter and lay the whole blame upon me So to be quite frank with you I decided that it would be better not to call upon you and I purposely stayed away for a long time But only a few days ago happening to visit Iijima s house I heard to my great surprise that his daughter had died and that her servant O Yone had also died Then remembering all that had taken place I knew that the young lady must have died of love for you Laughing Ah you are really a sinful fellow Yes you are Laughing Isn t it a sin to have been born so handsome that the girls die for love of you one Seriously Well we must leave the dead to the dead It is no use to talk further about the matter all that you now can do for her is to repeat the Nembutsu two Good bye And the old man retired hastily anxious to avoid further converse about the painful event for which he felt himself to have been unwittingly responsible one Perhaps this conversation may seem strange to the Western reader but it is true to life The whole of the scene is characteristically Japanese two The invocation Namu Amida Butsu Hail to the Buddha Amitabha repeated as a prayer for the sake of the dead III Shinzaburo long remained stupefied with grief by the news of O Tsuyu s death But as soon as he found himself again able to think clearly he inscribed the dead girl s name upon a mortuary tablet and placed the tablet in the Buddhist shrine of his house and set offerings before it and recited prayers Every day thereafter he presented offerings and repeated the Nembutsu and the memory of O Tsuyu was never absent from his thought Nothing occurred to change the monotony of his solitude before the time of the Bon the great Festival of the Dead which begins upon the thirteenth day of the seventh month Then he decorated his house and prepared everything for the festival hanging out the lanterns that guide the returning spirits and setting the food of ghosts on the shoryodana or Shelf of Souls And on the first evening of the Ban after sun down he kindled a small lamp before the tablet of O Tsuyu and lighted the lanterns The night was clear with a great moon and windless and very warm Shinzaburo sought the coolness of his veranda Clad only in a light summer robe he sat there thinking dreaming sorrowing sometimes fanning himself sometimes making a little smoke to drive the mosquitoes away Everything was quiet It was a lonesome neighborhood and there were few passers by He could hear only the soft rushing of a neighboring stream and the shrilling of night insects But all at once this stillness was broken by a sound of women s geta one approaching kara kon kara kon and the sound drew nearer and nearer quickly till it reached the live hedge surrounding the garden Then Shinzaburoe feeling curious stood on tiptoe so as to look Over the hedge and he saw two women passing One who was carrying a beautiful lantern decorated with peony flowers two appeared to be a servant the other was a slender girl of about seventeen wearing a long sleeved robe embroidered with designs of autumn blossoms Almost at the same instant both women turned their faces toward Shinzaburo and to his utter astonishment he recognized O Tsuyu and her servant O Yone They stopped immediately and the girl cried out Oh how strange Hagiwara Sama Shinzaburo simultaneously called to the maid O Yone Ah you are O Yone I remember you very well Hagiwara Sama exclaimed O Yone in a tone of supreme amazement Never could I have believed it possible Sir we were told that you had died How extraordinary cried Shinzaburo Why I was told that both of you were dead Ah what a hateful story returned O Yone Why repeat such unlucky words Who told you Please to come in said Shinzaburo here we can talk better The garden gate is open So they entered and exchanged greeting and when Shinzaburo had made them comfortable he said I trust that you will pardon my discourtesy in not having called upon you for so long a time But Shijo the doctor about a month ago told me that you had both died So it was he who told you exclaimed O Yone It was very wicked of him to say such a thing Well it was also Shijo who told us that you were dead I think that he wanted to deceive you which was not a difficult thing to do because you are so confiding and trustful Possibly my mistress betrayed her liking for you in some words which found their way to her father s ears and in that case O Kuni the new wife might have planned to make the doctor tell you that we were dead so as to bring about a separation Anyhow when my mistress heard that you had died she wanted to cut off her hair immediately and to become a nun But I was able to prevent her from cutting off her hair and I persuaded her at last to become a nun only in her heart Afterwards her father wished her to marry a certain young man and she refused Then there was a great deal of trouble chiefly caused by O Kuni and we went away from the villa and found a very small house in Yanaka no Sasaki There we are now just barely able to live by doing a little private work My mistress has been constantly repeating the Nembutsu for your sake To day being the first day of the Bon we went to visit the temples and we were on our way home thus late when this strange meeting happened Oh how extraordinary cried Shinzaburo Can it be true or is it only a dream Here I too have been constantly reciting the Nembutsu before a tablet with her name upon it Look And he showed them O Tsuyu s tablet in its place upon the Shelf of Souls We are more than grateful for your kind remembrance returned O Yone smiling Now as for my mistress she continued turning towards O Tsuyu who had all the while remained demure and silent half hiding her face with her sleeve as for my mistress she actually says that she would not mind being disowned by her father for the time of seven existences three or even being killed by him for your sake Come will you not allow her to stay here to night Shinzaburo turned pale for joy He answered in a voice trembling with emotion Please remain but do not speak loud because there is a troublesome fellow living close by a ninsomi four called Hakuodo Yusai who tells peoples fortunes by looking at their faces He is inclined to be curious and it is better that he should not know The two women remained that night in the house of the young samurai and returned to their own home a little before daybreak And after that night they came every nighht for seven nights whether the weather were foul or fair always at the same hour And Shinzaburo became more and more attached to the girl and the twain were fettered each to each by that bond of illusion which is stronger than bands of iron one Komageta in the original The geta is a wooden sandal or clog of which there are many varieties some decidedly elegant The komageta or pony geta is so called because of the sonorous hoof like echo which it makes on hard ground two The sort of lantern here referred to is no longer made and its shape can best be understood by a glance at the picture accompanying this story It was totally unlike the modern domestic band lantern painted with the owner s crest but it was not altogether unlike some forms of lanterns still manufactured for the Festival of the Dead and called Bon doro The flowers ornamenting it were not painted they were artificial flowers of crepe silk and were attached to the top of the lantern three For the time of seven existences that is to say for the time of seven successive lives In Japanese drama and romance it is not uncommon to represent a father as disowning his child for the time of seven lives Such a disowning is called shichi sho made no mando a disinheritance for seven lives signifying that in six future lives after the present the erring son or daughter will continue to feel the parental displeasure four The profession is not yet extinct The ninsomi uses a kind of magnifying glass or magnifying mirror sometimes called tengankyo or ninsomegane IV Now there was a man called Tomozo who lived in a small cottage adjoining Shinzaburo s residence Tomozo and his wife O Mine were both employed by Shinzaburo as servants Both seemed to be devoted to their young master and by his help they were able to live in comparative comfort One night at a very late hour Tomozo heard the voice of a woman in his master s apartment and this made him uneasy He feared that Shinzaburo being very gentle and affectionate might be made the dupe of some cunning wanton in which event the domestics would be the first to suffer He therefore resolved to watch and on the following night he stole on tiptoe to Shinzaburo s dwelling and looked through a chink in one of the sliding shutters By the glow of a night lantern within the sleeping room he was able to perceive that his master and a strange woman were talking together under the mosquito net At first he could not see the woman distinctly Her back was turned to him he only observed that she was very slim and that she appeared to be very young judging from the fashion of her dress and hair one Putting his ear to the chink he could hear the conversation plainly The woman said And if I should be disowned by my father would you then let me come and live with you Shinzaburo answered Most assuredly I would nay I should be glad of the chance But there is no reason to fear that you will ever be disowned by your father for you are his only daughter and he loves you very much What I do fear is that some day we shall be cruelly separated She responded softly Never never could I even think of accepting any other man for my husband Even if our secret were to become known and my father were to kill me for what I have done still after death itself I could never cease to think of you And I am now quite sure that you yourself would not be able to live very long without me Then clinging closely to him with her lips at his neck she caressed him and he returned her caresses Tomozo wondered as he listened because the language of the woman was not the language of a common woman but the language of a lady of rank two Then he determined at all hazards to get one glimpse of her face and he crept round the house backwards and forwards peering through every crack and chink And at last he was able to see but therewith an icy trembling seized him and the hair of his head stood up For the face was the face of a woman long dead and the fingers caressing were fingers of naked bone and of the body below the waist there was not anything it melted off into thinnest trailing shadow Where the eyes of the lover deluded saw youth and grace and beauty there appeared to the eyes of the watcher horror only and the emptiness of death Simultaneously another woman s figure and a weirder rose up from within the chamber and swiftly made toward the watcher as if discerning his presence Then in uttermost terror he fled to the dwelling of Hakuodo Yusai and knocking frantically at the doors succeeded in arousing him one The color and form of the dress and the style of wearing the hair are by Japanese custom regulated accord big to the age of the woman two The forms of speech used by the samurai and other superior classes differed considerably from those of the popular idiom but these differences could not be effectively rendered into English V Hakuodo Yusai the ninsomi was a very old man but in his time he had travelled much and he had heard and seen so many things that he could not be easily surprised Yet the story of the terrified Tomozo both alarmed and amazed him He had read in ancient Chinese books of love between the living and the dead but he had never believed it possible Now however he felt convinced that the statement of Tomozo was not a falsehood and that something very strange was really going on in the house of Hagiwara Should the truth prove to be what Tomozo imagined then the young samurai was a doomed man If the woman be a ghost said Yusai to the frightened servant if the woman be a ghost your master must die very soon unless something extraordinary can be done to save him And if the woman be a ghost the signs of death will appear upon his face For the spirit of the living is yoki and pure the spirit of the dead is inki and unclean the one is Positive the other Negative He whose bride is a ghost cannot live Even though in his blood there existed the force of a life of one hundred years that force must quickly perish Still I shall do all that I can to save Hagiwara Sama And in the meantime Tomozo say nothing to any other person not even to your wife about this matter At sunrise I shall call upon your master When questioned next morning by Yusai Shinzaburo at first attempted to deny that any women had been visiting the house but finding this artless policy of no avail and perceiving that the old man s purpose was altogether unselfish he was finally persuaded to acknowledge what had really occurred and to give his reasons for wishing to keep the matter a secret As for the lady Iijima he intended he said to make her his wife as soon as possible Oh madness cried Yusai losing all patience in the intensity of his alarm Know sir that the people who have been coming here night after night are dead Some frightful delusion is upon you Why the simple fact that you long supposed O Tsuyu to be dead and repeated the Nembutsu for her and made offerings before her tablet is itself the proof The lips of the dead have touched you the hands of the dead have caressed you Even at this moment I see in your face the signs of death and you will not believe Listen to me now sir I beg of you if you wish to save yourself otherwise you have less than twenty days to live They told you those people that they were residing in the district of Shitaya in Yanaka no Sasaki Did you ever visit them at that place No of course you did not Then go to day as soon as you can to Yanaka no Sasaki and try to find their home And having uttered this counsel with the most vehement earnestness Hakuodo Yusai abruptly took his departure Shinzaburo startled though not convinced resolved after a moment s reflection to follow the advice of the ninsomi and to go to Shitaya It was yet early in the morning when he reached the quarter of Yanaka no Sasaki and began his search for the dwelling of O Tsuyu He went through every street and side street read all the names inscribed at the various entrances and made inquiries whenever an opportunity presented itself But he could not find anything resembling the little house mentioned by O Yone and none of the people whom he questioned knew of any house in the quarter inhabited by two single women Feeling at last certain that further research would be useless he turned homeward by the shortest way which happened to lead through the grounds of the temple Shin Banzui In Suddenly his attention was attracted by two new tombs placed side by side at the rear of the temple One was a common tomb such as might have been erected for a person of humble rank the other was a large and handsome monument and hanging before it was a beautiful peony lantern which had probably been left there at the time of the Festival of the Dead Shinzaburo remembered that the peony lantern carried by O Yone was exactly similar and the coincidence impressed him as strange He looked again at the tombs but the tombs explained nothing Neither bore any personal name only the Buddhist kaimyo or posthumous appellation Then he determined to seek information at the temple An acolyte stated in reply to his questions that the large tomb had been recently erected for the daughter of Iijima Heizayemon the hatamoto of Ushigome and that the small tomb next to it was that of her servant O Yone who had died of grief soon after the young lady s funeral Immediately to Shinzaburoe s memory there recurred with another and sinister meaning the words of O Yone We went away and found a very small house in Yanaka no Sasaki There we are now just barely able to live by doing a little private work Here was indeed the very small house and in Yanaka no Sasaki But the little private work Terror stricken the samurai hastened with all speed to the house of Yusai and begged for his counsel and assistance But Yusai declared himself unable to be of any aid in such a case All that he could do was to send Shinzaburo to the high priest Ryoseki of Shin Banzui In with a letter praying for immediate religious help VII The high priest Ryoseki was a learned and a holy man By spiritual vision he was able to know the secret of any sorrow and the nature of the karma that had caused it He heard unmoved the story of Shinzaburo and said to him A very great danger now threatens you because of an error committed in one of your former states of existence The karma that binds you to the dead is very strong but if I tried to explain its character you would not be able to understand I shall therefore tell you only this that the dead person has no desire to injure you out of hate feels no enmity towards you she is influenced on the contrary by the most passionate affection for you Probably the girl has been in love with you from a time long preceding your present life from a time of not less than three or four past existences and it would seem that although necessarily changing her form and condition at each succeeding birth she has not been able to cease from following after you Therefore it will not be an easy thing to escape from her influence But now I am going to lend you this powerful mamoni one It is a pure gold image of that Buddha called the Sea Sounding Tathagata Kai On Nyorai because his preaching of the Law sounds through the world like the sound of the sea And this little image is especially a shiryo yoke two which protects the living from the dead This you must wear in its covering next to your body under the girdle Besides I shall presently perform in the temple a segaki service three for the repose of the troubled spirit And here is a holy sutra called Ubo Darani Kyo or Treasure Raining Sutra four you must be careful to recite it every night in your house without fail Furthermore I shall give you this package of o fuda five you must paste one of them over every opening of your house no matter how small If you do this the power of the holy texts will prevent the dead from entering But whatever may happen do not fail to recite the sutra Shinzaburo humbly thanked the high priest and then taking with him the image the sutra and the bundle of sacred texts he made all haste to reach his home before the hour of sunset one The Japanese word mamori has significations at least as numerous as those attaching to our own term amulet It would be impossible in a mere footnote even to suggest the variety of Japanese religious objects to which the name is given In this instance the mamori is a very small image probably enclosed in a miniature shrine of lacquer work or metal over which a silk cover is drawn Such little images were often worn by samurai on the person I was recently shown a miniature figure of Kwannon in an iron case which had been carried by an officer through the Satsuma war He observed with good reason that it had probably saved his life for it had stopped a bullet of which the dent was plainly visible two From shiryo a ghost and yokeru to exclude The Japanese have two kinds of ghosts proper in their folk lore the spirits of the dead shiryo and the spirits of the living ikiryo A house or a person may be haunted by an ikiryo as well as by a shiryo three A special service accompanying offerings of food et cetera to those dead having no living relatives or friends to care for them is thus termed In this case however the service would be of a particular and exceptional kind four The name would be more correctly written Ubo Darani Kyo It is the Japanese pronunciation of the title of a very short sutra translated out of Sanscrit into Chinese by the Indian priest Amoghavajra probably during the eighth century The Chinese text contains transliterations of some mysterious Sanscrit words apparently talismanic words like those to be seen in Kern s translation of the Saddharma Pundarika ch xxvi five O fuda is the general name given to religious texts used as charms or talismans They are sometimes stamped or burned upon wood but more commonly written or printed upon narrow strips of paper O fuda are pasted above house entrances on the walls of rooms upon tablets placed in household shrines et cetera et cetera Some kinds are worn about the person others are made into pellets and swallowed as spiritual medicine The text of the larger o fuda is often accompanied by curious pictures or symbolic illustrations VIII With Yusai s advice and help Shinzaburo was able before dark to fix the holy texts over all the apertures of his dwelling Then the ninsomi returned to his own house leaving the youth alone Night came warm and clear Shinzaburo made fast the doors bound the precious amulet about his waist entered his mosquito net and by the glow of a night lantern began to recite the Ubo Darani Kyo For a long time he chanted the words comprehending little of their meaning then he tried to obtain some rest But his mind was still too much disturbed by the strange events of the day Midnight passed and no sleep came to him At last he heard the boom of the great temple bell of Dentsu In announcing the eighth hour one It ceased and Shinzaburo suddenly heard the sound of geta approaching from the old direction but this time more slowly karan koron karan koron At once a cold sweat broke over his forehead Opening the sutra hastily with trembling hand he began again to recite it aloud The steps came nearer and nearer reached the live hedge stopped Then strange to say Shinzaburo felt unable to remain under his mosquito net something stronger even than his fear impelled him to look and instead of continuing to recite the Ubo Darani Kyo he foolishly approached the shutters and through a chink peered out into the night Before the house he saw O Tsuyu standing and O Yone with the peony lantern and both of them were gazing at the Buddhist texts pasted above the entrance Never before not even in what time she lived had O Tsuyu appeared so beautiful and Shinzaburo felt his heart drawn towards her with a power almost resistless But the terror of death and the terror of the unknown restrained and there went on within him such a struggle between his love and his fear that he became as one suffering in the body the pains of the Sho netsu hell two Presently he heard the voice of the maid servant saying My dear mistress there is no way to enter The heart of Hagiwara Sama must have changed For the promise that he made last night has been broken and the doors have been made fast to keep us out We cannot go in to night It will be wiser for you to make up your mind not to think any more about him because his feeling towards you has certainly changed It is evident that he does not want to see you So it will be better not to give yourself any more trouble for the sake of a man whose heart is so unkind But the girl answered weeping Oh to think that this could happen after the pledges which we made to each other Often I was told that the heart of a man changes as quickly as the sky of autumn yet surely the heart of Hagiwara Sama cannot be so cruel that he should really intend to exclude me in this way Dear Yone please find some means of taking me to him Unless you do I will never never go home again Thus she continued to plead veiling her face with her long sleeves and very beautiful she looked and very touching but the fear of death was strong upon her lover O Yone at last made answer My dear young lady why will you trouble your mind about a man who seems to be so cruel Well let us see if there be no way to enter at the back of the house come with me And taking O Tsuyu by the hand she led her away toward the rear of the dwelling and there the two disappeared as suddenly as the light disappears when the flame of a lamp is blown out one According to the old Japanese way of counting time this yatsudoki or eighth hour was the same as our two o clock in the morning Each Japanese hour was equal to two European hours so that there were only six hours instead of our twelve and these six hours were counted backwards in the order nine eight seven six five four Thus the ninth hour corresponded to our midday or midnight half past nine to our one o clock eight to our two o clock Two o clock in the morning also called the Hour of the Ox was the Japanese hour of ghosts and goblins two En netsu or Sho netsu Sanscrit Tapana is the sixth of the Eight Hot Hells of Japanese Buddhism One day of life in this hell is equal in duration to thousands some say millions of human years IX Night after night the shadows came at the Hour of the Ox and nightly Shinzaburo heard the weeping of O Tsuyu Yet he believed himself saved little imagining that his doom had already been decided by the character of his dependents Tomozo had promised Yusai never to speak to any other person not even to O Mine of the strange events that were taking place But Tomozo was not long suffered by the haunters to rest in peace Night after night O Yone entered into his dwelling and roused him from his sleep and asked him to remove the o fuda placed over one very small window at the back of his master s house And Tomozo out of fear as often promised her to take away the o fuda before the next sundown but never by day could he make up his mind to remove it believing that evil was intended to Shinzaburo At last in a night of storm O Yone startled him from slumber with a cry of reproach and stooped above his pillow and said to him Have a care how you trifle with us If by to morrow night you do not take away that text you shall learn how I can hate And she made her face so frightful as she spoke that Tomozo nearly died of terror O Mine the wife of Tomozo had never till then known of these visits even to her husband they had seemed like bad dreams But on this particular night it chanced that waking suddenly she heard the voice of a woman talking to Tomozo Almost in the same moment the talk ing ceased and when O Mine looked about her she saw by the light of the night lamp only her husband shuddering and white with fear The stranger was gone the doors were fast it seemed impossible that anybody could have entered Nevertheless the jealousy of the wife had been aroused and she began to chide and to question Tomozo in such a manner that he thought himself obliged to betray the secret and to explain the terrible dilemma in which he had been placed Then the passion of O Mine yielded to wonder and alarm but she was a subtle woman and she devised immediately a plan to save her husband by the sacrifice of her master And she gave Tomozo a cunning counsel telling him to make conditions with the dead They came again on the following night at the Hour of the Ox and O Mine hid herself on hearing the sound of their coming karan koron karan koron But Tomozo went out to meet them in the dark and even found courage to say to them what his wife had told him to say It is true that I deserve your blame but I had no wish to cause you anger The reason that the o fuda has not been taken away is that my wife and I are able to live only by the help of Hagiwara Sama and that we cannot expose him to any danger without bringing misfortune upon ourselves But if we could obtain the sum of a hundred ryo in gold we should be able to please you because we should then need no help from anybody Therefore if you will give us a hundred ryo I can take the o fuda away without being afraid of losing our only means of support When he had uttered these words O Yone and O Tsuyu looked at each other in silence for a moment Then O Yone said Mistress I told you that it was not right to trouble this man as we have no just cause of ill will against him But it is certainly useless to fret yourself about Hagiwara Sama because his heart has changed towards you Now once again my dear young lady let me beg you not to think any more about him But O Tsuyu weeping made answer Dear Yone whatever may happen I cannot possibly keep myself from thinking about him You know that you can get a hundred ryo to have the o fuda taken off Only once more I pray dear Yone only once more bring me face to face with Hagiwara Sama I beseech you And hiding her face with her sleeve she thus continued to plead Oh why will you ask me to do these things responded O Yone You know very well that I have no money But since you will persist in this whim of yours in spite of all that I can say I suppose that I must try to find the money somehow and to bring it here to morrow night Then turning to the faithless Tomozo she said Tomozo I must tell you that Hagiwara Sama now wears upon his body a mamoni called by the name of Kai On Nyorai and that so long as he wears it we cannot approach him So you will have to get that mamori away from him by some means or other as well as to remove the o fuda Tomozo feebly made answer That also I can do if you will promise to bring me the hundred ryo Well mistress said O Yone you will wait will you not until to morrow night Oh dear Yone sobbed the other have we to go back to night again without seeing Hagiwara Sama Ah it is cruel And the shadow of the mistress weeping was led away by the shadow of the maid x Another day went and another night came and the dead came with it But this time no lamentation was heard without the house of Hagiwara for the faithless servant found his reward at the Hour of the Ox and removed the o fuda Moreover he had been able while his master was at the bath to steal from its case the golden mamori and to substitute for it an image of copper and he had buried the Kai On Nyorai in a desolate field So the visitants found nothing to oppose their entering Veiling their faces with their sleeves they rose and passed like a streaming of vapor into the little window from over which the holy text had been torn away But what happened thereafter within the house Tomozo never knew The sun was high before he ventured again to approach his master s dwelling and to knock upon the sliding doors For the first time in years he obtained no response and the silence made him afraid Repeatedly he called and received no answer Then aided by O Mine he succeeded in effecting an entrance and making his way alone to the sleeping room where he called again in vain He rolled back the rumbling shutters to admit the light but still within the house there was no stir At last he dared to lift a corner of the mosquito net But no sooner had he looked beneath than he fled from the house with a cry of horror Shinzaburo was dead hideously dead and his face was the face of a man who had died in the uttermost agony of fear and lying beside him in the bed were the bones of a woman And the bones of the arms and the bones of the hands clung fast about his neck Xl Hakuodo Yusai the fortune teller went to view the corpse at the prayer of the faithless Tomozo The old man was terrified and astonished at the spectacle but looked about him with a keen eye He soon perceived that the o fuda had been taken from the little window at the back of the house and on searching the body of Shinzaburo he discovered that the golden mamori had been taken from its wrapping and a copper image of Fudo put in place of it He suspected Tomozo of the theft but the whole occurrence was so very extraordinary that he thought it prudent to consult with the priest Ryoseki before taking further action Therefore after having made a careful examination of the premises he betook himself to the temple Shin Banzui In as quickly as his aged limbs could bear him Ryoseki without waiting to hear the purpose of the old man s visit at once invited him into a private apartment You know that you are always welcome here said Ryoseki Please seat yourself at ease Well I am sorry to tell you that Hagiwara Sama is dead Yusai wonderingly exclaimed Yes he is dead but how did you learn of it The priest responded Hagiwara Sama was suffering from the results of an evil karma and his attendant was a bad man What happened to Hagiwara Sama was unavoidable his destiny had been determined from a time long before his last birth It will be better for you not to let your mind be troubled by this event Yusai said I have heard that a priest of pure life may gain power to see into the future for a hundred years but truly this is the first time in my existence that I have had proof of such power Still there is another matter about which I am very anxious You mean interrupted Ryoseki the stealing of the holy mamori the Kai On Nyorai But you must not give yourself any concern about that The image has been buried in a field and it will be found there and returned to me during the eighth month of the coming year So please do not be anxious about it More and more amazed the old ninsomi ventured to observe I have studied the In Yo one and the science of divination and I make my living by telling peoples fortunes but I cannot possibly understand how you know these things Ryoseki answered gravely Never mind how I happen to know them I now want to speak to you about Hagiwara s funeral The House of Hagiwara has its own family cemetery of course but to bury him there would not be proper He must be buried beside O Tsuyu the Lady Iijima for his karma relation to her was a very deep one And it is but right that you should erect a tomb for him at your own cost because you have been indebted to him for many favors Thus it came to pass that Shinzaburo was buried beside O Tsuyu in the cemetery of Shin Banzui In in Yanaka no Sasaki Here ends the story of the Ghosts in the Romance of the Peony Lantern one The Male and Female principles of the universe the Active and Passive forces of Nature Yusai refers here to the old Chinese nature philosophy better known to Western readers by the name FENG SHUI My friend asked me whether the story had interested me and I answered by telling him that I wanted to go to the cemetery of Shin Banzui In so as to realize more definitely the local color of the author s studies I shall go with you at once he said But what did you think of the personages To Western thinking I made answer Shinzaburo is a despicable creature I have been mentally comparing him with the true lovers of our old ballad literature They were only too glad to follow a dead sweetheart into the grave and nevertheless being Christians they believed that they had only one human life to enjoy in this world But Shinzaburo was a Buddhist with a million lives behind him and a million lives before him and he was too selfish to give up even one miserable existence for the sake of the girl that came back to him from the dead Then he was even more cowardly than selfish Although a samurai by birth and training he had to beg a priest to save him from ghosts In every way he proved himself contemptible and O Tsuyu did quite right in choking him to death From the Japanese point of view likewise my friend responded Shinzaburo is rather contemptible But the use of this weak character helped the author to develop incidents that could not otherwise perhaps have been so effectively managed To my thinking the only attractive character in the story is that of O Yone type of the old time loyal and loving servant intelligent shrewd full of resource faithful not only unto death but beyond death Well let us go to Shin Banzui In We found the temple uninteresting and the cemetery an abomination of desolation Spaces once occupied by graves had been turned into potato patches Between were tombs leaning at all angles out of the perpendicular tablets made illegible by scurf empty pedestals shattered water tanks and statues of Buddhas without heads or hands Recent rains had soaked the black soil leaving here and there small pools of slime about which swarms of tiny frogs were hopping Everything excepting the potato patches seemed to have been neglected for years In a shed just within the gate we observed a woman cooking and my companion presumed to ask her if she knew anything about the tombs described in the Romance of the Peony Lantern Ah the tombs of O Tsuyu and O Yone she responded smiling you will find them near the end of the first row at the back of the temple next to the statue of Jizo Surprises of this kind I had met with elsewhere in Japan We picked our way between the rain pools and between the green ridges of young potatoes whose roots were doubtless feeding on the sub stance of many another O Tsuyu and O Yone and we reached at last two lichen eaten tombs of which the inscriptions seemed almost obliterated Beside the larger tomb was a statue of Jizo with a broken nose The characters are not easy to make out said my friend but wait He drew from his sleeve a sheet of soft white paper laid it over the inscription and began to rub the paper with a lump of clay As he did so the characters appeared in white on the blackened surface Eleventh day third month Rat Elder Brother Fire Sixth year of Horeki A D seventeen fifty six This would seem to be the grave of some innkeeper of Nedzu named Kichibei Let us see what is on the other monument With a fresh sheet of paper he presently brought out the text of a kaimyo and read En myo In Ho yo I tei ken shi Ho ni Nun of the Law Illustrious Pure of heart and will Famed in the Law inhabiting the Mansion of the Preaching of Wonder The grave of some Buddhist nun What utter humbug I exclaimed That woman was only making fun of us Now my friend protested you are unjust to the woman You came here because you wanted a sensation and she tried her very best to please you You did not suppose that ghost story was true did you Footprints of the Buddha I I was recently surprised to find in Anderson s catalogue of Japanese and Chinese paintings in the British Museum this remarkable statement It is to be noted that in Japan the figure of the Buddha is never represented by the feet or pedestal alone as in the Amravati remains and many other Indian art relics As a matter of fact the representation is not even rare in Japan It is to be found not only upon stone monuments but also in religious paintings especially certain kakemono suspended in temples These kakemono usually display the footprints upon a very large scale with a multitude of mystical symbols and characters The sculptures may be less common but in Tokyo alone there are a number of Butsu soku seki or Buddha foot stones which I have seen and probably several which I have not seen There is one at the temple of Eko In near Ryogoku bashi one at the temple of Denbo In in Koishikawa one at the temple of Denbo In in Asakusa and a beautiful example at Zojoji in Shiba These are not cut out of a single block but are composed of fragments cemented into the irregular traditional shape and capped with a heavy slab of Nebukawa granite on the polished surface of which the design is engraved in lines about one tenth of an inch in depth I should judge the average height of these pedestals to be about two feet four inches and their greatest diameter about three feet Around the footprints there are carved in most of the examples twelve little bunches of leaves and buds of the Bodai ju Bodhidruma or Bodhi tree of Buddhist legend In all cases the footprint design is about the same but the monuments are different in quality and finish That of Zojoji with figures of divinities cut in low relief on its sides is the most ornate and costly of the four The specimen at Eko In is very poor and plain The first Butsu soku seki made in Japan was that erected at Todaiji in Nara It was designed after a similar monument in China said to be the faithful copy of an Indian original Concerning this Indian original the following tradition is given in an old Buddhist book one In a temple of the province of Makada Maghada there is a great stone The Buddha once trod upon this stone and the prints of the soles of his feet remain upon its surface The length of the impressions is one foot and eight inches two and the width of them a little more than six inches On the sole part of each footprint there is the impression of a wheel and upon each of the prints of the ten toes there is a flower like design which sometimes radiates light When the Buddha felt that the time of his Nirvana was approaching he went to Kushina Kusinara and there stood upon that stone He stood with his face to the south Then he said to his disciple Anan Ananda In this place I leave the impression of my feet to remain for a last token Although a king of this country will try to destroy the impression it can never be entirely destroyed And indeed it has not been destroyed unto this day Once a king who hated Buddhism caused the top of the stone to be pared off so as to remove the impression but after the surface had been removed the footprints reappeared upon the stone Concerning the virtue of the representation of the footprints of the Buddha there is sometimes quoted a text from the Kwan butsu sanmai kyo Buddha dhyana samadhi sagara sutra thus translated for me In that time Shaka Sakyamuni lifted up his foot When the Buddha lifted up his foot all could perceive upon the sole of it the appearance of a wheel of a thousand spokes And Shaka said Whosoever beholds the sign upon the sole of my foot shall be purified from all his faults Even he who beholds the sign after my death shall be delivered from all the evil results of all his errors Various other texts of Japanese Buddhism affirm that whoever looks upon the footprints of the Buddha shall be freed from the bonds of error and conducted upon the Way of Enlightenment An outline of the footprints as engraved on one of the Japanese pedestals three should have some interest even for persons familiar with Indian sculptures of the S ripada The double page drawing accompanying this paper Fig one and showing both footprints has been made after the tracing at Dentsu In where the footprints have the full legendary dimension It will be observed that there are only seven emblems these are called in Japan the Shichi So or Seven Appearances I got some information about them from the Sho Eko Ho Kwan a book used by the Jodo sect This book also contains rough woodcuts of the footprints and one of them I reproduce here for the purpose of calling attention to the curious form of the emblems upon the toes They are said to be modifications of the manji or svastika but I doubt it In the Butsu soku seki tracings the corresponding figures suggest the flower like design mentioned in the tradition of the Maghada stone while the symbols in the book print suggest fire Indeed their outline so much resembles the conventional flamelet design of Buddhist decoration that I cannot help thinking them originally intended to indicate the traditional luminosity of the footprints Moreover there is a text in the book called Ho Kai Shidai that lends support to this supposition The sole of the foot of the Buddha is flat like the base of a toilet stand Upon it are lines forming the appearance of a wheel of a thousand spokes The toes are slender round long straight graceful and somewhat luminous Fig three The explanation of the Seven Appearances which is given by the Sho Eko Ho Kwan cannot be called satisfactory but it is not without interest in relation to Japanese popular Buddhism The emblems are considered in the following order I The Svastika The figure upon each toe is said to be a modification of the manji four and although I doubt whether this is always the case I have observed that on some of the large kakemono representing the footprints the emblem really is the svastika not a flamelet nor a flower shape five The Japanese commentator explains the svastika as a symbol of everlasting bliss II The Fish Gyo The fish signifies freedom from all restraints As in the water a fish moves easily in any direction so in the Buddha state the fully emancipated knows no restraints or obstructions III The Diamond Mace Jap Kongo sho Sansc Vadjra Explained as signifying the divine force that strikes and breaks all the lusts bonno of the world IV The Conch Shell Jap Hora or Trumpet Emblem of the preaching of the Law The book Shin zoku butsu ji hen calls it the symbol of the voice of the Buddha The Dai hi kyo calls it the token of the preaching and of the power of the Mahayana doctrine The Dai Nichi Kyo says At the sound of the blowing of the shell all the heavenly deities are filled with delight and come to hear the Law V The Flower Vase Jap Hanagame Emblem of muro a mystical word which might be literally rendered as not leaking signifying that condition of supreme intelligence triumphant over birth and death VI The Wheel of a Thousand Spokes Sansc Tchakra This emblem called in Japanese Senfuku rin so is curiously explained by various quotations The Hokke Monku says The effect of a wheel is to crush something and the effect of the Buddha s preaching is to crush all delusions errors doubts and superstitions Therefore preaching the doctrine is called turning the Wheel The Sei Ri Ron says Even as the common wheel has its spokes and its hub so in Buddhism there are many branches of the Hasshi Shodo Eight fold Path or eight rules of conduct VII The Crown of Brahma Under the heel of the Buddha is the Treasure Crown Ho Kwan of Brahma Bon Ten O in symbol of the Buddha s supremacy above the gods But I think that the inscriptions upon any of these Butsu soku seki will be found of more significance than the above imperfect attempts at an explanation of the emblems The inscriptions upon the monument at Dentsu In are typical On different sides of the structure near the top and placed by rule so as to face certain points of the compass there are engraved five Sanscrit characters which are symbols of the Five Elemental Buddhas together with scriptural and commemorative texts These latter have been translated for me as follows The HO KO honorable NYO KYO says In that time from beneath his feet the Buddha radiated a light having the appearance of a wheel of a thousand spokes And all who saw that radiance became strictly upright and obtained the Supreme Enlightenment The KWAN BUTSU SANMAI KYO says Whosoever looks upon the footprints of the Buddha shall be freed from the results even of innumerable thousands of imperfections The BUTSU SETSU MU RYO JU KYO says In the land that the Buddha treads in journeying there is not even one person in all the multitude of the villages who is not benefited Then throughout the world there is peace and good will The sun and the moon shine clear and bright Wind and rain come only at a suitable time Calamity and pestilence cease The country prospers the people are free from care Weapons become useless All men reverence religion and regulate their conduct in all matters with earnestness and modesty Commemorative Text The Fifth Month of the Eighteenth Year of Meiji all the priests of this temple made and set up this pedestal stone bearing the likeness of the footprints of the Buddha and placed the same within the main court of Dentsu In in order that the seed of holy enlightenment might be sown for future time and for the sake of the advancement of Buddhism TAIJO priest being the sixty sixth chief priest by succession of this temple has respectfully composed JUNYU the minor

A monument at Nara exhibits the S ripada in a form differing considerably from the design upon the Tokyo pedestals four Lit The thousand character sign five On some monuments and drawings there is a sort of disk made by a single line in spiral on each toe together with the image of a small wheel II Strange facts crowd into memory as one contemplates those graven footprints footprints giant seeming yet less so than the human personality of which they remain the symbol Twenty four hundred years ago out of solitary meditation upon the pain and the mystery of being the mind of an Indian pilgrim brought forth the highest truth ever taught to men and in an era barren of science anticipated the uttermost knowledge of our present evolutional philosophy regarding the secret unity of life the endless illusions of matter and of mind and the birth and death of universes He by pure reason and he alone before our time found answers of worth to the questions of the Whence the Whither and the Why and he made with these answers another and a nobler faith than the creed of his fathers He spoke and returned to his dust and the people worshipped the prints of his dead feet because of the love that he had taught them Thereafter waxed and waned the name of Alexander and the power of Rome and the might of Islam nations arose and vanished cities grew and were not the children of another civilization vaster than Romes begirdled the earth with conquest and founded far off empires and came at last to rule in the land of that pilgrim s birth And these rich in the wisdom of four and twenty centuries wondered at the beauty of his message and caused all that he had said and done to be written down anew in languages unborn at the time when he lived and taught Still burn his foot prints in the East and still the great West marvelling follows their gleam to seek the Supreme Enlightenment Even thus of old Milinda the king followed the way to the house of Nagasena at first only to question after the subtle method of the Greeks yet later to accept with noble reverence the nobler method of the Master Ululation SHE is lean as a wolf and very old the white bitch that guards my gate at night She played with most of the young men and women of the neighborhood when they were boys and girls I found her in charge of my present dwelling on the day that I came to occupy it She had guarded the place I was told for a long succession of prior tenants apparently with no better reason than that she had been born in the woodshed at the back of the house Whether well or ill treated she had served all occupants faultlessly as a watch The question of food as wages had never seriously troubled her because most of the families of the street daily contributed to her support She is gentle and silent silent at least by day and in spite of her gaunt ugliness her pointed ears and her somewhat unpleasant eyes everybody is fond of her Children ride on her back and tease her at will but although she has been known to make strange men feel uncomfortable she never growls at a child The reward of her patient good nature is the friendship of the community When the dog killers come on their bi annual round the neighbors look after her interests Once she was on the very point of being officially executed when the wife of the smith ran to the rescue and pleaded successfully with the policeman superintending the massacres Put somebody s name on the dog said the latter then it will be safe Whose dog is it That question proved hard to answer The dog was everybody s and nobody s welcome everywhere but owned nowhere But where does it stay asked the puzzled constable It stays said the smith s wife in the house of the foreigner Then let the foreigner s name be put upon the dog suggested the policeman Accordingly I had my name painted on her back in big Japanese characters But the neighbors did not think that she was sufficiently safeguarded by a single name So the priest of Kobudera painted the name of the temple on her left side in beautiful Chinese text and the smith put the name of his shop on her right side and the vegetable seller put on her breast the ideographs for eight hundred which represent the customary abbreviation of the word yaoya vegetable seller any yaoya being supposed to sell eight hundred or more different things Consequently she is now a very curious looking dog but she is well protected by all that calligraphy I have only one fault to find with her she howls at night Howling is one of the few pathetic pleasures of her existence At first I tried to frighten her out of the habit but finding that she refused to take me seriously I concluded to let her howl It would have been monstrous to beat her Yet I detest her howl It always gives me a feeling of vague disquiet like the uneasiness that precedes the horror of nightmare It makes me afraid indefinably superstitiously afraid Perhaps what I am writing will seem to you absurd but you would not think it absurd if you once heard her howl She does not howl like the common street dogs She belongs to some ruder Northern breed much more wolfish and retaining wild traits of a very peculiar kind And her howl is also peculiar It is incomparably weirder than the howl of any European dog and I fancy that it is incomparably older It may represent the original primitive cry of her species totally unmodified by centuries of domestication It begins with a stifled moan like the moan of a bad dream mounts into a long long wail like a wailing of wind sinks quavering into a chuckle rises again to a wail very much higher and wilder than before breaks suddenly into a kind of atrocious laughter and finally sobs itself out in a plaint like the crying of a little child The ghastliness of the performance is chiefly though not entirely in the goblin mockery of the laughing tones as contrasted with the piteous agony of the wailing ones an incongruity that makes you think of madness And I imagine a corresponding incongruity in the soul of the creature I know that she loves me that she would throw away her poor life for me at an instant s notice I am sure that she would grieve if I were to die But she would not think about the matter like other dogs like a dog with hanging ears for ex ample She is too savagely close to Nature for that Were she to find herself alone with my corpse in some desolate place she would first mourn wildly for her friend but this duty per formed she would proceed to ease her sorrow in the simplest way possible by eating him by cracking his bones between those long wolf s teeth of hers And thereafter with spotless conscience she would sit down and utter to the moon the funeral cry of her ancestors It fills me that cry with a strange curiosity not less than with a strange horror because of certain extraordinary vowellings in it which always recur in the same order of sequence and must represent particular forms of animal speech particular ideas The whole thing is a song a song of emotions and thoughts not human and therefore humanly unimaginable But other dogs know what it means and make answer over the miles of the night sometimes from so far away that only by straining my hearing to the uttermost can I detect the faint response The words if I may call them words are very few yet to judge by their emotional effect they must signify a great deal Possibly they mean things myriads of years old things relating to odors to exhalations to influences and effluences inapprehensible by duller human sense impulses also impulses without name bestirred in ghosts of dogs by the light of great moons Could we know the sensations of a dog the emotions and the ideas of a dog we might discover some strange correspondence between their character and the character of that peculiar disquiet which the howl of the creature evokes But since the senses of a dog are totally unlike those of a man we shall never really know And we can only surmise in the vaguest way the meaning of the uneasiness in ourselves Some notes in the long cry and the weirdest of them oddly resemble those tones of the human voice that tell of agony and terror Again we have reason to believe that the sound of the cry itself became associated in human imagination at some period enormously remote with particular impressions of fear It is a remarkable fact that in almost all countries including Japan the howling of dogs has been attributed to their perception of things viewless to man and awful especially gods and ghosts and this unanimity of superstitious belief suggests that one element of the disquiet inspired by the cry is the dread of the supernatural To day we have ceased to be consciously afraid of the unseen knowing that we ourselves are supernatural that even the physical man with all his life of sense is more ghostly than any ghost of old imagining but some dim inheritance of the primitive fear still slumbers in our being and wakens perhaps like an echo to the sound of that wail in the night Whatever thing invisible to human eyes the senses of a dog may at times perceive it can be nothing resembling our idea of a ghost Most probably the mysterious cause of start and whine is not anything seen There is no anatomical reason for supposing a dog to possess exceptional powers of vision But a dog s organs of scent proclaim a faculty immeasurably superior to the sense of smell in man The old universal belief in the superhuman perceptivities of the creature was a belief justified by fact but the perceptivities are not visual Were the howl of a dog really as once supposed an outcry of ghostly terror the meaning might possibly be I smell Them but not I see Them No evidence exists to support the fancy that a dog can see any forms of being which a man cannot see But the night howl of the white creature in my close forces me to wonder whether she does not mentally see something really terrible something which we vainly try to keep out of moral consciousness the ghoulish law of life Nay there are times when her cry seems to me not the mere cry of a dog but the voice of the law itself the very speech of that Nature so inexplicably called by poets the loving the merciful the divine Divine perhaps in some unknowable ultimate way but certainly not merciful and still more certainly not loving Only by eating each other do beings exist Beautiful to the poet s vision our world may seem with its loves its hopes its memories its aspirations but there is nothing beautiful in the fact that life is fed by continual murder that the tenderest affection the noblest enthusiasm the purest idealism must be nourished by the eating of flesh and the drinking of blood All life to sustain itself must devour life You may imagine yourself divine if you please but you have to obey that law Be if you will a vegetarian none the less you must eat forms that have feeling and desire Sterilize your food and digestion stops You cannot even drink without swallowing life Loathe the name as we may we are cannibals all being essentially is One and whether we eat the flesh of a plant a fish a reptile a bird a mammal or a man the ultimate fact is the same And for all life the end is the same every creature whether buried or burnt is devoured and not only once or twice nor a hundred nor a thousand nor a myriad times Consider the ground upon which we move the soil out of which we came think of the vanished billions that have risen from it and crumbled back into its latency to feed what becomes our food Perpetually we eat the dust of our race the substance of our ancient selves But even so called inanimate matter is self devouring Substance preys upon substance As in the droplet monad swallows monad so in the vast of Space do spheres consume each other Stars give being to worlds and devour them planets assimilate their own moons All is a ravening that never ends but to recommence And unto whomsoever thinks about these matters the story of a divine universe made and ruled by paternal love sounds less persuasive than the Polynesian tale that the souls of the dead are devoured by the gods Monstrous the law seems because we have developed ideas and sentiments which are opposed to this demoniac Nature much as voluntary movement is opposed to the blind power of gravitation But the possession of such ideas and sentiments does but aggravate the atrocity of our situation without lessening in the least the gloom of the final problem Anyhow the faith of the Far East meets that problem better than the faith of the West To the Buddhist the Cosmos is not divine at all quite the reverse It is Karma it is the creation of thoughts and acts of error it is not governed by any providence it is a ghastliness a nightmare Likewise it is an illusion It seems real only for the same reason that the shapes and the pains of an evil dream seem real to the dreamer Our life upon earth is a state of sleep Yet we do not sleep utterly There are gleams in our darkness faint auroral wakenings of Love and Pity and Sympathy and Magnanimity these are selfless and true these are eternal and divine these are the Four Infinite Feelings in whose after glow all forms and illusions will vanish like mists in the light of the sun But except in so far as we wake to these feelings we are dreamers indeed moaning unaided in darkness tortured by shadowy horror All of us dream none are fully awake and many who pass for the wise of the world know even less of the truth than my dog that howls in the night Could she speak my dog I think that she might ask questions which no philosopher would be able to answer For I believe that she is tormented by the pain of existence Of course I do not mean that the riddle presents itself to her as it does to us nor that she can have reached any abstract conclusions by any mental processes like our own The external world to her is a continuum of smells She thinks compares remembers reasons by smells By smell she makes her estimates of character all her judgments are founded upon smells Smelling thousands of things which we cannot smell at all she must comprehend them in a way of which we can form no idea Whatever she knows has been learned through mental operations of an utterly unimaginable kind But we may be tolerably sure that she thinks about most things in some odor relation to the experience of eating or to the intuitive dread of being eaten Certainly she knows a great deal more about the earth on which we tread than would be good for us to know and probably if capable of speech she could tell us the strangest stories of air and water Gifted or afflicted as she is with such terribly penetrant power of sense her notion of apparent realities must be worse than sepulchral Small wonder if she howl at the moon that shines upon such a world And yet she is more awake in the Buddhist meaning than many of us She possesses a rude moral code inculcating loyalty submission gentleness gratitude and maternal love together with various minor rules of conduct and this simple code she has always observed By priests her state is termed a state of darkness of mind because she cannot learn all that men should learn but according to her light she has done well enough to merit some better condition in her next rebirth So think the people who know her When she dies they will give her an humble funeral and have a sutra recited on behalf of her spirit The priest will let a grave be made for her somewhere in the temple garden and will place over it a little sotoba bearing the text Nyo ze chikusho hotsu Bodai shin one Even within such as this animal the Knowledge Supreme will unfold at last one Lit the Bodhi mind that is to say the Supreme Enlightenment the intelligence of Buddhahood itself Bits of Poetry I Among a people with whom poetry has been for centuries a universal fashion of emotional utterance we should naturally suppose the common ideal of life to be a noble one However poorly the upper classes of such a people might compare with those of other nations we could scarcely doubt that its lower classes were morally and otherwise in advance of our own lower classes And the Japanese actually present us with such a social phenomenon Poetry in Japan is universal as the air It is felt by everybody It is read by everybody It is composed by almost everybody irrespective of class and condition Nor is it thus ubiquitous in the mental atmosphere only it is everywhere to be heard by the ear and seen by the eye As for audible poetry wherever there is working there is singing The toil of the fields and the labor of the streets are performed to the rhythm of chanted verse and song would seem to be an expression of the life of the people in about the same sense that it is an expression of the life of cicadae As for visible poetry it appears everywhere written or graven in Chinese or in Japanese characters as a form of decoration In thousands and thousands of dwellings you might observe that the sliding screens separating rooms or closing alcoves have Chinese or Japanese decorative texts upon them and these texts are poems In houses of the better class there are usually a number of gaku or suspended tablets to be seen each bearing for all design a beautifully written verse But poems can be found upon almost any kind of domestic utensil for example upon braziers iron kettles vases wooden trays lacquer ware porcelains chopsticks of the finer sort even toothpicks Poems are painted upon shop signs panels screens and fans Poems are printed upon towels draperies curtains kerchiefs silk linings and women s crepe silk underwear Poems are stamped or worked upon letter paper envelopes purses mirror cases travelling bags Poems are inlaid upon enamelled ware cut upon bronzes graven upon metal pipes embroidered upon tobacco pouches It were a hopeless effort to enumerate a tithe of the articles decorated with poetical texts Probably my readers know of those social gatherings at which it is the custom to compose verses and to suspend the compositions to blossoming frees also of the Tanabata festival in honor of certain astral gods when poems inscribed on strips of colored paper and attached to thin bamboos are to be seen even by the roadside all fluttering in the wind like so many tiny flags Perhaps you might find your way to some Japanese hamlet in which there are neither trees nor flowers but never to any hamlet in which there is no visible poetry You might wander as I have done into a settlement so poor that you could not obtain there for love or money even a cup of real tea but I do not believe that you could discover a settlement in which there is nobody capable of making a poem II Recently while looking over a manuscript collection of verses mostly short poems of an emotional or descriptive character it occurred to me that a selection from them might serve to illustrate certain Japanese qualities of sentiment as well as some little known Japanese theories of artistic expression and I ventured forthwith upon this essay The poems which had been collected for me by different persons at many different times and places were chiefly of the kind written on particular occasions and cast into forms more serried if not also actually briefer than anything in Western prosody Probably few Of my readers are aware of two curious facts relating to this order of composition Both facts are exemplified in the history and in the texts of my collection though I cannot hope in my renderings to reproduce the original effect whether of imagery or of feeling The first curious fact is that from very ancient times the writing of short poems has been practised in Japan even more as a moral duty than as a mere literary art The old ethical teaching was somewhat like this Are you very angry do not say anything unkind but compose a poem Is your best beloved dead do not yield to useless grief but try to calm your mind by making a poem Are you troubled because you are about to die leaving so many things unfinished be brave and write a poem on death Whatever injustice or misfortune disturbs you put aside your resentment or your sorrow as soon as possible and write a few lines of sober and elegant verse for a moral exercise Accordingly in the old days every form of trouble was encountered with a poem Bereavement separation disaster called forth verses in lieu of plaints The lady who preferred death to loss of honor composed a poem before piercing her throat The samurai sentenced to die by his own hand wrote a poem before performing hara kiri Even in this less romantic era of Meiji young people resolved upon suicide are wont to compose some verses before quitting the world Also it is still the good custom to write a poem in time of ill fortune I have frequently known poems to be written under the most trying circumstances of misery or suffering nay even upon a bed of death and if the verses did not display any extraordinary talent they at least afforded extraordinary proof of self mastery under pain Surely this fact of composition as ethical practice has larger interest than all the treatises ever written about the rules of Japanese prosody The other curious fact is only a fact of aesthetic theory The common art principle of the class of poems under present consideration is identical with the common principle of Japanese pictorial illustration By the use of a few chosen words the composer of a short poem endeavors to do exactly what the painter endeavors to do with a few strokes of the brush to evoke an image or a mood to revive a sensation or an emotion And the accomplishment of this purpose by poet or by picture maker depends altogether upon capacity to suggest and only to suggest A Japanese artist would be condemned for attempting elaboration of detail in a sketch intended to recreate the memory of some landscape seen through the blue haze of a spring morning or under the great blond light of an autumn after noon Not only would he be false to the traditions of his art he would necessarily defeat his own end thereby In the same way a poet would be condemned for attempting any completeness of utterance in a very short poem his object should be only to stir imagination without satisfying it So the term ittakkiri meaning all gone or entirely vanished in the sense of all told is contemptuously applied to verses in which the verse maker has uttered his whole thought praise being reserved for compositions that leave in the mind the thrilling of a something unsaid Like the single stroke of a temple bell the perfect short poem should set murmuring and undulating in the mind of the hearer many a ghostly aftertone of long duration III But for the same reason that Japanese short poems may be said to resemble Japanese pictures a full comprehension of them requires an intimate knowledge of the life which they reflect And this is especially true of the emotional class of such poems a literal translation of which in the majority of cases would signify almost nothing to the Western mind Here for example is a little verse pathetic enough to Japanese comprehension ChochO ni Kyonen shishitaru Tsuma koishi Translated this would appear to mean only Two butterflies Last year my dear wife died Unless you happen to know the pretty Japanese symbolism of the butterfly in relation to happy marriage and the old custom of sending with the wedding gift a large pair of paper butterflies ocho mecho the verse might well seem to be less than commonplace Or take this recent composition by a University student which has been praised by good judges Furusato ni Fubo ari mushi no Koe goe one In my native place the old folks or my parents are clamor of insect voices one I must observe however that the praise was especially evoked by the use of the term koe goe literally meaning voice after voice or a crying of many voices and the special value of the syllables here can be appreciated only by a Japanese poet The poet here is a country lad In unfamiliar fields he listens to the great autumn chorus of insects and the sound revives for him the memory of his far off home and of his parents But here is something incomparably more touching though in literal translation probably more obscure than either of the preceding specimens Mi ni shimiru Kaze ya I Shoji ni Yubi no ato Oh body piercing wind that work of little fingers in the shoji two What does this mean It means the sorrowing of a mother for her dead child Shoji is the name given to those light white paper screens which in a Japanese house serve both as windows and doors admitting plenty of light but concealing like frosted glass the interior from outer observation and excluding the wind Infants delight to break these by poking their fingers through the soft paper then the wind blows through the holes In this case the wind blows very cold indeed into the mother s very heart for it comes through the little holes that were made by the fingers of her dead child two More literally body through pierce wind ah shoji in the traces of viz holes made by fingers The impossibility of preserving the inner quality of such poems in a literal rendering will now be obvious Whatever I attempt in this direction must of necessity be ittakkiri for the unspoken has to be expressed and what the Japanese poet is able to say in seventeen or twenty one syllables may need in English more than double that number of words But perhaps this fact will lend additional interest to the following atoms of emotional expression A MOTHER S REMEMBRANCE Sweet and clear in the night the voice of a boy at study Reading out of a book I also once had a boy A MEMORY IN SPRING She who departing hence left to the flowers of the plum tree Blooming beside our eaves the charm of her youth and beauty And maiden pureness of heart to quicken their flush and fragrance Ah where does she dwell to day our dear little vanished sister FANCIES OF ANOTHER FAITH one I sought in the place of graves the tomb of my vanished friend From ancient cedars above there rippled a wild doves cry two Perhaps a freak of the wind yet perhaps a sign of remembrance This fall of a single leaf on the water I pour for the dead three I whispered a prayer at the grave a butterfly rose and fluttered Thy spirit perhaps dear friend IN A CEMETERY AT NIGHT This light of the moon that plays on the water I pour for the dead Differs nothing at all from the moonlight of other years AFTER LONG ABSENCE The garden that once I loved and even the hedge of the garden All is changed and strange the moonlight only is faithful The moon along remembers the charm of the time gone by MOONLIGHT ON THE SEA O vapory moon of spring would that one plunge into ocean Could win me renewal of life as a part of thy light on the waters AFTER FAREWELL Whither now should look where is the place of parting Boundaries all have vanished nothing tells of direction Only the waste of sea under the shining moon HAPPY POVERTY Wafted into my room the scent of the flowers of the plum tree Changes my broken window into a source of delight AUTUMN FANCIES one Faded the clover now sere and withered the grasses What dreams the matsumushi one in the desolate autumn fields two Strangely sad I thought sounded the bell of evening Haply that tone proclaimed the night in which autumn dies three Viewing this autumn moon I dream of my native village Under the same soft light and the shadows about my home one A musical cricket calyptotryphus marmoratus IN TIME OF GRIEF HEARING A SEMI CICADA Only I I the cry of the foolish semi Any one knows that the world is void as its cast off shell ON THE CAST OFF SHELL OF A SEMI Only the pitiful husk O poor singer of summer Wherefore thus consume all thy body in song SUBLIMITY OF INTELLECTUAL POWER The mind that undimmed absorbs the foul and the pure together Call it rather a sea one thousand fathoms deep two two This is quite novel in its way a product of the University the original runs thus Nigoreru mo Sumeru mo tomo ni Iruru koso Chi hiro no umi no Kokoro nari kere SHINTO REVERY Mad waves devour The rocks I ask myself in the darkness Have I become a god Dim is The night and wild Have I become a god that is to say Have I died am I only a ghost in this desolation The dead becoming kami or gods are thought to haunt wild solitudes by preference IV The poems above rendered are more than pictorial they suggest something of emotion or sentiment But there are thousands of pictorial poems that do not and these would seem mere insipidities to a reader ignorant of their true purpose When you learn that some exquisite text of gold means only Evening sunlight on the wings of the water fowl or Now in my garden the flowers bloom and the butterflies dance then your first interest in decorative poetry is apt to wither away Yet these little texts have a very real merit of their own and an intimate relation to Japanese aesthetic feeling and experience Like the pictures upon screens and fans and cups they give pleasure by recalling impressions of nature by reviving happy incidents of travel or pilgrimage by evoking the memory of beautiful days And when this plain fact is fully understood the persistent attachment of modern Japanese poets notwithstanding their University training to the ancient poetical methods will be found reasonable enough I need offer only a very few specimens of the purely pictorial poetry The following mere thumb nail sketches in verse are of recent date LONESOMENESS Furu dera ya Kane mono iwazu Sakura chiru Old temple bell voiceless cherry flowers fall MORNING AWAKENING AFTER A NIGHT S REST IN A TEMPLE Yamadera no Shicho akeyuku Taki no oto In the mountain temple the paper mosquito curtain is lighted by the dawn sound of water fall WINTER SCENE Yuki no mura Niwatori naite Ake shiroshi Snow village cocks crowing white dawn Let me conclude this gossip on poetry by citing from another group of verses also pictorial in a certain sense but chiefly remarkable for ingenuity two curiosities of impromptu The first is old and is attributed to the famous poetess Chiyo Having been challenged to make a poem of seventeen syllables referring to a square a triangle and a circle she is said to have immediately responded Kaya no te wo Hitotsu hazushite Tsuki mi kana Detaching one corner of the mosquito net lo I behold the moon The top of the mosquito net suspended by cords at each of its four corners represents the square letting down the net at one corner converts the square into a triangle and the moon represents the circle The other curiosity is a recent impromptu effort to portray in one verse of seventeen syllables the last degree of devil may care poverty perhaps the brave misery of the wandering student and I very much doubt whether the effort could be improved upon Nusundaru Kagashi no kasa ni Ame kyu nari Heavily pours the rain on the hat that I stole from the scarecrow Japanese Buddhist Proverbs As representing that general quality of moral experience which remains almost unaffected by social modifications of any sort the proverbial sayings of a people must always possess a special psychological interest for thinkers In this kind of folklore the oral and the written literature of Japan is rich to a degree that would require a large book to exemplify To the subject as a whole no justice could be done within the limits of a single essay But for certain classes of proverbs and proverbial phrases something can be done within even a few pages and sayings related to Buddhism either by allusion or derivation form a class which seems to me particularly worthy of study Accordingly with the help of a Japanese friend I have selected and translated the following series of examples choosing the more simple and familiar where choice was possible and placing the originals in alphabetical order to facilitate reference Of course the selection is imperfectly representative but it will serve to illustrate certain effects of Buddhist teaching upon popular thought and speech one Akuji mi ni tomaru All evil done clings to the body The consequence of any evil act or thought never so long as karma endures will cease to act upon the existence of the person guilty of it two Atama soru yori kokoro wo sore Better to shave the heart than to shave the head Buddhist nuns and priests have their heads completely shaven The proverb signifies that it is better to correct the heart to conquer all vain regrets and desires than to become a religious In common parlance the phrase to shave the head means to become a monk or a nun three Au wa wakare no hajime Meeting is only the beginning of separation Regret and desire are equally vain in this world of impermanency for all joy is the beginning of an experience that must have its pain This proverb refers directly to the sutra text Shoja bitsumetsu e sha jori All that live must surely die and all that meet will surely part four Banji wa yume All things are merely dreams Literally ten thousand things five Bonbu mo satoreba hotoke nari Even a common man by obtaining knowledge becomes a Buddha The only real differences of condition are differences In knowledge of the highest truth six Bonno kuno All lust is grief All sensual desire invariably brings sorrow seven Buppo to wara ya no ame dete kike One must go outside to hear Buddhist doctrine or the sound of rain on a straw roof There is an allusion here to the condition of the sbuhhl priest literally one who has left his house The proverb suggests that the higher truths of Buddhism cannot be acquired by those who continue to live in the world of follies and desires eight Bussho en yori okoru Out of karma relation even the divine nature itself grows There is good as well as bad karma Whatever hap piness we enjoy is not less a consequence of the acts and thoughts of previous lives than is any misfortune that comes to us Every good thought and act contributes to the evolution of the Buddha nature within each of us Another proverb No ten En naki shujo wa doshi gatashi further illustrates the meaning of this one nine Enko ga tsuki wo toran to suru ga gotoshi Like monkeys trying to snatch the moon s reflection on water Allusion to a parable said to have been related by the Buddha himself about some monkeys who found a well under a tree and mistook for reality the image of the moon in the water They resolved to seize the bright apparition One monkey suspended himself by the tail from a branch overhanging the well a second monkey clung to the first a third to the second a fourth to the third and so on till the long chain of bodies had almost reached the water Suddenly the branch broke under the unaccustomed weight and all the monkeys were drowned ten En naki shujo wa doshi gatashi To save folk having no karma relation would be difficult indeed No karma relation would mean an utter absence of merit as well as of demerit eleven Fujo seppo suru hoshi wa biratake ni umaru The priest who preaches foul doctrine shall be reborn as a fungus twelve Gaki mo ninzu Even gaki pretas can make a crowd Literally Even gaki are a multitude or population This is a popular saying used in a variety of ways The ordinary meaning is to the effect that no matter how poor or miserable the individuals composing a multitude they collectively represent a respectable force Jocosely the saying is sometimes used of a crowd of wretched or tired looking people sometimes of an assembly of weak boys desiring to make some demonstration sometimes of a miserable looking company of soldiers Among the lowest classes of the people it is not uncommon to call a deformed or greedy person a gaki thirteen Gaki no me ni midzu miezu To the eyes of gaki water is viewless Some authorities state that those pretas who suffer especially from thirst as a consequence of faults committed in former lives are unable to see water This proverb is used in speaking of persons too stupid or vicious to perceive a moral truth fourteen Gosho wa daiji The future life is the all important thing The common people often use the curious expression gosho daiji as an equivalent for extremely important fifteen Gun mo no tai zo wo saguru ga gotoshi Like a lot of blind men feeling a great elephant Said of those who ignorantly criticise the doctrines of Buddhism The proverb alludes to a celebrated fable in the Avadanas about a number of blind men who tried to decide the form of an elephant by feeling the animal One feeling the leg declared the elephant to be like a tree another feeling the trunk only declared the elephant to be like a serpent a third who felt only the side said that the elephant was like a wall a fourth grasping the tail said that the elephant was like a rope et cetera sixteen Gwai men nyo Bosatsu nai shin nyo Yasha In outward aspect a Bodhisattva at innermost heart a demon Yasha Sanscrit Yaksha a man devouring demon seventeen Hana wa ne ni kaeru The flower goes back to its root This proverb is most often used in reference to death signifying that all forms go back into the nothingness out of which they spring But it may also be used in relation to the law of cause and effect eighteen Hibiki no koe ni ozuru ga gotoshi Even as the echo answers to the voice Referring to the doctrine of cause and effect The philosophical beauty of the comparison will be

giving it a soul This proverb is used in reference to the conduct of those who undertake to do some work and leave the most essential part of the work unfinished It contains an allusion to the curious

represented twenty six Ichi ju no kage ichi ga no nagare tasho no en Even the experience of a single shadow or a single flowing of water is made by the karma relations of a former life Even so

tamashii Even a worm an inch long has a soul half an inch long Literally has a soul of five bu five bu being equal to half of the Japanese inch Buddhism forbids all taking of life and classes as

small or mean is entitled to mercy thirty three Iwashi no atama mo shinjin kara Even the head of an iwashi by virtue of faith will have power to save or heal The iwashi is a very small fish much resembling a sardine The proverb implies that the object of worship signifies little so long as the prayer is made with perfect faith and pure intention thirty four Jigo jitoku The fruit of ones own deeds in a previous state of existence Few popular Buddhist phrases are more often used than this Jigo signifies ones own acts or thoughts jitoku to bring upon oneself nearly always in the sense of

such as Jigoku no sata mo kane shidai Even the Judgments of Hell may be influenced by money forty one Karu toki no Jizo gao nasu toki no Emma gao Borrowing time the face of Jizoe repaying time the face of Emma Figs two three Emma is the Chinese and Japanese Yama in Buddhism the Lord of Hell and the Judge of the Dead The proverb is best explained by the accompanying drawings which will serve to give an idea of the commoner representations of both divinities forty two Kiite Gokuraku mite Jigoku Heard of only it is Paradise seen it is Hell Rumor is never trustworthy forty three Koji mon wo idezu akuji sen ni wo hashiru Good actions go not outside of the gate bad deeds travel a thousand ri forty four Kokoro no koma ni tadzuna wo yuru suna Never let go the reins of the wild colt of the

have been my mother This verse proverb is cited in the Buddhist work Wojo Yosbu with the following comment Who knows whether the animal in the field or the bird in the mountain wood has not been

to say The love of parents for their child may impede their spiritual progress not only in this world but through all their future states of being just as a kubikasi or Japanese cangue impedes the movements of the person upon whom it is placed Parental affection being the strongest of earthly attachments is particularly apt to cause those whom it enslaves to commit wrongful acts in the hope of benefiting their offspring The term Sangai here signifies the three worlds of Desire Form and Formlessness all the states of existence below Nirvana But the word is sometimes used to signify the Past

Oni no me ni mo namida tears in even a devil s eyes Oni no kakuran devil s cholera said of the unexpected sickness of some very strong and healthy person et cetera et cetera The class of demons called

ni ari Joy and sorrow exist only in the mind ninety five Uri no tsuru ni nasubi wa naranu Egg plants do not grow upon melon vines ninety six Uso mo hoben Even an untruth may serve as a device That is a pious device for effecting conversion Such a device is justified especially by the famous parable of the third chapter of the Saddharma Pundarika ninety seven Waga ya no hotoke tattoshi My family ancestors were all excellent Buddhas Meaning that one most reveres the hotoke the spirits of the dead regarded as Buddhas in one s own household shrine There is an ironical play upon the word hotoke which may mean either a dead person simply or a Buddha Perhaps the spirit of this proverb may be better explained by the help of another Nigeta sakana ni chisai wa nai shinda kodomo ni warui ko wa nai Fish that escaped was never small child that died was never bad ninety eight Yuki no hate wa Nehan The end of snow is Nirvana This curious saying is the only one in my collection containing the word Nehan Nirvana and is here inserted chiefly for that reason The common people seldom speak of Nehan and have little knowledge of those profound doctrines to which the term is related The above phrase as might be inferred is not a popular expression it is rather an artistic and poetical reference to the aspect of a landscape covered with snow to the horizon line so that beyond the snow circle there is only the great void of the sky ninety nine Zen ni wa zen no mukui aku ni wa aku no mukui Goodness or virtue is the return for goodness evil is the return for evil Not so commonplace a proverb as might appear at first sight for it refers especially to the Buddhist belief that every kindness shown to us in this life is a return of kindness done to others in a former life and that every wrong inflicted upon us is the reflex of some injustice which we committed in a previous birth one hundred Zense no yakusoku goto Promised or destined from a former birth A very common saying often uttered as a comment upon the unhappiness of separation upon sudden misfortune upon sudden death et cetera It is used especially in relation to shinju or lovers suicide Such suicide is popularly thought to be a result of cruelty in some previous state of being or the consequence of having broken in a former life the mutual promise to become husband and wife SUGGESTION I had the privilege of meeting him in Tokyo where he was making a brief stay on his way to India and we took a long walk together and talked of Eastern religions about which he knew incomparably more than I Whatever I could tell him concerning local beliefs he would comment upon in the most startling manner citing weird correspondences in some living cult of India Burmah or Ceylon Then all of a sudden he turned the conversation into a totally unexpected direction I have been thinking he said about the constancy of the relative proportion of the sexes and wondering whether Buddhist doctrine furnishes an explanation For it seems to me that under ordinary conditions of karma human rebirth would necessarily proceed by a regular alternation Do you mean I asked that a man would be reborn as a woman and a woman as a man Yes he replied because desire is creative and the desire of either sex is towards the other And how many men I said would want to be reborn as women Probably very few he answered But the doctrine that desire is creative does not imply that the individual longing creates its own satisfaction quite the contrary The true teaching is that the result of every selfish wish is in the nature of a penalty and that what the wish creates must prove to higher knowledge at least the folly of wishing There you are right I said but I do not yet understand your theory Well he continued if the physical conditions of human rebirth are all determined by the karma of the will relating to physical conditions then sex would be determined by the will in relation to sex Now the will of either sex is towards the other Above all things else excepting life man desires woman and woman man Each individual moreover independently of any personal relation feels perpetually you say the influence of some inborn feminine or masculine ideal which you call a ghostly reflex of countless attachments in countless past lives And the insatiable desire represented by this ideal would of itself suffice to create the masculine or the feminine body of the next existence But most women I observed would like to be reborn as men and the accomplishment of that wish would scarcely be in the nature of a penalty Why not he returned The happiness or unhappiness of the new existence would not be decided by sex alone it would of necessity depend upon many conditions in combination Your theory is interesting I said but I do not know how far it could be made to accord with accepted doctrine And what of the person able through knowledge and practice of the higher law to remain superior to all weaknesses of sex Such a one he replied would be reborn neither as man nor as woman providing there were no pre existent karma powerful enough to check or to weaken the results of the self conquest Reborn in some one of the heavens I queried by the Apparitional Birth Not necessarily he said Such a one might be reborn in a world of desire like this but neither as man only nor as woman only Reborn then in what form I asked In that of a perfect being he responded A man or a woman is scarcely more than half a being because in our present imperfect state either sex can be evolved only at the cost of the other In the mental and the physical composition of every man there is undeveloped woman and in the composition of every woman there is undeveloped man But a being complete would be both perfect man and perfect woman possessing the highest faculties of both sexes with the weaknesses of neither Some humanity higher than our own in other worlds might be thus evolved But you know I observed that there are Buddhist texts in the Saddharma Pundarika for example and in the Vinayas which forbid Those texts he interrupted refer to imperfect beings less than man and less than woman they could not refer to the condition that I have been supposing But remember I am not preaching a doctrine I am only hazarding a theory May I put your theory some day into print I asked Why yes he made answer if you believe it worth thinking about And long afterwards I wrote it down thus as fairly as I was able from memory Ingwa banashi one The daimyo s wife was dying and knew that she was dying She had not been able to leave her bed since the early autumn of the tenth Bunsei It was now the fourth month of the twelfth Bunsei the year eighteen twenty nine by Western counting and the cherry trees were blossoming She thought of the cherry trees in her garden and of the gladness of spring She thought of her children She thought of her husband s various concubines especially the Lady Yukiko nineteen years old My dear wife said the daimyo you have suffered very much for three long years We have done all that we could to get you well watching beside you night and day praying for you and often fasting for your sake But in spite of our loving care and in spite of the skill of our best physicians it would now seen that the end of your life is not far off Probably we shall sorrow more than you will sorrow because of your having to leave what the Buddha so truly termed this burning house of the world I shall order to be performed no matter what the cost every religious rite that can serve you in regard to your next rebirth and all of us will pray without ceasing for you that you may not have to wander in the Black Space but nay quickly enter Paradise and attain to Buddha hood He spoke with the utmost tenderness pressing her the while Then with eyelids closed she answered him in a voice thin as the voice of in insect I am grateful most grateful for your kind words Yes it is true as you say that I have been sick for three long years and that I have been treated with all possible care and affection Why indeed should I turn away from the one true Path at the very moment of my death Perhaps to think of worldly matters at such a time is not right but I have one last request to make only one Call here to me the Lady Yukiko you know that I love her like a sister I want to speak to her about the affairs of this household Yukiko came at the summons of the lord and in obedience to a sign from him knelt down beside the couch The daimyo s wife opened her eyes and looked at Yukiko and spoke Ah here is Yukiko I am so pleased to see you Yukiko Come a little closer so that you can hear me well I am not able to speak loud Yukiko I am going to die I hope that you will be faithful in all things to our dear lord for I want you to take my place when I am gone I hope that you will always be loved by him yes even a hundred times more than I have been and that you will very soon be promoted to a higher rank and become his honored wife And I beg of you always to cherish our dear lord never allow another woman to rob you of his affection This is what I wanted to say to you dear Yukiko Have you been able to understand Oh my dear Lady protested Yukiko do not I entreat you say such strange things to me You well know that I am of poor and mean condition how could I ever dare to aspire to become the wife of our lord Nay nay returned the wife huskily this is not a time for words of ceremony let us speak only the truth to each other After my death you will certainly be promoted to a higher place and I now assure you again that I wish you to become the wife of our lord yes I wish this Yukiko even more than I wish to become a Buddha Ah I had almost forgotten I want you to do something for me Yukiko You know that in the garden there is a yae zakura two which was brought here the year before last from Mount Yoshino in Yamato I have been told that it is now in full bloom and I wanted so much to see it in flower In a little while I shall be dead I must see that tree before I die Now I wish you to carry me into the garden at once Yukiko so that I can see it Yes upon your back Yukiko take me upon your back While thus asking her voice had gradually become clear and strong as if the intensity of the wish had given her new force then she suddenly burst into tears Yukiko knelt motionless not knowing what to do but the lord nodded assent It is her last wish in this world he said She always loved cherry flowers and I know that she wanted very much to see that Yamato tree in blossom Come my dear Yukiko let her have her will As a nurse turns her back to a child that the child may cling to it Yukiko offered her shoulders to the wife and said Lady I am ready please tell me how I best can help you Why this way responded the dying woman lifting herself with an almost superhuman effort by clinging to Yukiko s shoulders But as she stood erect she quickly slipped her thin hands down over the shoulders under the robe and clutched the breasts of the girl and burst into a wicked laugh I have my wish she cried I have my wish for the cherry bloom three but not the cherry bloom of the garden I could not die before I got my wish Now I have it oh what a delight And with these words she fell forward upon the crouching girl and died The attendants at once attempted to lift the body from Yukiko s shoulders and to lay it upon the bed But strange to say this seemingly easy thing could not be done The cold hands had attached themselves in some unaccountable way to the breasts of the girl appeared to have grown into the quick flesh Yukiko became senseless with fear and pain Physicians were called They could not understand what had taken place By no ordinary methods could the hands of the dead woman be unfastened from the body of her victim they so clung that any effort to remove them brought blood This was not because the fingers held it was because the flesh of the palms had united itself in some inexplicable manner to the flesh of the breasts At that time the most skilful physician in Yedo was a foreigner a Dutch surgeon It was decided to summon him After a careful examination he said that he could not understand the case and that for the immediate relief of Yukiko there was nothing to be done except to cut the hands from the corpse He declared that it would be dangerous to attempt to detach them from the breasts His advice was accepted and the hands were amputated at the wrists But they remained clinging to the breasts and there they soon darkened and dried up like the hands of a person long dead Yet this was only the beginning of the horror Withered and bloodless though they seemed those hands were not dead At intervals they would stir stealthily like great grey spiders And nightly thereafter beginning always at the Hour of the Ox four they would clutch and compress and torture Only at the Hour of the Tiger the pain would cease Yukiko cut off her hair and became a mendicant nun taking the religious name of Dassetsu She had an ibai mortuary tablet made bearing the kaimyo of her dead mistress Myo Ko In Den Chizan Ryo Fu Daishi and this she carried about with her in all her wanderings and every day before it she humbly besought the dead for pardon and performed a Buddhist service in order that the jealous spirit might find rest But the evil karma that had rendered such an affliction possible could not soon be exhausted Every night at the Hour of the Ox the hands never failed to torture her during more than seventeen years according to the testimony of those persons to whom she last told her story when she stopped for one evening at the house of Noguchi Dengozayemon in the village of Tanaka in the district of Kawachi in the province of Shimotsuke This was in the third year of Kokwa eighteen forty six Thereafter nothing more was ever heard of her one Lit a tale of ingwa Ingwa is a Japanese Buddhist term for evil karma or the evil consequence of faults committed in a former state of existence Perhaps the curious title of the narrative is best explained by the Buddhist teaching that the dead have power to injure the living only in consequence of evil actions committed by their victims in some former life Both title and narrative may be found in the collection of weird stories entitled Hyaku Monogatari two Yae zakura yae no sakura a variety of Japanese cherry tree that bears double blossoms three In Japanese poetry and proverbial phraseology the physical beauty of a woman is compared to the cherry flower while feminine moral beauty is compared to the plum flower four In ancient Japanese time the Hour of the Ox was the special hour of ghosts It began at two A M and lasted until four A M for the old Japanese hour was double the length of the modern hour The Hour of the Tiger began at four A M Story of a Tengu one In the days of the Emperor Go Reizei there was a holy priest living in the temple of Saito 
584-47041-0000	train-other-500	on the mountain called Hiyei Zan near Kyoto One summer day this good priest after a visit to the city was returning to his temple by way of Kita no Oji
none	none	 when he saw some boys ill treating a kite 
584-47041-0001	train-other-500	They had caught the bird in a snare and were beating it with sticks Oh the poor creature compassionately exclaimed the priest why do you torment it so children
584-47041-0002	train-other-500	One of the boys made answer We want to kill it to get the feathers Moved by pity the priest persuaded the boys to let him have the kite in exchange for a fan that he was carrying
584-47041-0003	train-other-500	and he set the bird free It had not been seriously hurt and was able to fly away Happy at having performed this Buddhist act of merit the priest then resumed his walk
584-47041-0004	train-other-500	He had not proceeded very far when he saw a strange monk come out of a bamboo grove by the road side and hasten towards him The monk respectfully saluted him and said Sir
none	none	 through your compassionate kindness my life has been saved and I now desire to express my gratitude in a fitting manner Astonished at hearing himself thus addressed the priest replied 
584-47041-0005	train-other-500	Really I cannot remember to have ever seen you before please tell me who you are It is not wonderful that you cannot recognize me in this form returned the monk
584-47041-0006	train-other-500	I am the kite that those cruel boys were tormenting at Kita no Oji You saved my life and there is nothing in this world more precious than life So I now wish to return your kindness in some way or other
none	none	 If there be anything that you would like to have or to know or to see 
584-47041-0007	train-other-500	anything that I can do for you in short please to tell me for as I happen to possess in a small degree the Six Supernatural Powers I am able to gratify almost any wish that you can express
584-47041-0008	train-other-500	On hearing these words the priest knew that he was speaking with a Tengu and he frankly made answer My friend I have long ceased to care for the things of this world I am now seventy years of age
584-47041-0009	train-other-500	neither fame nor pleasure has any attraction for me I feel anxious only about my future birth but as that is a matter in which no one can help me it were useless to ask about it
none	none	 Really I can think of but one thing worth wishing for It has been my life long regret that I was not in India in the time of the Lord Buddha and could not attend the great assembly on the holy mountain Gridhrakuta 
584-47041-0010	train-other-500	Never a day passes in which this regret does not come to me in the hour of morning or of evening prayer Ah my friend if it were possible to conquer Time and Space like the Bodhisattvas
584-47041-0011	train-other-500	so that I could look upon that marvellous assembly how happy should I be Why the Tengu exclaimed that pious wish of yours can easily be satisfied I perfectly well remember the assembly on the Vulture Peak
none	none	 and I can cause everything that happened there to reappear before you exactly as it occurred It is our greatest delight to represent such holy matters Come this way with me And the priest suffered himself to be led to a place among pines on the slope of a hill Now said the Tengu you have only to wait here for awhile with your eyes shut Do not open them until you hear the voice of the Buddha preaching the Law Then you can look But when you see the appearance of the Buddha you must not allow your devout feelings to influence you in any way 
584-47041-0012	train-other-500	you must not bow down nor pray nor utter
none	none	 any such exclamation as Even so Lord or O thou Blessed One 
584-47041-0013	train-other-500	You must not speak at all
none	none	 Should you make even the least sign of reverence something very unfortunate might happen to me 
584-47041-0014	train-other-500	The priest gladly promised to follow these injunctions and the Tengu hurried away as if to prepare the spectacle The day waned and passed and the darkness came but the old priest waited patiently beneath a tree
584-47041-0015	train-other-500	keeping his eyes closed At last a voice suddenly resounded above him a wonderful voice deep and clear like the pealing of a mighty bell the voice of the Buddha Sakyamuni
584-47041-0016	train-other-500	proclaiming the Perfect Way Then the priest opening his eyes in a great radiance perceived that all things had been changed the place was indeed the Vulture Peak
584-47041-0017	train-other-500	the holy Indian mountain Gridhrakuta and the time was the time of the Sutra of the Lotos of the Good Law Now there were no pines about him but strange shining trees
none	none	 made of the Seven Precious Substances with foliage and fruit of gems 
584-47041-0018	train-other-500	and the ground was covered with Mandarava and Manjushaka flowers showered from heaven and the night was filled with fragrance and splendour and the sweetness of the great Voice And in mid air
584-47041-0019	train-other-500	shining as a moon above the world
none	none	 the priest beheld the Blessed One seated upon the Lion throne 
584-47041-0020	train-other-500	with Samantabhadra at his right hand and Manjusri at his left and before them assembled immeasurably spreading into Space like a flood Of stars the hosts of the Mahasattvas and the Bodhisattvas
584-47041-0021	train-other-500	with their countless following gods demons Nagas goblins men and beings not human Sariputra he saw and Kasyapa and Ananda
none	none	 with all the disciples of the Tathagata and the Kings of the Devas and the Kings of the Four Directions like pillars of fire and the great Dragon Kings and the Gandharvas and Garudas 
584-47041-0022	train-other-500	and the Gods of the Sun and the Moon and the Wind and the shining myriads of Brahma s heaven And incomparably further than even the measureless circling of the glory of these he saw
584-47041-0023	train-other-500	made visible by a single ray of light that shot from the forehead of the Blessed One to pierce beyond uttermost Time the eighteen hundred thousand
none	none	 Buddha fields of the Eastern Quarter with all their habitants 
584-47041-0024	train-other-500	and the beings in each of the Six States of Existence and even the shapes of the Buddhas extinct that had entered into Nirvana These and all the gods
584-47041-0025	train-other-500	and all the demons he saw bow down before the Lion throne and he heard that multitude incalculable of beings praising the Sutra of the Lotos of the Good Law like the roar of a sea before the Lord
584-47041-0026	train-other-500	Then forgetting utterly his pledge foolishly dreaming that he stood in the very presence of the very Buddha he cast himself down in worship with tears of love and thanksgiving
584-47041-0027	train-other-500	crying out with a loud voice
none	none	 O thou Blessed One 
584-47041-0028	train-other-500	Instantly with a shock as of earthquake the stupendous spectacle disappeared and the priest found himself alone in the dark kneeling upon the grass of the mountain side
584-47041-0029	train-other-500	Then a sadness unspeakable fell upon him because of the loss of the vision
none	none	 and because of the thoughtlessness that had caused him to break his word As he sorrowfully turned his steps homeward the goblin monk once more appeared before him and said to him in tones of reproach and pain Because you did not keep the promise which you made to me 
584-47041-0030	train-other-500	and heedlessly allowed your feelings to overcome you the Gohotendo who is the Guardian of the Doctrine swooped down suddenly from heaven upon us
none	none	 and smote us in great anger 
584-47041-0031	train-other-500	crying out How do ye dare thus to deceive a pious person Then the other monks whom I had assembled all fled in fear As for myself one of my wings has been broken
584-47041-0032	train-other-500	so that now I cannot fly And with these words the Tengu vanished forever
none	none	 one 
584-47041-0033	train-other-500	This story may be found in the curious old Japanese book called Jikkun Sho The same legend has furnished the subject of an interesting No play called Dai E The Great Assembly
584-47041-0034	train-other-500	In Japanese popular art the Tengu are commonly represented either as winged men with beak shaped noses or as birds of prey
584-47041-0035	train-other-500	There are different kinds of Tengu but all are supposed to be mountain haunting spirits capable of assuming many forms and occasionally appearing as crows vultures or eagles
none	none	 Buddhism appears to class the Tengu among the Marakayikas At Yaidzu I Under a bright sun the old fishing town of Yaidzu has a particular charm of neutral color Lizard like it takes the grey tints of the rude grey coast on which it rests curving along a little bay It is sheltered from heavy seas by an extraordinary rampart of boulders This rampart on the water side is built in the form of terrace steps the rounded stones of which it is composed being kept in position by a sort of basket work woven between rows of stakes driven deeply into the ground a separate row of stakes sustaining each of the grades Looking landward from the top of the structure your gaze ranges over the whole town a broad space of grey tiled roofs and weather worn grey timbers with here and there a pine grove marking the place of a temple court Seaward over leagues of water there is a grand view a jagged blue range of peaks crowding sharply into the horizon like prodigious amethysts and beyond them to the left the glorious spectre of Fuji towering enormously above everything Between sea wall and sea there is no sand only a grey slope of stones chiefly boulders and these roll with the surf so that it is ugly work trying to pass the breakers on a rough day If you once get struck by a stone wave as I did several times you will not soon forget the experience At certain hours the greater part of this rough slope is occupied by ranks of strange looking craft fishing boats of a form peculiar to the locality They are very large capable of carrying forty or fifty men each and they have queer high prows to which Buddhist or Shinto charms mamori or shugo are usually attached A common form of Shinto written charm shugo is furnished for this purpose from the temple of the Goddess of Fuji the text reads Fuji san chojo Sengen gu dai gyo manzoku meaning that the owner of the boat pledges himself in case of good fortune at fishing to perform great austerities in honor of the divinity whose shrine is upon the summit of Fuji In every coast province of Japan and even at different fishing settlements of the same province the forms of boats and fishing implements are peculiar to the district or settlement Indeed it will sometimes be found that settlements within a few miles of each other respectively manufacture nets or boats as dissimilar in type as might be the inventions of races living thousands of miles apart This amazing variety may be in some degree due to respect for local tradition to the pious conservatism that preserves ancestral teaching and custom unchanged through hundreds of years but it is better explained by the fact that different communities practise different kinds of fishing and the shapes of the nets or the boats made at any one place are likely to prove on investigation the inventions of a special experience The big Yaidzu boats illustrate this fact They were devised according to the particular requirements of the Yaidzu fishing industry which supplies dried katsuo bonito to all parts of the Empire and it was necessary that they should be able to ride a very rough sea To get them in or out of the water is a heavy job but the whole village helps A kind of slipway is improvised in a moment by laying flat wooden frames on the slope in a line and over these frames the flat bottomed vessels are hauled up or down by means of long ropes You will see a hundred or more persons thus engaged in moving a single boat men women and children pulling together in time to a curious melancholy chant At the coming of a typhoon the boats are moved far back into the streets There is plenty of fun in helping at such work and if you are a stranger the fisher folk will perhaps reward your pains by showing you the wonders of their sea crabs with legs of astonishing length balloon fish that blow themselves up in the most absurd manner and various other creatures of shapes so extraordinary that you can scarcely believe them natural without touching them The big boats with holy texts at their prows are not the strangest objects on the beach Even more remarkable are the bait baskets of split bamboo baskets six feet high and eighteen feet round with one small hole in the dome shaped top Ranged along the sea wall to dry they might at some distance be mistaken for habitations or huts of some sort Then you see great wooden anchors shaped like ploughshares and shod with metal iron anchors with four flukes prodigious wooden mallets used for driving stakes and various other implements still more unfamiliar of which you cannot even imagine the purpose The indescribable antique queerness of everything gives you that weird sensation of remoteness of the far away in time and place which makes one doubt the reality of the visible And the life of Yaidzu is certainly the life of many centuries ago The people too are the people of Old Japan frank and kindly as children good children honest to a fault innocent of the further world loyal to the ancient traditions and the ancient gods II I happened to be at Yaidzu during the three days of the Bon or Festival of the Dead and I hoped to see the beautiful farewell ceremony of the third and last day In many parts of Japan the ghosts are furnished with miniature ships for their voyage little models of junks or fishing craft each containing offerings of food and water and kindled incense also a tiny lantern or lamp if the ghost ship be despatched at night But at Yaidzu lanterns only are set afloat and I was told that they would be launched after dark Midnight being the customary hour elsewhere I supposed that it was the hour of farewell at Yaidzu also and I rashly indulged in a nap after supper expecting to wake up in time for the spectacle But by ten o clock when I went to the beach again all was over and everybody had gone home Over the water I saw something like a long swarm of fire flies the lanterns drifting out to sea in procession but they were already too far to be distinguished except as points of colored light I was much disappointed I felt that I had lazily missed an opportunity which might never again return for these old Bon customs are dying rapidly But in another moment it occurred to me that I could very well venture to swim out to the lights They were moving slowly I dropped my robe on the beach and plunged in The sea was calm and beautifully phosphorescent Every stroke kindled a stream of yellow fire I swam fast and overtook the last of the lantern fleet much sooner than I had hoped I felt that it would be unkind to interfere with the little embarcations or to divert them from their silent course so I contented myself with keeping close to one of them and studying its details The structure was very simple The bottom was a piece of thick plank perfectly square and measuring about ten inches across Each one of its corners supported a slender slick about sixteen inches high and these four uprights united above by cross pieces sustained the paper sides Upon the point of a long nail driven up through the centre of the bottom was fixed a lighted candle The top was left open The four sides presented five different colors blue yellow red white and black these five colors respectively symbolizing Ether Wind Fire Water and Earth the five Buddhist elements which are metaphysically identified with the Five Buddhas One of the paper panes was red one blue one yellow and the right half of the fourth pane was black while the left half uncolored represented white No kaimyo was written upon any of the transparencies Inside the lantern there was only the flickering candle I watched those frail glowing shapes drifting through the night and ever as they drifted scattering under impulse of wind and wave more and more widely apart Each with its quiver of color seemed a life afraid trembling on the blind current that was bearing it into the outer blackness Are not we ourselves as lanterns launched upon a deeper and a dimmer sea and ever separating further and further one from another as we drift to the inevitable dissolution Soon the thought light in each burns itself out then the poor frames and all that is left of their once fair colors must melt forever into the colorless Void Even in the moment of this musing I began to doubt whether I was really alone to ask myself whether there might not be something more than a mere shuddering of light in the thing that rocked beside me some presence that haunted the dying flame and was watching the watcher A faint cold thrill passed over me perhaps some chill uprising from the depths perhaps the creeping only of a ghostly fancy Old superstitions of the coast recurred to me old vague warnings of peril in the time of the passage of Souls I reflected that were any evil to befall me out there in the night meddling or seeming to meddle with the lights of the Dead I should myself furnish the subject of some future weird legend I whispered the Buddhist formula of farewell to the lights and made speed for shore As I touched the stones again I was startled by seeing two white shadows before me but a kindly voice asking if the water was cold set me at ease It was the voice of my old landlord Otokichi the fishseller who had come to look for me accompanied by his wife Only pleasantly cool I made answer as I threw on my robe to go home with them Ah said the wife it is not good to go out there on the night of the Bon I did not go far I replied I only wanted to look at the lanterns Even a Kappa gets drowned sometimes one protested Otokichi There was a man of this village who swam home a distance of seven ri in bad weather after his boat had been broken But he was drowned afterwards Seven ri means a trifle less than eighteen miles I asked if any of the young men now in the settlement could do as much Probably some might the old man replied There are many strong swimmers All swim here even the little children But when fisher folk swim like that it is only to save their lives Or to make love the wife added like the Hashima girl Who queried I A fisherman s daughter said Otokichi She had a lover in Ajiro several ri distant and she used to swim to him at night and swim back in the morning He kept a light burning to guide her But one dark night the light was neglected or blown out and she lost her way and was drowned The story is famous in Idzu So I said to myself in the Far East it is poor Hero that does the swimming And what under such circumstances would have been the Western estimate of Leander one This is a common proverb Kappa mo obore shini The Kappa is a water goblin haunting rivers especially III Usually about the time of the Bon the sea gets rough and I was not surprised to find next morning that the surf was running high All day it grew By the middle of the afternoon the waves had become wonderful and I sat on the sea wall and watched them until sundown It was a long slow rolling massive and formidable Sometimes just before breaking a towering swell would crack all its green length with a tinkle as of shivering glass then would fall and flatten with a peal that shook the wall beneath me I thought of the great dead Russian general who made his army to storm as a sea wave upon wave of steel thunder following thunder There was yet scarcely any wind but there must have been wild weather elsewhere and the breakers were steadily heightening Their motion fascinated How indescribably complex such motion is yet how eternally new Who could fully describe even five minutes of it No mortal ever saw two waves break in exactly the same way And probably no mortal ever watched the ocean roll or heard its thunder without feeling serious I have noticed that even animals horses and cows become meditative in the presence of the sea they stand and stare and listen as if the sight and sound of that immensity made them forget all else in the world There is a folk saying of the coast The Sea has a soul and hears And the meaning is thus explained Never speak of your fear when you feel afraid at sea if you say that you are afraid the waves will suddenly rise higher Now this imagining seems to me absolutely natural I must confess that when I am either in the sea or upon it I cannot fully persuade myself that it is not alive a conscious and a hostile power Reason for the time being avails nothing against this fancy In order to be able to think of the sea as a mere body of water I must be upon some height from whence its heaviest billowing appears but a lazy creeping of tiny ripples But the primitive fancy may be roused even more strongly in darkness than by daylight How living seem the smoulderings and the flashings of the tide on nights of phosphorescence how reptilian the subtle shifting of the tints of its chilly flame Dive into such a night sea open your eyes in the black blue gloom and watch the weird gush of lights that follow your every motion each luminous point as seen through the flood like the opening and closing of an eye At such a moment one feels indeed as if enveloped by some monstrous sentiency suspended within some vital substance that feels and sees and wills alike in every part an infinite soft cold Ghost IV Long I lay awake that night and listened to the thunder rolls and crashings of the mighty tide Deeper than these distinct shocks of noise and all the storming of the nearer waves was the bass of the further surf a ceaseless abysmal muttering to which the building trembled a sound that seemed to imagination like the sound of the trampling of infinite cavalry the massing of incalculable artillery some rushing from the Sunrise of armies wide as the world Then I found myself thinking of the vague terror with which I had listened when a child to the voice of the sea and I remembered that in after years on different coasts in different parts of the world the sound of surf had always revived the childish emotion Certainly this emotion was older than I by thousands of thousands of centuries the inherited sum of numberless terrors ancestral But presently there came to me the conviction that fear of the sea alone could represent but one element of the multitudinous awe awakened by its voice For as I listened to that wild tide of the Suruga coast I could distinguish nearly every sound of fear known to man not merely noises of battle tremendous of interminable volleying of immeasurable charging but the roaring of beasts the crackling and hissing of fire the rumbling of earthquake the thunder of ruin and above all these a clamor continual as of shrieks and smothered shoutings the Voices that are said to be the voices of the drowned Awfulness supreme of tumult combining all imaginable echoings of fury and destruction and despair And to myself I said Is it wonderful that the voice of the sea should make us serious Consonantly to its multiple utterance must respond all waves of immemorial fear that move in the vaster sea of soul experience Deep calleth unto deep The visible abyss calls to that abyss invisible of elder being whose flood flow made the ghosts of us Wherefore there is surely more than a little truth in the ancient belief that the speech of the dead is the roar of the sea Truly the fear and the pain of the dead past speak to us in that dim deep awe which the roar of the sea awakens But there are sounds that move us much more profoundly than the voice of the sea can do and in stranger ways sounds that also make us serious at times and very serious sounds of music Great music is a psychical storm agitating to unimaginable depth the mystery of the past within us Or we might say that it is a prodigious incantation every different instrument and voice making separate appeal to different billions of prenatal memories There are tones that call up all ghosts of youth and joy and tenderness there are tones that evoke all phantom pain of perished passion there are tones that resurrect all dead sensations of majesty and might and glory all expired exultations all forgotten magnanimities Well may the influence of music seem inexplicable to the man who idly dreams that his life began less than a hundred years ago But the mystery lightens for whomsoever learns that the substance of Self is older than the sun He finds that music is a Necromancy he feels that to every ripple of melody to every billow of harmony there answers within him out of the Sea of Death and Birth some eddying immeasurable of ancient pleasure and pain Pleasure and pain they commingle always in great music and therefore it is that music can move us more profoundly than the voice of ocean or than any other voice can do But in music s larger utterance it is ever the sorrow that makes the undertone the surf mutter of the Sea of Soul Strange to think how vast the sum of joy and woe that must have been experienced before the sense of music could evolve in the brain of man Somewhere it is said that human life is the music of the Gods that its sobs and laughter its songs and shrieks and orisons its outcries of delight and of despair rise never to the hearing of the Immortals but as a perfect harmony Wherefore they could not desire to hush the tones of pain it would spoil their music The combination without the agony tones would prove a discord unendurable to ears divine And in one way we ourselves are as Gods since it is only the sum of the pains and the joys of past lives innumerable that makes for us through memory organic the ecstasy of music All the gladness and the grief of dead generations come back to haunt us in countless forms of harmony and of melody Even so a million years after we shall have ceased to view the sun will the gladness and the grief of our own lives pass with richer music into other hearts there to bestir for one mysterious moment some deep and exquisite thrilling of voluptuous pain End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of In Ghostly Japan by Lafcadio Hearn END OF THE PROJECT
