www pgdp net STUDIES IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX VOLUME II Sexual Inversion by HAVELOCK ELLIS nineteen twenty seven PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION It has been remarked by Professor Wilhelm Ostwald that the problem of homosexuality is a problem left over to us by the Middle Ages which for five hundred years dealt with inverts as it dealt with heretics and witches To regard the matter thus is to emphasize its social and humanitarian interest rather than its biological and psychological significance It is no doubt this human interest of the question of inversion rather than its scientific importance great as the latter is which is mainly responsible for the remarkable activity with which the study of homosexuality has been carried on during recent years The result has been that during the fourteen years that have passed since the last edition of this Study was issued so vast an amount of work has been carried on in this field that the preparation of a new edition of the book has been a long and serious task Nearly every page has been rewritten or enlarged and the Index of Authors consulted has more than doubled in length The original portions of the book have been still more changed sixteen new Histories have been added selected from others in my possession as being varied typical and full These extensive additions to the volume have rendered necessary various omissions Many of the shorter and less instructive Histories contained in earlier editions have been omitted as well as three Appendices which no longer seem of sufficient interest to retain In order to avoid undue increase in the size of this volume already much larger than in the previous editions a new Study of Eonism or sexo esthetic inversion will be inserted in vol v where it will perhaps be at least as much in place as here HAVELOCK ELLIS PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION It was not my intention to publish a study of an abnormal manifestation of the sexual instinct before discussing its normal manifestations It has happened however that this part of my work is ready first and since I thus gain a longer period to develop the central part of my subject I do not regret the change of plan I had not at first proposed to devote a whole volume to sexual inversion It may even be that I was inclined to slur it over as an unpleasant subject and one that it was not wise to enlarge on But I found in time that several persons for whom I felt respect and admiration were the congenital subjects of this abnormality At the same time I realized that in England more than in any other country the law and public opinion combine to place a heavy penal burden and a severe social stigma on the manifestations of an instinct which to those persons who possess it frequently appears natural and normal It was clear therefore that the matter was in special need of elucidation and discussion There can be no doubt that a peculiar amount of ignorance exists regarding the subject of sexual inversion I know medical men of many years general experience who have never to their knowledge come across a single case We may remember indeed that some fifteen years ago the total number of cases recorded in scientific literature scarcely equaled those of British race which I have obtained and that before my first cases were published not a single British case unconnected with the asylum or the prison had ever been recorded Probably not a very large number of people are even aware that the turning in of the sexual instinct toward persons of the same sex can ever be regarded as inborn so far as any sexual instinct is inborn And very few indeed would not be surprised if it were possible to publish a list of the names of sexually inverted men and women who at the present time are honorably known in church state society art or letters It could not be positively affirmed of all such persons that they were born inverted but in most the inverted tendency seems to be instinctive and appears at a somewhat early age In any case however it must be realized that in this volume we are not dealing with subjects belonging to the lunatic asylum or the prison We are concerned with individuals who live in freedom some of them suffering intensely from their abnormal organization but otherwise ordinary members of society In a few cases we are concerned with individuals whose moral or artistic ideals have widely influenced their fellows who know nothing of the peculiar organization which has largely molded those ideals I am indebted to several friends for notes observations and correspondence on this subject more especially to one referred to as Z and to another as Q who have obtained a considerable number of reliable histories for me and have also supplied many valuable notes to Josiah Flynt whose articles on tramps in Atlantic Monthly and Harper s Magazine have attracted wide attention for an appendix on

Human Races The Albanians The Greeks The Eskimos The Tribes of the Northwest United States Homosexuality Among Soldiers in Europe Indifference Frequently Manifested by European Lower Classes Sexual Inversion at Rome Homosexuality in Prisons Among Men of Exceptional Intellect and Moral Leaders Muret Michelangelo Winkelmann Homosexuality in English History Walt Whitman Verlaine Burton s Climatic Theory of Homosexuality The Racial Factor The Prevalence of Homosexuality Today Sexual inversion as here understood means sexual instinct turned by inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex It is thus a narrower term than homosexuality which includes all sexual attractions between persons of the same sex even when seemingly due to the accidental absence of the natural objects of sexual attraction a phenomenon of wide occurrence among all human races and among most of the higher animals It is only during recent years that sexual inversion has been recognized previously it was not distinguished from homosexuality in general and homosexuality was regarded as a national custom as an individual vice or as an unimportant episode in grave forms of insanity one We have further to distinguish sexual inversion and all other forms of homosexuality from another kind of inversion which usually remains so far as the sexual impulse itself is concerned heterosexual that is to say normal Inversion of this kind leads a person to feel like a person of the opposite sex and to adopt so far as possible the tastes habits and dress of the opposite sex while the direction of the sexual impulse remains normal This condition I term sexo esthetic inversion or Eonism The nomenclature of the highly important form of sexual perversion with which we are here concerned is extremely varied and most investigators have been much puzzled in coming to a conclusion as to the best most exact and at the same time most colorless names to apply to it The first in the field in modern times was Ulrichs who as early as eighteen sixty two used the appellation Uranian Uranier based on the well known myth in Plato s Banquet Later he Germanized this term into Urning for the male and Urningin for the female and referred to the condition itself as Urningtum He also invented a number of other related terms on the same basis some of these terms have had a considerable vogue but they are too fanciful and high strung to secure general acceptance If used in other languages than German they certainly should not be used in their Germanized shape and it is scarcely legitimate to use the term Urning in English Uranian is more correct In Germany the first term accepted by recognized scientific authorities was contrary sexual feeling Kontraere Sexualempfindung It was devised by Westphal in eighteen sixty nine and used by Krafft Ebing and Moll Though thus accepted by the earliest authorities in this field and to be regarded as a fairly harmless and vaguely descriptive term it is somewhat awkward and is now little used in Germany it was never currently used outside Germany It has been largely superseded by the term homosexuality This also was devised by a little known Hungarian doctor Benkert who used the pseudonym Kertbeny in the same year eighteen sixty nine but at first attracted no attention It has philologically the awkward disadvantage of being a bastard term compounded of Greek and Latin elements but its significance sexual attraction to the same sex is fairly clear and definite while it is free from any question begging association of either favorable or unfavorable character Edward Carpenter has proposed to remedy its bastardly linguistic character by transforming it into homogenic this however might mean not only toward the same sex but of the same kind and in German already possesses actually that meaning The term homosexual has the further advantage that on account of its classical origin it is easily translatable into many languages It is now the most widespread general term for the phenomena we are dealing with and it has been used by Hirschfeld now the chief authority in this field as the title of his encyclopedic work Die Homosexualitaet Sexual Inversion in French inversion sexuelle and in Italian inversione sessuale is the term which has from the first been chiefly used in France and Italy ever since Charcot and Magnan in eighteen eighty two published their cases of this anomaly in the Archives de Neurologie It had already been employed in Italy by Tamassia in the Revista Sperimentale di Freniatria in eighteen seventy eight I have not discovered when and where the term sexual inversion was first used Possibly it first appeared in English for long before the paper of Charcot and Magnan I have noticed in an anonymous review of Westphal s first paper in the Journal of Mental Science then edited by doctor Maudsley for October eighteen seventy one that Contraere Sexualempfindung is translated as inverted sexual proclivity So far as I am aware sexual inversion was first used in English as the best term by J A Symonds in eighteen eighty three in his privately printed essay A Problem in Greek Ethics Later in eighteen ninety seven the same term was adopted I believe for the first time publicly in English in the present work It is unnecessary to refer to the numerous other names which have been proposed A discussion of the nomenclature will be found in the first chapter of Hirschfeld s work Die Homosexualitaet and of some special terms in an article by Schouten Sexual Probleme December nineteen twelve It may suffice to mention the ancient theological and legal term sodomy sodomia because it is still the most popular term for this perversion though it must be remembered it has become attached to the physical act of intercourse per anum even when carried out heterosexually and has little reference to psychic sexual proclivity This term has its origin in the story narrated in Genesis ch xix of Lot s visitors whom the men of Sodom desired to have intercourse with and of the subsequent destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah This story furnishes a sufficiently good ground for the use of the term though the Jews do not regard sodomy as the sin of Sodom but rather inhospitality and hardness of heart to the poor J Preuss Biblisch Talmudische Medizin pp five hundred seventy nine eighty one and Christian theologians also both Catholic and Protestant see e g Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol iv p one hundred ninety nine and Hirschfeld Homosexualitaet p seven hundred forty two have argued that it was not homosexuality but their other offenses which provoked the destruction of the Cities of the Plain In Germany sodomy has long been used to denote bestiality or sexual intercourse with animals but this use of the term is quite unjustified In English there is another term buggery identical in meaning with sodomy and equally familiar Bugger in French bougre is a corruption of Bulgar the ancient Bulgarian heretics having been popularly supposed to practise this perversion The people of every country have always been eager to associate sexual perversions with some other country than their own The terms usually adopted in the present volume are sexual inversion and homosexuality The first is used more especially to indicate that the sexual impulse is organically and innately turned toward individuals of the same sex The second is used more comprehensively of the general phenomena of sexual attraction between persons of the same sex even if only of a slight and temporary character It may be admitted that there is no precise warrant for any distinction of this kind between the two terms The distinction in the phenomena is however still generally recognized thus Iwan Bloch applies the term homosexuality to the congenital form and pseudo homosexuality to its spurious or simulated forms Those persons who are attracted to both sexes are now usually termed bisexual a more convenient term than psycho sexual hermaphrodite which was formerly used There remains the normal person who is heterosexual Before approaching the study of sexual inversion in cases which we may investigate with some degree of scientific accuracy there is interest in glancing briefly at the phenomena as they appear before us as yet scarcely or at all differentiated among animals among various human races and at various periods Among animals in a domesticated or confined state it is easy to find evidence of homosexual attraction due merely to the absence of the other sex two This was known to the ancients the Egyptians regarded two male partridges as the symbol of homosexuality and Aristotle noted that two female pigeons would cover each other if no male was at hand Buffon observed many examples especially among birds He found that if male or female birds of various species such as partridges fowls and doves were shut up together they would soon begin to have sexual relations among themselves the males sooner and more frequently than the females More recently Sainte Claire Deville observed that dogs rams and bulls when isolated first became restless and dangerous and then acquired a permanent state of sexual excitement not obeying the laws of heat and leading them to attempts to couple together the presence of the opposite sex at once restored them to normal conditions three Bombarda of Lisbon states that in Portugal it is well known that in every herd of bulls there is nearly always one bull who is ready to lend himself to the perverted whims of his companions four It may easily be observed how a cow in heat exerts an exciting influence on other cows impelling them to attempt to play the bull s part Lacassagne has also noted among young fowls and puppies et cetera that before ever having had relations with the opposite sex and while in complete liberty they make hesitating attempts at intercourse with their own sex five This indeed together with similar perversions may often be observed especially in puppies who afterward become perfectly normal Among white rats which are very sexual animals Steinach found that when deprived of females the males practise homosexuality though only with males with whom they have long associated the weaker rats play the passive part But when a female is introduced they immediately turn to her although they are occasionally altogether indifferent to sex they never actually prefer their own sex six With regard to the playing of the female part by the weaker rats it is interesting to observe that Fere found among insects that the passive part in homosexual relations is favored by fatigue among cockchafers it was the male just separated from the female who would take the passive part on the rare occasions when homosexual relations occurred with a fresh male seven Homosexuality appears to be specially common among birds It was among birds that it attracted the attention of the ancients and numerous interesting observations have been made in more recent times Thus Selous a careful bird watcher finds that the ruff the male of the Machetes pugnax suffers from sexual repression owing to the coyness of the female the reeve and consequently the males often resort to homosexual intercourse It is still more remarkable that the reeves also even in the presence of the males will court each other and have intercourse eight We may associate this with the high erotic development of birds the difficulty with which tumescence seems to occur in them and their long courtships Among the higher animals again female monkeys even when grown up as Moll was informed behave in a sexual way to each other though it is difficult to say how far this is merely in play doctor Seitz Director of the Frankfurt Zooelogical Garden gave Moll a record of his own careful observations of homosexual phenomena among the males and females of various animals confined in the Garden Antelope cervicapra Bos Indicus Capra hircus Ovis steatopyga nine In all such cases we are not concerned with sexual inversion but merely with the accidental turning of the sexual instinct into an abnormal channel the instinct being called out by an approximate substitute or even by diffused emotional excitement in the absence of the normal object It is probable however that cases of true sexual inversion in which gratification is preferably sought in the same sex may be found among animals although observations have rarely been made or recorded It has been found by Muccioli an Italian authority on pigeons that among Belgian carrier pigeons inverted practices may occur even in the presence of many of the other sex ten This seems to be true inversion though we are not told whether these birds were also attracted toward the opposite sex The birds of this family appear to be specially liable to sexual perversion Thus M J Bailly Maitre a breeder of great knowledge and a keen observer wrote to Girard that they are strange creatures in their manners and customs and are apt to elude the most persistent observer No animal is more depraved Mating between males and still more frequently between females often occurs at an early age up to the second year I have had several pairs of pigeons formed by subjects of the same sex who for many months behaved as if the mating were natural In some cases this had taken place among young birds of the same nest who acted like real mates though both subjects were males In order to mate them productively we have had to separate them and shut each of them up for some days with a female eleven In the Berlin Zooelogical Gardens also it has been noticed that two birds of the same sex will occasionally become attached to each other and remain so in spite of repeated advances from individuals of opposite sex This occurred for instance in the case of two males of the Egyptian goose who were thus to all appearance paired and always kept together vigorously driving away any female that approached Similarly a male Australian sheldrake was paired to a male of another species twelve Among birds generally inverted sexuality seems to accompany the development of the secondary sexual characters of the opposite sex which is sometimes found Thus a poultry breeder describes a hen colored Dorking crowing like a cock only somewhat more harshly as a cockerel crows and with an enormous comb larger than is ever seen in the male This bird used to try to tread her fellow hens At the same time she laid early and regularly and produced grand chickens thirteen Among ducks also it has occasionally been observed that the female assumes at the same time both male livery and male sexual tendencies It is probable that such observations will be multiplied in the future and that sexual inversion in the true sense will be found commoner among animals than at present it appears to be Traces of homosexual practices sometimes on a large scale have been found among all the great divisions of the human race It would be possible to collect a considerable body of evidence under this head fourteen Unfortunately however the travellers and others on whose records we are dependent have been so shy of touching these subjects and so ignorant of the main points for investigation that it is very difficult to discover sexual inversion in the proper sense in any lower race Travellers have spoken vaguely of crimes against nature without defining the precise relationship involved nor inquiring how far any congenital impulse could be distinguished Looking at the phenomena generally so far as they have been recorded among various lower races we seem bound to recognize that there is a widespread natural instinct impelling men toward homosexual relationships and that this has been sometimes though very exceptionally seized upon and developed for advantageous social purposes On the whole however unnatural intercourse sodomy has been regarded as an antisocial offense and punishable sometimes by the most serious penalties that could be invented This was for instance the case in ancient Mexico in Peru among the Persians in China and among the Hebrews and Mohammedans Even in very early history it is possible to find traces of homosexuality with or without an implied disapproval Its existence in Assyria and Babylonia is indicated by the Codex Hamurabi and by inscriptions which do not on the whole refer to it favorably fifteen As regards Egypt we learn from a Fayum papyrus found by Flinders Petrie translated by Griffiths and discussed by Oefele sixteen that more than four thousand years ago homosexual practices were so ancient that they were attributed to the gods Horus and Set The Egyptians showed great admiration of masculine beauty and it would seem that they never regarded homosexuality as punishable or even reprehensible It is notable also that Egyptian women were sometimes of very virile type and Hirschfeld considers that intermediate sexual types were specially widespread among the Egyptians seventeen One might be tempted to expect that homosexual practices would be encouraged whenever it was necessary to keep down the population Aristotle says that it was allowed by law in Crete for this end And Professor Haddon tells me that at Torres Straits a native advocated sodomy on this ground eighteen There seems however on the whole to be little evidence pointing to this utilization of the practice The homosexual tendency appears to have flourished chiefly among warriors and warlike peoples During war and the separation from women that war involves the homosexual instinct tends to develop it flourished for instance among the Carthaginians and among the Normans as well as among the warlike Dorians Scythians Tartars and Celts nineteen and when there has been an absence of any strong moral feeling against it the instinct has been cultivated and idealized as a military virtue partly because it counteracts the longing for the softening feminine influences of the home and partly because it seems to have an inspiring influence in promoting heroism and heightening esprit de corps In the lament of David over Jonathan we have a picture of intimate friendship passing the love of women between comrades in arms among a barbarous warlike race There is nothing to show that such a relationship was sexual but among warriors in New Caledonia friendships that were undoubtedly homosexual were recognized and regulated the fraternity of arms according to Foley twenty complicated with pederasty was more sacred than uterine fraternity We have moreover a recent example of the same relationships recognized in a modern European race the Albanians Hahn in the course of his Albanische Studien eighteen fifty four p one hundred sixty six says that the young men between sixteen and twenty four lore boys from about twelve to seventeen A Gege marries at the age of twenty four or twenty five and then he usually but not always gives up boy love The following passage is reported by Hahn as the actual language used to him by an Albanian Gege The lover s feeling for the boy is pure as sunshine It places the beloved on the same pedestal as a saint It is the highest and most exalted passion of which the human breast is capable The sight of a beautiful youth awakens astonishment in the lover and opens the door of his heart to the delight which the contemplation of this loveliness affords Love takes possession of him so completely that all his thought and feeling goes out in it If he finds himself in the presence of the beloved he rests absorbed in gazing on him Absent he thinks of nought but him If the beloved unexpectedly appears he falls into confusion changes color turns alternately pale and red His heart beats faster and impedes his breathing He has ears and eyes only for the beloved He shuns touching him with the hand kisses him only on the forehead sings his praise in verse a woman s never One of these love poems of an Albanian Gege runs as follows The sun when it rises in the morning is like you boy when you are near me When your dark eye turns upon me it drives my reason from my head It should be added that Prof Weigand who knew the Albanians well assured Bethe Rheinisches Museum fuer Philologie nineteen oh seven p four hundred seventy five that the relations described by Hahn are really sexual although tempered by idealism A German scholar who travelled in Albania some years ago also assured Naecke Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol ix nineteen oh eight p three hundred twenty seven that he could fully confirm Hahn s statements and that though it was difficult to speak positively he doubted whether these relationships were purely ideal While most prevalent among the Moslems they are also found among the Christians and receive the blessing of the priest in church Jealousy is frequently aroused the same writer remarks and even murder may be committed on account of a boy It may be mentioned here that among the Tschuktsches Kamschatdals and allied peoples according to a Russian anthropological journal quoted in Sexual Probleme January nineteen thirteen p forty one there are homosexual marriages among the men and occasionally among the women ritually consecrated and openly recognized The Albanians it is possible belonged to the same stock which produced the Dorian Greeks and the most important and the most thoroughly known case of socially recognized homosexuality is that of Greece during its period of highest military as well as ethical and intellectual vigor In this case as in those already mentioned the homosexual tendency was frequently regarded as having beneficial results which caused it to be condoned if not indeed fostered as a virtue Plutarch repeated the old Greek statement that the Beotians the Lacedemonians and the Cretans were the most warlike stocks because they were the strongest in love an army composed of loving homosexual couples it was held would be invincible It appears that the Dorians introduced paiderastia as the Greek form of homosexuality is termed into Greece they were the latest invaders a vigorous mountain race from the northwest the region including what is now Albania who spread over the whole land the islands and Asia Minor becoming the ruling race Homosexuality was of course known before they came but they made it honorable Homer never mentions it and it was not known as legitimate to the AEolians or the Ionians Bethe who has written a valuable study of Dorian paiderastia states that the Dorians admitted a kind of homosexual marriage and even had a kind of boy marriage by capture the scattered vestiges of this practice indicating Bethe believes that it was a general custom among the Dorians before the invasion of Greece Such unions even received a kind of religions consecration It was moreover shameful for a noble youth in Crete to have no lover it spoke ill for his character By paiderastia a man propagated his virtues as it were in the youth he loved implanting them by the act of intercourse In its later Greek phases paiderastia was associated less with war than with athletics it was refined and intellectualized by poetry and philosophy It cannot be doubted that both AEschylus and Sophocles cultivated boy love while its idealized presentation in the dialogues of Plato has caused it to be almost identified with his name thus in the early Charmides we have an attractive account of the youth who gives his name to the dialogue and the emotions he excites are described But even in the early dialogues Plato only conditionally approved of the sexual side of paiderastia and he condemned it altogether in the final Laws twenty one The early stages of Greek paiderastia are very interestingly studied by Bethe Die Dorische Knabenliebe Rheinisches Museum fuer Philologie nineteen oh seven J A Symonds s essay on the later aspects of paiderastia especially as reflected in Greek literature A Problem in Greek Ethics is contained in the early German edition of the present study but though privately printed in eighteen eighty three by the author in an edition of twelve copies and since pirated in another private edition it has not yet been published in English Paiderastia in Greek poetry has also been studied by Paul Brandt Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vols viii and ix nineteen oh six and nineteen oh seven and by Otto Knapp Anthropophyteia vol iii pp two hundred fifty four two hundred sixty who seeks to demonstrate the sensual side of paiderastia On the other hand Licht working on somewhat the same lines as Bethe Zeitschrift fuer Sexualwissenschaft August nineteen oh eight deals with the ethical element in paiderastia points out its beneficial moral influence and argues that it was largely on this ground that it was counted sacred Licht has also published a learned study of paiderastia in Attic comedy Anthropophyteia vol vii nineteen ten and remarks that without paiderastia Greek comedy is unthinkable Paiderastia in the Greek anthology has been fully explored by P Stephanus Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol ix nineteen oh eight p two hundred thirteen Kiefer who has studied Socrates in relation to homosexuality O Kiefer Socrates und die Homosexualitaet Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol ix nineteen oh eight concludes that he was bisexual but that his sexual impulses had been sublimated It may be added that many results of recent investigation concerning paiderastia are summarized by Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet pp seven hundred forty seven seven hundred eighty eight and by Edward Carpenter Intermediate Types Among Primitive Folk nineteen fourteen part ii see also Bloch Die Prostitution vol i p two hundred thirty two et seq and Der Ursprung der Syphilis vol ii p five hundred sixty four It would appear that almost the only indications outside Greece of paiderastic homosexuality showing a high degree of tenderness and esthetic feeling are to be found in Persian and Arabian literature after the time of the Abbasids although this practice was forbidden by the Koran twenty two In Constantinople as Naecke was informed by German inverts living in that city homosexuality is widespread most cultivated Turks being capable of relations with boys as well as with women though very few are exclusively homosexual so that their attitude would seem to be largely due to custom and tradition Adult males rarely have homosexual relations together one of the couple is usually a boy of twelve to eighteen years and this condition of things among the refined classes is said to resemble ancient Greek paiderastia But ordinary homosexual prostitution is prevalent it is especially recognized in the baths which abound in Constantinople and are often open all night The attendants at these baths are youths who scarcely need an invitation to induce them to gratify the client in this respect the gratification usually consisting in masturbation mutual or one sided as desired The practice though little spoken of is carried on almost openly and blackmailing is said to be unknown twenty three In the New Turkey however it is stated by Adler Bey that homosexual prostitution has almost disappeared twenty four There is abundant evidence to show that homosexual practices exist and have long existed in most parts of the world outside Europe when subserving no obvious social or moral end How far they are associated with congenital inversion is usually very doubtful In China for instance it seems that there are special houses devoted to male prostitution though less numerous than the houses devoted to females for homosexuality cannot be considered common in China its prevalence among Chinese abroad being due to the absence of women and it is chiefly found in the north twenty five When a rich man gives a feast he sends for women to cheer the repast by music and song and for boys to serve at table and to entertain the guests by their lively conversation The boys have been carefully brought up for this occupation receiving an excellent education and their mental qualities are even more highly valued than their physical attractiveness The women are less carefully brought up and less esteemed After the meal the lads usually return home with a considerable fee What further occurs the Chinese say little about It seems that real and deep affection is often born of these relations at first platonic but in the end becoming physical not a matter for great concern in the eyes of the Chinese In the Chinese novels often of a very literary character devoted to masculine love it seems that all the preliminaries and transports of normal love are to be found while physical union may terminate the scene In China however the law may be brought into action for attempts against nature even with mutual consent the penalty is one hundred strokes with the bamboo and a month s imprisonment if there is violence the penalty is decapitation I am not able to say how far the law is a dead letter According to Matignon so far as homosexuality exists in China it is carried on with much more decorum and restraint than it is in Europe and he thinks it may be put down to the credit of the Chinese that unlike Europeans they never practice unnatural connection with women His account of the customs of the Chinese confirms Morache s earlier account and he remarks that though not much spoken of homosexuality is not looked down upon He gives some interesting details concerning the boy prostitutes These are sold by their parents sometimes stolen from them about the age of four and educated while they are also subjected to a special physical training which includes massage of the gluteal regions to favor development dilatation of the anus and epilation which is not however practised by Chinese women At the same time they are taught music singing drawing and the art of poetry The waiters at the restaurants always know where these young gentlemen are to be found when they are required to grace a rich man s feast They are generally accompanied by a guardian and usually nothing very serious takes place for they know their value and money will not always buy their expensive favors They are very effeminate luxuriously dressed and perfumed and they seldom go on foot There are however lower orders of such prostitutes twenty six Homosexuality is easily traceable in India Dubois referred to houses devoted to male prostitution with men dressed as women and imitating the ways of women twenty seven Burton in the Terminal Essay to his translation of the Arabian Nights states that when in eighteen forty five Sir Charles Napier conquered and annexed Sind three brothels of eunuchs and boys were found in the small town of Karachi and Burton was instructed to visit and report on them Hindus in general however it appears hold homosexuality in abhorrence In Afghanistan homosexuality is more generally accepted and Burton stated that each caravan is accompanied by a number of boys and lads almost in woman s attire with kohled eyes and rouged cheeks long tresses and hennaed fingers and toes riding luxuriously in camel paniers If we turn to the New World we find that among the American Indians from the Eskimo of Alaska downward to Brazil and still farther south homosexual customs have been very frequently observed Sometimes they are regarded by the tribe with honor sometimes with indifference sometimes with contempt but they appear to be always tolerated Although there are local differences these customs on the whole seem to have much in common The best early description which I have been able to find is by Langsdorff twenty eight and concerns the Aleuts of Oonalashka in Alaska Boys if they happen to be very handsome he says are often brought up entirely in the manner of girls and instructed in the arts women use to please men their beards are carefully plucked out as soon as they begin to appear and their chins tattooed like those of women they wear ornaments of glass beads upon their legs and arms bind and cut their hair in the same manner as the women and supply their place with the men as concubines This shocking unnatural and immoral practice has obtained here even from the remotest times nor have any measures hitherto been taken to repress and restrain it such men are known under the name of schopans Among the Konyagas Langsdorff found the custom much more common than among the Aleuts he remarks that although the mothers brought up some of their children in this way they seemed very fond of their offspring Lisiansky at about the same period tells us that Of all the customs of these islanders the most disgusting is that of men called schoopans living with men and supplying the place of women These are brought up from their infancy with females and taught all the feminine arts They even assume the manner and dress of the women so nearly that a stranger would naturally take them for what they are not This odious practice was formerly so prevalent that the residence of one of these monsters in a house was considered as fortunate it is however daily losing ground twenty nine He mentions a case in which a priest had nearly married two males when an interpreter chanced to come in and was able to inform him what he was doing The practice has however apparently continued to be fairly common among the Alaska Eskimos down to recent times Thus doctor Engelmann mentioned to me that he was informed by those who had lived in Alaska especially near Point Barrow that as many as five such individuals regarded by uninstructed strangers as hermaphrodites might be found in a single comparatively small community It is stated by Davydoff as quoted by Holmberg thirty that the boy is selected to be a schopan because he is girl like This is a point of some interest as it indicates that the schopan is not effeminated solely by suggestion and association but is probably feminine by inborn constitution In Louisiana Florida Yucatan et cetera somewhat similar customs exist or have existed In Brazil men are to be found dressed as women and solely occupying themselves with feminine occupations they are not very highly regarded thirty one They are called cudinas i e circumcized Among the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico these individuals are called mujerados supposed to be a corruption of mujeriego and are the chief passive agents in the homosexual ceremonies of these people They are said to be intentionally effeminated in early life by much masturbation and by constant horse riding thirty two Among all the tribes of the northwest United States sexual inverts may be found The invert is called a bote not man not woman by the Montana and a burdash half man half woman by the Washington Indians The bote has been carefully studied by doctor A B Holder thirty three Holder finds that the bote wears woman s dress and that his speech and manners are feminine The dress and manners are assumed in childhood but no sexual practices take place until puberty These consist in the practice of fellatio by the bote who probably himself experiences the orgasm at the same time The bote is not a pederast although pederasty occurs among these Indians Holder examined bote who was splendidly made prepossessing and in perfect health With much reluctance he agreed to a careful examination The sexual organs were quite normal though perhaps not quite so large as his physique would suggest but he had never had intercourse with a woman On removing his clothes he pressed his thighs together as a timid woman would so as to conceal completely the sexual organs Holder says that the thighs really or to my fancy had the feminine rotundity He has heard a bote beg a male Indian to submit to his caress and he tells that one little fellow while in the agency boarding school was found frequently surreptitiously wearing female attire He was punished but finally escaped from school and became a bote which vocation he has since followed At Tahiti at the beginning of the nineteenth century Turnbull thirty four found that there are a set of men in this country whose open profession is of such abomination that the laudable delicacy of our language will not admit it to be mentioned These are called by the natives Mahoos they assume the dress attitude and manners of women and affect all the fantastic oddities and coquetries of the vainest of females They mostly associate with the women who court their acquaintance With the manners of the women they adopt their peculiar employments making cloth bonnets and mats and so completely are they unsexed that had they not been pointed out to me I should not have known them but as women I add with some satisfaction that the encouragement of this abomination is almost solely confined to the chiefs Among the Sakalaves of Madagascar there are certain boys called sekatra as described by Lasnet who are apparently chosen from childhood on account of weak or delicate appearance and brought up as girls They live like women and have intercourse with men with or without sodomy paying the men who please them thirty five Among the negro population of Zanzibar forms of homosexuality which are believed to be congenital as well as acquired forms are said to be fairly common Their frequency is thought to be due to Arab influence The male congenital inverts show from their earliest years no aptitude for men s occupations but are attracted toward female occupations As they grow older they wear women s clothes dress their hair in women s fashion and behave altogether like women They associate only with women and with male prostitutes and they obtain sexual satisfaction by passive pederasty or in ways simulating coitus In appearance they resemble ordinary male prostitutes who are common in Zanzibar but it is noteworthy that the natives make a clear distinction between them and men prostitutes The latter are looked down on with contempt while the former as being what they are by the will of God are tolerated thirty six Homosexuality occurs in various parts of Africa Cases of effeminatio and passive sodomy have been reported from Unyamwezi and Uganda Among the Bangala of the Upper Congo sodomy between men is very common especially when they are away from home in strange towns or in fishing camps If however a man had intercourse with a woman per anum he was at one time liable to be put to death thirty seven Among the Papuans in some parts of New Guinea as already mentioned homosexuality is said to be well recognized and is resorted to for convenience as well perhaps as for Malthusian reasons thirty eight But in the Rigo district of British New Guinea where habitual sodomy is not practised doctor Seligmann of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits made some highly important observations on several men and women who clearly appeared to be cases of congenital sexual inversion with some degree of esthetic inversion and even some anatomical modification thirty nine These people it may be noted belong to a primitive race uncontaminated by contact with white races and practically still in the Stone Age Finally among another allied primitive people the Australians it would appear that homosexuality has long been well established in tribal customs Among the natives of Kimberley Western Australia who are by no means of low type quick and intelligent with special aptitudes for learning languages and music if a wife is not obtainable for a young man he is presented with a boy wife between the ages of five and ten the age when a boy receives his masculine initiation The exact nature of the relations between the boy wife and his protector are doubtful they certainly have connection but the natives repudiate with horror and disgust the idea of sodomy forty Further light is thrown on homosexuality in Australia by the supposition of Spencer and Gillen that the mika operation urethral subincision an artificial hypospadias is for the purpose of homosexual intercourse Klaatsch has discussed the homosexual origin of the mika operation on the basis of information he received from missionaries at Niol Niol on the northwest coast The subincised man acts as a female to the as yet unoperated boys who perform coitus in the incised opening Both informed Klaatsch in nineteen oh six that at Boulia in Queensland the operated men are said to possess a vulva forty one These various accounts are of considerable interest though for the most part their precise significance remains doubtful Some of them however such as Holder s description of the bote Baumann s account of homosexual phenomena in Zanzibar and especially Seligmann s observations in British New Guinea indicate not only the presence of esthetic inversion but of true congenital sexual inversion The extent of the evidence will doubtless be greatly enlarged as the number of competent observers increases and crucial points are no longer so frequently overlooked On the whole the evidence shows that among lower races homosexual practices are regarded with considerable indifference and the real invert if he exists among them as doubtless he does exist generally passes unperceived or joins some sacred caste which sanctifies his exclusively homosexual inclinations Even in Europe today a considerable lack of repugnance to homosexual practices may be found among the lower classes In this matter as folklore shows in so many other matters the uncultured man of civilization is linked to the savage In England I am told the soldier often has little or no objection to prostitute himself to the swell who pays him although for pleasure he prefers to go to women and Hyde Park is spoken of as a center of male prostitution Among the working masses of England and Scotland Q writes comradeship is well marked though not as in Italy very conscious of itself Friends often kiss each other though this habit seems to vary a good deal in different sections and coteries Men commonly sleep together whether comrades or not and so easily get familiar Occasionally but not so very often this relation delays for a time or even indefinitely actual marriage and in some instances is highly passionate and romantic There is a good deal of grossness no doubt here and there in this direction among the masses but there are no male prostitutes that I am aware of whose regular clients are manual workers This kind of prostitution in London is common enough but I have only a slight personal knowledge of it Many youths are kept handsomely in apartments by wealthy men and they are of course not always inaccessible to others Many keep themselves in lodgings by this means and others eke out scanty wages by the same device just like women in fact Choirboys reinforce the ranks to a considerable extent and private soldiers to a large extent Some of the barracks notably Knightsbridge are great centres On summer evenings Hyde Park and the neighborhood of Albert Gate is full of guardsmen and others plying a lively trade and with little disguise in uniform or out In these cases it sometimes only amounts to a chat on a retired seat or a drink at a bar sometimes recourse is had to a room in some known lodging house or to one or two hotels which lend themselves to this kind of business In any case it means a covetable addition to Tommy Atkins s pocket money And mister Raffalovich speaking of London remarks The number of soldiers who prostitute themselves is greater than we are willing to believe It is no exaggeration to say that in certain regiments the presumption is in favor of the venality of the majority of the men It is worth noting that there is a perfect understanding in this matter between soldiers and the police who may always be relied upon by the former for assistance and advice I am indebted to my correspondent Z for the following notes Soldiers are no less sought after in France than in England or in Germany and special houses exist for military prostitution both in Paris and the garrison towns Many facts known about the French army go to prove that these habits have been contracted in Algeria and have spread to a formidable extent through whole regiments The facts related by Ulrichs about the French foreign legion on the testimony of a credible witness who had been a pathic in his regiment deserve attention Ara Spei p twenty Memnon p twenty seven This man who was a German told Ulrichs that the Spanish French and Italian soldiers were the lovers the Swiss and German their beloved see also General Brossier s Report quoted by Burton Arabian Nights vol x p two hundred fifty one In Lucien Descaves s military novel Sous Offs Paris Tresse et Stock eighteen ninety some details are given regarding establishments for male prostitution See pages three hundred twenty two four hundred twelve and four hundred seventeen for description of the drinking shop called Aux Amis de l Armee where a few maids were kept for show and also of its frequenters including in particular the Adjutant Laprevotte Ulrichs reports that in the Austrian army lectures on homosexual vices are regularly given to cadets and conscripts Memnon p twenty six A soldier who had left the army told a friend of mine that he and many of his comrades had taken to homosexual indulgences when abroad on foreign service in a lonely station He kept the practice up in England because the women of his class were so unattractive The captain of an English man of war said that he was always glad to send his men on shore after a long cruise at sea never feeling sure how far they might not all go if left without women for a certain space of time I may add that A Hamon La France Sociale et Politique eighteen ninety one pp six hundred fifty three fifty five also in his Psychologie du Militaire Professional chapter x gives details as to the prevalence of homosexuality in the French army especially in Algeria he regards it as extremely common although the majority are free A fragment of a letter by General Lamoriciere speaking of Marshal Changarnier is quoted En Afrique nous en etions tous mais lui en est reste ici This primitive indifference is doubtless also a factor in the prevalence of homosexuality among criminals although here it must be remembered two other factors congenital abnormality and the isolation of imprisonment have to be considered In Russia Tarnowsky observes that all pederasts are agreed that the common people are tolerably indifferent to their sexual advances which they call gentlemen s games A correspondent remarks on the fact patent to all observers that simple folk not infrequently display no greater disgust for the abnormalities of sexual appetite than they do for its normal manifestations forty two He knows of many cases in which men of lower class were flattered and pleased by the attentions of men of higher class although not themselves inverted And from this point of view the following case which he mentions is very instructive A pervert whom I can trust told me that he had made advances to upward of one hundred men in the course of the last fourteen years and that he had only once met with a refusal in which case the man later on offered himself spontaneously and only once with an attempt to extort money Permanent relations of friendship sprang up in most instances He admitted that he looked after these persons and helped them with his social influence and a certain amount of pecuniary support setting one up in business giving another something to marry on and finding places for others Among the peasantry in Switzerland I am informed homosexual relationships are not uncommon before marriage and such relationships are lightly spoken of as Dummheiten No doubt similar traits might be found in the peasantry of other parts of Europe What may be regarded as true sexual inversion can be traced in Europe from the beginning of the Christian era though we can scarcely demonstrate the congenital element especially among two classes men of exceptional ability and criminals and also it may be added among those neurotic and degenerate individuals who may be said to lie between these two classes and on or over the borders of both Homosexuality mingled with various other sexual abnormalities and excesses seems to have flourished in Rome during the empire and is well exemplified in the persons of many of the emperors forty three Julius Caesar Augustus Tiberius Caligula Claudius Nero Galba Titus Domitian Nerva Trajan Hadrian Commodus and Heliogabalus many of them men of great ability and from a Roman standpoint great moral worth are all charged on more or less solid evidence with homosexual practices In Julius Caesar the husband of all women and the wife of all men as he was satirically termed excess of sexual activity seems to have accompanied as is sometimes seen an excess of intellectual activity He was first accused of homosexual practices after a long stay in Bithynia with King Nikomedes and the charge was very often renewed Caesar was proud of his physical beauty and like some modern inverts he was accustomed carefully to shave and epilate his body to preserve the smoothness of the skin Hadrian s love for his beautiful slave Antinoues is well known the love seems to have been deep and mutual and Antinoues has become immortalized partly by the romance of his obscure death and partly by the new and strangely beautiful type which he has given to sculpture forty four Heliogabalus the most homosexual of all the company as he has been termed seems to have been a true sexual invert of feminine type he dressed as a woman and was devoted to the men he loved forty five Homosexual practices everywhere flourish and abound in prisons There is abundant evidence on this point I will only bring forward the evidence of doctor Wey formerly physician to the Elmira Reformatory New York Sexuality he wrote in a private letter is one of the most troublesome elements with which we have to contend I have no data as to the number of prisoners here who are sexually perverse In my pessimistic moments I should feel like saying that all were but probably eighty per cent would be a fair estimate And referring to the sexual influence which some men have over others he remarks that there are many men with features suggestive of femininity that attract others to them in a way that reminds me of a bitch in heat followed by a pack of dogs forty six In Sing Sing prison of New York twenty per cent of the prisoners are said to be actively homosexual and a large number of the rest passively homosexual These prison relationships are not always of a brutal character McMurtrie states the attraction sometimes being more spiritual than physical forty seven Prison life develops and fosters the homosexual tendency of criminals but there can be little doubt that that tendency or else a tendency to sexual indifference or bisexuality is a radical character of a very large number of criminals We may also find it to a considerable extent among tramps an allied class of undoubted degenerates who save for brief seasons are less familiar with prison life I am able to bring forward interesting evidence on this point by an acute observer who lived much among tramps in various countries and largely devoted himself to the study of them forty eight The fact that homosexuality is especially common among men of exceptional intellect was long since noted by Dante In somma sappi che tutti fur cherci E litterati grandi et di gran fama D un medismo peccato al mondo lerci forty nine It has often been noted since and remains a remarkable fact There cannot be the slightest doubt that intellectual and artistic abilities of the highest order have frequently been associated with a congenitally inverted sexual temperament There has been a tendency among inverts themselves to discover their own temperament in many distinguished persons on evidence of the most slender character But it remains a demonstrable fact that numerous highly distinguished persons of the past and the present in various countries have been inverts I may here refer to my own observations on this point in the preface Mantegazza Gli Amori degli Uomini remarks that in his own restricted circle he is acquainted with a French publicist a German poet an Italian statesman and a Spanish jurist all men of exquisite taste and highly cultivated mind who are sexually inverted Krafft Ebing in the preface to his Psychopathia Sexualis referring to the numberless communications he has received from these step children of nature remarks that the majority of the writers are men of high intellectual and social position and often possess very keen emotions Raffalovich Uranisme p one hundred ninety seven names among distinguished inverts Alexander the Great Epaminondas Virgil the great Conde Prince Eugene et cetera The question of Virgil s inversion is discussed in the Revista di Filologia eighteen ninety fas seven nine but I have not been able to see this review Moll in his Beruehmte Homosexuelle nineteen ten in the series of Grenzfragen des Nerven und Seelenlebens discusses the homosexuality of a number of eminent persons for the most part with his usual caution and sagacity speaking of the alleged homosexuality of Wagner he remarks with entire truth that the method of arguing the existence of homosexuality from the presence of feminine traits must be decisively rejected Hirschfeld has more recently included in his great work Die Homosexualitaet nineteen thirteen pp six hundred fifty six hundred seventy four two lists ancient and modern of alleged inverts among the distinguished persons of history briefly stating the nature of the evidence in each case They amount to nearly three hundred Not all of them however can be properly described as distinguished Thus we end in the list forty three English names of these at least half a dozen were noblemen who were concerned in homosexual prosecutions but were of no intellectual distinction Others again are of undoubted eminence but there is no good reason to regard them as homosexual this is the case for instance as regards Swift who may have been mentally abnormal but appears to have been heterosexual rather than homosexual Fletcher of whom we know nothing definite in this respect is also included as well as Tennyson whose youthful sentimental friendship for Arthur Hallam is exactly comparable to that of Montaigne for Etienne de la Boetie yet Montaigne is not included in the list It may be added however that while some of the English names in the list are thus extremely doubtful it would have been possible to add some others who were without doubt inverts It has not I think been noted largely because the evidence was insufficiently clear that among moral leaders and persons with strong ethical instincts there is a tendency toward the more elevated forms of homosexual feeling This may be traced not only in some of the great moral teachers of old but also in men and women of our own day It is fairly evident why this should be so Just as the repressed love of a woman or a man has in normally constituted persons frequently furnished the motive power for an enlarged philanthropic activity so the person who sees his own sex also bathed in sexual glamour brings to his work of human service an ardor wholly unknown to the normally constituted individual morality to him has become one with love fifty I am not prepared here to insist on this point but no one I think who studies sympathetically the histories and experiences of great moral leaders can fail in many cases to note the presence of this feeling more or less finely sublimated from any gross physical manifestation If it is probable that in moral movements persons of homosexual temperament have sometimes become prominent it is undoubtedly true beyond possibility of doubt that they have been prominent in religion Many years ago in eighteen eighty five the ethnologist Elie Reclus in his charming book Les Primitifs fifty one setting forth the phenomena of homosexuality among the Eskimo Innuit tribe clearly insisted that from time immemorial there has been a connection between the invert and the priest and showed how well this connection is illustrated by the Eskimo schupans Much more recently in his elaborate study of the priest Horneffer discusses the feminine traits of priests and shows that among the most various peoples persons of sexually abnormal and especially homosexual temperament have assumed the functions of priesthood To the popular eye the unnatural is the supernatural and the abnormal has appeared to be specially close to the secret Power of the World Abnormal persons are themselves of the same opinion and regard themselves as divine As Horneffer points out they often really possess special aptitude fifty two Karsch in his Gleichgeschlechtliche Leben der Naturvoelker nineteen eleven has brought out the high religious as well as social significance of castes of cross dressed and often homosexual persons among primitive peoples At the same time Edward Carpenter in his remarkable book Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk nineteen fourteen has shown with much insight how it comes about that there is an organic connection between the homosexual temperament and unusual psychic or divinatory powers Homosexual men were non warlike and homosexual women non domestic so that their energies sought different outlets from those of ordinary men and women they became the initiators of new activities Thus it is that from among them would in some degree issue not only inventors and craftsmen and teachers but sorcerers and diviners medicine men and wizards prophets and priests Such persons would be especially impelled to thought because they would realize that they were different from other people treated with reverence by some and with contempt by others they would be compelled to face the problems of their own nature and indirectly the problems of the world generally Moreover Carpenter points out persons in whom the masculine and feminine temperaments were combined would in many cases be persons of intuition and complex mind beyond their fellows and so able to exercise divination and prophecy in a very real and natural sense fifty three This aptitude of the invert for primitive religion for sorcery and divination would have its reaction on popular feeling more especially when magic and the primitive forms of religion began to fall into disrepute The invert would be regarded as the sorcerer of a false and evil religion and be submerged in the same ignominy This point has been emphasized by Westermarck in the instructive chapter on homosexuality in his great work on Moral Ideas fifty four He points out the significance of the fact at the first glance apparently inexplicable that homosexuality in the general opinion of medieval Christianity was constantly associated even confounded with heresy as we see significantly illustrated by the fact that in France and England the popular designation for homosexuality is derived from the Bulgarian heretics It was Westermarck believes chiefly as a heresy and out of religious zeal that homosexuality was so violently reprobated and so ferociously punished In modern Europe we find the strongest evidence of the presence of what may fairly be called true sexual inversion when we investigate the men of the Renaissance The intellectual independence of those days and the influence of antiquity seem to have liberated and fully developed the impulses of those abnormal individuals who would otherwise have found no clear expression and passed unnoticed fifty five Muret the Humanist may perhaps be regarded as a typical example of the nature and fate of the superior invert of the Renaissance Born in fifteen twenty six at Muret Limousin of poor but noble family he was of independent somewhat capricious character unable to endure professors and consequently he was mainly his own teacher though he often sought advice from Jules Cesar Scaliger Muret was universally admired in his day for his learning and his eloquence and is still regarded not only as a great Latinist and a fine writer but as a notable man of high intelligence and remarkable moreover for courtesy in polemics in an age when that quality was not too common His portrait shows a somewhat coarse and rustic but intelligent face He conquered honor and respect before he died in fifteen eighty five at the age of fifty nine In early life Muret wrote wanton erotic poems to women which seem based on personal experience But in fifteen fifty three we find him imprisoned in the Chatelet for sodomy and in danger of his life so that he thought of starving himself to death Friends however obtained his release and he settled in Toulouse But the very next year he was burnt in effigy in Toulouse as a Huguenot and sodomist this being the result of a judicial sentence which had caused him to flee from the city and from France Four years later he had to flee from Padua owing to a similar accusation He had many friends but none of them protested against the charge though they aided him to escape from the penalty It is very doubtful whether he was a Huguenot and whenever in his works he refers to pederasty it is with strong disapproval But his writings reveal passionate friendship for men and he seems to have expended little energy in combating a charge which if false was a shameful injustice to him It was after fleeing into Italy and falling ill of a fever from fatigue and exposure that Muret is said to have made the famous retort to the physician by his bedside who had said Faciamus experimentum in anima vili Vilem animam appellas pro qua Christus non dedignatus est mori fifty six A greater Humanist than Muret Erasmus himself seems as a young man when in the Augustinian monastery of Stein to have had a homosexual attraction to another Brother afterward Prior to whom he addressed many passionately affectionate letters his affection seems however to have been unrequited fifty seven As the Renaissance developed homosexuality seems to become more prominent among distinguished persons Poliziano was accused of pederasty Aretino was a pederast as Pope Julius II seems also to have been Ariosto wrote in his satires no doubt too extremely Senza quel vizio son pochi umanisti fifty eight Tasso had a homosexual strain in his nature but he was of weak and feminine constitution sensitively emotional and physically frail fifty nine It is however among artists at that time and later that homosexuality may most notably be traced Leonardo da Vinci whose ideals as revealed in his work are so strangely bisexual lay under homosexual suspicion in his youth In fourteen seventy six when he was twenty four years of age charges were made against him before the Florentine officials for the control of public morality and were repeated though they do not appear to have been substantiated There is however some ground for supposing that Leonardo was imprisoned in his youth sixty Throughout life he loved to surround himself with beautiful youths and his pupils were more remarkable for their attractive appearance than for their skill to one at least of them he was strongly attached while there is no record of any attachment to a woman Freud who has studied Leonardo with his usual subtlety considers that his temperament was marked by ideal homosexuality sixty one Michelangelo one of the very chief artists of the Renaissance period we cannot now doubt was sexually inverted The evidence furnished by his own letters and poems as well as the researches of numerous recent workers Parlagreco Scheffler J A Symonds et cetera may be said to have placed this beyond question sixty two He belonged to a family of five brothers four of whom never married and so far as is known left no offspring the fifth only left one male heir His biographer describes Michelangelo as a man of peculiar not altogether healthy nervous temperament He was indifferent to women only in one case indeed during his long life is there evidence even of friendship with a woman while he was very sensitive to the beauty of men and his friendships were very tender and enthusiastic At the same time there is no reason to suppose that he formed any physically passionate relationships with men and even his enemies seldom or never made this accusation against him We may probably accept the estimate of his character given by Symonds Michelangelo Buonarotti was one of those exceptional but not uncommon men who are born with sensibilities abnormally deflected from the ordinary channel He showed no partiality for women and a notable enthusiasm for the beauty of young men He was a man of physically frigid temperament extremely sensitive to beauty of the male type who habitually philosophized his emotions and contemplated the living objects of his admiration as amiable not only for their personal qualities but also for their esthetical attractiveness sixty three A temperament of this kind seems to have had no significance for the men of those days they were blind to all homosexual emotion which had no result in sodomy Plato found such attraction a subject for sentimental metaphysics but it was not until nearly our own time that it again became a subject of interest and study Yet it undoubtedly had profound influence on Michelangelo s art impelling him to find every kind of human beauty in the male form and only a grave dignity or tenderness divorced from every quality that is sexually desirable in the female form This deeply rooted abnormality is at once the key to the melancholy of Michelangelo and to the mystery of his art Michelangelo s contemporary the painter Bazzi fourteen seventy seven fifteen forty nine seems also to have been radically inverted and to this fact he owed his nickname Sodoma As however he was married and had children it may be that he was as we should now say of bisexual temperament He was a great artist who has been dealt with unjustly partly perhaps because of the prejudice of Vasari whose admiration for Michelangelo amounted to worship but who is contemptuous toward Sodoma and grudging of praise partly because his work is little known out of Italy and not very easy of access there Reckless unbalanced and eccentric in his life Sodoma revealed in his painting a peculiar feminine softness and warmth which indeed we seem to see also in his portrait of himself at Monte Oliveto Maggiore and a very marked and tender feeling for masculine but scarcely virile beauty sixty four Cellini was probably homosexual He was imprisoned on a charge of unnatural vice and is himself suspiciously silent in his autobiography concerning this imprisonment sixty five In the seventeenth century another notable sculptor who has been termed the Flemish Cellini Jerome Duquesnoy whose still more distinguished brother Francois executed the Manneken Pis in Brussels was an invert having finally been accused of sexual relations with a youth in a chapel of the Ghent Cathedral where he was executing a monument for the bishop he was strangled and burned notwithstanding that much influence including that of the bishop was brought to bear in his behalf sixty six In more recent times Winkelmann who was the initiator of a new Greek Renaissance and of the modern appreciation of ancient art lies under what seems to be a well grounded suspicion of sexual inversion His letters to male friends are full of the most passionate expressions of love His violent death also appears to have been due to a love adventure with a man The murderer was a cook a wholly uncultivated man a criminal who had already been condemned to death and shortly before murdering Winkelmann for the sake of plunder he was found to be on very intimate terms with him sixty seven It is noteworthy that sexual inversion should so often be found associated with the study of antiquity It must not however be too hastily concluded that this is due to suggestion and that to abolish the study of Greek literature and art would be largely to abolish sexual inversion What has really occurred in those recent cases that may be studied and therefore without doubt in the older cases is that the subject of congenital sexual inversion is attracted to the study of Greek antiquity because he finds there the explanation and the apotheosis of his own obscure impulses Undoubtedly that study tends to develop these impulses While it is peculiarly easy to name men of distinguished ability who either certainly or in all probability have been affected by homosexual tendencies they are not isolated manifestations They spring out of an element of diffused homosexuality which is at least as marked in civilization as it is in savagery It is easy to find illustrations in every country Here it may suffice to refer to France Germany and England In France in the thirteenth century the Church was so impressed by the prevalence of homosexuality that it reasserted the death penalty for sodomy at the Councils of Paris twelve twelve and Rouen twelve fourteen while we are told that even by rejecting a woman s advances as illustrated in Marie de France s Lai de Lanval a man fell under suspicion as a sodomist which was also held to involve heresy sixty eight At the end of this century about twelve ninety four Alain de Lille was impelled to write a book De Planctu Naturae in order to call attention to the prevalence of homosexual feeling he also associated the neglect of women with sodomy Man is made woman he writes he blackens the honor of his sex the craft of magic Venus makes him of double gender nobly beautiful youths have turned their hammers of love to the office of anvils and many kisses lie untouched on maiden lips The result is that the natural anvils that is to say the neglected maidens bewail the absence of their hammers and are seen sadly to demand them Alain de Lille makes himself the voice of this demand sixty nine A few years later at the beginning of the fourteenth century sodomy was still regarded as very prevalent At that time it was especially associated with the Templars who it has been supposed brought it from the East Such a supposition however is not required to account for the existence of homosexuality in France Nor is it necessary at a somewhat later period to invoke as is frequently done the Italian origin of Catherine de Medici in order to explain the prevalence of homosexual practices at her court Notwithstanding its prevalence sodomy was still severely punished from time to time Thus in fifteen eighty six Dadon who had formerly been Rector of the University of Paris was hanged and then burned for injuring a child through sodomy seventy In the seventeenth century homosexuality continued however to flourish and it is said that nearly all the numerous omissions made in the published editions of Tallement des Reaux s Historiettes refer to sodomy seventy one How prominent homosexuality was in the early eighteenth century in France we learn from the frequent references to it in the letters of Madame the mother of the Regent whose husband was himself effeminate and probably inverted seventy two For the later years of the century the evidence abounds on every hand At this time the Bastille was performing a useful function until recently overlooked by historians as an asile de surete for abnormal persons whom it was considered unsafe to leave at large Inverts whose conduct became too offensive to be tolerated were frequently placed in the Bastille which indeed abounded in homosexual subjects to a greater extent than any other class of sexual perverts Some of the affairs which led to the Bastille have a modern air One such case on a large scale occurred in seventeen oh two and reveals an organized system of homosexual prostitution one of the persons involved in this affair was a handsome well made youth named Lebel formerly a lackey but passing himself off as a man of quality Seduced at the age of ten by a famous sodomist named Duplessis he had since been at the disposition of a number of homosexual persons including officers priests and marquises Some of the persons involved in these affairs were burned alive some cut their own throats others again were set at liberty or transferred to the Bicetre seventy three During the latter part of the eighteenth century also we find another modern homosexual practice recognized in France the rendezvous or center where homosexual persons could quietly meet each other seventy four Inversion has always been easy to trace in Germany Ammianus Marcellinus bears witness to its prevalence among some German tribes in later Roman days seventy five In mediaeval times as Schultz points out references to sodomy in Germany were far from uncommon Various princes of the German Imperial house and of other princely families in the Middle Ages were noted for their intimate friendships At a later date attention has frequently been called to the extreme emotional warmth which has often marked German friendship even when there has been no suspicion of any true homosexual relationship seventy six The eighteenth century in the full enjoyment of that abandonment to sentiment initiated by Rousseau proved peculiarly favorable to the expansion of the tendency to sentimental friendship On this basis a really inverted tendency when it existed could easily come to the surface and find expression We find this well illustrated in the poet Heinrich von Kleist who seems to have been of bisexual temperament and his feelings for the girl he wished to marry were indeed much cooler than those for his friend To this friend Ernst von Pfuel afterward Prussian war minister Kleist wrote in eighteen oh five at the age of twenty eight You bring the days of the Greeks back to me I could sleep with you dear youth my whole soul so embraces you When you used to bathe in the Lake of Thun I would gaze with the real feelings of a girl at your beautiful body It would serve an artist to study from There follows an enthusiastic account of his friend s beauty and of the Greek idea of the love of youths and Kleist concludes Go with me to Anspach and let us enjoy the sweets of friendship I shall never marry you must be wife and children to me seventy seven In all social classes and in all fields of activity Germany during the nineteenth century produced a long series of famous or notorious homosexual persons At the one end we find people of the highest intellectual distinction such as Alexander von Humboldt whom Naecke a cautious investigator stated that he had good ground for regarding as an invert seventy eight At the other end we find prosperous commercial and manufacturing people who leave Germany to find solace in the free and congenial homosexual atmosphere of Capri of these F A Krupp the head of the famous Essen factory may be regarded as the type seventy nine In England and the same is true today of the United States although homosexuality has been less openly manifest and less thoroughly explored it is doubtful whether it has been less prevalent than in Germany At an early period indeed the evidence may even seem to show that it was more prevalent In the Penitentials of the ninth and tenth centuries natural fornication and sodomy were frequently put together and the same penance assigned to both it was recognized that priests and bishops as well as laymen might fall into this sin though to the bishop nearly three times as much penance was assigned as to the layman Among the Normans everywhere homosexuality was markedly prevalent the spread of sodomy in France about the eleventh century is attributed to the Normans and their coming seems to have rendered it at times almost fashionable at all events at court In England William Rufus was undoubtedly inverted as later on were Edward II James I and perhaps though not in so conspicuous a degree William III eighty Ordericus Vitalis who was himself half Norman and half English says that the Normans had become very effeminate in his time and that after the death of William the Conqueror sodomy was common both in England and Normandy Guillaume de Nangis in his chronicle for about eleven twenty speaking of the two sons of Henry and the company of young nobles who went down with them in the White Ship states that nearly all were considered to be sodomists and Henry of Huntingdon in his History looked upon the loss of the White Ship as a judgment of heaven upon sodomy Anselm in writing to Archdeacon William to inform him concerning the recent Council at London eleven oh two gives advice as to how to deal with people who have committed the sin of sodomy and instructs him not to be too harsh with those who have not realized its gravity for hitherto this sin has been so public that hardly anyone has blushed for it and many therefore have plunged into it without realizing its gravity eighty one So temperate a remark by a man of such unquestionably high character is more significant of the prevalence of homosexuality than much denunciation In religious circles far from courts and cities as we might expect homosexuality was regarded with great horror though even here we may discover evidence of its wide prevalence Thus in the remarkable Revelation of the Monk of Evesham written in English in eleven ninety six we find that in the very worst part of Purgatory are confined an innumerable company of sodomists including a wealthy witty and learned divine a doctor of laws personally known to the Monk and whether these people would ever be delivered from Purgatory was a matter of doubt of the salvation of no other sinners does the Monk of Evesham seem so dubious Sodomy had always been an ecclesiastical offense The Statute of fifteen thirty three twenty five Henry VIII c six made it a felony and Pollock and Maitland consider that this affords an almost sufficient proof that the temporal courts had not punished it and that no one had been put to death for it for a very long time past eighty two The temporal law has never however proved very successful in repressing homosexuality At this period the Renaissance movement was reaching England and here as elsewhere it brought with it if not an increase at all events a rehabilitation and often an idealization of homosexuality eighty three An eminent humanist and notable pioneer in dramatic literature Nicholas Udall to whom is attributed Ralph Roister Doister the first English comedy stands out as unquestionably addicted to homosexual tastes although he has left no literary evidence of this tendency He was an early adherent of the Protestant movement and when head master of Eton he was noted for his love of inflicting corporal punishment on the boys Tusser says he once received from Udall fifty three stripes for fault but small or none at all Here there was evidently a sexual sadistic impulse for in fifteen forty one the year of Ralph Roister Doister Udall was charged with unnatural crime and confessed his guilt before the Privy Council He was dismissed from the head mastership and imprisoned but only for a short time and his reputation his modern biographer states was not permanently injured He retained the vicarage of Braintree and was much favored by Edward VI who nominated him to a prebend of Windsor Queen Mary was also favorable and he became head master of Westminster School eighty four An Elizabethan lyrical poet of high quality whose work has had the honor of being confused with Shakespeare s Richard Barnfield appears to have possessed the temperament at least of the invert His poems to male friends are of so impassioned a character that they aroused the protests of a very tolerant age Very little is known of Barnfield s life Born in fifteen seventy four he published his first poem The Affectionate Shepherd at the age of twenty while still at the University It was issued anonymously revealed much fresh poetic feeling and literary skill and is addressed to a youth of whom the poet declares If it be sin to love a lovely lad Oh then sin I In his subsequent volume Cynthia fifteen ninety five Barnfield disclaims any intention in the earlier poem beyond that of imitating Virgil s second eclogue But the sonnets in this second volume are even more definitely homosexual than the earlier poem though he goes on to tell how at last he found a lass whose beauty surpassed that of the swain Whom I never could obtain After the age of thirty one Barnfield wrote no more but being in easy circumstances retired to his beautiful manor house and country estate in Shropshire lived there for twenty years and died leaving a wife and son eighty five It seems probable that he was of bisexual temperament and that as not infrequently happens in such cases the homosexual element developed early under the influence of a classical education and university associations while the normal heterosexual element developed later and as may happen in bisexual persons was associated with the more commonplace and prosaic side of life Barnfield was only a genuine poet on the homosexual side of his nature Greater men of that age than Barnfield may be suspected of homosexual tendencies Marlowe whose most powerful drama Edward II is devoted to a picture of the relations between that king and his minions is himself suspected of homosexuality An ignorant informer brought certain charges of freethought and criminality against him and further accused him of asserting that they are fools who love not boys These charges have doubtless been colored by the vulgar channel through which they passed but it seems absolutely impossible to regard them as the inventions of a mere gallows bird such as this informer was eighty six Moreover Marlowe s poetic work while it shows him by no means insensitive to the beauty of women also reveals a special and peculiar sensitiveness to masculine beauty Marlowe clearly had a reckless delight in all things unlawful and it seems probable that he possessed the bisexual temperament Shakespeare has also been discussed from this point of view All that can be said however is that he addressed a long series of sonnets to a youthful male friend These sonnets are written in lover s language of a very tender and noble order They do not appear to imply any relationship that the writer regarded as shameful or that would be so regarded by the world Moreover they seem to represent but a single episode in the life of a very sensitive many sided nature eighty seven There is no other evidence in Shakespeare s work of homosexual instinct such as we may trace throughout Marlowe s while there is abundant evidence of a constant preoccupation with women While Shakespeare thus narrowly escapes inclusion in the list of distinguished inverts there is much better ground for the inclusion of his great contemporary Francis Bacon Aubrey in his laboriously compiled Short Lives in which he shows a friendly and admiring attitude toward Bacon definitely states that he was a pederast Aubrey was only a careful gleaner of frequently authentic gossip but a similar statement is made by Sir Simonds D Ewes in his Autobiography D Ewes whose family belonged to the same part of Suffolk as Bacon s sprang from was not friendly to Bacon but that fact will not suffice to account for his statement He was an upright and honorable man of scholarly habits and moreover a trained lawyer who had many opportunities of obtaining first hand information for he had lived in the Chancery office from childhood He is very precise as to Bacon s homosexual practices with his own servants both before and after his fall and even gives the name of a very effeminate faced youth who was his catamite and bedfellow he states further that there had been some question of bringing Bacon to trial for sodomy These allegations may be supported by a letter of Bacon s own mother printed in Spedding s Life of Bacon reproving him on account of what she had heard concerning his behavior with the young Welshmen in his service whom he made his bedfellows It is notable that Bacon seems to have been specially attracted to Welshmen one might even find evidence of this in the life of the Welshman Henry VII a people of vivacious temperament unlike his own this is illustrated by his long and intimate friendship with the mercurial Sir Toby Mathew his alter ego a man of dissipated habits in early life though we are not told that he was homosexual Bacon had many friendships with men but there is no evidence that he was ever in love or cherished any affectionate intimacy with a woman Women play no part at all in his life His marriage which was childless took place at the mature age of forty six it was effected in a business like manner and though he always treated his wife with formal consideration it is probable that he neglected her and certain that he failed to secure her devotion it is clear that toward the end of Bacon s life she formed a relationship with her gentleman usher whom subsequently she married Bacon s writings it may be added equally with his letters show no evidence of love or attraction to women in his Essays he is brief and judicial on the subject of Marriage copious and eloquent on the subject of Friendship while the essay on Beauty deals exclusively with masculine beauty During the first half of the eighteenth century we have clear evidence that homosexuality flourished in London with the features which it presents today in all large cities everywhere There was a generally known name Mollies applied to homosexual persons evidently having reference to their frequently feminine characteristics there were houses of private resort for them Molly houses there were special public places of rendezvous whither they went in search of adventure exactly as there are today A walk in Upper Moorfields was especially frequented by the homosexual about seventeen twenty five A detective employed by the police about that date gave evidence as follows at the Old Bailey I takes a turn that way and leans over the wall In a little time the prisoner passes by and looks hard at me and at a small distance from me stands up against the wall as if he was going to make water Then by degrees he siddles nearer and nearer to where I stood till at last he was close to me Tis a very fine night says he Aye say I and so it is Then he takes me by the hand and after squeezing and playing with it a little he conveys it to his breeches whereupon the detective seizes the man by his sexual organs and holds him until the constable comes up and effects an arrest At the same period Margaret Clap commonly called Mother Clap kept a house in Field Lane Holborn which was a noted resort of the homosexual To Mother Clap s Molly house thirty or forty clients would resort every night on Sunday there might be as many as fifty for as in Berlin and other cities today that was the great homosexual gala night there were beds in every room in this house We are told that the men would sit in one another s laps kissing in a lewd manner and using their hands indecently Then they would get up dance and make curtsies and mimic the voices of women Oh fie sir Pray sir Dear sir Lord how can you serve me so I swear I ll cry out You re a wicked devil And you re a bold face Eh ye dear little toad Come bus They d hug and play and toy and go out by couples into another room on the same floor to be married as they called it On the whole one gains the impression that homosexual practices were more prevalent in London in the eighteenth century bearing in mind its population at that time than they are today eighty eight It must not however be supposed that the law was indulgent and its administration lax The very reverse was the case The punishment for sodomy when completely effected was death and it was frequently inflicted Homosexual intercourse without evidence of penetration was regarded as attempt and was usually punished by the pillory and a heavy fine followed by two years imprisonment Moreover it would appear that more activity was shown by the police in prosecution than is nowadays the case this is for instance suggested by the evidence of the detective already quoted To keep a homosexual resort was also a severely punishable offense Mother Clap was charged at the Old Bailey in seventeen twenty six with keeping a sodomitical house she protested that she could not herself have taken part in these practices but that availed her nothing she could bring forward no witnesses on her behalf and was condemned to pay a fine to stand in the pillory and to undergo imprisonment for two years The cases were dealt with in a matter of fact way which seems to bear further witness to the frequency of the offense and with no effort to expend any specially vindictive harshness on this class of offenders If there was the slightest doubt as to the facts even though the balance of evidence was against the accused he was usually acquitted and the man who could bring witnesses to his general good character might often thereby escape In seventeen twenty one a religious young man married was convicted of attempting sodomy with two young men he slept with he was fined placed in the pillory and imprisoned for two months Next year a man was acquitted on a similar charge and another man of decent aspect although the evidence indicated that he might have been guilty of sodomy was only convicted of attempt and sentenced to fine pillory and two years imprisonment In seventeen twenty three again a schoolmaster was acquitted on account of his good reputation of the charge of attempt on a boy of fifteen his pupil though the evidence seemed decidedly against him In seventeen thirty a man was sentenced to death for sodomy effected on his young apprentice this was a bad case and the surgeon s evidence indicated laceration of the perineum Homosexuality of all kinds flourished it will be seen notwithstanding the fearless yet fair application of a very severe law eighty nine In more recent times Byron has frequently been referred to as experiencing homosexual affections and I have been informed that some of his poems nominally addressed to women were really inspired by men It is certain that he experienced very strong emotions toward his male friends My school friendships he wrote were with me passions When he afterward met one of these friends Lord Clare in Italy he was painfully agitated and could never hear the name without a beating of the heart At the age of twenty two he formed one of his strong attachments for a youth to whom he left Lseven thousand in his will ninety It is probable however that here as well as in the case of Shakespeare and in that of Tennyson s love for his youthful friend Arthur Hallam as well as of Montaigne for Etienne de la Boetie although such strong friendships may involve an element of sexual emotion we have no true and definite homosexual impulse homosexuality is merely simulated by the ardent and hyperesthetic emotions of the poet ninety one The same quality of the poet s emotional temperament may doubtless also be invoked in the case of Goethe who is said to have written elegies which on account of their homosexual character still remain unpublished The most famous homosexual trial of recent times in England was that of Oscar Wilde a writer whose literary reputation may be said to be still growing not only in England but throughout the world Wilde was the son of parents who were both of unusual ability and somewhat eccentric Both these tendencies became in him more concentrated He was born with as it were a congenital antipathy to the commonplace a natural love of paradox and he possessed the skill to embody the characteristic in finished literary form At the same time it must not be forgotten beneath this natural attitude of paradox his essential judgments on life and literature were usually sound and reasonable His essay on The Soul of Man Under Socialism witnessed to his large and enlightened conception of life and his profound admiration for Flaubert to the sanity and solidity of his literary taste In early life he revealed no homosexual tendencies he married and had children After he had begun to outgrow his youthful esthetic extravagances however and to acquire success and fame he developed what was at first a simply inquisitive interest in inversion Such inquisitive interest is sometimes the sign of an emerging homosexual impulse It proved to be so in Wilde s case and ultimately he was found to be cultivating the acquaintance of youths of low class and doubtful character Although this development occurred comparatively late in life we must hesitate to describe Wilde s homosexuality as acquired If we consider his constitution and his history it is not difficult to suppose that homosexual germs were present in a latent form from the first and it may quite well be that Wilde s inversion was of that kind which is now described as retarded though still congenital As is usual in England no active efforts were made to implicate Wilde in any criminal charge It was his own action as even he himself seems to have vaguely realized beforehand which brought the storm about his head He was arrested tried condemned and at once there arose a general howl of execration joined in even by the judge whose attitude compared unfavorably with the more impartial attitude of the eighteenth century judges in similar cases Wilde came out of prison ambitious to retrieve his reputation by the quality of his literary work But he left Reading gaol merely to enter a larger and colder prison He soon realized that his spirit was broken even more than his health He drifted at last to Paris where he shortly after died shunned by all but a few of his friends ninety two In a writer of the first order Edward Fitzgerald to whom we owe the immortal and highly individualized version of Omar Khayyam it is easy to trace an element of homosexuality though it appears never to have reached full and conscious development Fitzgerald was an eccentric person who though rich and on friendly terms with some of the most distinguished men of his time was always out of harmony with his environment He felt himself called on to marry very unhappily a woman whom he had never been in love with and with whom he had nothing in common All his affections were for his male friends In early life he was devoted to his friend W K Browne whom he glorified in Euphranor To him Browne was at once Jonathan Gamaliel Apollo the friend the master the God there was scarcely a limit to his devotion and admiration ninety three On Browne s premature death Fitzgerald s heart was empty In eighteen fifty nine at Lowestoft Fitzgerald as he wrote to missus Browne used to wander about the shore at night longing for some fellow to accost me who might give some promise of filling up a very vacant place in my heart It was then that he met Posh Joseph Fletcher a fisherman six feet tall said to be of the best Suffolk type both in body and character Posh reminded Fitzgerald of his dead friend Browne he made him captain of his lugger and was thereafter devoted to him Posh was said Fitzgerald a man of the finest Saxon type with a complexion vif male et flamboyant blue eyes a nose less than Roman more than Greek and strictly auburn hair that any woman might envy Further he was a man of simplicity of soul justice of thought tenderness of nature a gentleman of Nature s grandest type in fact the greatest man Fitzgerald had ever met Posh was not however quite so absolutely perfect as this description suggests and various misunderstandings arose in consequence between the two friends so unequal in culture and social traditions These difficulties are reflected in some of the yet extant letters from the enormous mass which Fitzgerald addressed to my dear Poshy ninety four A great personality of recent times widely regarded with reverence as the prophet poet of Democracy ninety five Walt Whitman has aroused discussion by his sympathetic attitude toward passionate friendship or manly love as he calls it in Leaves of Grass In this book in Calamus Drumtaps and elsewhere Whitman celebrates a friendship in which physical contact and a kind of silent voluptuous emotion are essential elements In order to settle the question as to the precise significance of Calamus J A Symonds wrote to Whitman frankly posing the question The answer written from Camden N J on August nineteen eighteen ninety is the only statement of Whitman s attitude toward homosexuality and it is therefore desirable that it should be set on record About the questions on Calamus et cetera they quite daze me Leaves of Grass is only to be rightly construed by and within its own atmosphere and essential character all its pages and pieces so coming strictly under That the Calamus part has ever allowed the possibility of such construction as mentioned is terrible I am fain to hope that the pages themselves are not to be even mentioned for such gratuitous and quite at the time undreamed and unwished possibility of morbid inferences which are disavowed by me and seem damnable It would seem from this letter ninety six that Whitman had never realized that there is any relationship whatever between the passionate emotion of physical contact from man to man as he had experienced it and sung it and the act which with other people he would regard as a crime against nature This may be singular for there are many inverted persons who have found satisfaction in friendships less physical and passionate than those described in Leaves of Grass but Whitman was a man of concrete emotional instinctive temperament lacking in analytical power receptive to all influences and careless of harmonizing them He would most certainly have refused to admit that he was the subject of inverted sexuality It remains true however that manly love occupies in his work a predominance which it would scarcely hold in the feelings of the average man whom Whitman wishes to honor A normally constituted person having assumed the very frank attitude taken up by Whitman would be impelled to devote far more space and far more ardor to the subject of sexual relationships with women and all that is involved in maternity than is accorded to them in Leaves of Grass Some of Whitman s extant letters to young men though they do not throw definite light on this question are of a very affectionate character ninety seven and although a man of remarkable physical vigor he never felt inclined to marry ninety eight It remains somewhat difficult to classify him from the sexual point of view but we can scarcely fail to recognize the presence of a homosexual tendency I should add that some friends and admirers of Whitman are not prepared to accept the evidence of the letter to Symonds I am indebted to Q for the following statement of the objections I think myself that it is a mistake to give much weight to this letter perhaps a mistake to introduce it at all since if introduced it will of course carry weight And this for three or four reasons one That it is difficult to reconcile the letter itself with its strong tone of disapprobation with the general atmosphere of Leaves of Grass the tenor of which is to leave everything open and free two That the letter is in hopeless conflict with the Calamus section of poems For whatever moral lines Whitman may have drawn at the time of writing these poems it seems to me quite incredible that the possibility of certain inferences morbid or other was undreamed of three That the letter was written only a few months before his last illness and death and is the only expression of the kind that he appears to have given utterance to four That Symonds s letter to which this was a reply is not forth coming and we consequently do not know what rash expressions it may have contained leading Whitman with his extreme caution to hedge his name from possible use to justify dubious practices I may add that I endeavored to obtain Symonds s letter but he was unable to produce it nor has any copy of it been found among his papers It should be said that Whitman s attitude toward Symonds was marked by high regard and admiration A wonderful man is Addington Symonds he remarked shortly before his own death some ways the most indicative and penetrating and significant man of our time Symonds is a curious fellow I love him dearly He is of college breed and education horribly literary and suspicious and enjoys things A great fellow for delving into persons and into the concrete and even into the physiological and the gastric and wonderfully cute But on this occasion he delved in vain The foregoing remarks substantially contained in the previous editions of this book were based mainly on the information received from J A Symonds s side But of more recent years interesting light has been thrown on this remarkable letter from Walt Whitman s side The Boswellian patience enthusiasm and skill which Horace Traubel has brought to his full and elaborate work now in course of publication With Walt Whitman in Camden clearly reveal in the course of various conversations Whitman s attitude to Symonds s question and the state of mind which led up to this letter Whitman talked to Traubel much about Symonds from the twenty seventh of April eighteen eighty eight very soon after the date when Traubel s work begins onward Symonds had written to him repeatedly it seems concerning the passional relations of men with men as Whitman expressed it He is always driving at me about that is that what Calamus means because of me or in spite of me is that what it means I have said no but no does not satisfy him There is however no record from Symonds s side of any letter by Whitman to Symonds in this sense up to this date But read this letter read the whole of it it is very shrewd very cute in deadliest earnest it drives me hard almost compels me it is urgent persistent he sort of stands in the road and says I won t move till you answer my question You see this is an old letter sixteen years old and he is still asking the question he refers to it in one of his latest notes He is surely a wonderful man a rare cleaned up man a white souled heroic character You will be writing something about Calamus some day said W to Traubel and this letter and what I say may help to clear your ideas Calamus needs clear ideas it may be easily innocently distorted from its natural its motive body of doctrine The letter dated Feb seven eighteen seventy two of some length is then reproduced It tells how much Leaves of Grass and especially the Calamus section had helped the writer What the love of man for man has been in the past Symonds wrote I think I know What it is here now I know also alas What you say it can and should be I dimly discern in your Poems But this hardly satisfies me so desirous am I of learning what you teach Some day perhaps in some form I know not what but in your own chosen form you will tell me more about the Love of Friends Till then I wait Said W Well what do you think of that Do you think that could be answered I don t see why you call that letter driving you hard It s quiet enough it only asks questions and asks the questions mildly enough I suppose you are right drive is not exactly the word yet you know how I hate to be catechised Symonds is right no doubt to ask the questions I am just as much right if I do not answer them just as much right if I do answer them I often say to myself about Calamus perhaps it means more or less than what I thought myself means different perhaps I don t know what it all means perhaps never did know My first instinct about all that Symonds writes is violently reactionary is strong and brutal for no no no Then the thought intervenes that I maybe do not know all my own meanings I say to myself You too go away come back study your own book as alien or stranger study your own book see what it amounts to Some time or other I will have to write to him definitely about Calamus give him my word for it what I meant or mean it to mean Again a month later May twenty four eighteen eighty eight Whitman speaks to Traubel of a beautiful letter from Symonds You will see that he harps on the Calamus poems again I don t see why it should but his recurrence to that subject irritates me a little I suppose you might say why don t you shut him up by answering him There is no logical answer to that I suppose but I may ask in my turn What right has he to ask questions anyway W laughed a bit Anyway the question comes back to me almost every time he writes He is courteous enough about it that is the reason I do not resent him I suppose the whole thing will end in an answer some day The letter follows The chief point in it is that the writer hopes he has not been importunate in the question he had asked about Calamus three years before I Traubel said to W That s a humble letter enough I don t see anything in that to get excited about He doesn t ask you to answer the old question In fact he rather apologizes for having asked it W fired up Who is excited As to that question he does ask it again and again asks it asks it asks it I laughed at his vehemence Well suppose he does It does not harm Besides you ve got nothing to hide I think your silence might lead him to suppose there was a nigger in your wood pile Oh nonsense But for thirty years my enemies and friends have been asking me questions about the Leaves I m tired of not answering questions It was very funny to see his face when he gave a humorous twist to the fling in his last phrase Then he relaxed and added Anyway I love Symonds Who could fail to love a man who could write such a letter I suppose he will yet have to be answered damn im It is clear that these conversations considerably diminish the force of the declaration in Whitman s letter We see that the letter which on the face of it might have represented the swift and indignant reaction of a man who suddenly faced by the possibility that his work may be interpreted in a perverse sense emphatically repudiates that interpretation was really nothing of the kind Symonds for at least eighteen years had been gently considerately even humbly yet persistently asking the same perfectly legitimate question If the answer was really an emphatic no it would more naturally have been made in eighteen seventy two than eighteen ninety Moreover in the face of this ever recurring question Whitman constantly speaks to his friends of his great affection for Symonds and his admiration for his intellectual cuteness feelings that would both be singularly out of place if applied to a man who was all the time suggesting the possibility that his writings contained inferences that were terrible morbid and damnable Evidently during all those years Whitman could not decide what to reply On the one hand he was moved by his horror of being questioned by his caution by his natural aversion to express approval of anything that could be called unnatural or abnormal On the other hand he was moved by the desire to let his work speak for itself by his declared determination to leave everything open and possibly by a more or less conscious sympathy with the inferences presented to him It was not until the last years of his life when his sexual life belonged to the past when weakness was gaining on him when he wished to put aside every drain on his energies that being constitutionally incapable of a balanced scientific statement he chose the simplest and easiest solution of the difficulty ninety nine

5719-233352-0012	train-other-500	It is with this fundamental abnormality usually called sexual inversion that we shall here be concerned There is no evidence to show that homosexuality in Greece was a congenital perversion

5719-233352-0014	train-other-500	Doubtless in a certain proportion of cases the impulse was organic and it may well be that there was an organic and racial predisposition to homosexuality among the Greeks or at all events the Dorians
5719-233352-0015	train-other-500	But the state of social feeling however it originated induced a large proportion of the ordinary population to adopt homosexuality as a fashion or it may be said the environment was peculiarly favorable to the development of latent homosexual tendencies
5719-233352-0016	train-other-500	So that any given number of homosexual persons among the Greeks would have presented a far smaller proportion of constitutionally abnormal individuals than a like number in England In a similar manner though I do not regard the analogy as complete

5719-233352-0018	train-other-500	For this reason I am unable to see that homosexuality in ancient Greece while of great interest as a social and psychological problem throws light on sexual inversion as we know it in England or the United States

5719-233352-0025	train-other-500	There is some reason for believing that homosexuality is especially prominent in Germany and among Germans I have elsewhere referred to the highly emotional and sentimental traits which have frequently marked German friendships
5719-233352-0026	train-other-500	Germany is the only country in which there is a definite and well supported movement for the defense and social rehabilitation of inverts The study of sexual inversion began in Germany
5719-233352-0027	train-other-500	and the scientific and literary publications dealing with homosexuality issued from the German press probably surpass in quantity and importance those issued from all other countries put together The homosexual tendencies of Germans outside Germany
5719-233352-0028	train-other-500	have been noted in various countries Among my English cases I have found that a strain of German blood occurs much more frequently than we are entitled to expect Parisian prostitutes are said to be aware of the homosexual tastes of Germans
5719-233352-0029	train-other-500	it is significant that as a German invert familiar with Turkey informed Naecke at Constantinople the procurers who naturally supply girls as well as youths regard Germans and Austrians as more tending to homosexuality than the foreigners from any other land
5719-233352-0030	train-other-500	Germans usually deny however that there is any special German proclivity to inversion and it would not appear that such statistics as are available though all such statistics cannot be regarded as more than approximations show any pronounced predominance of inversion among Germans
none	none	 It is to Hirschfeld that we owe the chief attempt to gain some notion of the percentage of homosexual persons among the general population one hundred four It may be said to vary in different regions 
5719-233352-0031	train-other-500	and more especially in different occupations from one to ten per cent But the average when the individuals belonging to a large number of groups are combined is generally found to be rather over two per cent
none	none	 So that there are about a million and a half inverted persons in Germany one hundred five This would be a minimum which can scarcely fail to be below the actual proportion as no one can be certain that he is acquainted with the real proclivities of all the persons comprising a larger group of acquaintances one hundred six It is not found in the estimates which have reached Hirschfeld that the French groups show a smaller proportion of homosexual persons than the German groups 
5719-233352-0032	train-other-500	and a Japanese group comes out near to the general average for the whole
none	none	 Various authorities especially Germans believe that homosexuality is just as common in France as in Germany one hundred seven Saint Paul doctor Laupts on the other hand 
5719-233352-0033	train-other-500	is unable to accept this view
none	none	 As an army surgeon who has long served in Africa he can as also Rebierre in his Joyeux et demifous bear witness to the frequency of homosexuality among the African battalions of the French army 
5719-233352-0034	train-other-500	especially in the cavalry less so in the infantry in the French army generally he finds it rare as also in the general population
none	none	 one hundred eight Naecke is also inclined to believe that homosexuality is rarer in Celtic lands 
5719-233352-0035	train-other-500	and in the Latin countries generally than in Teutonic and Slavonic lands
none	none	 and believes that it may be a question of race one hundred nine The question is still undecided 
5719-233352-0036	train-other-500	It is possible that the undoubted fact that homosexuality is less conspicuous in France and the other Latin countries than in Teutonic lands
none	none	 may be due not to the occurrence of a smaller proportion of congenital inverts in the former lands 
5719-233352-0037	train-other-500	but mainly to general difference in temperament
none	none	 and in the social reaction one hundred ten The French idealize and emphasize the place of women to a much greater degree than the Germans 
5719-233352-0038	train-other-500	while at the same time inverts in France have much less occasion than in Germany to proclaim their legal grievances Apart from such considerations as these it seems very doubtful whether inborn inversion is in any considerable degree rarer in France than in Germany
none	none	 As to the frequency of homosexuality in England one hundred eleven and the United States there is much evidence 
5719-233352-0039	train-other-500	In England its manifestations are well marked for those whose eyes have once been opened The manifestations are of the same character as those in Germany modified by social and national differences and especially by the greater reserve
none	none	 Puritanism and prudery of England one hundred twelve In the United States these same influences exert a still greater effect in restraining the outward manifestations of homosexuality 
5719-233352-0040	train-other-500	Hirschfeld though so acute and experienced in the investigation of homosexuality states that when visiting Philadelphia and Boston he could scarcely detect any evidence of homosexuality
none	none	 though he was afterward assured by those acquainted with local conditions 
5719-233352-0041	train-other-500	that its extension in both cities is colossal There have been numerous criminal cases and scandals in the United States in which homosexuality has come to the surface
none	none	 and the very frequently occurring cases of transvestism or cross dressing 
5719-233352-0042	train-other-500	in the States seem to be in a large proportion associated with homosexuality
none	none	 In the opinion of some English homosexuality has become much more conspicuous during recent years 
5719-233352-0043	train-other-500	and this is sometimes attributed to the Oscar Wilde case
none	none	 No doubt the celebrity of Oscar Wilde and the universal publicity given to the facts of the case by the newspapers 
5719-233352-0044	train-other-500	may have brought conviction of their perversion to many inverts who were before only vaguely conscious of their abnormality and paradoxical though it may seem have imparted greater courage to others
none	none	 but it can scarcely have sufficed to increase the number of inverts 
5719-233352-0045	train-other-500	Rather one may say the development of urban life renders easier the exhibition and satisfaction
none	none	 of this as of all other forms of perversion 
5719-233352-0046	train-other-500	Regarding the proportion of inverts among the general population
none	none	 it is very difficult to speak positively The invert himself is a misleading guide because he has formed round himself a special coterie of homosexual persons 
5719-233352-0047	train-other-500	and moreover he is sometimes apt to overestimate the number of inverts through the misinterpretation of small indications that are not always conclusive
5719-233352-0048	train-other-500	The estimate of the ordinary normal person feeling the ordinary disgust toward abnormal phenomena is also misleading because his homosexual acquaintances are careful not to inform him concerning their proclivities
5719-233352-0049	train-other-500	A writer who has studied the phenomena of homosexuality is apt to be misguided in the same way as the invert himself and to overestimate the prevalence of the perversion
5719-233352-0050	train-other-500	Striving to put aside this source of fallacy and only considering those individuals with whom I have been brought in contact by the ordinary circumstances of life and with whose modes of feeling I am acquainted I am still led to the conclusion that the proportion is considerable
5719-233352-0051	train-other-500	Among the professional and most cultured element of the middle class in England there must be a distinct percentage of inverts which may sometimes be as much as five per cent though such estimates must always be hazardous
none	none	 Among women of the same class the percentage seems to be at least double 
5719-233352-0052	train-other-500	though here the phenomena are less definite and deep seated This seems to be a moderate estimate for this class which includes however it must be remembered a considerable proportion of individuals who are somewhat abnormal in other respects
none	none	 As we descend the scale the phenomena are doubtless less common though when we reach the working class we come to that comparative indifference to which allusion has already been made Taken altogether we may probably conclude that the proportion of inverts is the same as in other related and neighboring lands that is to say slightly over two per cent That would give the homosexual population of Great Britain as somewhere about a million FOOTNOTES one Taking all its forms en bloc as they are known to the police homosexuality is seen to possess formidable proportions Thus in France from official papers which passed through M Carlier s bureau during ten years eighteen sixty seventy he compiled a list of six thousand three hundred forty two pederasts who came within the cognizance of the police twenty forty nine Parisians three thousand seven hundred nine provincials and five hundred eighty four foreigners Of these three thousand four hundred thirty two or more than

twentieth sonnet with its reference to the one thing to my purpose nothing is alone enough to show that Shakespeare was not a genuine invert as then he would have found the virility of the loved object beautiful His sonnets may fairly be compared to the In Memoriam of Tennyson whom it is impossible to describe as inverted though in his youth he cherished an ardent friendship for another youth such as was also felt in youth by Montaigne eighty eight A scene in Vanbrugh s Relapse and the chapter ch li in Smollett s Roderick Random describing Lord Strutwell may also be mentioned as evidencing familiarity with inversion In our country said Lord Strutwell to Rawdon putting forward arguments familiar to modern champions of homosexuality it gains ground apace and in all probability will become

nineteen oh eight ninety five It is as such that Whitman should be approached and I would desire to protest against the tendency now marked in many quarters to treat him merely as an invert and to vilify him or glorify him accordingly However important inversion may be as a psychological key to Whitman s personality it plays but a small part in Whitman s work and for many who care for that work a negligible part I may be allowed to refer to my own essay on Whitman in The New Spirit written nearly thirty years ago ninety six I may add that Symonds in his book on Whitman accepted this letter as a candid and final statement showing that Whitman was absolutely hostile to sexual inversion that he had not even taken its phenomena into account and that he had omitted to perceive that there are inevitable points of contact between sexual inversion and his doctrine of friendship He recalls however Whitman s own lines at the end of Calamus in the Camden edition of eighteen seventy six Here my last words and the most baffling Here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting Here I shade down and hide my thoughts I do not expose them And yet they expose me more than all my other poems ninety seven Whitman s letters to Peter Doyle an uncultured young tram conductor deeply loved by the poet have been edited by doctor Bucke and published at Boston Calamus A Series of Letters eighteen ninety seven ninety eight Whitman acknowledged however as in the letter to Symonds already referred to that he had had six children they appear to have been born in the earlier part of his life when he lived in the South See a chapter on Walt Whitman s children in Edward Carpenter s interesting book Days with Walt Whitman nineteen oh six Yet his brother George Whitman said I never knew Walt to fall in love with young girls or even to show them marked attention And Doyle who knew him intimately during ten years of late life said Women in that sense never came into his head The early heterosexual relationship seems to have been an exception in his life With regard to the number of children I am informed that in the opinion of a lady who knew Whitman in the South there can be no reasonable doubt as to the existence of one child but that when enumerating six he possibly included grandchildren ninety nine While the homosexual strain in Walt Whitman has been more or less definitely admitted by various writers the most vigorous attempts to present the homosexual character of his personality and work are due to Eduard Bertz in Germany and to doctor W C Rivers in England Bertz has issued three publications on Whitman see especially his Der Yankee Heiland nineteen oh six and Whitman Mysterien nineteen oh seven The arguments of Rivers are concisely stated in a pamphlet entitled Walt Whitman s Anomaly London George Allen nineteen thirteen Both Bertz and Rivers emphasize the feminine traits in Whitman An interesting independent picture of Whitman at about the date of the letter to Symonds accompanied by the author s excellent original photographs is furnished by doctor John Johnston A Visit to Walt Whitman eighteen ninety eight It may be added that probably both the extent and the significance of the feminine traits in Whitman have been overestimated by some writers Most artists and men of genius have some feminine traits they do not prove the existence of inversion nor does their absence disprove it doctor Clark Bell writes to me in reference to the little book by doctor Rivers I knew Walt Whitman personally To me mister Whitman was one of the most robust and virile of men extraordinarily so He was from my standpoint not feminine at all but physically masculine and robust The difficulty is that a virile and strong man who is poetic in temperament ardent and tender may have phases and moods of passion and emotion which are apt to be misinterpreted A somewhat similar view in opposition to Bertz and Rivers has been vigorously set

he called the Sotadic Zone the vice is popular and endemic held at the worst to be a mere peccadillo while the races to the north and south of the limits here defined practice it only sporadically amid the opprobrium of their fellows who as a rule are physically incapable of performing the operation and look upon it with the liveliest disgust He adds The only physical cause for the practice which suggests itself to me and that must be owned to be purely conjectural is that within the Sotadic Zone there is a blending of the masculine and feminine temperaments a crasis which elsewhere only occurs sporadically Arabian Nights eighteen eighty five vol x pp two hundred five two hundred fifty four The theory of the Sotadic Zone fails to account for the custom among the Normans Celts Scythians Bulgars and Tartars and moreover in various of these regions different views have prevailed at different periods Burton was wholly unacquainted with the psychological investigations into sexual inversion which had indeed scarcely begun in his day one hundred two Spectator Anthropophyteia vol vii nineteen ten referring especially to the neighborhood of Sorrento states that the southern Italians regard passive pedicatio as disgraceful but attach little or no shame to active pedicatio This indifference enables them to exploit the homosexual foreigners who are specially attracted to southern Italy in the development of a flourishing homosexual industry one hundred three It is true that in the solitude of great modern cities it is possible for small homosexual coteries to form in a certain sense an environment of their own favorable to their abnormality yet this fact hardly modifies the general statement made in the text one hundred four See especially Hirschfeld Die

inverts establish themselves outside England Paris Florence Nice Naples Cairo and other places are said to swarm with homosexual Englishmen CHAPTER II THE STUDY OF SEXUAL INVERSION Westphal Hoessli Casper Ulrichs Krafft Ebing Moll Fere Kiernan Lydston Raffalovich Edward Carpenter Hirschfeld Westphal an eminent professor of psychiatry at Berlin may be said to be the first to put the study of sexual inversion on an assured scientific basis In eighteen seventy he published in the Archiv fuer Psychiatrie of which he was for many years editor the detailed history of a young woman who from her earliest years differed from other girls she liked to dress as a boy only cared for boys games and as she grew up was sexually attracted only to women with whom she formed a series of tender relationships in which the friends obtained sexual gratification by mutual caresses while she blushed and was shy in the presence of women more especially the girl with whom she chanced to be in love she was always absolutely indifferent in the presence of men Westphal a pupil it may be noted of Griesinger who had already called attention to the high character sometimes shown by subjects of this perversion combined keen scientific insight with a rare degree of personal sympathy for those who came under his care and it was this combination of qualities which enabled him to grasp the true nature of a case such as this which by most medical men at that time would have been hastily dismissed as a vulgar instance of vice or insanity Westphal perceived that this abnormality was congenital not acquired so that it could not be termed vice and while he insisted on the presence of neurotic elements his observations showed the absence of anything that could legitimately be termed insanity He gave to this condition the name of contrary sexual feeling Kontraere Sexualempfindung by which it was long usually known in Germany The way was thus made clear for the rapid progress of our knowledge of this abnormality New cases were published in quick succession at first exclusively in Germany and more especially in Westphal s Archiv but soon in other countries also chiefly Italy and France one hundred thirteen While Westphal was the first to place the study of sexual inversion on a progressive footing many persons had previously obtained glimpses into the subject Thus in seventeen ninety one two cases were published one hundred fourteen of men who showed a typical emotional attraction to their own sex though it was not quite clearly made out that the inversion was congenital In eighteen thirty six again a Swiss writer Heinrich Hoessli published a rather diffuse but remarkable work entitled Eros which contained much material of a literary character bearing on this matter He seems to have been moved to write this book by a trial which had excited considerable attention at that time A man of good position had suddenly murdered a youth and was executed for the crime which according to Hoessli was due to homosexual love and jealousy Hoessli was not a trained scholar he was in business at Glarus as a skillful milliner the most successful in the town His own temperament is supposed to have been bisexual His book was prohibited by the local authorities and at a later period the entire remaining stock was destroyed in a fire so that its circulation was very small It is now however regarded by some as the first serious attempt to deal with the problem of homosexuality since Plato s Banquet one hundred fifteen Some years later in eighteen fifty two Casper the chief medico legal authority of his time in Germany for it is in Germany that the foundations of the study of sexual inversion have been laid pointed out in Casper s Vierteljahrsschrift that pederasty in a broad sense of the word was sometimes a kind of moral hermaphroditism due to a congenital psychic condition and also that it by no means necessarily involved sodomy immissio penis in anum Casper brought forward a considerable amount of valuable evidence concerning these cardinal points which he was the first to note one hundred sixteen but he failed to realize the full significance of his observations and they had no immediate influence though Tardieu in eighteen fifty eight admitted a congenital element in some pederasts The man however who more than anyone else brought to light the phenomena of sexual inversion had not been concerned either with the medical or the criminal aspects of the matter Karl Heinrich Ulrichs born in eighteen twenty five near Aurich who for many years expounded and defended homosexual love and whose views are said to have had some influence in drawing Westphal s attention to the matter was a Hanoverian legal official Amtsassessor himself sexually inverted From eighteen sixty four onward at first under the name of Numa Numantius and subsequently under his own name Ulrichs published in various parts of Germany a long series of works dealing with this question and made various attempts to obtain a revision of the legal position of the sexual invert in Germany Although not a writer whose psychological views can carry much scientific weight Ulrichs appears to have been a man of most brilliant ability and his knowledge is said to have been of almost universal extent he was not only well versed in his own special subjects of jurisprudence and theology but in many branches of natural science as well as in archeology he was also regarded by many as the best Latinist of his time In eighteen eighty he left Germany and settled in Naples and afterward at Aquila in the Abruzzi whence he issued a Latin periodical He died in eighteen ninety five one hundred seventeen John Addington Symonds who went to Aquila in eighteen ninety one wrote Ulrichs is chrysostomos to the last degree sweet noble a true gentleman and man of genius He must have been at one time a man of singular personal distinction so finely cut are his features and so grand the lines of his skull one hundred eighteen For many years Ulrichs was alone in his efforts to gain scientific recognition for congenital homosexuality He devised with allusion to Uranos in Plato s Symposium the word uranian or urning ever since frequently used for the homosexual lover while he called the normal heterosexual lover a dioning from Dione He regarded uranism or homosexual love as a congenital abnormality by which a female soul had become united with a male body anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa and his theoretical speculations have formed the starting point for many similar speculations His writings are remarkable in various respects although on account of the polemical warmth with which as one pleading pro domo he argued his cause they had no marked influence on scientific thought one hundred nineteen This privilege was reserved for Westphal After he had shown the way and thrown open his journal for their publication new cases appeared in rapid succession In Italy also Ritti Tamassia Lombroso and others began to study these phenomena In eighteen eighty two Charcot and Magnan published in the Archives de Neurologie the first important study which appeared in France concerning sexual inversion and allied sexual perversions They regarded sexual inversion as an episode syndrome in a more fundamental process of hereditary degeneration and compared it with such morbid obsessions as dipsomania and kleptomania From a somewhat more medico legal standpoint the study of sexual inversion in France was furthered by Brouardel and still more by Lacassagne whose stimulating influence at Lyons has produced fruitful results in the work of many pupils one hundred twenty Of much more importance in the history of the theory of sexual inversion was the work of Richard von Krafft Ebing born at Mannheim in eighteen forty and died at Graz in nineteen oh two for many years professor of psychiatry at Vienna University and one of the most distinguished alienists of his time While active in all departments of psychiatry and author of a famous textbook from eighteen seventy seven onward he took special interest in the pathology of the sexual impulse His Psychopathia Sexualis contained over two hundred histories not only of sexual inversion but of all other forms of sexual perversion For many years it was the only book on the subject and it long remained the chief storehouse of facts It passed through many editions and was translated into many languages there are two translations in English enjoying an immense and not altogether enviable vogue Krafft Ebing s methods were open to some objection His mind was not of a severely critical order He poured out the new and ever enlarged editions of his book with extraordinary rapidity sometimes remodelling them He introduced new subdivisions from time to time into his classification of sexual perversions and although this rather fine spun classification has doubtless contributed to give precision to the subject and to advance its scientific study it was at no time generally accepted Krafft Ebing s great service lay in the clinical enthusiasm with which he approached the study of sexual perversions With the firm conviction that he was conquering a great neglected field of morbid psychology which rightly belongs to the physician he accumulated without any false shame a vast mass of detailed histories and his reputation induced sexually abnormal individuals in all directions to send him their autobiographies in the desire to benefit their fellow sufferers It is as a clinician rather than as a psychologist that we must regard Krafft Ebing At the outset he considered inversion to be a functional sign of degeneration a partial manifestation of a neuropathic and psychopathic state which is in most cases hereditary This perverse sexuality appears spontaneously with the developing sexual life without external causes as the individual manifestation of an abnormal modification of the vita sexualis and must then be regarded as congenital or it develops as a result of special injurious influences working on a sexuality which had at first been normal and must then be regarded as acquired Careful investigation of these so called acquired cases however Krafft Ebing in the end finally believed would indicate that the predisposition consists in a latent homosexuality or at least bisexuality which requires for its manifestation the operation of accidental causes In the last edition of his work Krafft Ebing was inclined to regard inversion as being not so much a degeneration as a variation a simple anomaly and acknowledged that his opinion thus approximated to that which had long been held by inverts themselves one hundred twenty one At the time of his death Krafft Ebing who had begun by accepting the view at that time prevalent among alienists that homosexuality is a sign of degeneration thus fully adopted and set the seal of his authority on the view already expressed alike by some scientific investigators as well as by inverts themselves that sexual inversion is to be regarded simply as an anomaly whatever difference of opinion there might be as to the value of the anomaly The way was even opened for such a view as that of Freud and most of the psychoanalysts today who regard a strain of homosexuality as normal and almost constant with a profound significance for the psychonervous life In eighteen ninety one doctor Albert Moll of Berlin published his work Die Kontraere Sexualempfindung which subsequently appeared in much enlarged and revised editions It speedily superseded all previous books as a complete statement and judicious discussion of sexual inversion Moll was not content merely to present fresh clinical material He attacked the problem which had now become of primary importance the nature and causes of sexual inversion He discussed the phenomena as a psychologist even more than as a physician bearing in mind the broader aspects of the problem keenly critical of accepted opinions but judiciously cautious in the statement of conclusions He cleared away various ancient prejudices and superstitions which even Krafft Ebing sometimes incautiously repeated He accepted the generally received doctrine that the sexually inverted usually belong to families in which various nervous and mental disorders prevail but he pointed out at the same time that it is not in all cases possible to prove that we are concerned with individuals possessing a hereditary neurotic taint He also rejected any minute classification of sexual inverts only recognizing psycho sexual hermaphroditism and homosexuality At the same time he cast doubt on the existence of acquired homosexuality in a strict sense except in occasional cases and he pointed out that even when a normal heterosexual impulse appears at puberty and a homosexual impulse later it may still be the former that was acquired and the latter that was inborn In America attention had been given to the phenomena at a fairly early period Mention may be specially made of J G Kiernan and G Frank Lydston both of whom put forward convenient classifications of homosexual manifestations some thirty years ago one hundred twenty two More recently nineteen eleven an American writer under the pseudonym of Xavier Mayne privately printed an extensive work entitled The Intersexes A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social Life popularly written and compiled from many sources This book from a subjective and scarcely scientific standpoint claims that homosexual relationships are natural necessary and legitimate one hundred twenty three In England the first attempts to deal seriously from the modern point of view with the problem of homosexuality came late and were either published privately or abroad In eighteen eighty three John Addington Symonds privately printed his discussion of paiderastia in ancient Greece under the title of A Problem in Greek Ethics and in eighteen eighty nine eighteen ninety he further wrote and in eighteen ninety one privately printed A Problem of Modern Ethics Being an Enquiry into the Phenomena of Sexual Inversion In eighteen eighty six Sir Richard Burton added to his translation of the Arabian Nights a Terminal Essay on the same subject In eighteen ninety four Edward Carpenter privately printed in Manchester a pamphlet entitled Homogenic Love in which he criticised various psychiatric views of inversion at that time current and claimed that the laws of homosexual love are the same as those of heterosexual love urging however that the former possesses a special aptitude to be exalted to a higher and more spiritual level of comradeship so fulfilling a beneficent social function More recently nineteen oh seven Edward Carpenter published a volume of papers on homosexuality and its problems under the title of The Intermediate Sex and later nineteen fourteen a more special study of the invert in early religion and in warfare Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk In eighteen ninety six the most comprehensive book so far written on the subject in England was published in French by mister Andre Raffalovich in Lacassagne s Bibliotheque de Criminologie Uranisme et Unisexualite This book dealt chiefly with congenital inversion publishing no new cases but revealing a wide knowledge of the matter Raffalovich put forward many just and sagacious reflections on the nature and treatment of inversion and the attitude of society toward perverted sexuality The historical portions of the book which are of special interest deal largely with the remarkable prevalence of inversion in England neglected by previous investigators Raffalovich whose attitude is on the whole philosophical rather than scientific regards congenital inversion as a large and inevitable factor in human life but taking the Catholic standpoint he condemns all sexuality either heterosexual or homosexual and urges the invert to restrain the physical manifestations of his instinct and to aim at an ideal of chastity On the whole it may be said that the book is the work of a thinker who has reached his own results in his own way and those results bear an imprint of originality and freedom from tradition In recent years no one has so largely contributed to place our knowledge of sexual inversion on a broad and accurate basis as doctor Magnus Hirschfeld of Berlin who possesses an unequalled acquaintance with the phenomena of homosexuality in all their aspects He has studied the matter exhaustively in Germany and to some extent in other countries also he has received the histories of a thousand inverts he is said to have met over ten thousand homosexual persons As editor of the Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen which he established in eighteen ninety nine and author of various important monographs more especially on transitional psychic and physical stages between masculinity and femininity Hirschfeld had already contributed greatly to the progress of investigation in this field before the appearance in nineteen fourteen of his great work Die Homosexualitaet des Mannes und des Weibes This is not only the largest but the most precise detailed and comprehensive even the most condensed work which has yet appeared on the subject It is indeed an encyclopedia of homosexuality For such a task Hirschfeld had been prepared by many years of strenuous activity as a physician an investigator a medico legal expert before the courts and his position as president of the Wissenschaftlich humanitaeren Komitee which is concerned with the defense of the interests of the homosexual in Germany In Hirschfeld s book the pathological conception of inversion has entirely disappeared homosexuality is regarded as primarily a biological phenomenon of universal extension and secondarily as a social phenomenon of serious importance There is no attempt to invent new theories the main value of Hirschfeld s work lies indeed in the constant endeavor to keep close to definite facts It is this quality which renders the book an indispensable source for all who seek enlightened and precise information on this question Even the existence of such a treatise as this of Hirschfeld s is enough to show how rapidly the study of this subject has grown A few years ago for instance when doctor Paul Moreau wrote his Aberrations du Sens Genesique sexual inversion was scarcely even a name It was a loathsome and nameless vice only to be touched with a pair of tongs rapidly and with precautions As it now presents itself it is a psychological and medico legal problem so full of interest that we need not fear to face it and so full of grave social actuality that we are bound to face it FOOTNOTES one hundred thirteen In England aberration of the sexual instinct or the tendency of men to feminine occupations and of women to masculine occupations had been referred to in the Medical Times and Gazette February nine eighteen sixty seven Sir G Savage first described a case of Sexual Perversion in the Journal of Mental Science vol xxx

a very early age in spite of all provocations to the normal attitude And if this inclination were not natural he makes Sarmiento say would the impression of it be received in childhood Let us study

Impulse in Early Life The Freudian View Homosexuality in Schools The Question of Acquired Homosexuality Latent Inversion Retarded Inversion Bisexuality The Question of the Invert s Truthfulness Histories When the sexual instinct first appears in early youth it is much less specialized than normally it becomes later Not only is it at the outset less definitely directed to a specific sexual end but even the sex of its object is sometimes uncertain one hundred twenty four This has always been so well recognized that those in authority over young men have sometimes forced women upon them to avoid the risk of possible unnatural offenses one hundred twenty five The institution which presents these phenomena to us in the most marked and the most important manner is naturally the school in England especially the Public School In France where the same phenomena are noted Tarde called attention to these relationships most usually Platonic in the primitive meaning of the word which indicate a simple indecision of frontier between friendship and love still undifferentiated in the dawn of the awakening heart and he regretted that no one had studied them In England we are very familiar with vague allusions to the vices of public schools From time to time we read letters in the newspapers denouncing public schools as hot beds of vice and one anonymous writer remarks that some of our public schools almost provoke the punishment of the cities of the Plain one hundred twenty six But these allegations are rarely or never submitted to accurate investigation The physicians and masters of public schools who are in a position to study the matter usually possess no psychological training and appear to view homosexuality with too much disgust to care to pay any careful attention to it What knowledge they possess they keep to themselves for it is considered to be in the interests of public schools that these things should be hushed up When anything very scandalous occurs one or two lads are expelled to their own grave and perhaps lifelong injury and without benefit to those who remain whose awakening sexual life rarely receives intelligent sympathy In several of the Histories which follow in this chapter as well as in Histories contained in other volumes of these Studies details will be found concerning homosexuality as it occurs in English schools public or private See also the study Auto erotism in vol i The prevalence of homosexual and erotic phenomena in schools varies greatly at different schools and at different times in the same school while in small private schools such phenomena may be entirely unknown As an English schoolboy I never myself saw or heard anything of such practices and in Germany Professor Gurlitt Die Neue Generation January nineteen oh nine among others testifies to similar absence of experience during his whole school life although there was much talk and joking among the boys over sexual things I have added some observations by a correspondent whose experiences of English public school life are still recent In the years I was a member of a public school I saw and heard a good deal of homosexuality though till my last two years I did not understand its meaning As a prefect I discussed with other prefects the methods of checking it and of punishing it when detected My own observations supported by those of others led me to think that the fault of the usual method of dealing with homosexuality in schools is that it regards all school homosexualists as being in one class together and has only one way of dealing with them the birch for a first offense expulsion for a second Now I think we may distinguish three classes of school homosexualists a A very small number who are probably radically inverted and who do not scruple to sacrifice young and innocent boys to their passions These and these only are a real moral danger to others and I believe them to be rare b Boys of various ages who having been initiated into the passive part in their young days continue practices of an active or passive kind but only with boys already known to be homosexualists they draw the line at corrupting fresh victims This class realize more or less what they are about but cannot be called a danger to the morals of pure boys c Young boys who whether in the development of their own physical nature or by the instruction of older boys of the class a find out the pleasures of masturbation or intercrural connection I never heard of a case of pedicatio at my school and only once of fellatio which was attempted on a quite young boy who complained to his house master and the offender was expelled Boys in this class have probably little or no idea of what sexual morality means and can hardly be accused of a moral offense at all I submit that these three classes should receive quite different treatment Expulsion may occasionally be necessary for class a but the few who belong to this class are usually too cunning to get caught It used to be notorious at school that it was almost always the wrong people who got dropped on I do not think a boy in the other two classes should ever be expelled and even when expulsion is unavoidable it should if possible be deferred till the end of the term so as to make it indistinguishable from an ordinary departure After all there is no reason to ruin a boy s prospects because he is a little beast at sixteen there are very few hopeless incorrigibles at that age As regards the other two classes I should begin by giving boys very much fuller enlightenment on sexual subjects than is usually done before they go to a public school at all Either a boy is pitchforked into the place in utter innocence and ignorance and yields to temptations to do things which he vaguely if at all realizes are wrong and that only because a puzzling sort of instinct tells him so or else he is given just enough information to whet his curiosity usually in the shape of warnings against certain apparently harmless bodily acts which he not unnaturally tries out of curiosity and finds them very pleasant It may be undesirable that a boy should have full knowledge at the time he goes to school but it is more undesirable that he should go with a burning curiosity or a total ignorance on the subject I am convinced that much might be done in the way of prevention if boys were told more and allowed to be open Much of the pleasure of sexual talk among boys I believe to be due to the spurious interest aroused by the fact that it is forbidden fruit and involves risk if caught It seems to me that frankness is far more moral than suggestion I would not expurgate school editions of great authors the frank obscenity of parts of Shakespeare is far less immoral than the prurient prudishness which declines to print it but numbers the lines in such a way that the boy can go home and look up the omitted passage in a complete edition with a distinct sense of guilt which is where the harm comes in It is probable that only a small proportion of homosexual boys in schools can properly be described as vicious A Hoche describing homosexuality in German schools Zuer Frage der forensischen Beurteilung sexuellen Vergehen Neurologisches Centralblatt eighteen ninety six No two and putting together communications received from various medical men regarding their own youthful experiences at school finds relationships of the kind very common usually between boys of different ages and school classes According to one observer the feminine or passive part was always played by a boy of girlish form and complexion and the relationships were somewhat like those of normal lovers with kissing poems love letters scenes of jealousy sometimes visits to each other in bed but without masturbation pederasty or other grossly physical manifestations From his own youthful experience Hoche records precisely similar observations and remarks that the lovers were by no means recruited from the vicious elements in the school The elder scholars of twenty one or twenty two years of age formed regular sexual relationships with the servant girls in the house It is probable that the homosexual relationships in English schools are as a rule not more vicious than those described by Hoche but that the concealment in which they are wrapped leads to exaggeration In the course of a discussion on this matter over thirty years ago Olim Etoniensis wrote Journal of Education eighteen eighty two p eighty five that on making a list of the vicious boys he had known at Eton he found that these very boys had become cabinet ministers statesmen officers clergymen country gentlemen et cetera and that they are nearly all of them fathers of thriving families respected and prosperous But as Marro has remarked the question is not thus settled Public distinction by no means necessarily implies any fine degree of private morality Sometimes the manifestations thus appearing in schools or wherever youths are congregated together are not truly homosexual but exhibit a more or less brutal or even sadistic perversion of the immature sexual instinct This may be illustrated by the following narrative concerning a large London city warehouse A youth left my class at the age of one hundred sixty one two writes a correspondent to take up an apprenticeship in a large wholesale firm in G Street Fortunately he went on probation of three weeks before articling He came to me at the end of the first week asking me to intercede with his mother he had no father not to let him return He told me that almost nightly and especially when new fellows came the youths in his dormitory eleven in number would waylay him hold him down and rub his parts to the tune of some comic song or dance music The boy who could choose the fastest time had the privilege of performing the operation and most had to be the victim in turn unless new boys entered when they would sometimes be subjected to this for a week This boy having been brought up strictly was shocked dazed and alarmed but they stopped him from calling out and he dared not report it Most boys entered direct on their apprenticeship without probation and had no chance to get out I procured the boy s release from the place and gave the manager to understand what went on In such a case as this it has usually happened that a strong boy of brutal and perverse instincts and some force of character initiates proceedings which the others either fall into with complacency or are too weak to resist Max Dessoir one hundred twenty seven came to the conclusion that an undifferentiated sexual feeling is normal on the average during the first years of puberty i e from thirteen to fifteen in boys and from twelve to fourteen in girls while in later years it must be regarded as pathological He added very truly that in this early period the sexual emotion has not become centered in the sexual organs This latter fact is certainly far too often forgotten by grown up persons who suspect the idealized passion of boys and girls of a physical side which children have often no suspicion of and would view with repulsion and horror How far the sexual instinct may be said to be undifferentiated in early puberty as regards sex is a little doubtful It is comparatively undifferentiated but except in rare cases it is not absolutely undifferentiated We have to admit however that in the opinion of the latest physiologists of sex such as Castle Heape and Marshall each sex contains the latent characters of the other or recessive sex Each sex is latent in the other and each as it contains the characters of both sexes and can transmit those of the recessive sex is latently hermaphrodite A homosexual tendency may thus be regarded as simply the psychical manifestation of special characters of the recessive sex susceptible of being evolved under changed circumstances such as may occur near puberty and associated with changed metabolism one hundred twenty eight William James Principles of Psychology vol ii p four hundred thirty nine considered inversion a kind of sexual appetite of which very likely most men possess the germinal possibility Conolly Norman Article Sexual Perversion Tuke s Dictionary of Psychological Medicine also stated that the sexual passion at its first appearance is always indefinite and is very easily turned in a wrong direction and he apparently accounted for inversion by this fact and by the precocity of neurotics Obici and Marchesini Le Amicizie di collegio p one hundred twenty six refer to the indeterminate character of the sexual feelings when they first begin to develop A correspondent believes that sexual feelings are undifferentiated in the early years about puberty but at the same time considers that school life is to some extent responsible the holidays he adds are sufficiently long to counteract it however provided the boy has sisters and they have friends the change from school fare and work to home naturally results in a greater surplus of nerve force and I think most boys fool about with servants or their sisters friends Moll Kontraere Sexualempfindung eighteen eighty nine pp six and three hundred fifty six does not think it proved that a stage of undifferentiated sexual feeling always occurs although we have to recognize that it is of frequent occurrence In his later work nineteen oh nine Das Sexualleben des Kindes English translation The Sexual Life of the Child ch iv Moll remains of the same opinion that a homosexual tendency is very frequent in normal children whose later development is quite normal it begins between the ages of seven and ten or even at five and may last to twenty In recent years Freud has accepted and developed the conception of the homosexual strain as normal in early life Thus in nineteen oh five in his Bruchstueck einer Hysterie Analyse reprinted in the second series of Sammlung Kleiner Schriften zur Neurosenlehre nineteen oh nine Freud regards it as a well known fact that boys and girls at puberty normally show plain signs of the existence of a homosexual tendency Under favorable circumstances this tendency is overcome but when a happy heterosexual love is not established it remains liable to reappear under the influence of an appropriate stimulus In the neurotic these homosexual germs are more highly developed I have never carried through any psychoanalysis of a man or a woman Freud states without discovering a very significant homosexual tendency Ferenczi again Jahrbuch fuer Psychoanalytische Forschungen Bd iii nineteen eleven p one hundred nineteen without reference to any physical basis of the impulse accepts the psychic capacity of the child to direct his originally objectless eroticism to one or both sexes and terms this disposition ambisexuality The normality of a homosexual element in early life may be said to be accepted by most psychoanalysts even of the schools that are separated from Freud Stekel would go farther and regards various psychic sexual anomalies as signs of a concealed bisexual tendency psychic impotence the admiration of men for masculine women and of women for feminine men various forms of fetichism they are all masks of homosexuality Stekel Zentralblatt fuer Psychoanalyse vol ii April nineteen twelve These schoolboy affections and passions arise to a large extent spontaneously with the evolution of the sexual emotions though the method of manifestation may be a matter of example or suggestion As the sexual emotions become stronger and as the lad leaves school or college to mix with men and women in the world the instinct usually turns into the normal channel in which channel the instincts of the majority of boys have been directed from the earliest appearance of puberty if not earlier But a certain proportion remain insensitive to the influence of women and these may be regarded as true sexual inverts Some of them are probably individuals of somewhat undeveloped sexual instincts The members of this group are of some interest psychologically although from the comparative quiescence of their sexual emotions they have received little attention The following communication which I have received from a well accredited source is noteworthy from this point of view The following facts may possibly be of interest to you though my statement of them is necessarily general and vague I happen to know intimately three cases of men whose affections have chiefly been directed exclusively to persons of their own sex The first having practised masturbation as a boy and then for some ten years ceased to practise it to such an extent that he even inhibited his erotic dreams has since recurred to it deliberately at about fortnightly intervals as a substitute for copulation for which he has never felt the least desire But occasionally when sleeping with a male friend he has emissions in the act of embracing The second is constantly and to an abnormal extent I should say troubled with erotic dreams and emissions and takes drugs by doctor s advice to reduce this activity He has recently developed a sexual interest in women but for ethical and other reasons does not copulate with them Of the third I can say little as he has not talked to me on the subject but I know that he has never had intercourse with women and has always had a natural and instinctive repulsion to the idea In all these I imagine the physical impulse of sex is less imperative than in the average man The emotional impulse on the other hand is very strong It has given birth to friendships of which I find no adequate description anywhere but in the dialogues of Plato and beyond a certain feeling of strangeness at the gradual discovery of a temperament apparently different to that of most men it has provoked no kind of self reproach or shame On the contrary the feeling has been rather one of elation in the consciousness of a capacity of affection which appears to be finer and more spiritual than that which commonly subsists between persons of different sexes These men are all of intellectual capacity above the average and one is actively engaged in the world where he is both respected for his capacity and admired for his character I mention this particularly because it appears to be the habit in books upon this subject to regard the relation in question as pathological and to select cases where those who are concerned in it are tormented with shame and remorse In the cases to which I am referring nothing of the kind subsists In all these cases a physical sexual attraction is recognized as the basis of the relation but as a matter of feeling and partly also of theory the ascetic ideal is adopted These are the only cases with which I am personally and intimately acquainted But no one can have passed through a public school and college life without constantly observing indications of the phenomenon in question It is clear to me that in a large number of instances there is no fixed line between what is called distinctively friendship and love and it is probably the influence of custom and public opinion that in most cases finally specializes the physical passion in the direction of the opposite sex The classification of the varieties of homosexuality is a matter of difficulty and no classification is very fundamental The early attempts of Krafft Ebing and others at elaborate classification are no longer acceptable Even the most elementary groupings become doubtful when we have definitely to fit our cases into them The old distinction between congenital and acquired homosexuality has ceased to possess significance When we have recognized that there is a tendency for homosexuality to arise in persons of usually normal tendency who are placed under conditions as on board ship or in prison where the exercise of normal sexuality is impossible there is little further classification to be achieved along this line one hundred twenty nine We have gone as far as is necessary by admitting a general undefined homosexuality a relationship of unspecified nature to persons of the same sex in addition to the more specific sexual inversion one hundred thirty It may now be said to be recognized by all authorities even by Freud who emphasizes a special psychological mechanism by which homosexuality may become established that a congenital predisposition as well as an acquired tendency is necessary to constitute true inversion apparent exceptions being too few to carry much weight Krafft Ebing Naecke Iwan Bloch who at one time believed in the possibility of acquired inversion all finally abandoned that view and even Schrenck Notzing a vigorous champion of the doctrine of acquired inversion twenty years ago admits the necessity of a favoring predisposition an admission which renders the distinction between innate and acquired an unimportant if not a merely verbal distinction one hundred thirty one Supposing indeed that we are prepared to admit that true inversion may be purely acquired the decision in any particular case must be extremely difficult and I have found very few cases which even with imperfect knowledge could fairly so be termed Even the cases to which Schopenhauer long since referred in which inversion is only established late in life are no longer regarded as constituting a difficulty in accepting the doctrine of the congenital nature of inversion in such cases the inversion is merely retarded The conception of retarded inversion that is to say a latent congenital inversion becoming manifest at a late period in life was first brought forward by Thoinot in eighteen ninety eight in his Attentats aux Moeurs in order to supersede the unsatisfactory conception as he considered it to be of acquired inversion Thoinot regarded retarded inversion as relatively rare and of no great importance but more accessible to therapeutic measures Three years later Krafft Ebing toward the close of his life adopted the same conception the cases to which he applied it were all he considered of bisexual disposition and usually also marked by sexual hyperesthesia This way of looking at the matter was speedily championed by Naecke and may now be said to be widely accepted one hundred thirty two Moll earlier than Thoinot had pointed out that it is difficult to believe that homosexuality in late life can ever be produced without at least some inborn weakness of the heterosexual impulse and that we must not deny the possibility of heredity even when homosexuality appears at the age of fifty or sixty one hundred thirty three Moll believes it is very doubtful whether heterosexual satiety alone can ever suffice to produce homosexuality Naecke was careful to set aside the cases to which much significance was once attached in which old men with failing sexual powers or younger men exhausted by heterosexual debauchery are attracted to boys In such cases which include the majority of those appearing late Naecke regarded the inversion as merely spurious the faute de mieux of persons no longer apt for normal sexual activity Such cases no doubt need more careful psychological study than they usually receive Fere once investigated a case of this kind in which a healthy young man though with slightly neurotic heredity on one side practised sexual intercourse excessively between the ages of twenty and twenty three often impelled more by amour propre or what Adler would term the masculine protest of the organically inferior than sexual desire and then suddenly became impotent at the same time losing all desire but without any other loss of health Six months later potency slowly returned though never to the same extent and he married At the age of thirty five symptoms of locomotor ataxia began to appear and some years later he again became impotent but without losing sexual desire Suddenly one day on sitting in close contact with a young man at a table d hote he experienced a violent erection he afterward found that the same thing occurred with other young men and though he had no psychic desire for men he was constrained to seek such contact and a repugnance for women and their sexuality arose Five months later a complete paraplegic impotence set in and then both the homosexual tendency and the aversion to women disappeared Fere L Instinct Sexuel p one hundred eighty four In such a case under the influence of disease excessive stimulation seems to result in more or less complete sexual anesthesia just as temporarily we may be more or less blinded by excess of light and functional power reasserts itself under the influence of a different and normally much weaker stimulus Leppmann who has studied the homosexual manifestations of previously normal old men toward boys Greisenalter und Kriminalitaet Zeitschrift fuer Psychotherapie Bd i Heft four nineteen oh nine considers the chief factor to be a flaring up of the sexual impulse in a perverted direction in an early stage of morbid cerebral disturbance not amounting to insanity and not involving complete irresponsibility In such cases Leppmann believes the subject may through his lack of power be brought back to the beginning of his sexual life and to the perhaps unconsciously homosexual attractions of that age With the recognition that homosexuality in youth may be due to an as yet undifferentiated sexual impulse homosexuality in mature age to a retarded development on a congenital basis and homosexuality in sold age to a return to the attitude of youth the area of spurious or pseudo homosexuality seems to me to be very much restricted Most perhaps all authorities still accept the reality of this spurious homosexuality in heterosexual persons But they enter into no details concerning it and they bring forward no minutely observed cases in which it occurred Hirschfeld in discussing the diagnosis of homosexuality and seeking to distinguish genuine from spurious inverts one hundred thirty four enumerates three classes of the latter one those who practise homosexuality for purposes of gain more especially male prostitutes and blackmailers two persons who from motives of pity good nature friendship et cetera allow themselves to be the objects of homosexual desire three normal persons who when excluded from the society of the opposite sex as in schools barracks on board ship or in prison have sexual relations with persons of their own sex Now Hirschfeld clearly realizes that the mere sexual act is no proof of the direction of the sexual impulse it may be rendered possible by mechanical irritation as by the stimulation of a full bladder and in women without any stimulation at all such cases can have little psychological significance Moreover he seems to admit that some subdivisions of his first class are true inverts He further mentions that some seventy five per cent of the individuals included in these classes are between fifteen and twenty five years of age that is to say that they have scarcely emerged from the period when we have reason to believe that in a large number of individuals at all events the sexual impulse is not yet definitely differentiated so that neither its homosexual nor its heterosexual tendencies can properly be regarded as spurious If indeed we really accept the very reasonable view that the basis of the sexual life is bisexual although its direction may be definitely fixed in a heterosexual or homosexual direction at a very early period in life it becomes difficult to see how we can any longer speak with certainty of a definitely spurious class of homosexual persons Everyone of Hirschfeld s three classes may well contain a majority of genuinely homosexual or bisexual persons The prostitutes and even the blackmailers are certainly genuine inverts in very many cases Those persons again who allow themselves to be the recipients of homosexual attentions may well possess traces of homosexual feeling and are undoubtedly in very many cases lacking in vigorous heterosexual impulse Finally the persons who turn to their own sex when forcibly excluded from the society of the opposite sex can by no means be assumed without question to be normal heterosexual persons It is only a small proportion of heterosexual persons who experience these impulses under such conditions There are always others who under the same conditions remain emotionally attracted to the opposite sex and sexually indifferent to their own sex There is evidently a difference and that difference may most reasonably be supposed to be in the existence of a trace of homosexual feeling which is called into activity under the abnormal conditions and subsides when the stronger heterosexual impulse can again be gratified The real distinction would seem therefore to be between a homosexual impulse so strong that it subsists even in the presence of the heterosexual object and a homosexual impulse so weak that it is eclipsed by the presence of the heterosexual object We could not however properly speak of the latter as any more spurious or pseudo than the former A heterosexual person who experiences a homosexual impulse in the absence of any homosexual disposition is not today easy to accept We can certainly accept the possibility of a mechanical or other non sexual stimulus leading to a sexual act contrary to the individual s disposition But usually it is somewhat difficult to prove and when proved it has little psychological significance or importance We may expect therefore to find pseudo homosexuality or spurious homosexuality playing a dwindling part in classification The simplest of all possible classifications and that which I adopted in the earlier editions of the present Study merely seeks to distinguish between those who not being exclusively attracted to the opposite sex are exclusively attracted to the same sex and those who are attracted to both sexes The first are the homosexual whether or not the attraction springs from genuine inversion The second are the bisexual or as they were formerly more often termed following Krafft Ebing psycho sexual hermaphrodites one hundred thirty five There would thus seem to be a broad and simple grouping of all sexually functioning persons into three comprehensive divisions the heterosexual the bisexual and the homosexual Even this elementary classification seems however of no great practical use The bisexual group is found to introduce uncertainty and doubt Not only a large proportion of persons who may fairly be considered normally heterosexual have at some time in their lives experienced a feeling which may be termed sexual toward individuals of their own sex but a very large proportion of persons who are definitely and markedly homosexual are found to have experienced sexual attraction toward and have had relationships with persons of the opposite sex The social pressure urging all persons into the normal sexual channel suffices to develop such slight germs of heterosexuality as homosexual persons may possess and so to render them bisexual In the majority of adult bisexual persons it would seem that the homosexual tendency is stronger and more organic than the heterosexual tendency Bisexuality would thus in a large number of cases be comparable to ambidexterity which Biervliet has found to occur most usually in people who are organically left handed one hundred thirty six While therefore the division into heterosexual bisexual and homosexual is a useful superficial division it is scarcely a scientific classification In the face of these various considerations and in view of the fact that while I feel justified in regarding the histories of my cases as reliable so far as they go I have not been always able to explore them extensively it has seemed best to me to attempt no classification at all The order in which the following histories appear is not therefore to be regarded as possessing any significance It may be proper at this point to say a few words as to the reliability of the statements furnished by homosexual persons This has sometimes been called in question Many years ago we used to be told that inverts are such lying and deceitful degenerates that it was impossible to place reliance on anything they said It was also usual to say that when they wrote autobiographical accounts of themselves they merely sought to mold them in the fashion of those published by Krafft Ebing More recently the psychoanalysts have made a more radical attack on all histories not obtained by their own methods as being quite unreliable even when put forth in good faith in part because the subject withholds much that he either regards as too trivial or too unpleasant to bring forward and in part because he cannot draw on that unconscious field within himself wherein it is held the most significant facts in his own sexual history are concealed Thus Sadger Ueber den Wert der Autobiographien Sexuell Perverser Fortschritte der Medizin nos twenty six twenty eight nineteen thirteen vigorously puts forward this view and asserts that the autobiographies of inverts are worthless although his assertions are somewhat discounted by the fact that they accompany an autobiography written in the usual manner to which he attributes much value The objection to homosexual autobiographic statements dates from a period when the homosexual were very little known and it was supposed that their moral character generally was fairly represented by a small section among them which attracted more attention than the rest by reason of discreditable conduct But in reality as we now know there are all sorts of people with all varieties of moral character to be found among inverts just as among normal people Sadger Archiv fuer Kriminal Anthropologie nineteen thirteen p one hundred ninety nine complains of the great insincerity of inverts in not acknowledging their inversion but as Sadger himself admits we cannot be surprised at this so long as inversion is counted a crime The most normal persons under similar conditions would be similarly insincere If the homosexual differ in any respect under this aspect from the heterosexual it is by exhibiting a more frequent tendency to be slightly neuropathic nervously sensitive and femininely emotional These tendencies while on the one hand they are liable to induce a very easily detectable vanity may also lead to an unusual self subordination to veracity On the whole it may be said in my own experience that the best histories written by the homosexual compare favorably for frankness intelligence and power of self analysis with those written by the heterosexual The ancient allegation that inverts have written their own histories on the model or under the suggestion of those published in Krafft Ebing s Psychopathia Sexualis can scarcely have much force now that the published histories are so extremely varied and numerous that they cannot possibly produce any uniform impression on the most sensitively receptive mind As a matter of fact there is no doubt that inverts have frequently been stimulated to set down the narrative of their own experiences through reading those written by others But the stimulation has as often as not lain in the fact that their own experiences have seemed different not that they have seemed identical The histories that they read only serve as models in the sense that they indicate the points on which information is desired I have often been able to verify this influence which would in any case seem to be fairly obvious Psycho analysis is in theory an ideal method of exploring many psychic conditions such as hysteria and obsessions which are obscure and largely concealed beneath the psychic surface In most homosexual cases the main facts are with the patient s good will and the investigator s tact not difficult to ascertain Any difficulties which psychoanalysis may help to elucidate mainly concern the early history of the case in childhood and regarding these psychoanalysis may sometimes raise questions which it cannot definitely settle Psycho analysis reveals an immense mass of small details any of which may or may not possess significance and in determining which are significant the individuality of the psychoanalyst cannot fail to come into play He will necessarily tend to arrange them according to a system If for instance he regards infantile incestuous emotions or early Narcissism as an essential feature of the mechanism of homosexuality a conscientious investigator will not rest until he has discovered traces of them as he very probably will See e g Sadger Fragment der Psychoanalyse eines Homosexuellen Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen Bd ix nineteen oh eight and cf Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p one hundred sixty four But the exact weight and significance of these traces may still be doubtful and even if considerable in one case may be inconsiderable in another Freud who sets forth one type of homosexual mechanism admits that there may be others Moreover it must be added that the psychoanalytic method by no means excludes unconscious deception by the subject as Freud found and so was compelled to admit the patient s tendency to fantasy as Adler has to fictions as a fundamental psychic tendency of the unconscious The force of these considerations is now beginning to be generally recognized Thus Moll art Homosexualitaet in fourth ed of Eulenburg s Realencyclopaedie der gesamten Heilkunde nineteen oh nine p six hundred eleven rightly says that while the invert may occasionally embroider his story the expert can usually distinguish between the truth and the poetry though it is unnecessary to add that complete confidence on the patient s part is necessary Naecke again Sexual Probleme September nineteen eleven p six hundred nineteen after quoting with approval the remark of one of the chief German authorities doctor Numa Praetorius that a great number of inverts histories are at the least as trustworthy as the attempts of psychoanalysts especially when they come from persons skillful in self analysis adds that even Freudian analysis gives no absolute guarantee for truth A healthy skepticism is justifiable but not an unhealthy skepticism Hirschfeld also Die Homosexualitaet p one hundred sixty four whose knowledge of such histories is unrivalled remarks that while we may now and then meet with a case of pseudo logia fantastica in connection with psychic debility on the basis of a psychopathic constitution taken all in all any generalized assertion of the falsehood of inverts is an empty fiction and is merely a sign that the physicians who make it have not been able to win the trust of the men and women who consult them My own experience has fully convinced me of the truth of this statement I am assured that many of the inverts I have met not only possess a rare power of intellectual self analysis stimulated by the constant and inevitable contrast between their own feelings and those of the world around them but an unsparing sincerity in that self analysis not so very often attained by normal people The histories which follow have been obtained in various ways and are of varying degrees of value Some are of persons whom I have known very well for very long periods and concerning whom I can speak very positively A few are from complete strangers whose good faith however I judge from internal evidence that I am able to accept Two or three were written by persons who though educated in one case a journalist had never heard of inversion and imagined that their own homosexual feelings were absolutely unique in the world A fair number were written by persons whom I do not myself know but who are well known to others in whose judgment I feel confidence Perhaps the largest number are concerned with individuals who wrote to me spontaneously in the first place and whom I have at intervals seen or heard from since in some cases during a very long period so that I have slowly been able to fill in their histories although the narratives as finally completed may have the air of being written down at a single sitting I have not admitted any narrative which I do not feel that I am entitled to regard as a substantially accurate statement of the facts although allowance must occasionally be made for the emotional coloring of these facts the invert sometimes cherishing too high an opinion and sometimes too low an opinion of his own personality HISTORY I Both parents healthy father of unusually fine physique He is himself a manual worker and also of exceptionally fine physique He is however of nervous temperament He is mentally bright though not

none	none	a keen sportsman and in general a good example of an all around healthy Englishman While very affectionate his sexual desires are not strongly developed on the physical side and seem never to have been so He sometimes masturbated about the age of puberty but never afterward He does not appear to have well marked erotic dreams There used to be some attraction toward women though it was never strong At the age of twenty six he was seduced by a woman and had connection with her once Afterward he had reason to think she had played him false in various ways This induced the strongest antipathy not only to this woman but to all marriageable women A year after this episode homosexual feeling first became clear and defined He is now thirty three and feels the same antipathy to women he hates even to speak of marriage There has only been one really strong attraction toward a man of about the same age but of different social class and somewhat a contrast to him both physically and mentally So far as the physical act is concerned this relationship is not definitely sexual but it is of the most intimate possible kind and the absence of the physical act is probably largely due to circumstances At the same time there is no conscious desire for the act for its own sake and the existing harmony and satisfaction are described as very complete There is no repulsion to the physical side and he regards the whole relationship as quite natural HISTORY II B O English aged thirty five missionary abroad A brother is more definitely inverted B O has never had any definitely homosexual relationships although he has always been devoted to boys nor has he had any relationships with women As regards women he says I feel I have not the patience to try and understand them they are petulant and changeable et cetera He objects to being called abnormal and thinks that people like himself are extremely common I have never wanted to kiss boys he writes nor to handle them in any way except to put my arm around them at their studies and at other similar times Of course with really little boys it is different but boys and girls under fourteen seem to me much alike and I can love either equally well As to any sort of sexual connection between myself and one of my own sex I cannot think of it otherwise than with disgust I can imagine great pleasure in having connection with a woman but their natures do not attract me Indeed my liking for my own sex seems to consist almost entirely in a preference for the masculine character and the feeling that as an object to look at the male body is really more beautiful than the female When any strong temptations to sexual passion come over me in my waking moments it is of women I think On the other hand I have to confess that after being with some lad I love for an hour or two I have sometimes felt my sexual organs roused But only once in my life have I experienced a strong desire to sleep in the same bed with a particular lad and even then no idea of doing anything entered my mind Needless to say I did not sleep with him I never feel tempted by any girls here although I see so many with their bodies freely exposed and plenty of them have really pretty faces Neither do I feel tempted to do anything improper with any of the boys although I frequently sit talking with one who has very little on But I find the constant sight of well shaped bare limbs has a curious effect on the mind and comes before one s imagination as a picture at unlooked for times But the most curious thing of all is this There are several lads here of whom I am very fond Now when they are near me I think of them with only the purest and most tender feelings but sometimes at night when I am half asleep or when I am taking my midday siesta my imagination pictures one of these lads approaching a girl or actually lying with her and the strange thing is that I do not feel any desire myself to approach the girl but I feel I wish I were in her place and the lad was coming to me In my calm waking moments it disgusts and rather horrifies me to find myself apparently so unsexed yet such is the fact and the experience with only slight changes repeats itself over and over again It is not that I as a man wish even in imagination to act improperly with a boy but I feel I would like to be in the girl s place and the strange thing is that in all these dreams and imaginings I can always apparently enter into the feelings of the woman better than into those of the man Sometimes I fancy for a moment that perhaps reincarnation is true and I was a woman in my last life Sometimes I fancy that when I was in the womb I was formed as a girl and the sexual organs changed just at the last moment It is a curious problem Don t think I worry about it Only at long intervals do I think of it The thing has its bright side Boys and men seem to have tender feelings toward me such as one expects them to have for members of the opposite sex and I get into all the closer contact with them in consequence HISTORY III F R English aged fifty Belongs on both sides to healthy normal families of more than average ability Father was thirty five at birth and mother twenty seven He is the second of four children There was a considerable interval between the births of the children which were spread over twenty one years All are normal except F R two of them married and with families Owing to the difference of age between the children F R who was three years younger than his elder brother and more than four years older than his sister the third child had no male companionship and was constantly alone with his mother Being naturally imitative he remarks I think I acquired her tastes and interests and habits of thought However that may be I feel sure that my interests and amusements were more girlish than boyish By way of illustration I may mention that I have often been told by a friend of my mother s that on one occasion I was wanting a new hat and none being found of a size to fit me I congratulated myself that I should therefore be obliged to have a bonnet As regards my feminine tastes and instincts I have always been conscious of taking interest in questions of family relationships etiquette dress women s as much as or more than men s and other things of that kind which as a rule were treated with indifference or contempt In the house I take more notice than my sister does of the servants deficiencies and neglects and am much more orderly in my arrangements than she is There is nothing markedly feminine in the general appearance Pubertal development took place at an early age long before fourteen with nocturnal emissions but without erotic dreams The testicles are well developed the penis perhaps rather below the average in size and the prepuce long and narrow Erection occurs with much facility especially at night When young he knew nothing of masturbation but he began the habit about ten years ago and has practised it occasionally ever since Although he likes the society of women to a certain extent he soon grows tired of it and has never had any desire to marry His sexual dreams never have any relation to women I am generally doing or saying something he remarks to some man whom I know when awake something which I admit I might wish to do or say if it were not quite out of the question on grounds of propriety and self respect He has however never had any intimate relationships with men and much that he has heard of such relationships fills him with horror What I feel about myself is he writes that I have to a certain extent or in some respects a feminine mind in a male body or I might put it that I am a combination of an immoral in tendency rather than in act woman and a religious man From time to time I have felt strong affection for young men but I cannot flatter myself that my affection has been reciprocated At the present time there is a young fellow twenty three years old who acts as my clerk and sits in my room He is extremely good looking and of a type which is generally considered aristocratic but so far as I or he know he is quite of the lower middle class He has little to recommend him but a fine face and figure and there is nothing approaching to mental or social equality between us But I constantly feel the strongest desire to treat him as a man might a young girl he warmly loved Various obvious considerations keep me from more than quasi paternal caresses and I feel sure he would resent very strongly anything more This constant repression is trying beyond measure to the nerves and I often feel quite ill from that cause Having had no experiences of my own I am always anxious to learn anything I can of the sexual relations of other men and their organs but I have no curiosity whatever concerning the other sex My chief pleasure and source of gratification is found in the opportunities afforded by Turkish and other baths wherever in fact there is the nude male to be found But I seldom find in these places anyone who seems to have the same tendency as myself and certainly I have not met with more than two cases among the attendants who responded to my hinted desire to see everything Under a shampooer particularly an unfamiliar one I occasionally experience an orgasm but less often now than when I was younger F R is very short sighted His favorite color is blue He is able to whistle His tastes are chiefly of a literary character and he has never had any liking for sports I have been generally considered ineffective in the use of my hands he writes and I am certainly not skillful All I have ever been able to do in that way is to net and do the simpler forms of needlework but it seems more natural to me to do or try to do everything of that sort and to play on the piano rather than to shoot or play games I may add that I am fonder of babies than many women and am generally considered to be surprisingly capable of holding them Certainly I enjoy doing so As a youth I used to act in charades but I was too shy to do so unless I was dressed as a woman and veiled and when I took a woman s part I felt less like acting than I have done in propria persona A remark made by an uncle once rather annoyed me that it seemed more like nature than art But he was quite right HISTORY IV Of Lowland Scotch parentage Both sides of house healthy and without cerebral or nervous disease Homosexual desires began at puberty He practised onanism to a limited extent at school and up to the age of about twenty two His erotic dreams are exclusively about males While very friendly and intimate with women of all ages he is instantly repelled by any display of sexual affection on their side This has happened in varying degree in three or four cases With regard to marriage he remarks As there seems no immediate danger of the race dying out I leave marriage to those who like it His male ideal has varied to some extent It has for some years tended toward a healthy well developed athletic or out of door working type intelligent and sympathetic but not specially intellectual At school his sexual relations were of the simplest type Since then there have been none This he says is not due either to absence of desire or presence of morals To put it shortly there were never the time and the place and the loved one together In another view physical desire and the general affection have not always coexisted toward the same person and the former without the latter is comparatively transient while the latter stops the gratification of the former if it is felt that that gratification could in any way make the object of affection unhappy mentally or emotionally He is healthy and fairly well developed of sensitive emotional nature but self controlled mentally he is receptive and aggressive by turns sometimes uncritical sometimes analytical His temper is equable and he is strongly affectionate Very fond of music and other arts but not highly imaginative Of sexual inversion in the abstract he says he has no views but he thus sums up his moral attitude I presume that if it is there it is there for use or abuse as men please I condemn gratification of bodily desire at the expense of others in whatever form it may take I condemn it no more in its inverted form than in the ordinary I believe that affection between persons of the same sex even when it includes the sexual passion and its indulgences may lead to results as splendid as human nature can ever attain to In short I place it on an absolute equality with love as ordinarily understood HISTORY V S W aged sixty four English musical journalist The communication which follows somewhat abbreviated was written before S W had heard or read anything about sexual inversion and when he still believed that his own case was absolutely unique I am the son of a clergyman and lived for the first thirteen years of my life in the country town where I was born Then my father became the vicar of a country village where I lived until I went out into the world at the age of eighteen As during the whole of this time my father had a few pupils I was educated with them and never went to school I was born I fancy with sexual passions about as strong as can well be imagined and at the same time was very precocious in my entry into the stage of puberty Semen began to form a little before my twelfth birthday hair soon followed and in a year I was in that respect the equal of an average boy of fifteen or sixteen I conversed freely with my companions on the relations of the sexes but unlike them had no personal feeling toward girls In time I became conscious that I was different as I then believed and believe now from all other men My sexual organs were quite perfect But in the frame of a man I had the sexual mind of a female I distinctly disclaim the faintest inclination to perform unnatural acts the idea of committing sodomy would be most disgusting To come to my actual condition of mind While totally indifferent to the person of woman I always enjoyed their friendship and companionship and many of my best friends have been ladies I had a burning desire to have carnal intercourse with a male and had the capacity for falling in love as it is called to the utmost extent In imagination I possessed the female organ and felt toward man exactly as an amorous female would At the time when I became fully conscious of my condition I attached little importance to it I had not a notion of its terrible import nor of the future misery it would entail All that I had to learn by bitter experience I did once think of forcing myself to have connection with a prostitute in order to see whether the actual sensual enjoyment might bring a change and so have the power to marry But when it came to thinking over ways and means my repugnance to the act became so strong that it was quite out of the question In the case of any male to whom I became attached I wanted to feel ourselves together skin to skin and to be privileged to take such liberties as an amorous female would take if that were all permitted I sought no purely sensual gratification of any kind my love was far too genuine for that During the rather more than half a century which has elapsed since my twelfth birthday I have been genuinely in love about thirteen times I despair attempting to give an idea of the depth and reality of my feelings I have alluded to my precocity I was in love when twelve years old the object being a man of twenty four a well known analytical chemist He came to my father s house very frequently and my heart beat almost at the mention of his name The next serious time I was about fifteen It was a farmer s son about two years older I don t think that I was ever alone with him and really only knew him as a member of his family yet for a time he was my chief interest in life When twenty one I had a chum a youth of seventeen who entertained for me at any rate a brotherly affection We were under the same roof and early one summer morning he got out of bed and came direct to my room to talk about some matter or other In order to talk more comfortably he got into bed with me and we lay there just as two school girls might have done This proximity was more than I could stand and my heart began to beat so that it was impossible that he should not notice it As of course he could not have the slightest notion of the reason he said in all innocence Why how your heart beats I can hear it quite plainly So far my details are purely innocent Up to eighteen familiarities passed at intervals between me and the son of the village doctor a youth about two years older than myself and precociously immoral I did not really care for him much but he was my chief companion Then I became a school assistant and for about six years managed to control myself only alas to fall again Another resolution I kept for eight years one long fight with my nature Again I sinned in three instances extending over three or four years I now come to a very painful and eventful episode in my unhappy life which I would gladly pass over were it possible It was a case in middle life of sin discovery and great folly in addition Before going into details so far as may be necessary I cannot help asking you to consider calmly and dispassionately my exact condition compared with that of my fellow creatures as a whole In my struggles to resist in the past I have at times felt as if wrestling in the folds of a python I again sinned then with a youth and his friend Oddly enough discovery followed through a man who was actuated by a feeling of revenge for a strictly right act on my part The lads refused to state more than the truth and this did not satisfy the man and a third lad was introduced who was prepared to say anything This was not all some twelve or fifteen more boys made similar accusations The general belief in consequence was that I had committed nameless crimes in all directions ad lib If you were to ask me for an explanation of the action of all these boys beyond the third who of course had some special inducements I can offer none They may have thought that the original trio were regarded rather in the light of heroes why should they not be heroes too I might well feel crushed under such a load of accusations but that does not excuse the incredible folly of my conduct I denied alike the modicum of truth and the mass of lying and went off to America However as time passed on and my mind got into a proper state I felt that the truth must be told some time or other I accordingly wrote from America to the proper quarter a full confession of my sin with regard to the two youths who had told merely the truth at the same time pointing out the falsehood of all the rest of the accusations I remained in America six years and actually made money so that I could return to England with a small capital I was also under a promise to my three sisters all older than myself that I would return in their lifetime My programme was to purchase a small light business in London and quietly earn my living at the same time making my presence known to no one I did buy such a business got swindled in the most clever way and lost every farthing I possessed in the world I had to make my plight known to old friends who all either gave or lent me money Still my position was a very precarious one I tried an insurance agency one of the last resources of the educated destitute but soon found out that I was unfitted for work in which impudence is a prime factor Then an extraordinary stroke of good fortune took place almost simultaneously I began to get a few music pupils and literary work in connection with a good musical journal Making my presence known to old friends involved the same information to those who were not friends My identity as a journalist became known and as time passed by it seemed to me as if half the world had heard of my alleged iniquities People who have never set eyes on me seem to regard me in the light of a monster of iniquity who ought not to be suffered to exist All these outsiders believe that I have committed nameless offenses times innumerable and lift up their hands in speechless horror at the audacity of a man who so situated dares to appear openly in public under his own name and look people in the face They have not even the brains to see that this very fearlessness proves the fictitious character of their beliefs Next they believe that if only they could get my dismissal from my journalistic post I should be brought to starvation point This up to a year ago was true Then an old relative died and left me some property which I sold to invest in an annuity and thus have just enough to live on quietly apart from what I may earn Under such strange conditions it might be asked whether life was not unendurable Frankly speaking I cannot say that I find it so I have in London a few bachelor friends who go with me to theaters et cetera In the suburbs I have about half a dozen family friends Here I meet with pleasant society and a hearty welcome I am passionately fond of music have an excellent piano and can hear the best concerts in Europe I go to all good plays I am a good chess player Lastly I am an omnivorous reader You will allow that my resources for passing the time are not limited Of course I am sorry that I sinned and wish that I had not done so But I disclaim any feeling of shame S W was the youngest of four children and the only boy His father was forty at his birth his mother thirty three The father was an intellectual man of weak character the mother a woman of violent and eccentric temper with he believes strong sexual passions S W knows of nothing in the family to account for his own abnormal condition He is short five feet five inches but well built with strong chest and a powerful voice His arms are weak and flabby feminine he thinks but the legs muscular As a boy of fourteen he could walk forty miles with ease and he played football till near the age of forty five He is considered manly in character and tastes but is easily moved to tears under strong excitement There is no information as to the type of man to whom he is attracted I may observe however that the analytical chemist who first evoked S W s admiration was well known to me some thirty years later as he was my own teacher in chemistry At that time he was an elderly man of attractive appearance and character sympathetic and winning in manner to an almost feminine extent S W has never felt the slightest sexual attraction toward the opposite sex The first indications of inverted feeling were at the age of six or seven Watching his father s pupils boys of thirteen or fourteen from the windows he speculated on what their organs of generation were like In connection with a girl he writes I should no more have thought of such a thing than in the case of a block of marble About this time indeed he at times slept with a sister of ten who induced him to go through the form of sexual connection saying that it felt so funny but he merely did this to please her and without the slightest interest or feeling on his own part This attitude became more marked with increased knowledge until he fell ardently in love at the age of twelve Throughout life he has practised masturbation to a certain extent and is prepared to defend the practice in his own case His erotic dreams have been of only the vaguest and most shadowy character He is able to whistle He takes a warm interest in politics and in philanthropic work But his chief love is for music and he has published many musical compositions On the whole and notwithstanding the persecution he has endured he does not regard his life as unhappy At the same time he is keenly conscious of the atmosphere of Pariahdom which surrounds inverts and in his own case this has never been alleviated by any sense of companionship in misery The facility with which some inverts are said to recognize others of their own kind is quite incomprehensible to him he has never to his knowledge met one HISTORY VI E S physician aged fifty I have some reason he writes for believing that some of my relatives on the paternal side were not normal in their sexual life But I am sure that no such suspicion was entertained by their friends or associates they were very reticent people A great proportion of my near relatives have remained unmarried or deferred marriage until late in life None of them have been good business men all seem to have been more deeply concerned in other things than in making or in keeping money They have mostly taken little or no share in public life and not cared much for society Yet they have been folk of more than average ability with intellectual and aesthetic interests We are prone to enthusiasms but lack perseverance We are discursive and superficial perhaps but none would call us stupid We are perhaps abnormally self centered and self conscious never cruel or vicious Our powers of self control are considerable we are conventional people only because we are lazy and intensely dislike any open self assertion Yet we are nervous rather than phlegmatic All that is on the father s side My maternal ancestors have been concerned with farming and the sea and have also had a similar lack of business capacity but with less mental adaptiveness and alertness with more steadiness of purpose however always doers rather than dreamers Among them I remember one cousin who was probably abnormal although he died when I was too young to notice much Again they were all rather reserved people but more genial with strangers more socially inclined and with less self control I was an only child and a spoilt one I was always quick at school fond of learning and finding my lessons no trouble Serious study I disliked But for school purposes I did not find it necessary and had no difficulty in carrying all before me I was never fond of games although very fond of being out of doors and of walking Few of my relatives have been at all keen on sport I made no close friendships at school and was never very popular with my schoolfellows who however tolerated my odd ways better than might have been expected I was easily brought to appreciate good literature but I never had much power of expression or of strenuous thought I was extremely susceptible and impressible moved by beauty of any kind but never at all ambitious or in any way creative I was easily stimulated to work and then loved to work but unless the stimulus were maintained the natural indolence of my disposition asserted itself and I wasted my powers in dreams and trifles My memory was very quick and retentive in the main but curiously capricious I always lacked initiative and decision At college my successes were continued I gained medals and prizes passed my examinations easily and graduated with first class honors In my professional lifework I have been successful rather beyond the average I love it with all my heart I cannot speak with any confidence about the first stirrings of my sexual instincts but I think I can assert that they have at no time led me to any desire for the opposite sex It is true that my earliest recollection of the kind is concerned with intimacies with a girl play fellow but as we had at the time reached only the mature age of seven at the most I fancy that our mutual exhibitions for there was nothing more simply satisfied our natural curiosity Certainly these memories are in my mind in no way set apart from the recollections of other kinds of play Next to that I remember the usual schoolboy talk about things hidden and forbidden but up till I was twelve or so this was simply dirty talk concerned more with renal and intestinal functions than with any sexual feelings or understanding One boy was known to us all and of my not inconsiderable circle of early friends all grew up to be normal people who married and had children in due course for the unusual size of his parts and for the freedom with which he invited and satisfied the curiosity of his friends He must have been precocious for he could not have been more than twelve and I remember to have heard that he had a thick growth of pubic hair Even then although I know that my curiosity to put it at that only was active I never allowed myself to have any dealings with him and I think I should have discouraged them had they been suggested to me That is the odd thing about my life the things I longed intensely to do I would not let myself do not from any religious or moral scruple but from some inexplicable fastidiousness or scrupulosity which is yet as active as ever although I am sure that it would not be able to hold its own could these favorable conditions be repeated but would be overcome by the imperious and fully grown desires which by long repression or by unsatisfactory diversion have grown to be so strong Indeed given the opportunity and the assurance that no first seduction or corruption of anyone was in question they would prove quite irrepressible Certainly long before puberty which was early with me I remember being greatly attracted to certain boys and wishing to have an opportunity of sleeping with them Had I been able to do so I am sure I should have been impelled to get into as close contact with their naked body as possible and I do not think I should then have craved for anything more I knew some boys perhaps a little older who even then had relations which were certainly not innocent with a girl who was a year or two older than any of us She once kissed me to my intense shame But I felt that these relations would have been unspeakably disgusting and I took no particular interest in hearing about them I remember being fondled and caressed by a very good looking boy of sixteen when I was three or four years younger and had sustained some hurt at play and I am still able to recall the thrill of delight that I experienced at his touch Nothing took place that all the world might not have seen but I remember being taken between his knees as he sat and his arms being put around my neck and the warm soft pressure of his thighs had an unspeakable effect on me About this time too an older boy perhaps about eighteen used to get hold of smaller boys when on country walks to throw them down and then look at and toy with their genitals He was himself a handsome boy and I was greatly excited when told about this by boys who had experienced it and wished greatly to have it done to me It never was and if it had been attempted I know I should have resisted with all my strength although my desires would have set me aflame This boy died before he was twenty with a psoas abscess and I remember crying myself to sleep the night I learned of his death Another boy about three years older than myself who had very silky hair I used to be attracted by and I was always trying to stroke his hair but he always objected I must have been about twelve when I first was taught to masturbate by a cousin who was slightly older At first I thought it silly but I used to watch him at it and practised it myself from time to time until I became old enough to experience the proper sensation Then I have reason to think I gave myself up to it rather freely but it was generally done in solitude although it was long before I realized that there was anything wrong about it or that it might prove hurtful Looking back now I feel perfectly certain that my instincts were wholly homosexual from the very first This cousin who possessed notable intellectual and artistic gifts married but I feel sure his liking for his own sex was not normal With another cousin almost years my junior I was always on terms of the most affectionate intimacy My holidays at his parents house were my greatest delight We were always together by night or day we slept in the same bed literally in each other s arms To me it afforded the keenest sexual pleasure to press close to his naked body We used mutually to handle and caress our parts but without any attempt at mutual masturbation although at that period I regularly practised it on myself I asked him once about it but he had not been taught it by others and to my great pride and satisfaction I can say that I never either did it to him or asked him to do it to me This I mention as an instance of my restraint in act although my thoughts and desires knew no such curb I remember also an elder brother of his perhaps three or four years my senior once showing me then about twelve I suppose his semierect penis He would not allow me to touch it but showed me how to draw back the foreskin so as to uncover the glans His penis was large and the incident was not forgotten We had no other relation and I know that both he and my own friend grew up to be quite normal men I think I must have been about seventeen when I got frightened about the occurrence of nocturnal emissions which I believed were the evil result of masturbation and for two or three years I continued in considerable mental distress until when in my second or third year at college I summoned up courage enough to consult our good old family doctor who reassured me but made I now think too light of my confidences so that I relapsed the more readily although much later on into old habits From our windows at home we looked over a bit of common or down to the beach and I used to keep watch on warm summer afternoons over boys who might be bathing to observe them through our telescope All this I kept strictly secret and I was never surprised I might just as well and without arousing the slightest suspicion of my motive have walked down to the beach and seen them and chatted with them but this I could not have brought myself to do It gave me considerable sexual satisfaction when I was able to see them bathing without pants I also used to watch them at play on the common and felt rewarded when I saw as I not infrequently did sexual familiarities taking place These violently excited me and sometimes brought on orgasm always erection with pleasure Indeed it was an experience of this kind that made me return to masturbation after I had given it up for a while I remember one day seeing two lads of about sixteen lying on the grass in the sunshine all at once the bigger lad put out his hand and tried to open his companion s trousers He resisted with all his might and a long struggle ensued ending in the smaller lad having his penis exposed and manipulated by the other Even at this day the recollection of this excites me Both lads grew up to be normal men Twice only have I been approached by grown up people When I was about thirteen I used to meet often when going to school by train an old gentleman who courted me as it were used often to talk to me and asked me to come to see his well known scientific collections but I always had a vague distrust of him and never went One day in the summer during a spare hour I met him in an empty room in the museum where there were usually very few visitors at that time of day and where large show cases gave concealment He came up to me and told me he had been away in the country and that when making his way home through hedges and thorny bushes some of the thorns got stuck amongst his clothes and were still giving him uneasiness I would be very grateful he said if you would put your hand down and try if you can feel any thorns sticking in my underflannels and pull them out He then unbuttoned his braces on one side undid his trousers and made me thrust my hand over his groin and lower abdomen I avoided touching his genitals but he pushed my hand down in that direction until burning with shame I made my escape and ran off not stopping until I was safe in school I scarcely understood it but never spoke of it and avoided him ever afterward I learned later on that he was a well off bachelor who took a great interest in working lads and young men and did much to help them on in life and keep them so it was said from falling into bad company He died at a great age and left most of his fortune to an institution for lads as well as large legacies to youths in whom he had been interested The other time was on top of a tramcar when a grown up man who was near pressed as close to me as he could began to talk praised my dark eyes then put his hand on my thigh under my loose cloak and felt up toward my parts At the same time he took hold of my hand caressed it and put it over his parts it was in the dusk This excited me and if we had not been at our destination I think I would gladly have permitted further familiarities He tried to ask me where I lived but there was no time to answer and the female relative who was with me on another seat would no doubt have prevented this from having any further sequel On more than one occasion I have experienced the sexual orgasm as the result of mental anxiety The first time this occurred was when I was hurrying to avoid being late for school Another time was when I was about twenty four and was extremely anxious to fill an appointment for which I was late So copious was the emission that I had to go home and change As a medical student the first reference bearing definitely on the subject of sexual inversion was made in the class of Medical Jurisprudence where certain sexual crimes were alluded to very summarily and inadequately but nothing was said of the existence of sexual inversion as the normal condition of certain unhappy people nor was any distinction drawn between the various non normal acts which were all classed together as manifestations of the criminal depravity of ordinary or insane people To a student beginning to be acutely conscious that his sexual nature differed profoundly from that of his fellows nothing could be more perplexing and disturbing and it shut me up more completely in my reserve than ever I felt that this teaching must be based on some radical error or prejudice or misapprehension for I knew from my own very clear remembrance of my own development that my peculiarity was not acquired but inborn my great misfortune undoubtedly but not my fault It was still more unfortunate that in the course of the lectures on Clinical Medicine there was not the slightest allusion to the subject All sorts of rare diseases some of which I have not yet met with in the course of twenty one years of a busy practice were fully discussed but we were left entirely ignorant of a subject so vitally important to me personally and as it seems to me to the profession to which I aspired There might have been an incidental reference to masturbation although I do not remember it but its real significance received no attention and what we students knew of it was the result of our reading or of our personal experiences In the class of Mental Disease there was naturally more detailed and systematic reference to facts in the sexual life and to sexual inversion as a rare pathological condition But still there was not a comforting word to reassure me growing ever more hopelessly ashamed of what it seemed was a criminal or a gravely morbid nature Among all my fellow students I knew of no one constituted like myself but my natural reserve increased of course by my consciousness of what I saw would be thought to be a criminal tendency did not urge me to exchange of confidences or to the formation of close friendships After graduation I became a resident medical officer in the hospital and private assistant to one of the professors a physician and teacher of worldwide reputation With him I associated on the most cordial and affectionate terms and often in the course of conversation I tried to bring him to discuss the subject but without success It was obviously unpleasant and uninteresting to him Enough was said however to enable me to realize that he held the current ideas on the subject and I would not for worlds have allowed him to guess that I myself came under the despised and tainted category I have seldom heard sexual inversion discussed among my professional friends They speak of it with disgust or amusement I have never met a professional man who would consider it dispassionately and scientifically For them it was a subject entirely belonging to psychological medicine I have had no admitted case of it among my patients but I have often instinctively felt that some who consulted me about other matters would have taken me into their confidence about that but for their fear of being cruelly misunderstood As to my moral attitude I fear to speak Grossness disgusts me but I am not sure that I should be able to resist temptation placed in my way But I am absolutely sure that I should never under any circumstances tempt others to any disgraceful act If I ever committed any sexual act with one of my own sex whom I loved I could not look at it or approach it in any other than a sacramental way This sounds blasphemous and shocking but I cannot otherwise express my meaning As regards the marriage of inverts my own feeling is that for a congenital invert no matter how fully the situation be explained beforehand it is a step fraught with too great possibilities of tragedy and of the deepest unhappiness to be advised at all My view is that for the invert far more than for the ordinary person there is no escape from the supreme necessity of self control in any relationship he may form If that be attained then the ideal is a relationship with another man of similar temperament not a platonic one necessarily by means of which the highest happiness of both may be reached But this can occur very seldom To poetry and the fine arts I am very susceptible and I have given a great deal of time to this study I am devoted heart and soul to music which is more and more to me every year I live Trivial or light music I cannot endure but of Beethoven Bach Haendel Schumann Schubert Brahms Tschaikowsky and Wagner I should never hear enough Here too my sympathies are very catholic and I delight in McDowell Debussy Richard Strauss and Hugo Wolf HISTORY VII My parentage is very sound and healthy Both my parents who belong to the professional middle class have good general health nor can I trace any marked abnormal or diseased tendency of mind or body in any records of the family Though of a strongly nervous temperament myself and sensitive my health is good I am not aware of any tendency to physical disease In early manhood however owing I believe to the great emotional tension under which I lived my nervous system was a good deal shattered and exhausted Mentally and morally my nature is pretty well balanced and I have never had any serious perturbations in these departments At the age of eight or nine and long before distinct sexual feelings declared themselves I felt a friendly attraction toward my own sex and this developed after the age of puberty into a passionate sense of love which however never found any expression for itself till I was fully twenty years of age I was a day boarder at school and heard little of school talk on sex subjects was very reserved and modest besides no elder person or parent ever spoke to me on such matters and the passion for my own sex developed gradually utterly uninfluenced from the outside I never even during all this period and till a good deal later learned the practice of masturbation My own sexual nature was a mystery to me I found myself cut off from the understanding of others felt myself an outcast and with a highly loving and clinging temperament was intensely miserable I thought about my male friends sometimes boys of my own age sometimes elder boys and once even a master during the day and dreamed about them at night but was too convinced that I was a hopeless monstrosity ever to make any effectual advances Later on it was much the same but gradually though slowly I came to find that there were others like myself I made a few special friends and at last it came to me occasionally to sleep with them and to satisfy my imperious need by mutual embraces and emissions Before this happened however I was once or twice on the brink of despair and madness with repressed passion and torment Meanwhile from the first my feeling physically toward the female sex was one of indifference and later on with the more special development of sex desires one of positive repulsion Though having several female friends whose society I like and to whom I am sincerely attached the thought of marriage or cohabitation with any such has always been odious to me As a boy I was attracted in general by boys rather older than myself after leaving school I still fell in love in a romantic vein with comrades of my own standing Now at the age of thirty seven my ideal of love is a powerful strongly built man of my own age or rather younger preferably of the working class Though having solid sense and character he need not be specially intellectual If endowed in the latter way he must not be too glib or refined Anything effeminate in a man or anything of the cheap intellectual style repels me very decisively I have never had to do with actual pederasty so called My chief desire in love is bodily nearness or contact as to sleep naked with a naked friend the specially sexual though urgent enough seems a secondary matter Pederasty either active or passive might seem in place to me with one I loved very devotedly and who also loved me to that degree but I think not otherwise I am an artist by temperament and choice fond of all beautiful things especially the male human form of active slight muscular build and sympathetic but somewhat indecisive character though possessing self control I cannot regard my sexual feelings as unnatural or abnormal since they have disclosed themselves so perfectly naturally and spontaneously within me All that I have read in books or heard spoken about the ordinary sexual love its intensity and passion lifelong devotion love at first sight et cetera seems to me to be easily matched by my own experiences in the homosexual form and with regard to the morality of this complex subject my feeling is that it is the same as should prevail in love between man and woman namely that no bodily satisfaction should be sought at the cost of another person s distress or degradation I am sure that this kind of love is notwithstanding the physical difficulties that attend it as deeply stirring and ennobling as the other kind if not more so and I think that for a perfect relationship the actual sex gratifications whatever they may be probably hold a less important place in this love than in the other HISTORY VIII M N aged thirty My grandfather might be said to be of abnormal temperament for though of very humble origin he organized and carried out an extremely arduous mission work and became an accomplished linguist translating the Bible into an Eastern tongue and compiling the first dictionary of that language He died practically of overwork at the age of forty five He was twice married my father being his third son by the second wife I believe that two if not more of the family numbering seven in all were inverted and the only one of them to marry was my father My grandmother was the last representative of an old and very wild Irish family She died at an advanced age of paralysis My father was thirty six and my mother twenty one at the time of their marriage I was born three years after and was their only child The marriage proved a most unhappy one they being utterly unsuited to each other in every way My father s health during the first years of his marriage was very delicate and I have reason to believe that it had been undermined in certain ways by his life abroad I understand I was born with slight gonorrheal affection and as a child my health was very indifferent This latter may have been brought about by the peculiarly unhappy and unnatural life I led I had no companions of my own age and did not even attend any school until after my mother s death My father superintended my education up to that time and I had free access to a large and very varied library and a great deal of solitary leisure to enjoy it in There were a number of medical and scientific books in it which were my principal favorites and I remember deciding at a very early age to be a doctor When about five years old I recollect having a sexual dream connected with a railway porter It afforded me great pleasure to recall this dream and about that time I discovered a method of self gratification there is not much teaching required in these matters I cannot say that the dream I have mentioned constituted absolutely the first intimation of inverted feeling but rather that it crystallized vague ideas which I might have already had on the subject I can recollect that when about between three and four years of age a young fellow of about twenty came to our house several times as a visitor He was fond of children I suppose and I generally sat on his knee and was kissed by him This was a source of great pleasure to me but I cannot remember if it was accompanied by erection I can only recall that his attention and caresses made a greater impression upon me than those of women When about that age too I was often aroused when sleeping with my mother and told not to lie on my face I remember that erection was always present on these occasions The dream was the first of many of its kind and in my case they have never been accompanied by emission They have always been of an inverted character though I have occasionally had dreams about women These latter however have usually partaken somewhat of the nature of a nightmare Up to the age of fourteen I felt much perplexed and depressed by my views on sexual desire and was convinced that they were peculiar to myself This combined with the solitary condition of my life and about four years continued ill treatment prior to my mother s death she had given way to drink for that period had a very injurious effect on my health mental and bodily Looking back from my present point of view I can understand and forgive many things which appeared monstrous and unjust to me as a child My mother s life must have been a very unhappy one and she was bitterly disappointed in many ways very likely in me as well My unfortunate misunderstood temperament led me to be shy and secretive and I was often ailing and my training was not calculated to improve matters At last however change and freedom came and I was sent to a boarding school Here of course I soon met with attachments and gratifications with other boys I arrived at puberty and my health improved under happier surroundings I was not long in discovering that my companions viewed the pleasures that meant so much to me from an entirely different standpoint Their gratifications were usually accompanied by conversation about and a general direction of thought toward females When I had turned fifteen owing to monetary difficulties I was obliged to leave school and was soon not only thrown on my own resources but accountable to no one but myself for my conduct Of course my next discovery was that my case so far from being peculiar was a most common one and I was quickly initiated into all the mysteries of inversion with its freemasonry and argot Altogether my experience of inverts has been a pretty wide and varied one and I have always endeavored to classify and compare cases which have come under my notice with a view to arriving at some sort of conclusion or explanation I suppose it is due to female versatility or impressibility that it is possible for me to experience mentally the emotions attributable to either sex according to the age and temperament of my companion for instance with one older than myself possessing well marked male characteristics I am able to feel all that surrender and dependence which is so essentially feminine On the other hand if with a youth of feminine type and behavior I can realize with an equal amount of pleasure the tender yet dominant attitude of the male I experience no particular horror of women sexually I should imagine that my feeling toward them resembles very much what normal people feel with regard to others of their own sex M N remarks that he cannot whistle and that his favorite color is green In this case the subject easily found a moral modus vivendi with his inverted instinct and he takes its gratification for granted In the following case which I believe is typical of a large group the subject has never yielded to his inverted impulses and except so far as masturbation is concerned has preserved strict chastity HISTORY IX R S aged thirty one American of French descent Upon the question of heredity I may say that I belong to a reasonably healthy prolific and long lived family On my father s side however there is a tendency toward pulmonary troubles He himself died of pneumonia and two of his brothers and a nephew of consumption Neither of my parents were morbid or eccentric Excepting for a certain shyness with strangers my father was a very masculine man My mother is somewhat nervous but is not imaginative nor at all demonstrative in her affections I think that my own imaginative and artistic temperament must come from my father s side Perhaps my French ancestry has something to do with it With the exception of my maternal grandfather all my progenitors have been of French descent My mother s father was English I possess a mercurial temperament and a strong sense of the ludicrous Though my physique is slight my health has always been excellent Of late years especially I have been greatly given to introspection and self scrutiny but have never had any hallucinations mental delusions nor hysterics and am not at all superstitious Spiritualistic manifestations hypnotic dabblings and the other psychical fads of the day have little or no attraction for me In fact I have always been skeptical of them and they rather bore me At school I was an indolent dreamy boy shirking study but otherwise fairly docile to my teachers From earliest childhood I have indulged in omnivorous taste for reading my particular likings being for travels esthetics metaphysical and theological subjects and more recently for poetry and certain forms of mysticism I never cared much for history or for scientific subjects From the beginning too I showed a strong artistic bent and possessed an overpowering love for all things beautiful As a child I was passionately fond of flowers loved to be in the woods and alone and wanted to become an artist My parents opposed the latter wish and I gave way before their opposition In me the homosexual nature is singularly complete and is undoubtedly congenital The most intense delight of my childhood even when a tiny boy in a nurse s charge was to watch acrobats and riders at the circus This was not so much for the skillful feats as on account of the beauty of their persons Even then I cared chiefly for the more lithe and graceful fellows People told me that circus actors were wicked and would steal little boys and so I came to look upon my favorites as half devil and half angel When I was older and could go about alone I would often hang around the tents of travelling shows in hope of catching a glimpse of the actors I longed to see them naked without their tights and used to lie awake at night thinking of them and longing to be loved and embraced by them A certain bareback rider a sort of jockey used especially to please me on account of his handsome legs which were clothed in fleshlings up to his waist leaving his beautiful loins uncovered by a breech clout There was nothing consciously sensual about these reveries because at the time I had no sensual feelings or knowledge Curiously enough the women actors repelled me then as they do to this day quite as strongly as I was attracted by the men I used also to take great pleasure in watching men and boys in swimming but my opportunities for seeing them thus were extremely rare I never dared let my comrades know how I felt about these matters but the sight of a well formed naked youth or man would fill me and does now with mingled feelings of bashfulness anguish and delight I used to tell myself endless stories of a visionary castle inhabited by beautiful boys one of whom was especially my dear chum It was always the prince in fairy tales who held my interest or affection I was constantly falling in love with handsome boys whom I never knew nor did I ever try to mix in their company for I was abashed before them and had no liking nor aptitude for boyish games Sometimes I played with girls because they were more quiet and gentler but I cared for them little or not at all As is usually the case my parents neglected to impart to me any sexual knowledge and such as I possessed was gathered furtively from tainted sources bad boys talk at school and elsewhere My elders let me know in a vague way that talk of the kind was wicked and natural timidity and a wish to be good kept me from learning much about sexual matters As I never went to boarding school I was spared perhaps many of the degrading initiations administered by knowing boys at such institutions In spite of what has been said above I do not believe that I was sexually very precocious and even now I feel that more pleasure would ensue from merely contemplating than from personal contact with the object of my amorous attentions As I grew older there came of course an undefined physical longing but it was the beauty of those I admired which mainly appealed to me At the time of puberty I spontaneously acquired the habit of masturbation Once while bathing I found that a pleasant feeling came with touching the sexual organs It was not long before I was confirmed in the habit At first I practised it but seldom but afterward much more frequently say once a week though at times months have elapsed without any indulgences on my part I have only had erotic dreams three or four times in my life The masturbation habit I regard as morally reprehensible and have made many resolutions to break it but without avail It affords me only the most momentary satisfaction and is always followed by remorseful scruples I have never in my life had any sexual feeling for a woman nor any sexual connection with any woman whatsoever The very thought of such a thing is excessively repugnant and disgusting to me This is true apart from any moral considerations and I do not think I could bring myself to it I am not attracted by young women in any way Even their physical beauty has little or no charm for me and I often wonder how men can be so affected by it On the other hand I am not a woman hater and have several strong friends of the opposite sex They are however women older than myself and our friendship is based solely on certain intellectual or esthetic tastes we have in common I have had practically no physical relations with men at any rate none specifically sexual Once when about nineteen or twenty one I started to embrace a beautifully formed youth with whom I was sleeping but timidity and scruples got the better of my feelings and as my bedfellow was not amorously inclined toward me nothing came of it A few years after this I became strongly attached to a friend whom I had already known for several years Circumstances threw us very much together during one summer It was now that I felt for the first time the full shock of love He returned my affection but both of us were shy of showing our feelings or speaking of them Often when walking together after night fall we would put our arms about each other Sometimes too when sleeping together we would lie in close contact and my friend once suggested that I put my legs against his He frequently begged me to spend the night with him but I began to fear my feelings and slept with him but seldom We neither of us had any definite ideas about homosexual relations and apart from what I have related above we had no further contact with each other A few months after our amorous feelings had developed my friend died His death caused me great distress and my naturally religious temperament began to manifest itself quite strongly At this time too I first read some writings of mister Addington Symonds and certain allusions in his work coupled with my recent experience soon stirred me to a full consciousness of my inverted nature About eight months after my friend s death I happened to meet in a strange town a youth of about my own age who exerted upon me a strong and instant attraction He possessed a refined handsome face was gracefully built and though he was rather undemonstrative we soon became fast friends We were together only for a few days when I was obliged to leave for my home and the parting caused me great unhappiness and depression A few months after we spent a vacation together One day during our trip we went swimming and undressed in the same bathhouse When I saw my friend naked for the first time he seemed to me so beautiful that I longed to throw my arms about him and cover him with kisses I kept my feelings hidden however hardly daring to look at him for fear of being unable to restrain my desires Several times afterward in his room I saw him stripped with the same effect upon my emotions Until I had seen him naked my feelings for him were not of a physical character but afterward I longed for actual contact but only by embraces and kisses Though he was fond of me he had absolutely no amorous longings for me and being a simple pure minded fellow would have loathed me for mine and my inverted nature I was careful never to let him discover it and I was made very unhappy when he confided that he was in love with a young girl whom he wished to marry This episode took place several years ago and though we are still friends my emotional feelings for him have cooled considerably I have always been very shy of showing any affectionate tendencies Most of my acquaintances and close friends even think me curiously cold and often wonder why I have never fallen in love or married For obvious reasons I have never been able to tell them Three or four years ago a little book by Coventry Patmore fell into my hands and from its perusal resulted a strange blending of my religious and erotic notions The desire to love and be loved is hard to drown and when I realized that homosexually it was neither lawful nor possible for me to love in this world I began to project my longings into the next By birth I am a Roman Catholic and in spite of a somewhat skeptical temper manage to remain one by conviction From the doctrines of the Trinity Incarnation and Eucharist I have drawn conclusions which would fill the minds of the average pietist with holy horror nevertheless I believe that granting the premises these conclusions are both logically and theologically defensible The Divinity of my fancied paradise resembles in no way the vapid conceptions of Fra Angelico or the Quartier saint Sulpice His physical aspect at least would be better represented by some Praxitilean demigod or Flandrin s naked brooding boy While these imaginings have caused me considerable moral disquietude they do not seem wholly reprehensible because I feel that the chief happiness I would derive by their realization would be mainly from the contemplation of the loved one rather than from closer joys I possess only a slight knowledge of the history and particulars of erotic mysticism but it is likely that my notions are neither new nor peculiar and many utterances of the few mystical writers with whose works I am acquainted seem substantially in accord with my own longings and conclusions In endeavoring to find for them some sanction of valid authority I have always sought corroboration from members of my own sex hence am less likely to have fashioned my views after those of hypersensitive or hysterical women You will rightly infer that it is difficult for me to say exactly how I regard morally the homosexual tendency Of this much however I am certain that even if it were possible I would not exchange my inverted nature for a normal one I suspect that the sexual emotions and even inverted ones have a more subtle significance than is generally attributed to them but modern moralists either fight shy of transcendental interpretations or see none and I am ignorant and unable to solve the mystery these feelings seem to imply Patmore speaks boldly enough in his way and Lacordaire has hinted at things but in a very guarded manner I have neither the ability nor opportunity to study what the mystics of the Middle Ages have to say along these lines and besides the medieval way of looking at things is not congenial to me The chief characteristic of my tendency is an overpowering admiration for male beauty and in this I am more akin to the Greeks I have absolutely no words to tell you how powerfully such beauty affects me Moral and intellectual worth is I know of greater value but physical beauty I see more clearly and it appears to me the most vivid if not the most perfect manifestation of the divine A little incident may perhaps reveal to you my feelings more completely Not long ago I happened to see an unusually well formed young fellow enter a house of assignation with a common woman of the streets The sight filled me with the keenest anguish and the thought that his beauty would soon be at the disposal of a prostitute made me feel as if I were a powerless and unhappy witness to a sacrilege It may be that my rage for male loveliness is only another outbreaking of the old Platonic mania for as time goes on I find that I long less for the actual youth before me and more and more for some ideal perfect being whose bodily splendor and loving heart are the realities whose reflections only we see in this cave of shadows Since the birth and development within me of what for lack of a better name I term my homosexualized Patmorean ideal life has become in the main a weary business I am not despondent however because many things still hold for me a certain interest When that interest dies down as it is wont from time to time I endeavor to be patient God grant that after the end here I may be drawn from the shadow and seemingly vain imaginings into the possession of their never ending reality hereafter HISTORY X A H aged sixty two Belongs to a family which cannot be regarded as healthy but there is no insanity among near relations Father a very virile man of high character and good intelligence but not sound physical health Mother was high strung and nervous but possessed of indomitable courage and very affectionate she lived very happily with her husband She became a chronic invalid and died of consumption A H was a seven months child the third in the family who were born very rapidly so that there is only three years difference in the ages of the first and third children A H believes that one of his brothers who has never married and prefers men to women is also inverted though not to the same degree as himself and he also suspects that a relation of his mother s may have been an invert Sister who resembles the father in character is married but is spoken of as a woman s woman rather than a man s woman The family generally are considered proud and reserved but of superior mental endowment In early life A H was delicate and his studies were often interrupted by illness Though living under happy conditions he was shy and nervous often depressed In later life his health has been up to the average and he has usually been able to conceal his mental doubts and diffidence As a child he played with dolls and made girls his companions until an age when he grew conscious that his conduct was unusual and became ashamed while his father seemed troubled about him He regards himself as having been a very childish child His conscious sexual life began between the ages of eight and ten He was playing in the garden when he saw a manservant who had long been with the family standing at the door of a shed with his penis exposed and erect The boy had never seen anything of the kind before but felt great delight in the exhibition and moved shyly toward the man who retreated into the shed The boy followed and was allowed to caress and play with the penis until ejaculation took place the man replying in reply to the child s innocent inquiries that it felt good This experience was frequently repeated with the same man and the boy confided in a boy friend with whom he tried to ascertain by personal experience what the good feeling was like but they were too young to derive any pleasure from the attempt beyond the joy of what was instinctively felt to be eating forbidden fruit From this period his sexual tendencies began to become fixed and self conscious He has never at any period of life had a moment s conscious sexual attraction toward a person of the opposite sex His warmest friendships have indeed been with women and much perhaps most of the happiness he has enjoyed has been furnished by those friendships But passion has only been aroused by persons of his own sex generally by men much younger than himself He feels shy and uncomfortable in the presence of men of his own age But even at his present age a touch of a man or boy may cause the liveliest gratification Shortly after the incident in boyhood already narrated A H induced a little boy companion to go to a quiet spot where at A H s suggestion each placed the other s penis in his mouth by turns A H had never heard of such a proceeding It was a natural instinct He began to masturbate at an early age But he soon found a companion to share his passion An older man especially married and with a family became his accomplice on every possible opportunity and they would manipulate each other At the age of twenty one fellatio began to be practised with this man It became a lifelong practice and the preferred method of sexual gratification He likes best to have it performed on himself but he has never asked anyone to do for him what he would not himself do for the other if desired There has never been pedicatio The penis it may be added is of good size and the testicles rather large No one has ever suspected A H s sexual perversion not even his physician with whom he has long had a close friendship until at a time of great mental distress A H voluntarily revealed his state He is accustomed to refined society has always read much abhorred athletic pursuits and loved poetry children and flowers His love of nature amounts indeed to a passion Wherever he has been he has made friends among the best people He confesses to occasional periods of addiction to intoxicants induced by sociable companionship and only controlled by force of will For business he has not the slightest aptitude and cannot look after his own affairs He is always dreading poverty and destitution He believes however that he passes among his friends as fairly capable He considers that inversion is natural in his case and that he has a perfect right to gratify his own natural instincts though he also admits they may be vices He has never sought to influence an innocent person toward his own tendencies HISTORY XI T D knows of nothing abnormal in his ancestry His brother has homosexual tendencies but is also attracted to women A sister who is very religious states that she has little or no sexual inclinations They were all of a dreamy disposition when young to the disgust of their teachers He sent the following account of himself from the University at the age of twenty When I was a child before I went to school at nine he writes I was already of an affectionate disposition an affection turned readily to either sex No boy was the cause of my inclinations which were quite spontaneous No doubt part of the cause may be found in our social system by which ladies are rather drawing room creatures to be treated with distant respect When I was ten at a preparatory school I first began to form attachments with other boys of my own age in which I always had regard to physical beauty It is this stage in which the sexual element is latent that Shelley speaks of as preceding love in ardent natures At twelve I learned masturbation apparently by instinct and I regret to say practised it to excess for the next seven years always secretly and with shame and often with the accompaniment of prurient imaginings which did not prevent my relations with those I loved being of a very spiritual nature Masturbation was often practised daily with bursts of repentance and abstinence latterly more rarely But until I was fifteen I really knew nothing of sexual matters and it was not till I was at least seventeen that I was conscious of sexual desire which I repressed with shame Owing to excessive self abuse I am unable to emit except manually but desire is strong I think naked contact would suffice and in any case intercrural connection Pedicatio and fellatio I abhor I love boys between the ages of twelve and fifteen they must be of my own class refined and lovable I only desire the active masculine part I now regard my inclinations as natural and normal to me The difficulty is that of leading the other party to regard it as such besides the young age required and clandestine nature of proceedings necessary The moral difficulties of circumstances are so strong that I have little hope of ever gratifying my passion fully I have found myself deceived in the character of the boy twice The last friendship lasted three years during which time I only saw him naked two or three times this caused erection never touched him pruriently and only kissed him once I have never found a satisfactory object of my affections and my happiness perhaps my health have been seriously injured At my public school a master helped me to a truer understanding of these things The merely animal sodomy which exists in many public schools was unknown What I learned of sex I learned for myself I am recommended to turn my aspirations to the abstract universal maid but so far at least I cannot do it Male Greek statuary and the Phoedrus of Plato have had a great though only confirmatory influence on my feelings My ideal is that of Theocritus XIII wherein Hercules was bringing Hylas to the perfect measure of a man My first thought is the good of my friend but except for the good subjective influence of passion I have failed utterly I am very tall dark rather strong fond of games though I do not excel owing to short sight I am English though I have French blood which may account for an unreservedly passionate disposition Though unlike other people I am not in the least feminine nor has anyone thought so to my knowledge I can whistle easily and well I am so masculine that I cannot even conceive of passive sexual pleasure in women much less in men That is one of the difficulties in boy love My affections are inextricably bound up in the ideals of protection of one weaker than myself In the earlier days when sexuality was less conscious this was a great source of romantic feeling the glamour of which is rather departing I cannot understand love of adult males much less if they are of lower class and the idea of prostitution is nauseous to me I think I may say that I have the esthetic and moral sense very strongly ingrained Indeed they are largely synonymous with me I have no dramatic aptitude and though I flatter myself that my taste is good in music I have no knowledge of music If I have a favorite color it is a dark crimson or blue of the nature of old stained glass I derive great pleasure from all literary and pictorial art and architecture indeed art of all kinds I have facility in writing personal lyrical verse it affords me relief I think my inversion must be congenital as the desire of contact with those boys I loved began before masturbation and has lasted through private and public resorts and into university life The other sex does not attract me but I am very fond of children girls as well as boys If there is sexuality in this which I trust there is not it is latent This statement is of interest because it may well lead us to suppose that the writer who is of balanced mind and sound judgment possesses a confirmed homosexual outlook on life While however it is the rule for the permanent direction of the sexual impulse to be decided by the age of twenty that age is too early to permit us to speak positively especially in a youth whose adolescent undifferentiated or homosexual impulses are fostered by university life This proved to be the case with T D who though doubtless possessing a psychically anomalous strain is yet predominantly masculine On leaving the university his heterosexuality asserted itself normally About six years after the earlier statement he wrote that he had fallen in love I am on the eve of marrying a girl of nearly my own age She has sympathy as well as knowledge in my fields of study it was thus easier for me to explain my past and I found that she could not understand the moral objections to homosexual practices My own opinion always was that the moral objections were very considerable but might in some cases be overcome In any case I have entirely lost my sexual attraction toward boys though I am glad to say that the appreciation of their charm and grace remains My instincts therefore have undergone a considerable change but the change is not entirely in the direction of normality The instinct for sodomy in the proper sense of the word used to be unintelligible to me since the object of attraction has become a woman this instinct is mixed with the normal in my desire Further an element which much troubled me as being most foreign to my ideal feelings has not quite left me the indecent and often scatologic curiosity about immature girls I can only hope that the realization of the normal in marriage may finally kill these painful aberrations I should add that the practice of masturbation has been abandoned HISTORY XII Aged twenty four Father and mother both living the latter is of a better social standing than the father He is much attached to his mother and she gives him some sympathy He has a brother who is normally attracted to women He himself has never been attracted to women and takes no interest in them nor in their society At the age of four he first became conscious of an attraction for older males From the ages of eleven and nineteen at a large grammar school he had relationships with about one hundred boys Needless to add he considers homosexuality extremely common in schools It was however the Oscar Wilde case which first opened his eyes to the wide prevalence of homosexuality and he considers that the publicity of that case has done much if not to increase homosexuality at all events to make it more conspicuous and outspoken He is now attracted to youths about five or six years younger than himself they must be good looking He has never perverted a boy not already inclined to homosexuality In his relationship he does not feel exclusively like a male or a female sometimes one sometimes the other He is often liked he says because of his masculine character He is fully developed and healthy well over middle height inclined to be plump with full face and small moustache He smokes many cigarettes and cannot get on without them Though his manners are very slightly if at all feminine he acknowledges many feminine ways He is fond of jewelry until lately always wore a bangle and likes women s rings he is very particular about fine ties and uses very delicate women s handkerchiefs He has always had a taste for music and sings He has a special predilection for green it is the predominant color in the decoration of his room and everything green appeals to him He finds that the love of green and also of violet and purple is very widespread among his inverted friends HISTORY XIII Artist aged thirty four The earliest sex impression that I am conscious of he writes is at the age of nine or ten falling in love with a handsome boy who must have been about two years my senior I do not recollect ever having spoken to him but my desire so far as I can recall was that he should seize hold of and handle me I have a distinct impression yet of how pleasurable even physical pain or cruelty would have been at his hands I have noticed that in young children it is often difficult to differentiate the sexual emotions from what in the grown up would be definite cruelty It must have been at about this time that I discovered entirely by myself the act of masturbation The process grew up quite naturally though I cannot but think that the cooped up life in a London street and a London school with want of physical exercise as well as want of landscape color and beautiful form had much to do with it The tone of the school I was at was singularly clean but I question whether the vaunted cleanliness of tone of day schools can compensate for the open life and large discipline of an English public school How far the rather frequent masturbation between the ages of ten and thirteen may have had to do with weakly health I do not know but when I was twelve I was taken by my mother to a famous doctor He made no inquiries of a sexual nature but he advised that I should be sent away from London He had a sentimental horror of violent games et cetera for boys and put aside various suggested public schools Finally I was sent to a private school at the seaside The private school was clean and wholesome The plunge into the sexual cocytus of the great public school that followed was effectually sudden In my day was a perfect stew of uncleanness There was plenty of incontinence not much cruelty no end of dirty conversation and a great deal of genuine affection even to heroism shown among the boys in their relations to one another All these things were treated by masters and boys alike as more or less unholy with the result that they were either sought after or flung aside according to the sexual or emotional instinct of each No attempt was made at discrimination A kiss was as unclean as the act of fellatio and no one had any gauge or principle whatever on which to guide the cravings of boyhood My first initiation into the mysteries of sex was at the hands of the dormitory servant who showed me his penis when he woke me in the mornings and masturbated me when he gave me my hot bath on a Saturday night This old reprobate of forty five committed the act of fellatio with most of the boys in turn as he went the dormitory rounds For the older lads I cannot speak but over us younger ones of fourteen and fifteen he exercised a sort of unholy terror and fascination He was very popular we came to him like doves to a snake When I revisited my old school many years later he was occupying a very responsible position in the college chapel and I noticed that he wore that expression of sly reverence which I think I can now instantly detect when I see it in a man For the rest the dormitory was boisterous and lewd and there was a good deal of bullying which probably did little harm My principal recollection now is of the filthy mystery of foul talk that I neither cared for nor understood What I really needed like all the other boys was a little timely help over the sexual problems but this we none of us got and each had to work out his own principle of conduct for himself It was a long difficult and wasteful process and I cannot but believe that many of us failed in the endeavor We had come unprepared with any advice The principle upon which we were apparently trained was the repression of every instinct My mother was ignorant from innocence my father from indifference and so between them I was sent out helpless A mother incurs great responsibility in sending her child away unprepared A parent should not seek to shift his responsibility upon the schoolmaster Love alone should be the fount from which revelations should flow the master from the very nature of his position cannot reveal An imminent breakdown in health due it would now appear to quite obvious causes relieved me from the purgatory of the college dormitory and I was removed to one of the private houses These establishments were considered more select and less rough The social atmosphere was however perhaps more unwholesome because more effeminate and was full of noble young sucklings The nominal head of the house under normal conditions might have been a real leader as it was the real head of the house was a gilded young pariah fairly low down in the school and full of hypocrisy and unnatural lusts The boy who occupied the cubicle next to mine was also a bad case of sexual misdirection though he had not the social distinction to make him quite so refined a terror I had every opportunity of watching him until two years later he was fortunately asked to leave He talked bawd from morning till night got drunk on one or two occasions masturbated constantly without concealment had several of the younger boys inter femora though without evincing any care or affection for them and gave one the impression of having been born for a brothel His one redeeming quality was an element of good nature a characteristic one often finds among such as are selfish and irresponsible I have since been told that he has gone completely to the dogs Whether this young cub s sexual instincts could have been turned or guided I do not know but in a rougher and simpler life than that of a public school in a more open and less hypocritical atmosphere he might perhaps have been licked into better shape Hypocrisy is a vice however that schoolboys themselves are fortunately free from It comes later The tone among the boys was frankly and violently unclean though unclean not from instinct but from want of direction and from repression I have not a single happy recollection of this period of my school life Yet out of this morass of misbegotten virtues I plucked my first blossom of genuine affection I call it a blossom because it never ripened even to flower I had been given the extreme of filth to feed upon at the outset and now I found for myself the extreme of chastity It will be a matter of lifelong regret to me that the love which was the lodestar of my school years was never fulfilled or set upon a sound basis of comradeship When I was about one hundred sixty one two years old there came into the house a boy about two years younger than myself and who became the absorbing thought of my school days I do not remember a moment from the time I first saw him to the time I left school that I was not in love with him and the affection was reciprocated if somewhat reservedly He was always a little ahead of me in books and scholarship but as our affection ripened we spent most of our spare time together and he received my advances much as a girl who is being wooed a little mockingly perhaps but with real pleasure He allowed me to fondle and caress him but our intimacy never went further than a kiss and about that even was the slur of shame there was always a barrier between us and we never so much as whispered to one another concerning those things of which all the school obscenely talked Any connection between our own emotions and the sexual morals of the school never occurred to us In fact we lived a dream life of chastity that could not relate itself to any human conditions This was suddenly broken in upon My friend was very beautiful and an object of attraction to others That some of the elder boys had made offers of sexual intercourse to him I knew but to him as to me that was unspeakable wickedness One day I heard that four or five of these suitors of his had mishandled him they had I believe taken off his trousers and attempted to masturbate him The offense was probably horse play of an animal nature to me it seemed an unpardonable offense The matter had been reported to the master by a servant but confirmatory evidence was needed before punishment could follow I was torn asunder by passions I could not then analyze and in the end committed the greatest of schoolboy crimes I sneaked The action under the circumstances was courageous but I was indifferent so long as the boy I loved judged me rightly The result was that at the close of the term four or five of the senior boys were asked to leave The remaining brief period of my school life which had previously been a living hell became really happy That this should have been brought about to the harm of four or five boys whose sin after all was but a misdirected impulse for which the system was responsible seems to me now all very wrong Of the boys sent away however certainly three have made honorable careers For my friend and I we became more afraid of each other than before as our affections increased so our fear of them increased also The friendship was too ethereal to live but even yet we still have a deep respect for one another When at the age of nineteen I left school I was allowed to knock about for a year before entering college During this time I picked up a sexual experience that may or may not have been a valuable one I certainly look back upon it now with regret if not with horror My father had discovered some months before this date that I was in the habit of masturbating and he gave me what he conceived to be the right counsel under the circumstances If you do this he said you will never be able to use your penis with a woman Therefore your best plan will be to go with a prostitute Should you do this however you will probably pick up a beastly disease Therefore the safest way would be to do it abroad if you get the chance for there the houses are licensed Having delivered himself of this advice he troubled himself no further in the matter but left me to work out my own destiny The great physician to whom I was taken about this time also gave me his advice on this point Masturbation he said is death A number of young men come to me with the same story I tell them they are killing themselves and you will kill yourself too The doctor s hope was apparently to frighten his young patients into what he conceived to be natural conditions of life and one went away from him with the impression that every sexual manifestation in one s self was a physical infirmity due to one s own moral weakness It took me some time before I could make up my mind to follow my father s advice but after a period of real moral agony I deliberately and entirely in cold blood acted upon it I sought out a scarlet woman in the streets of and went home with her From something she said to me I know that I gave her pleasure and she asked me to come to her again This I did twice but without any real pleasure The whole thing was too sordid and soulless and the man who decides to take an evil medicine regularly has first to make up his mind that he really needs it At about the same time I chanced to be for a few months in a German university town and I determined as I had the opportunity to carry the parental advice to the logical conclusion I tried a licensed house The place was clean and decent and the conditions I take it such as one would normally find in any properly regulated continental city but to me the whole thing appeared unspeakably horrible It was a purely commercial transaction and it had not even the redeeming element of risk to one s self or of offense against a social or disciplinary code I came away feeling that I had touched bottom in my sexual experiences and I understood what it was that Faust saw when the red mouse sprang from the mouth of the witch in the Walpurgis dance These were the only occasions upon which I have had sexual intercourse with women Looking back to them now they appear to me to have been almost inevitable but if I had my life over again I would shun them as I would a lethal draught I believe I came out of the fire unscathed probably indeed it did me good in the sense that it made it possible for me to look deeper into life though to what extent seeing the torments of the damned makes us do this perhaps only a Dante could tell To gain knowledge at the expense of the shame and misery of others I hold to be fundamentally wrong and immoral What is to me however the chief and bitterest thought is that I flung away the first spring of manhood where I got no love in return His virginity is or should be as glorious and sacred a possession to a youth as to a maiden to be guarded jealously to be given only at the call of love to one who loves him be it comrade mistress or wife and whom he can love in return The full university life into which I now entered at the age of twenty brought with it a flood of new ideas feelings and sensations The friendships I made there will always remain the central ones in my life Up to my last term at college at the age of twenty four I still wore my chain mail of artificial chastity but then a change gradually set in and I began to understand the relationship of the physical phenomena of sex to its intellectual and imaginative manifestations I was not destined to fully realize this for some years and then exclusively through and out of my own personal experience It was the study of Walt Whitman s Leaves of Grass that first brought me light upon this question Hitherto I had kept the two things locked up as it were in two separate air tight compartments my friendships in one my sex instincts in another to be kept under and repressed by the public school code as I conceived it It is needless to say that I was continually troubled by the customary sex phenomena erotic dreams loss of semen troublesome erections at night et cetera These I repressed as best I could by habitual masturbation and by the regular diet and exercise which academic life made possible At one time for the period of a year I should say I tried to overcome the desire for masturbation by gradual stages on the principle of the drunkard s cure by which he took every day less tipple by the insertion of one pebble more in his bottle I marked on my calendar the erotic dreams and the nights on which I masturbated and sought gradually to extend the intervening periods Six weeks however was the longest time for which I was able to abstain A few years later the writer of this communication formed an intimate relationship in which he did not make the first advances with a youth some years younger than himself and of lower social class whose development he was able to assist But for my part he remarks I owe him as much as I gave him for his love lighted up the gold of affection that was in me and consumed the dross It was from him that I first learned that there was no such thing as a hard and fast line between the physical and the spiritual in friendship This relationship lasted for some years when the young man married its effects are described as very beneficial to both parties all the sexual troubles vanished together with the desire to masturbate Everything in life began to sing with joy and what little of real creative work I may have done I attribute largely to the power of work that was born in me during those years HISTORY XIV Scotchman aged thirty eight His paternal ancestors were normal so far as he knows His mother belonged to a very eccentric old Celtic family Soon after five he became so enamored of a young shepherd that the boy had to be sent away He practised masturbation many years before the age of puberty and attaches importance to this as a factor in the evolution of his homosexual life He has had erotic dreams rarely about men about women more frequently While indifferent to women he has no repulsion toward them He has had connection with women two or three times but without experiencing the same passionate emotions as with men He would like a son but he has never been able to get up the necessary amount of passion to lead to marriage He has always had a sentimental and Platonic affection for men Of late years he has formed two friendships with adults of an affectionate and also erotic character He cares little for anything beyond mutual masturbation and kissing what he desires is the love of the male In appearance there is nothing abnormal about him except an air of youth He is vigorous both in body and mind and has enormous power of resisting fatigue He is an excellent man of business Is a patient student He sees no harm in his homosexual passions He is averse to promiscuity His ideal is a permanent union which includes sexual relations HISTORY XV T S artist aged thirty two I was

no wish to wear woman s clothing or do woman s work As to clothes for myself I prefer black and not much jewelry I could only love a perfectly manly man from twenty one to forty years of age He must be physically beautiful and well made Size of sexual organs plays no part The muscles must be developed and the hands must be especially well shaped Hands are my fetish I could never love anyone with ugly hands He must have no odor issuing from his body though I do not dislike faint perfume when clothed and above all never have a bad breath He must be intelligent love music art literature and nature He must be refined and cultured and have been about the world He must have simplicity in behavior dress and manner and above all be clean bodied as clean minded Cynicism I cannot stand Here I may state I once owned a saint Bernard dog which reminded me much of my ideal He was always sedate always loving and faithful generally quiet He only got excited when out in the elements I have not been able to get on with people who have no sense of humor From my birth I was physically weak First I suffered from eczema Being born with a double squint I was operated on at twenty one two and again at thirty one two years of age with excellent result From four to twelve years of age I had convulsions often and all the illnesses of childhood At the age of one hundred twenty one two years I took scarlet fever followed by a weak heart which grew stronger after a year and Bright s disease which lasted fifteen years with hardly a break This illness had its wonted effect of producing melancholia and upsetting the whole nervous system Bright s disease stopped suddenly but was followed by a succession of illnesses Then I had neuritis very badly I then removed to Bavaria and to regain nervous strength I was treated by Freud s psychoanalytical method with great success I had a very bad relapse as my brother who had just heard I was homosexual came to visit me and threatened to have me put under guardians if my father should die It took me weeks to recover from the shock We broke off all intercourse and though my brother has been several times in the same town where I have been we remain strangers At this time my father died suddenly Last spring four suicides of friends in so many weeks had a very bad effect on my nerves I am now in Berlin in better spirits but the cramp continues badly at times To this I must add that since my fourteenth year independent of any illness I have suffered mentally and physically from menstrual pains recurring every twenty eight days and lasting from six to eight days That these were the equivalent pains to a woman s menstruation periods I could get no doctor to admit till I was treated for a length of time by a German nerve specialist The physical pains begin abruptly Sudden congestions of blood in the brain and in the abdomen Sudden perspirations heat and cold Great nervous pains in the small of the back also in the nerve centers of abdomen and stomach Sharp shooting pains in the breasts and especially the nipples Sudden toothache which stops as suddenly The skin becomes darker sometimes mottled I have the whole time a taste of blood in my mouth and often everything I eat tastes of blood I have great difficulty at that time in eating meat Physical longings for erotic adventure counterbalanced by mental nausea at the bare idea The mental symptoms are sudden feeling of deep depression suicidal tendencies alternating with sudden inexplicable lightheartedness Capriciousness and great dissatisfaction with myself and life generally Horror at my own incompleteness of sex and sudden fits of hatred toward women and a great longing to be loved by men This condition changes slowly back to the normal one It takes several days for me to lose my physical weakness owing to it Physically I was developed at sixteen years of age Mentally I was developed at a very early age but I kept my inner life quite dark always playing the innocent Nobody at home believed me to know anything about life They were at times very surprised when I fell out of the role I had planned for myself Up till I was seventeen years of age nothing to do with other people s morals was ever discussed before me I looked so pure and do now that people are always careful in front of me My father never discussed such things with me From my earliest childhood I loved men dearly though I was always at daggers drawn with my father and brother I worshipped my mother then as I do now My sister and I did not at all get on as children though we are the best of friends now She and her husband as well as my mother have been kindness itself ever since they knew of my condition Not till I was over thirty years did I meet a man I loved as well as my mother and he is heterosexual I must have loved my father and brother at first but continual conflicts incompatible temperaments and mutual misunderstandings and want of sympathy made life at home horrible I must admit from my earliest childhood I had a certain contempt for my father and brother because I found them so materialistic I had all my childhood rows with my brother My father took his part my mother mine After I had recovered from my father s sudden death my first words were after reading the letter Thank God it isn t mother I felt a great relief but it took a long time for me to grasp that I was really free I have always liked women s society and as a youth I was very fond of gossip which I by no means am now I have many women friends more than men friends These women friends are all heterosexual except one I very often like elderly women I suppose I see mother in such women A woman never could make me blush but a man I admired could easily I was twenty three years of age when a married woman of good family asked me to come and spend the night with her I went and though she was beautifully built cleanly and though her garments and apartments were of the utmost good taste I did not have any erection On the other hand I felt myself to be most unclean and bathed three times each of the following three days Since then I have never tried to have sexual intercourse with women In Copenhagen I tried to excite my feelings with every class of woman in vain I suppose it is that my nature is so like woman s that there can be no reaction With men I am often very shy and nervous tongue tied and my hands perspire Never so with women As a child I loved men and used to fall desperately in love with some who came to the house I would when no one was there kiss their hats or gloves or even their sticks I can remember when I was about six years how I fell in love with a very good looking twenty six year old German He had very curly hair and his hands were very beautiful He was very fond of me and I used to call him my Boy When visiting us he often used to tuck me in after the nurse had gone down He always had sweets or something for me I can remember how I used to fling my arms round his neck and cover his face with kisses I would then draw his head down on my pillow and he would tell me fairy tales and I would go off to sleep quite happy At seven years of age while staying in the country a very good looking groom about twenty five years of age misbehaved himself with me I often used to visit him in the stables as this man had a strange attraction for me One day he tickled me While doing so he produced my penis and also his own which was in full erection He tried in every way to excite my feelings in vain For him the occasion terminated in an ejaculation He forbade me to tell anyone and I did not do so but tried to find out all I could on the subject with little or no result From that day I hated the groom and I felt a sort of guilt as if I had lost something Not till I was twelve years did I understand From my earliest childhood I had one ideal of a man From that ideal I have never swerved At the age of thirty I found a friend who though quite heterosexual has without giving me any sexual intercourse given me the love I have always needed He has been for the last couple of years a second mother father sister brother and lover Through him I have regained my health my love of nature and he has helped to deaden my hatred toward human nature and my bitterness A better friend I never wish to find It has made up for all the years of mental and physical suffering One strange thing is that the feeling is mutual He has had a tragic life for his wife whom he loved beyond everything died under very sad circumstances He says I am the best male friend he has ever had While with him much of the lower nature in me was stamped out I shall always look upon him as the turning point in my life I think he wrought some of his finest influence through his music He played Beethoven and Wagner for me for a couple of hours every day for months and thus opened up a new world to me He is six years older than I am At ten years of age we moved to Sweden a country I hated from first to last About this time I began to notice that there was something strange about myself I felt myself an alien and have done so ever since An event of importance in my life was I feel sure when my father s sister tried to take away my mother s character It was done in jealousy and spite and my aunt had to beg my parents pardon Outwardly the affair was patched up but I feel sure my father never really forgave his sister Jews never forgive This event awoke in me a great hatred toward women and it was many years before I could at all control it At the age of fourteen I was much with a good looking musical American a year older than myself One day while romping very much the same thing occurred as with the groom I still had no sexual feelings We remained good friends I often wished to kiss him After the first time he would not allow it He was very much liked among the officers and so called high society men and had always much money About ten years later I heard he used to accept money after intimate intercourse with those society men During my fifteenth year I had great longing for sexual intercourse with men At this time the first signs of hair were to be seen on my abdomen At the age of sixteen a gardener a married man with family initiated me into mutual self abuse He lived in the back house of the apartment house we then inhabited He was about forty years of age an ugly but muscularly developed man These practices took place in the cellar to which there were three entrances I never allowed him to kiss me and the sight of his children always awoke in me a great feeling of nausea That was the natural reaction of a bad conscience For the man himself I had the utmost contempt This man told me of several parks and pissoirs where men met and I went to these places now and again for erotic adventure I must here relate that at the age of sixteen my mother warned me against self abuse It had the opposite effect made me curious so I began at once I have continued ever since at least once a day I have never had an involuntary emission in my whole life Between seventeen and twenty two it became necessary for me to do so several times a day Working at art painting and above all music and beauty have a strong influence over me and set my erotic longings in violent motion I have never found this do me any harm Abstinence on the other hand has a very harmful effect on me upsetting the whole nervous and physical system I often find that there is a something very much wanting in self abuse the commingling of two human bodies who are mentally as well as physically in sympathy gives an electrical satisfaction which quiets the whole nervous system That at least has been my experience The gardener left and moved to the country I then sometimes visited pissoirs or as they are often called panoramas because they are round and one sees much there What I saw in the parks during the long summer nights was quite a revelation During the summer when the husbands had sent their families in the country many of them led a very indiscreet life What I saw the first summer killed all the respect I had for elderly people I had always connected marriage and gray hairs with virtue and morals then I learnt otherwise I must say I became about this time a sensual pig I knew how dangerous these places were on account of the police and blackmailers but that gave the hunt a double zest At this time I led a double life and was always watching and analyzing myself I had to do with heaps of men of all classes I was often offered money but that I would on no condition accept To pay or to be paid kills every sort of erotic feeling in me and always has done so I once wished to experiment with myself I was offered a small sum of money by a former schoolmaster I accepted this just to see how it would affect me The next moment I threw the money as far away as possible Then I saw I had none of the prostitute nature in me I was simply overwhelmed with sensuality I considered I was a criminal and wished to see in how many ways my nature had the criminal instinct I wanted to see if I could become a thief I stole a silver button in a shop where antiquities were sold but I went to the shop the same day again and returned the button without the people knowing I found I could not become a thief Then the question came Why had I felt a criminal since my seventh year Was it my fault If not whose fault was it Not till I studied Freud s psychoanalytical system did I get a clear insight into my own character When I was twenty years of age I met a gentleman one night in a heavy snow storm We walked and talked and understood each other He belonged to one of Sweden s first aristocratic families He was extremely refined He asked me to his rooms We undressed and lay down He had a very beautiful head and a still more beautiful body I think that all my erotic feelings were numbed by looking at his beautiful body To me anything sensual would have been sacrilege I thought and I can remember the feeling of awe which came over me He was them twenty years of age but his hair was quite white First he did not understand and then he was very gentle to me I kept perfectly chaste for three whole months after the sight of his body We saw each other often Eight years later we met for the last time He suffered much from melancholia At that time I prevented him from committing suicide This winter however he shot himself At the age of twenty two my sister introduced me to a charming intelligent and refined half English half Swedish painter We recognized each other at once though we had never seen each other before and even knew each other s characters to the smallest traits My parents liked him better than any friend I had ever had My sister and he were from the first like sister and brother The first evening in my home he and I kissed each other The women were mad about him Later I found many men were too I was three weeks his senior He had his own rooms I have never felt any such wonderful harmony as when our naked bodies mingled It was like floating in ether With him it was the only time I had been active in fellatio We were much together though not much physically for he had many love affairs with women What I loved was the way he would cut off all advances of men I was his little brother and so he calls me to this day He is now married in America and the father of a pretty little daughter We are the best of friends to this day The two years in Copenhagen were some of the happiest I have spent though nearly the whole time I was in physical pain In Austria I found among the Tyrolese peasants that the Englishmen who come there in winter for sports and in the summer for mountain climbing have demoralized the young male peasants with money Homosexual intercourse is easy to get if you are willing to pay the price larger in season less out of season In Italy it is merely a question of money or passion but everything in love there is quite transient In Bavaria I found the love and peace which passeth all understanding This love and friendship without anything of a physically intimate nature brought me back from the deep black gulf to which I was swiftly floating When I met my friend I was nearly at the end of my tether What his love and friendship has done for me together with Freud s psychoanalytical system nobody will ever know Since being in Berlin a town I like very much a new life has opened for me a life where one lives as one likes if one does not have to do with young boys Here are homosexual baths pensions restaurants and hotels where you can go with one of your own sex at a certain fee per hour Berlin is a revelation But since being here I find the physical erotic side of my nature is little excited I suppose it is the old story of forbidden fruit My parents kept a very hospitable home The last two years in Sweden I was never at home I hated society and knew much too much about the private histories of those who came to my home They all belonged to the highest society The highest society and the lowest are very much alike Of course my parents knew nothing about these people When I told my mother a great deal of private history of people who came to our house she was thunderstruck and could at last understand my contempt for so called good society I have visited in later years only in artistic and theatrical circles I consider that class of people more natural than the other class and much more kind hearted My life has quite another side the mystic side But that would be a much longer story than this Suffice it to say I am of a highly sensitive nature gifted with second sight A detailed record of the subject s visions premonitions of death of acquaintances et cetera has been furnished by him I tried on four occasions to commit suicide but I now see there is nothing to be gained by doing so Two years ago I told my parents about my sexual condition It was a frightful blow to them My father had the circumstances explained to him he never understood the matter and never discussed it with me Had I told him earlier I feel quite certain that with his despotic nature he would have put me in a madhouse My mother and sister have treated me very kindly always My brother has disowned me HISTORY XVI Irish aged thirty six knows of nothing unusual in his ancestry His tastes are masculine in every respect He is strong healthy and fond of exercises and sports The sexual instincts are abnormally developed he confesses to an enormous appetite for almost everything food drink smoking and all the good things of life At about the age of fourteen he practised masturbation with other boys of the same age and also had much pleasure in being in bed with an uncle with whom the same thing was practised Later on he practised masturbation with every boy or man with whom he was on terms of intimacy to have been in bed with anyone without anything of the sort taking place would have made sleep impossible and rendered him utterly wretched His erotic dreams at first were concerned with women but more recently they are usually of young men and very rarely of women He is mostly indifferent to women as also they have always been to him Although good looking strong and masculine he has never known a woman to be in love with him When about the age of eighteen he imagined he was in love with a girl and he had often between the ages of twenty to thirty cohabited with prostitutes He remembers on one occasion many years ago having connection with a woman seven or eight times in one night and then having to masturbate at noon the next day He is unmarried and thinks it is unlikely that he ever will marry but he adds that if a healthy handsome and intelligent woman fell in love with him he might change his mind as it would be lonely to be old and alone and he would like to have children He is never attracted to men older than himself and prefers youths between the ages of eighteen and twenty five They may be of any class but he does not like common people and is not attached to uniforms or liveries The requisite attractions are an intelligent eye a voluptuous mouth and intelligent teeth If Alcibiades himself tried to woo me he says and had bad teeth his labor would be in vain He has sometimes been the active participant in pedicatio and has tried the passive role out of curiosity but prefers fellatio He does not consider that he is doing anything wrong and regards his acts as quite natural His only regret is the absorbing nature of his passions which obtrude themselves in season and out of season seldom or never leaving him quiet and sometimes making his life a hell Yet he doubts whether he would change himself even if he had the power HISTORY XVII Age twenty five is employed in an ordinary workshop and lives in the back alley of a large town in which he was born and bred Fair slight and refined in appearance The sexual organs are normal and well developed and the sexual passions strong His mother is a big masculine woman and he is much attached to her Father is slight and weakly He has seven brothers and one sister Homosexual desires began at an early age though he does not seem to have come under any perverse influences He is not inclined to masturbation Erotic dreams are always of males He declares he never cared for any woman except his mother and that he could not endure to sleep with a woman He says he generally falls in love with a man at first sight as a rule some one older than himself and of higher class and longs to sleep and be with him In one case he fell in love with a man twice his own age and would not rest until he had won his affection He does not much care what form the sexual relation takes He is sensitive and feminine by nature gentle and affectionate He is neat and orderly in his habits and fond of housework helps his mother in washing et cetera He appears to think that male attachments are perfectly natural HISTORY XVIII Englishman born in Paris aged twenty six an actor He belongs to an old English family his father so far as he is aware had no homosexual inclinations nor had any of his ancestors on the paternal side but he believes that his mother s family and especially a maternal uncle who had a strong feeling for beauty of form were more akin to him in this respect His earliest recollections show an attraction for males At children s parties he incurred his father s anger by kissing other small boys and his feelings grew in intensity with years He has never practised self abuse and seldom had erotic dreams when they do occur they are about males His physical feeling for women is one of absolute indifference He admires beautiful women in the same way as one admires beautiful scenery At the same time he likes to talk with clever women and has formed many friendships with frank pure and cultivated English girls for whom he has the utmost admiration and respect Marriage is impossible because physical pleasure with women is impossible he has tried but cannot obtain the slightest sexual feeling or excitement He especially admires youths though they must not be immature from sixteen or seventeen to about twenty five The type which physically appeals to him most and to which he appeals is fair smooth skinned gentle rather girlish and effeminate with the effeminacy of the ingenue not the cocotte His favorite to attract him must be submissive and womanly he likes to be the man and the master On this point he adds The great passion of my life is an exception and stands on an utterly different level It realizes an ideal of marriage in which neither is master but both share a joint empire and in which tyranny would be equally painful to both But this friendship and love is for an equal a year younger than myself and does not preclude other and less creditable liaisons physical constancy being impossible to men of our caliber Pedicatio is the satisfaction he prefers provided he takes the active never the passive role He is handsome with broad shoulders good figure and somewhat classic type of face with fine blue eyes He likes boating and skating though not cricket or football and is usually ready for fun but has at the same time a taste for reading He has no moral feelings on these matters he regards them as outside ethics mere matters of temperament and social feeling If England were underpopulated he thinks he might possibly feel some slight pangs of remorse but as things are he feels that in prostituting males rather than females he is doing a meritorious action HISTORY XIX T N His history is given in his own words From the time of my earliest imaginings I have always been attached by strength in men and often thought about being carried off by big warriors and living with them in caves and elsewhere When about seven a young man used to show me his penis and handle mine occasionally At private boarding school masturbation was fairly frequent and I suppose I was initiated about twelve or thirteen After leaving I occasionally indulged but nothing happened until I was about twenty except that I was often attracted by strong well built young men of good character a man who was not honest and good hearted had no attraction At twenty I was much attached to a young man of my own age He was engaged This did not prevent him on one occasion endeavoring playfully and with his brother to obtain access to my person I successfully resisted although if he only had been present I should not have done so but welcomed the attempt and I have often regretted I did not let him know this But I had a dim idea that my penis was somewhat undeveloped and this made me shy Circumstances separated us About two years later I was crossing the Channel when I engaged in conversation with a man about eight years older who was one of our travelling party I think the attraction was a case of love at sight certainly on my side A few nights later he had so arranged that we shared a bedroom and he very soon came over to me and tenderly handled my person I reciprocated and I look back all these years to that night with pleasure and no feeling of shame On one occasion about this time I happened to be sleeping with another young fellow an office mate on a holiday when I awoke and found him handling my penis caressingly I gently removed his hand and turned over I thought none the less of him but my body seemed to belong only to myself and the friend I loved He was not an urning I am sure but we Were often together and I much entered into his interests and felt infinite satisfaction with life made good progress and many friends Our physical intimacy was repeated he taking the active part in intercrural contact Then he married very happily Our friendship remains but circumstances prevent our often meeting and there is no longer desire on either part For some years I was rather lonely in spite of friends I was somewhat attracted to another man but his superior social position was a defect to me Then when about twenty eight I came in contact with a young man of twenty four of the artisan class but superior in ideals and intelligence to most men I loved him at first glance and to this day At first it was just friendship but soon his form voice and thoughts entered into my very soul by day and night I longed always to be near him to see him progress and help him if I could I would joyfully have given up home friends and income and followed him to the end of the world preferably an island where we two might at least be the only white men He seemed to embody all I longed for in the way of knowledge of nature of strength of practical ability and the desire to imitate him in these things widened and strengthened my character The first time I slept with him I could only summon courage to put my arm over his chest but I could not sleep for unsatisfied desire and the unrelieved erection caused a dull pain on the morrow I had always disliked conversation that might be regarded as bordering on the obscene and consequently was very ignorant on most matters it pained me even to hear him laugh at such remarks I think if he had been intimate with me I should have not conversed much on such topics but now I felt pleasure in such things with him as they expressed intimacy I dreamed about him and was never really happy in his absence the greatest joy would have been to have slept in his arms the hairiness of his legs and arms were also most fascinating Perhaps a year later we were again at night together and this time I by degrees felt his private organs but he was cold and I felt a little unsatisfied I wanted to be hugged This happened once more and then on a later occasion not that it afforded me much gratification but because I wanted to stimulate him to ardor I attempted masturbation This aroused his disgust and I was consequently dismayed He told me I ought to marry and although I knew his love was all I wanted I did not feel but what I could make a woman happy The constant unrelieved erections which took place when I saw my friend adopt a graceful attitude caused pain at the bottom of my back and I consulted two specialists who also advised marriage I did not tell them I was an invert for I hardly knew it was a recognized thing but I did tell them something of what had taken place and they made next to no comment but implied it was frequent My friend now felt repulsion toward me but did not express himself and as other circumstances then caused a barrier between us to a certain extent I did not realize the true reason of his coldness But I felt utterly miserable When I met a noble woman whom I had long known I asked her to be my wife and she consented Although I told her very soon and long before our marriage of my limitations as a husband and of my continued longing for my friend I feel now I did a great wrong and I cannot understand why I was not more conscious of this at the time that I was to a certain extent deceiving her relations was inevitable I had expected to devote my life in making her happy but I soon found that the true reason of my friend s apparent unfaithfulness was my own action combined with a feeling on his part that it was as well that our affection should cease even at the cost of misunderstanding Since then three years ago I have not had a happy day or night and am therefore quite unable to promote happiness in others Without my friend I can find no satisfaction with wife child or home Life has become almost unbearable Often I have seriously thought of committing suicide only to postpone it to a time which would be less cruelly inopportune to others I see my friend now married almost daily and suffer tortures at seeing others nearer to him than myself No explanation seems possible as the whole idea of inversion is so repugnant to him and being an honorable man he would feel marital ties preclude any warmth of affection But all the longing of my life seems to be culminating in a driving force which will carry me to the male prostitute or to death I can concentrate my mind on nothing else and consequently have become inefficient in work and have no heart for play I know if my longings could be occasionally satisfied I should immediately recover but my fear is that if I killed myself those who knew me in happier days would only be confirmed in the impression of my degeneracy and would feel my instincts had caused it whereas it is the denial and starvation of them which would have brought about the result I know now by experience of self and others that my disposition is congenital and that I have been rendered unhappy myself and a cause of unhappiness to others by the too late knowledge of myself The example of my former friend who married misled me to think I too could marry and make a happy home so that when the man I loved advised me I resolved to do so as I would have done almost anything else he suggested If I could have withdrawn from the engagement without embarrassment to the devoted woman who became my wife I would have done so if she gave me the opportunity Nothing in my married state has brought me pleasure and I often wish my wife would cease to love me so that we might separate But she would be heart broken at the suggestion and I feel driven to attempt to relieve my feelings even in a way that has previously seemed repulsive to me I mean by use of money About my feelings toward my child there is not much to say as they are not very strong I believe I carry him and help bathe and attend to him as much as most fathers and when he is a few years older I hope I may find him very companionable But he has brought me no real joy though I see other men look at him almost with affection But he has brought added happiness to his mother

5719-233361-0006	train-other-500	he crouched between their thighs and called himself their dirty pig and by their orders he performed services for their genitals and buttocks which he contemplated and handled with relish At about the same period when these visions began to come to him

none	none	 Between the age of eight and eleven he twice took the penis of a cousin into his mouth 
5719-233361-0008	train-other-500	after they had slept together the feeling of the penis pleased him When sleeping with another cousin they used to lie with hands outstretched to cover each other s penis or nates He preferred the nates but his cousin the penis
5719-233361-0009	train-other-500	Neither of these cousins was homosexual and there was no attempt at mutual masturbation He was in the habit of playing with five male cousins One of these boys was unpopular with the others and they invented a method of punishing him for supposed offenses
5719-233361-0010	train-other-500	They sat around the room on chairs each with his penis exposed and the boy to be punished went around the room on his knees and took each penis into his mouth in turn This was supposed to humiliate him It did not lead to masturbation
5719-233361-0011	train-other-500	On one occasion the child accidentally observed a boy who sat next to him in school playing with his penis and caressing it This gave him a powerful uneasy sensation
5719-233361-0012	train-other-500	With regard to all these points the subject observes that none of the boys with whom he was connected at this period and who were exposed to precisely the same influences became homosexual He was himself from the first indifferent to the opposite sex
5719-233361-0013	train-other-500	In early childhood and up to the age of thirteen he had frequent opportunities of closely inspecting the sexual organs of girls his playfellows These roused no sexual excitement On the contrary the smell of the female parts affected him disagreeably
5719-233361-0014	train-other-500	When he once saw a schoolfellow copulating with a little girl it gave him a sense of mystical horror Nor did the sight of the male organs arouse any particular sensations He is however of opinion that living with his sisters in childhood
5719-233361-0015	train-other-500	he felt more curious about his own sex as being more remote from him He showed no effeminacy in his preferences for games or work He went to a public school Here he was provoked by boy friends to masturbate but though he often saw the act in process
5719-233361-0016	train-other-500	it only inspired him with a sense of indecency In his fifteenth year puberty commenced with nocturnal emissions and at the same time he began to masturbate and continued to do so about once a week or once a fortnight during a period of eight months
5719-233361-0017	train-other-500	always with a feeling that that was a poor satisfaction and repulsive His thoughts were not directed either to males or females while masturbating He spoke to his father about these signs of puberty and by his father s advice he entirely abandoned onanism

5719-233361-0020	train-other-500	These second visions took the form of the large erect organs of naked young grooms or peasants These gross visions offended his taste and hurt him though at the same time they evoked a strong active desire for possession he took a strange poetic pleasure in the ideal form
5719-233361-0021	train-other-500	But the seminal losses which accompanied both kinds of dreams were a perpetual source of misery to him There is no doubt that at this time that is between the fifteenth and seventeenth years a homosexual diathesis had become established

5719-233361-0037	train-other-500	As he began to do this he also began to regain calm and comparative health He formed a close alliance with a youth of nineteen This liaison was largely sentimental and marked by a kind of etherealized sensuality
5719-233361-0038	train-other-500	It involved no sexual acts beyond kissing naked contact and rare involuntary emissions About the age of thirty six he began freely to follow homosexual inclinations After this he rapidly recovered his health

none	none	 It may be added that the narrative is also not without interest as a study in the evolution of a man of letters a child whose imagination was thus early exercised and developed was predestined for a literary career HISTORY XXI Almost the earliest recollection I have is of a dream which from my vivid recollection of its details must have repeated itself I think more than once unless my waking thoughts unconsciously added definition From this dream dated my consciousness of the attraction to me of my own sex which has ever since dominated my life The dream suggested in part I think by a picture in an illustrated newspaper of a mob murdering a church dignitary took this form I dreamed that I saw my own father murdered by a gang of ruffians but I do not remember that I felt any grief though I was actually an exceedingly affectionate child The body was then stripped of its clothing and eviscerated I had at the time no notion of anatomical details but the particulars remain distinct to my mind s eye of entrails uniformly brown the color of dung and there was no accompaniment of blood When the abdomen had been emptied the incident in which I became an active participant occurred I was seized and the fact that I was overpowered contributed to the agony of delight it afforded me and was laid between the thighs of my murdered parent and from there I had presently crawled my way into the evacuated abdomen The act so far as I can decide of a dream at an age when emission was out of the question caused in me extreme organic excitement At all events I used afterward definitely to recur to it in the waking moments before sleep for the purpose of gaining a state of erection The dream had no outcome it seemed to reach its goal in the excitement it caused I was at that time between three and four years old I have been told that erections occurred when I was only two years old It was between three and four that I used to induce at all events the sensation of an erection But I was nearer five when sitting on my bed and waiting to be dressed I got an involuntary erection and called my nurse s attention to it asking what it meant The appearance must therefore have been usual to me at that date but certainly the sensation was not At that time I was totally ignorant of the conditions of puberty which afterward when I discovered them so powerfully affected me I could not even visualize the private organs of a man I made no deductions from myself The only naked bodies I had seen then I judge from circumstances not from any actual memory of the facts were those of my own sisters In the waking dreams which I began to construct though I recurred often to the one already narrated the goal of my desire was generally to nestle between the thighs or to have my face pressed against the hinder parts of the object of my worship But for a time my first dream so engrossed me that I did not indulge in any promiscuity Gradually however my horizon enlarged and took in besides the first mentioned three others a cousin very much my elder an uncle and the curate of the parish At this stage I began to invent circumstances for the indulgence of my passion One of the earliest was to imagine myself in a tank with my three lovers floating in the water above me From this position I visited their limbs in turn the attraction rested in the thighs and buttocks only I fancy this limitation of the charm to the lower parts only lasted until actual experience of a more complete embrace made me as much a lover of the arms and breast indeed later I became more emotionally enamored of these parts than of all the rest At the beginning of things I simply loved best what my mind could first get hold of Quite early in my experience when I was not more than five I awoke earlier than usual and saw my nurse standing in complete nudity commencing her toilet She seemed to me a gross coarse and meaningless object the hair under her armpits displeased me and still more that on the lower part of her body In the case of men directly I came to have cognizance of the same thing on their bodies the effect was exactly the opposite It so happened that about this time the gardener had received some injury to his leg and in showing the bruise to another exhibited before my eyes a skin completely shagged over with dark hair Though the sight of the bruise repulsed me my pleasure was intense and the vision of the gardener s legs was in my bed every night for a week afterward My point is that the sight of my nurse was liable to rouse interest just as much as the far more prosaic display of the gardener s wounded leg but my nature made it impossible It was about this time if not before that an enormous sense of shyness with regard to all my private duties began to afflict me So great was it that I could endure from no hand except my mother s or my nurse s the necessary assistance in the buttoning and unbuttoning of my garments always excepting those who were about my own age toward whom I felt no privacy whatever When I was a little more than five I formed a friendship with a young clerk a youth of about fifteen though he seemed to me a grown up person One day as he sat at his desk writing I sat down and began playing with his feet investigating the height to which his socks went under his trousers in this way I obtained six inches of bare leg Conscious of my courage I fell to kissing it My friend laughed but left me to my devotions in peace This was the first time in which a feeling of romance mixed itself in my dreams the physical excitement was less but the pleasure was greater I cannot understand why I never repeated the experience He remained to me an object of very special and tender consideration In the next episode I have to relate the ideal was totally absent and the part I played was passive rather than active I was put to sleep with a boy considerably my senior His initiation led to a physical familiarity between us which was not warm or kind and I was allowed no scope for my own instinctive desires for a warmer kind of contact if I sought it under cover of my companion s slumbers I found myself kicked away Only on one occasion did I find a few moments of supreme charm while his sleep remained sound by discovering in the recesses of the sheet an exposed surface of flesh against which I pressed my face in an abandonment of joy For the rest I was a passive participant his pleasure seeming to end in the mere handling of the fleshy portions of my body For this purpose I usually lay face downward across his knees So far as I can remember this intimacy led to a decrease in my pursuit of imaginative pleasures for about a year no further development took place At about this date I was circumcised on account of the prepuce being too long Between the sixth and seventh years a change of environment brought me into contact with a new set of faces I had then a bed to myself and once more my imagination awoke to life It was at this time that I found myself constructing from men s faces suppositions as to the rest of their bodies a brown face led me to suppose a uniformly brown body a pale face a pale body This idea of variety began to charm me I now made definite choice in my reveries whether I would go to sleep between white thighs or red thighs or brown thighs Going to sleep definitely describes the goal of the method to which I had addicted myself As soon as I entered my bed I abandoned myself to the construction of an amour and retained it as long as I had consciousness I may say that I was not conscious of any emissions under these circumstances until some years later when I brought it about by my own act but the pleasure was fairly acute All this time there were secret meetings with my bedfellow of the year before But they now took place by day in various hiding places with little unclothing or exposure and my companion was cold and fastidious and repelled any warmth on my part it became to me a dry sort of ritual I had an idea at that time that the whole thing was so much an original invention of his and mine that there was no likelihood of it being practised by anyone else in the world But this consideration did not restrain me in constructing love scenes with all those whose appearance attracted me At this period nearly every man with whom I came in contact won at least my transient desire only the quite old and deformed lay outside the scope of my wishes Many of my amours developed in church the men who sat near me were the objects of my attention and the clergyman whose sermon I did not listen to supplied me with an occasion for reverie on the charms his person would have for me under other circumstances It must have been at this time that I began to elaborate ideas of a serried rank of congregated thighs across which I lay and was dragged I would arrange them in definite order and then imagine myself drawn across from one to the other somewhat forcibly Admiration of strength was beginning at this time to have a definite part in my conceptions but anything of the nature of cruelty had not then appealed to me I except the original dream of my childhood which seems to me still to stand fantastically apart In the inventions to which I now gave myself the sense of being passed across limbs of different texture and color was subtle and pleasurable I think the note of constructive cruelty which now followed arose from an imagined rivalry among my lovers for possession of me the idea that I was desired made me soon take a delight in imagining myself torn and snatched about by the contending parties Presently out of this I began constructing definite scenes of violence I was able in imagination to lie in the thick and stress of conglomerated deliciousness of thighs struggling to hold me I was able to imagine at least six bodies encircling me with passionate contact At the same time I had an ingrained feeling of my own physical smallness in relation to the limbs whose contact threw me into such paroxysms of delight A new and sufficiently ludicrous invention took possession of me I imagined myself strapped to the thigh always I think the right one of the man on whom I chose for the time to concentrate my desires and so to be worn by him during his day s work hidden beneath his garments I was not conscious of any difficulty due to my size The charm of bondage and compulsion was here again in the ascendant I fancy that it was in this connection that I first anticipated whipping as the delightful climax to my emotions administered when my possessor at the end of his day s work unclothed himself for rest Up to this stage my attraction to the male organ of generation had been slight and vague Two things now contributed to bring thought of it into prominence On two or three occasions when I accompanied farm laborers to their occupations I saw them pause by the way to relieve nature My extreme shyness as regards such matters in my own person made this performance in my presence like an outrage on my modesty it had about it the suggestion of an indecent solicitation to one whose inclination was to headlong and delirious surrender I stood rooted and flushing with downcast eyes till the act was over and was conscious for a considerable time of stammering speech and bewildered faculties When I afterward reviewed the circumstances they had the same attraction for me that amorous cruelty was just then beginning to exercise on my imagination My mind secretly embraced the fearful sweetness of the newly discovered sensation surrounding the performance of the function with all sorts of atrocious and bizarre inventions For a time my intellect hung back from accepting this as the central and most fiery secret of the male attraction but shortly afterward when out walking with my father I saw him perform the same act I was overwhelmed with emotion and could barely drag my feet from the spot or my eyes from the damp herbage where he had deposited the waters of secrecy Even today when my mind has been long accustomed to the knowledge of generative facts I cannot dissociate myself from the shuddering charm that moment had for me The attraction my father s person had always had for me was now increased tenfold by the performance I had witnessed though I had not seen the penis in any of these cases For a considerable time only those lovers were dominant in my imagination whom I had witnessed in the act that had so poignantly affected me My delight now took the form of imagining myself strapped to the thighs of the person while this function was in progress By this time I must have been eight years old The cold and secret relationship of which I have given an account had continued without instructing me in any of the ardent possibilities it might have suggested no force or cruelty was used upon me no warmth was lavished It made little difference that my companion had now discovered the act of masturbation it had no meaning to me since it led to no warmth of embrace His method was to avert himself from me I had to fawn upon him from the rear and also to invent indecent stories to stimulate his imagination I felt myself a despised instrument the mere spectator of an act which if directed toward me with any warmth would have aroused the liveliest appetite At this time as I have since seen my companion was gaining knowledge from the ancient classics For a time some charm was imparted by his instructing me to adopt a superincumbent face to face embrace The beginning of his puberty was enormously attractive to me had he been less cold blooded I could have responded passionately to his endearments but he always insisted on rigorous passivity on my part and he explained nothing One day by a small gratuity he induced me to offer him my mouth though I still had no comprehension of the result I was helping to attain Once the orgasm occurred and the effect was extremely nauseous after that he was more careful My companion was approaching manhood and his demands became more frequent his exactions more humiliating At the same time my passion for male love was growing stronger I was able to construct from the unsatisfactory bondage in which I was held images of bodily embrace which I had not before had sufficient sense of human contact to form though I seldom imagined any of the acts that in actual experience repulsed me One day however I shirked a particularly repulsive humiliation which my companion had forced upon me He discovered the deception rose from the prone position in which he lay and throwing me across his knees thrashed me violently I submitted without a struggle experiencing a curious sensation of pleasure in the midst of my pain When he repeated his order I found its accomplishment no longer repulsive One of the few pleasurable memories this intimacy extending over years has left for me is that moment of abject abasement to one who with no warmth of feeling had yet once had sufficient energy to be brutal to me It must have been from this incident that the calculated effect of flagellation began to have weight with me when I indulged my imagination A wish to be repulsed trampled violated by the object of my passion took hold of my instincts Even then and indeed up to my thirteenth year I had no idea of normal sexual connection I knew vaguely that children were born from women s bodies I did not know and when told I did not believe the true facts of the marital relationship All that I had experienced both in fact and imagination was to me so highly individual that I had no notion anything kindred to it could exist outside of my own experience I had no notion of sex as the basis of life Even when I came gradually to realize that men and women were formed in a way that argued connection with each other I still believed it to be a dissolute sort of conduct not to be indulged in by those who had claims to respectability I had however by this time arrived at a strong attraction toward the organs of generation and all aspects of puberty and my imagination spent Itself in a fantastic worship of every sign of masculinity My enjoyment now was to imagine myself forced to undergo physical humiliation and submission to the caprice of my male captors and the central fact became the discharge of urine from my lover over my body and limbs or if I were very fond of him I let it be in my face This was followed usually by a half caressing castigation in which the hand only was instrumental The period of which I am now writing was that of my entry into school life My imaginary lovers immediately became numerous all the masters and all the boys above a certain age attracted me for two I had in addition a feeling of romantic as well as physical attachment Indeed from this time onward I was never without some heroes toward whom I indulged a perfectly separate and tenderly ideal passion The announcement that one was about to leave surprised me into a passionate fit of weeping yet my reserve was so great and my sense of isolation so crushing that I made no effort at intimacy and to one for whom I felt inexhaustible devotion I barely spoke for the first three years though meeting him daily At this time the subjects of my contemplation had distinctly individualized methods of approach Thus in one case I imagined we stood face to face in our night gear suddenly mine was stripped from me I was seized and forcibly thrust under his and made to hang with my feet off the ground by my full weight on the erect organ which inserted itself between my thighs so suspended my body enveloped in the folds of his linen and my face pressed upon his heart I underwent a castigation which continued until I was thrown down to receive a discharge of urine over my prostrate body Such images seemed to come independently of my will It was at this time that I found a large pleasure in imagining contact with people whom I disliked the prevailing note of these intimacies was always cruelty to which I submitted with acute relish I discovered however from the ordinary school experiences of corporal punishment that it had no charm to me when administered for school offenses even from the hands under which at other times I imagined myself as delighting to receive pain The necessary link was lacking had I perceived on the part of my judge any liking for the operation there would probably have been a response on my side On one occasion I was flogged unjustly conscious as I was of its cruel instead of judiciary character this was the only castigation I received which had in it an element of gratification for my instincts At the same time I never forgave the hand that administered it it is the only instance I remember in myself of a grudge nourished for years Meanwhile amid this chaos of confused love and hatred of relish for cruelty and loathing for injustice my first thoroughly romantic and ideal attachment was developing itself I may say of those to whom romance as well as physical attachment bound me that they have remained unchangeable parts of my nature Today as it was twenty years ago when I think of them the blood gushes to my brain my hands tingle and moisten with an emotion I cannot subdue I am at their feet worshipping them Of them my dreams were entirely tender the idea of cruelty never touched the conception I had of them But I return to that one who was the chief influence of my youth older than myself by only three years he was of fine build and athletic with adolescence showing in his face my tremulous beginnings of worship were confirmed by a word of encouragement thrown to me one day as I went to receive my first flogging no doubt my small scared face excited his kind pity I made it my concern afterward to let him know that I had not cried under the ordeal and I believe he passed the word around that I had taken my punishment pluckily So little contact had I with him that beyond constant worship on my part I remember nothing till about three years later I received from him a kind half joking solicitation spoken in clean and simple language So terrific was my shyness and secrecy that I had even then no idea that familiarity of the sort was common enough in schools I was absolutely unable to connect my own sensations with those of the world at large or to believe that others felt as I did On this occasion I simply felt that some shrewd thrust had been made at me for the detection of my secret He had drawn me upon his knee I sat there silent flushing and dumbfounded He made no attempt to press me he had as he thought said enough if I chose to be reciprocal beyond that he would not tempt me A few years ago I heard of him married and prosperous In following up my emotions in this direction I have far outstripped the period up to which I have given a complete exposition of my development I must have been more than twelve years old before school life persuaded me to face as taught by sniggering novices the actual facts of sexual intercourse At the same time I learned that I had means of extracting enjoyment from my own body in a definite direction which I had not till then suspected A growing resistance on my part to his cold desires had led to a break with my former intimate to the last he had taught me nothing except distaste for himself I now found ready teachers right and left of me One of my schoolfellows invited me to watch him in the process of masturbation the spectacle left me quite unmoved the result appeared to me far less exciting than the discharge of urine which until then I had associated with male virility I was so accustomed to my own lone amorous broodings that the effort and action required for this process when I attempted to imitate it disconcerted my thoughts and interfered with concentration on my own inventions I had never experienced the pleasure accompanying the spasm of emission and there seemed to be nothing worth trying for along that road I desisted and returned to my reveries I was now in a perfect maze of promiscuity there must have been at least fifty people who attracted me at that time I developed a liking for imagining myself between two lovers generally men who were physical contrasts It was my habit to analyze as minutely as possible those who attracted me To gain intimacy with what was below the surface I studied with attention their hands the wrists where they disappeared showing the hair of the forearm and the neck I estimated the comparative size of the generative organs the formation of the thighs and buttocks and thus constructed a presentment of the whole man The more vividly I could do this the keener was the pleasure I was able to obtain from their contemplated embraces Till now I had been absolutely untouched by any moral scruples I had the usual acquiescence in the religious beliefs in which I had been trained it did not enter my head that there was any divine law one way or the other concerning the allurements of the imagination From my thirteenth year slight hints of uneasiness began to creep into my conscience I began perhaps to understand that the formulas of religion to which I had listened all my life with as little attention as possible had some meaning which now and then touched the circumstances of my own life I had not yet realized that my past foretold my future and that women would be to me a repulsion instead of an attraction where things sexual were concerned I had the full conviction that one day I should be married I had also some fear that as I grew to manhood I might succumb to the temptations of loose women I had an incipient revulsion from such a fate and this seemed to me to indicate that moral stirrings were at work within me One night I was amorously attacked in my bedroom by two of the domestics I experienced an acute horror which I hid under laughter my resistance was so desperate that I escaped with a tickling I had been accustomed to sit on the servants knees a habit I had innocently retained from childhood I can now recall in detail the approaches these women had been used to make me At the time I was utterly oblivious that anything was intended I was equally oblivious to things that had a nearer relation to my own feelings In passing along a side street one night I was overtaken by a man who began conversation on the weather He asked me if I were not cold began passing his hand up and down my back then came a question about caning at school whether certain parts of me were not sore leading to an investigating touch I put his hand aside shyly but did not resent the action Presently he was for exploring my trousers pockets and I began to think him a pickpocket repulsed in that direction he returned to rubbing my back The sensation was pleasant I now took him for a pimp who wished to take me to a prostitute and as at that time I had begun to realize that such pleasures were not to my taste I was glad to find myself at my destination and said good bye sharply leaving him standing full of astonishment at his failure with one who had taken his advances so pleasantly I could not bring myself to believe that others had the same feelings as myself Later I realized my escape not without a certain amount of regret and constructed for my own pleasure a different termination to the incident I was now so possessed by masculine attraction that I became a lover of all the heroes I read of in books Some became as vivid to me as those with whom I was living in daily contact For a time I became an ardent lover of Napoleon the incident of his anticipation of the nuptials with his second wife attracting me by its impetuous brutality of Edward I and of Julius Caesar Charles II I remember by a caressing cruelty with which my imagination gifted him Jugurtha was a great acquisition Bothwell Judge Jefferies and many villains of history and fiction appealed to me by their cruelty I had become an adept in the mental construction necessary for the satisfaction of my desires And yet up to that date I had never seen the nude body of a full grown adult I had no knowledge of the extent to which hair in certain instances develops on the torso indeed my efforts at characterization centered for the most part around the thighs and generative organs At this time one of my schoolfellows saw a common workman known to me by name bathing in a stream with some companions all his body was my informant told me covered with hair from throat to belly In face the man was coarse and repulsive but I now began to regard him as a lovely monstrosity and for many nights embraced the vision of him passionately with face buried in the jungle growth of hair that covered his chest I was for the first time conscious of deliberately and successfully willing not to see his face which was distasteful to me At the same time another schoolfellow told me concerning a master who bathed with the boys that hair showed above his bathing drawers as high as the navel I now began definitely to construct bodies in detail the suggestion of extensive hairiness maddened me with delight but remained in my mind strongly associated with cruelty my hairy lovers never behaved to me with tenderness everything at this period I think tended to draw me toward force and violence as an expression of amativeness A schoolfellow a few years my senior of a cruel bullying disposition took a particular delight in inflicting pain on me he had particularly pointed shoes and it was his custom to make me stand with my back to him while he addressed me in petting and caressing tones just when his words were at their kindliest he would inflict a sharp stroke with the toe of his boot so as to reach the most tender part of my fundament the pain was exquisite I was conscious that he experienced sexual pleasure I had seen definite signs of it beneath his clothing and though loathing him I would after I had suffered from his kicks throw myself into his imaginary embraces and indulge in a perfect rage of abject submission Yet all the time I would gladly have killed him At the age of fourteen I went for a time to a farm house where I was allowed to mingle familiarly with the farm laborers a fine set of muscular young men I became a great favorite and having childish caressing manners a good deal behind my real age I was allowed to take many liberties with them They all lived under the farmer s roof in the old fashioned way and in the evening I used to sit on their knees and caress and hug them to my heart s content They took it phlegmatically it apparently gave them no surprise One of the men used to return my squeezes and caresses and once allowed me to put my hand under his shirt but there were no further liberties It was not until I was nearly fifteen that the event happened which made me for the first time restless in my enforced solitude I was verging on puberty and perhaps in the hope that I should find my own development met by a corresponding warmth I again came into intimate relations with the companion whose frigid performances had caused me weariness and disgust He was now a man having reached majority He put me into his bed while he undressed himself and came toward me in perfect nudity In a moment we were in each other s arms and the deliciousness of that moment intoxicated me Suddenly lying on the bed I felt attacked as I thought by an imperative need to make water I leaped up with a hurried excuse but already the paroxysm had subsided No discharge came to my relief yet the need seemed to have passed I returned to my companion but the glamour of the meeting was already over My companion evidently found more pleasure in my person than when I was a mere child I felt moved and flattered by the pleasure he took in pressing his face against certain parts of my body On a second occasion one day I seemed involuntarily about to transgress decency but again as before separated myself and remained ignorant of what it was on which I had verged in my excitement At another meeting however I had been allowed to prolong my embrace and to act indeed upon my full instincts Once more I felt suddenly the coming of something acutely impending I took my courage in my hands and went boldly forward In another moment I had hold of the mysterious secret of masculine energy to which all my years of dilirious imaginings had been but as a waiting at the threshold the knocking on a closed door It was inevitable that from that day our intimacy should dwindle into dissolution though other causes anticipated this natural decay but I no longer found masturbation a dry and wearisome formula In my novitiate I was disheartened to find how long it took me to dissociate myself from the contemplative and attach myself to the active form of self gratification But I presently found myself committed to the repetition of the act three times a day On almost the last occasion I met my intimate he showed an exceptional ardor At that meeting he proposed to attempt an act I had not previously considered possible far less had I heard that it was considered the worst criminal connection that could take place I had a slight fear of pain but was willing to gratify him and for the first time found in my submission a union of the two amative instincts which had before disputed sway in me the instinct for tenderness and the instinct for cruelty Pedicatio failed to take place but I received an embrace which for the first time gave me full satisfaction My delight was enormous I was filled with emotions I have no words to describe the extraordinary charm of the warm smooth flesh upon mine and the rougher contact of the hairy parts Yet I was conscious even at the time that this was but the physical side of pleasure and that he was not and never could be one whom I might truly be said to love I was now in my sixteenth year and under the influence of these and many other emotions then for the first time beginning to seize me a sense of literary power and a desire to express myself through imaginative channels began to take hold of me I feared that my indulgence was having an enfeebling power on my faculties I had begun to experience physical languor and depression and certain religious scruples the result of my early training took hold of me For the first time I became conscious that the ardors I felt toward my own sex were a diversion of the sex instinct itself and to my astonishment and consternation I found by chance the practices I had already indulged in definitely denounced in the Bible as an abomination From that moment began a struggle which lasted for years I made a final breach with my former intimate and thereupon a long dispute took place between the conflicting influences that strove for possession of my body For a time I broke off the habit of masturbation but I could not so easily rid myself of the mental indulgence which was now almost an essential sedative for inducing sleep At this time a visit to the seaside where for the first time I was able to see men bathing in complete nudity frankly in the full light of day plunged me again for a time headforemost into imaginative amours and my scruples and resolutions were flung to the winds But on the whole I had now entered a stage which for want of a better term I must describe as the emotionally moral To whatever depth of indulgence I descended I carried a sense of obliquity with me I believed that I was a rebel from a law natural and divine of which yet no instinct had been implanted in me I still held unquestioned the truth of the religion I had been brought up in and my whole life every thought of my brain every impulse of my body were in direct antagonism to the will of God At times physical desire broke down these barriers but I practised considerable restraint physically though not mentally and made great efforts to conquer my aversion from women and extreme devotion for men without the slightest success I was thirty however before I found a companion to love me in the way my nature required I am quite a healthy person and capable of working at very high pressure Under sexual freedom I have become stronger HISTORY XXII T J aged fifty man of letters Height five feet seven inches weight ten stone but formerly much less Belongs to an entirely normal family all married and with children Owing to the fact that my mother suffered from some malady the whole period of gestation prior to my birth I came into the world so puny a child so ill nourished that for some time the doctors despaired of my life Till the age of puberty though never ill I suffered greatly from delicate health I was abnormally sensitive and all my affections and passions extraordinarily developed Owing to my brothers being much older than myself I was thrown into the society of my sister Till eight years old she was my chief playmate With her I played with dolls and abandoned myself wholly to the delights of an imaginary land which was much more real to me than the world around me I never remember learning to read but at five the Arabian Nights and Kingsley s Hereward the Wake were my favorite books Living in the country the society of other children was difficult to obtain My whole affections centered in my father my mother having died when I was a child This affection for my father was rather a morbid passion which absorbed my life I dared not leave his side for fear of a final separation from him I would wake him when asleep to see if he still lived To this day though he died twenty six years ago his memory haunts me My first abnormal desires were connected with him I had seen him occasionally micturating in the garden alleys or out in the country These occasions excited me terribly and I would if possible wait till he had gone and touch the humid leaves drawing a terrible pleasure from the contact Afterward though he never suspected it desire for him became a consuming passion and I remember on one occasion when on a holiday I occupied the same bed with him the excitement of his propinquity brought on such a formidable attack of heart palpitation that my father called in the family physician on our return home Needless to say my heart was found quite sound The desire still remains after all these years and nothing excites me more even now than the memory of my father in his morning bath The whole world for me in my early childhood was peopled with imaginary beings While still a young child I would invent stories and relate them to any listener I could find one such story lasting three years I was an omnivorous reader but my favorite reading was poetry At seven I could repeat the greater part of Longfellow s poems Scott followed then Milton captivated me when I was fourteen then came Tennyson Arnold Swinburne and Morris Later came the Greek and Latin poets From seven years on I wrote verses to my father Till eight years I was excessively timid of the dark and indeed of all loneliness This passed however and developed into an extreme sensitiveness of seeing or meeting people Even on a country road I would walk miles out of my way to avoid meeting the ordinary yokel At this period my day dreams were my favorite occupation Even to the present day my visions take up the greater part of my life Though timid I was not wanting in courage At an early age I would fight boys even older than myself Later I have risked my life many times in various parts of Europe As regards sports I can do a little of everything swimming riding fencing shooting a little of each Cricket and football I also played passably but sports never interested me much Literature became and is the passion of my life and for some years has remained my sole occupation At eight years the sexual inversion began to manifest itself though till I had attained ten years of age I was practically quite innocent At eight years of age my family removed to another country and I made the acquaintance of a little boy who attracted me sexually We masturbated in company without any reason except the pleasure of seeing each other exposed Then I had connection with him in anum This really at that time was an exception to my ordinary tastes which speedily developed into an intense desire of fellatio and later on of intercrural pleasures This latter perhaps may be accounted for by the visit to our house of a small boy with whom I slept for about a year Every night during this period I had intercrural connection with him twice and sometimes three times Then came a consuming passion for all young boys and very old men Boys after fourteen or fifteen ceased to attract me more particularly when the hair of the pubes began to develop From eight to fourteen when first I had sexual emissions I masturbated at every opportunity From fourteen to twenty seven always once a day generally twice and sometimes three times a day At twenty seven I took rooms and formed acquaintance with the family occupying the house The boys one by one were allowed to sleep with me and I conceived an extraordinary passion for one of them an attachment which lasted till I finally left England The attachment was much more that of a man for his wife and had nothing degrading in it I was wretched when away from him and as he was very attached to sport of all kinds I suffered divers kinds of death each time that I imagined his life to be endangered I can honestly say that in each of my attachments and I have had many the prevailing sentiment was the delight of protecting a weaker being than myself Each person whom I have loved has been perfectly normal and all are now fathers of families Each still regards me with affection and respect in spite of what has passed between us All my life I have been possessed with the passion for paternity I could almost say maternity Willingly would I have suffered the pains of hell could I have borne a son to the person I loved That I can honestly say has been the dominant instinct of my life In my passion I have never been brutal nor save under the influence of wine have I had connection with men over the age of puberty In Southern Europe my experiences have been the same a predominant passion for a boy exhibiting itself in every species of protecting care and though terminating so far as sexual passion was concerned when the boy reached fifteen or sixteen years yet still lasting and enduring in an honest and unselfish affection At the age of fifty one I still masturbate once or twice a week though I long for some person whom I love to share the pleasure with me I tried vainly at the age of twenty seven to bring myself into line with others Prostitutes caused me horror whether male or female I attempted the act of coitus four or five times twice with women of loose lives and at other times with married women Save in one case the attempts were either abortive or caused me extreme disgust Practically from the time of puberty I have attracted sexually not only women but men Women oddly enough though I care nothing for them sexually either hate me or adore me and I have had five offers of marriage At the same time up till five years ago I was pursued by men and have had the oddest experiences both in England and abroad In the early period of this history I suffered tremendously from the feeling that I was isolated and unique in the world I strove against the habit of masturbation and my perverted tastes with all my might Scourges vigils burnings all were of no avail Deeper reading in the Classics showed me how common was the taste of sex for the same sex At twenty seven I began to have a settled philosophy Then as now I made endless resolutions to avoid masturbation though I can see nothing wrong in the mutual act of two persons drawn together by love I am and always have been an extremely religious man and if I am not altogether an orthodox Catholic do my duties and have a high sense of the supernatural I suffered much from melancholy from my earliest years At eighteen though nothing definitely was wrong a vague but profound malaise induced me to open the veins of my arm I fainted however and was promptly succored At the age of thirty five after a return from abroad I took an enormous dose of poison This time again a singular coincidence saved me and I once more came back to life After this I purposely went abroad to obtain death and sought it in every possible way Quite in vain as you see One thing I have never had a fear of but have always longed for Death I am sure that if we only knew what joys lay on the other side of death the whole world would rush madly to suicide I have apart from any perversion of taste an honest and genuine passion for children and animals and I am never happier than when in their society Both adore me My life has not dimmed nor deadened my faculties for I am occupied at the present time with very important work and I write steadily But my real life is passed in my visions which take me into another world quite as real as this sensuous one and where I always retreat on all occasions possible And yet a strange paradox I am a convinced Stoic and almost confine my reading to Epictetus Marcus Aurelius and the Imitation I am extremely emotional fond of the society of women though I loathe the sexual side of them and when I love though passion is certainly inextricably mixed the prevailing sentiment is spiritual I shall probably end by being a Carthusian or a fakir HISTORY XXIII Englishman aged seventy of German descent on father s side Was first child of his mother who was thirty six at his birth a younger brother normal has no other relatives He was brought up in England and went to school at the age of thirteen At a very early age between six and eight was deeply impressed by the handsome face of a young man a royal trumpeter on horseback seen in a procession This and the sight of the naked body of young men in a rowing match on the river caused great commotion but not of a definitely sexual character This was increased by the sight of a beautiful male model of a young Turk smoking with his dress open in front showing much of the breast and below the waist He became familiar with pictures admired the male figures of Italian martyrs and the full rich forms of the Antinous and he read with avidity the Arabian Nights and other Oriental tales translations from the classics Suetonius Petronius et cetera He drew naked models in life schools and delighted in male ballet dancers As a child he used to perform in private theatricals he excelled in female parts and sang the songs of Madame Vestris encouraged in this by his father The sexual organs have never been fully developed and the testicles though large are of a flabby consistence He cannot whistle He thinks he ought to have been a woman At school he was shy and reserved and had no particular intimacy with anyone although he once desired it He learned self abuse from his younger brother who had learned it from an older boy He has never had erotic dreams He never touched anyone but his brother until later when travelling in Italy and then only his fellow traveller When travelling in Asia Minor he had many opportunities but always put them aside from fear afterward regretting his fearfulness He yearned for intimacy with particular friends but never dared to express it He went much to theaters and what he saw there incited him to masturbation When he was about thirty years of age his reserve and his fear of treachery and extortion were at last overcome by an incident which occurred late at night at the Royal Exchange and again in a dark recess in the gallery of the Olympic Theater when Gustavus Brooke was performing From that time the Adelphi Theater the Italian Opera and the open parks at night became his fields of adventure He remarks that among people crowding to witness a fire he found many opportunities His especial intimates were a railway clerk and an Italian model In more recent years he has chiefly found gratification among footmen and policemen He is exclusively passive also likes mutual fellatio He used greatly to admire finely developed forms conscious of his own shortcomings shapely limbs and delicate brown hair and always admired strength and manly vigor He never took any interest in boys and has always been indifferent to women HISTORY XXIV A medical man English aged thirty He believes that his father who was a magistrate was very sympathetic toward men on several occasions he has sat with him on the bench when cases of indecent assault were brought up he discharged three cases although there could be little doubt as to their guilt and was very lenient to the others From the age of nine he loved to sleep with his brother ten years older who was in the navy they slept in different beds and the child went to bed early but he always kept awake to see his brother undress as he adored his naked body and would then get into his bed He learned the habit of masturbation from his brother at the age of nine at that time there was no sexual orgasm but watching it in his brother was a perpetual source of wonder and pleasure During his brother s absence at sea the boy longed for his return and would practice self abuse with the thought of his brother s naked body before him This brother s death was a source of great grief At the age of twelve he went to boarding school and was constantly falling in love with good looking boys He was always taken into one of the bigger boys beds At this age he was thoroughly able to enjoy the sexual orgasm with boys His erotic dreams have always been of men and especially of boys he has never dreamed sexually of women From the age of nine to the age of twenty one when he left school he never gave women a thought sexually though he always liked their society For two years after leaving school he had connection with women not because he thought there was sin in loving his own sex but because he regarded it as a thing that no one did after leaving school During these two years he still really preferred men and used to admire the figures of soldiers and sailors He then paid a visit to London which may be described in his own words I went to see an old schoolfellow who was living there In his room was a young fellow fair extremely good looking with a good figure and charming manners From that moment all my past recollections came back I could not get him out of my mind in fact I was in love with him I pictured him naked before me as a lovely statue my dreams were frequent at night always of him For a fortnight afterward I practised masturbation with the picture of his lovely face and form always before me We became fast friends and from that day women have never entered my thoughts Although up to the present he has no wish or intention to marry he believes that he will eventually do so because it is thought desirable in his profession but he is quite sure that his love and affection for men and boys will never lessen In earlier life he preferred men from twenty to thirty five now he likes boys from sixteen upward grooms for instance who must be good looking well developed cleanly and of a lovable unchanging nature but he would prefer gentlemen He does not care for mere mutual embracing and reciprocal masturbation when he really loves a man he desires pedicatio in which he is himself the passive subject He has curly hair and moustache and well developed sexual organs His habits are masculine he has always enjoyed field sports and can swim ride drive and skate At the same time he is devoted to music can draw and paint and is an ardent admirer of male statuary While fond of practical occupations of every sort he dislikes anything that is theoretical He adds As a medical man I fail to see morally any unhealthiness or anything that nature should be ashamed of in connection with and sympathy for men HISTORY XXV A S Schoolmaster aged forty six My father was I should say below the average in capacity for friendship He liked young girls and was never interested in boys He was a man of strongly Puritanical morality capable of condemning with gloomy bitterness He was also a man capable of great sacrifice for principle and mentally very well endowed My mother was a clever practical woman with wide sympathies She was capable of warm friendship especially toward those younger than herself Her father whom I never saw was a teacher He was devoted to his wife but also delighted in the company of young men He had always some young man on his arm my mother would tell me My mother s family is of Welsh descent I learned to read at five and I can scarcely have been more than six when I used to read again and again David s lament for Absalom Even now I can dimly recall the siren charm for me of that melancholy refrain O my son Absalom O Absalom my son my son Of late when I have thought of the amount of devotion I have shown to lads and the amount I have sometimes suffered for them I have felt as if there were something almost weirdly prophetic in that early incident I was always an impressionable creature My mother was very musical and her singing got hold of me wonderfully The dramatic and the poetic always strongly appealed to me I felt I should like to act but I never dared In the same way I felt that one day I should like to be a schoolmaster but I dared not say so A shy retiring creature was obviously unfitted for such occupations Well the teaching came about and the strange part was that the boys were somehow or other attracted by me and the worst customers were attracted most And there came a chance of acting too Owing to some difficulties about the cast in a play at school I took a part After that I knew that within a certain range I could act I spent two holidays with a dramatic company I should undoubtedly have remained on the stage but for one thing I don t wish to be sanctimonious but dirty and ugly jokes are odious to me It was this sort of thing that drove me away I threw myself into the school work instead It was partly the dramatic interest partly a quite genuine interest in human nature that led me to do some preaching too When I had been badly hurt by one or two youngsters whom I loved I thought of going in for pastoral work but this too was given up and very wisely I should never be able to work comfortably with any organization For one thing I have a way of taking on new ideas and organizations do not like that For another all social functions are anathema to me Interest in art as usually understood began to be marked only after I was thirty It started with architecture and passed on to painting and sculpture The tendency to do rather a variety too great a variety of things characterizes many uranians We are rather like the labile chemical compounds our molecules readily rearrange themselves As a boy of ten I had the ordinary sweethearting with a girl of the same age The incident is worth perhaps a little further comment for the following reason When I was sixteen years old the girl lived with us for a year She was a nice pleasant bright girl and she thought a great deal of me I was strongly attracted by her I remember especially one little incident I had been showing her how to do some algebra and she was kneeling at the table by the side of my chair Her hair was flowing over her shoulders and she looked rather charming She expressed warm admiration of the way I had worked the problem out I remember that I deliberately squashed out the feeling of attraction that came over me I scarcely know why I did this but I fancy there was a vague sense that I did not want my work disturbed There was no sexual attraction or at least none that was manifest The girl there is no doubt grew to love me I am sorry to say that in two other cases later women loved me and have both permanently remained unmarried on my account I sometimes feel that in a wisely free society I should be able to give both of these women children That I believe I could do and I think it would be an immense satisfaction to them A permanent union with a woman would however be impossible to me A permanent union with a man would I believe be possible At least I know that attractions which have been at all homosexual in character have in my case been very lasting I was strongly attracted when not more than thirteen to a lad slightly older It was a love story there is no doubt but I do not recollect any outer sexual signs There were other passing cases but in no case was there any warm response till I was fifteen I then made friends with a lad of entirely different type from myself I was a reader I liked long walks and fresh air but I was too shy to go in for sports Indeed I was frightfully shy He was a great sportsman and always at home in society But he asked me to help him with some work and we took to working together I grew passionately fond of him His caresses always caused some erection Personally I believe it would have been wiser to have obtained complete sexual expression The absence of knowledge led to two distinctly undesirable results The first was marked congestion and pain at times the second was a tendency to a sort of modified masochism There is always I suppose some erotic attraction about the buttocks and of course also to boys they afford an irresistibly attractive mark for a good smack I found that when this lad spanked me it produced some amount of sexual excitement and the desire for this form of stimulus grew upon me The result in my case was bad It was sensualism not love I can say this with confidence because in a much later case of deeply passionate love I shrank from any such method but the mutual naked embrace I found was for me an absolutely natural and pure expression of love I never felt any touch of grossness in it and it destroyed the earlier and for me at least less wholesome desire The school friendship disappeared with the marriage of my friend I was furiously jealous and the young man s mother was opposed to me but I still think of that early friendship with tenderness I know that my boy friend was the first who made me capable of self expression the first who taught me how to make friends at all And if he still cared for me I know that his love would be dear to me still My chief regret as I look back is that I did not know about these things early I cannot but think that all youngsters should be spoken to about the love of comrades and encouraged to seek help in any sort of trouble that this may bring We homogenic folk may be but a small percentage of mankind but our numbers are still great and surely the making or marring of our lives should count for something At college I fell violently in love with a friend with whom I did work in science He loved me too though not with such heat He also was largely uranian but this I only realized a year or two back He remains unmarried and is still my friend We did some research work together which is pretty well known I am quite sure that the love we had for each other gave tremendous zest to our work and greatly increased our powers While I was working at college I was interested in a lad who was working as errand boy for a city firm I helped him to get better training and spent money on him My father was making me some allowance at the time and demurred I said I would in future support myself and in this way came to take up schoolmastering I at once became quite absorbed in my work with the boys Of course I loved them And here I feel I must touch upon what seems to me a characteristic of most of us uranians Our genital organs are with us ordinarily and usually organs of expression The clean minded heterogenic man is apt to look upon such a view of the genital organs as monstrous we on the other hand are compelled at least for ourselves to regard it as the natural and pure one For my own part I had many Puritan prejudices prejudices that I retained for many a long and weary day but my affection for those of my own sex so often expressed itself by some sexual stirring and more or less erection that I was obliged to look upon this as inevitable and in general I paid no attention to it whatever It was the older boys who sometimes attracted me strongly My love for them was I know a genuinely spiritual thing though inevitably having some physical expression I was capable of great devotion to them and sacrifice for them and I would certainly rather have died than have injured them The boys got on well with me I was never weak with them and I was able to allow all kinds of familiarities without any loss of respect The older boys usually out of class called me by my Christian name and I remember one writing to ask me whether he might do so as it made him feel nearer to me A few of the lads I of course loved with special devotion They kissed me and loved to have me embrace them One of these was I now know pure uranian and there was in his case certainly some sexual response but though I often slept with him when he was a lad of seventeen and eighteen there was never any idea in our minds of any sexual act We are still warm friends and always kiss when we meet Looking back upon those days I feel that I was a little inclined to pass on from one love to another but each was a genuine devotion and involved real hard work on the lad s behalf And I know that where the lad stuck to me into manhood a real tenderness and love remain still While teaching I made the acquaintance of a non conformist minister who though happily married had certainly some homogenic tendencies He was most devoted to boys and helped me with regard to some difficult cases It was the difficult cases that always attracted me I had to punish these lads and my friend recommended spanking with the hand on the bare buttocks I mention that I adopted this method because it might have been thought specially dangerous to me It certainly never produced in me the remotest suggestion of any sexual act though it did sometimes produce a slight amount of sexual excitement I disregarded this or put it out of my mind as I found the method most efficacious It was capable of great variation of intensity and the boys were always ready to joke about it I never came across a case where any sexual excitement was produced by it The boys whom I had to be most down on almost always however grew fonder of me There may be a slight and normal masochistic tendency in most boys and perhaps the erogenic character of the buttocks has something to do with the development of affection If so I am inclined to regard it as normal and useful rather than otherwise for in my experience no undesirable result was ever produced But then of course there was no playing with the business that might I am sure in some cases be decidedly injurious One experience of my schoolmastering days is I think important in its bearing upon general sexual psychology I always noticed that during the term I was specially free from wet dreams What is noteworthy is this During term there was never anything more than a very partial sexual expression of any feeling of mine such expression indeed as was wholly inevitable There was therefore no actual loss of semen and it seems clear that the wet dreams were not due to mere physical pressure The psychic satisfaction of love in this case made the complete physical expression less urgent But it was a love of a distinctly tender kind that was needed to keep the physical from obtruding Of that further experience has made me sure I am moreover now convinced that a mutual uranian love will reach its best results both spiritual and physical where there is complete sexual expression Of the character of the sexual dreams I have had there is not much to be said During the period of masochistic tendency they were masochistic in character otherwise they have been dreams simply of the naked embrace Usually there has been a considerable element of ideal love in the dream I have not more than three times at most dreamed of intercourse with one of the opposite sex There was only in one case anything that I could call actual emotion in such a dream The other dreams have often not always been dreams of real yearning and not at all what I should call merely sensual In the course of time I wanted more freedom to do things in my own way than could be obtained in a public school I started a school of my own The work was for a good many years very happy I loved the boys and they loved me I was active ardent and they made a chum of me But people got into the way of sending me awkward customers I poured out my love on these I used myself up for them Unfortunately though I was never orthodox my Puritanical morality was still strong within me my views of human psychology were too limited and I imposed them on the boys Some were very devoted but as years went by and the proportion of mauvais sujets increased there tended to be a split in the small camp and one or two boys whom I loved deceived me terribly To a man of my temperament this was heart rending and from then the work was doomed Troubles at school went along with troubles at home and these things contributed to center my affection upon a lad who was with me and who had given me much trouble For some reason or other I went on believing that he would get right Deceit was his great difficulty He was certainly partly homosexual himself Looking back I can see that with a wider and more charitable knowledge I could have dealt more wisely and helpfully with certain homosexual episodes of his I am convinced now that mere sweeping condemnation of the physical is not the wholesome way of help However to cut the story short all seemed at last to go well and the lad was growing into a young man Our love deepened and we always slept together but quite ascetically Later when quite in his young manhood he had left school there was unfortunately misunderstandings with his parents who forbad him to sleep with me What followed is of some importance Up till then though certainly his affection seemed ardent I had observed no sexual signs on his part I had been quite frank with him as to mine He was then nineteen and I thought old enough to have things explained to him Sleeping with him I had found peaceful and helpful and more than once he told me that it greatly helped him But after we were forbidden to sleep together I found the passion in me more difficult to control and it suddenly leaped out in him We were still however rather ascetic though we used to kiss each other and we used to embrace naked This produced emission not infrequently with me but only once with him though always powerful erection I would not allow any friction Perhaps this was a mistake A more complete expression might have helped him All my life I had been hungry for a complete response and at one time the lad thought he could give it He was then nearing twenty I have never been so happy in my life he said It was a blow to me when I found he had mistaken his own feelings but I was quite ready to accept what love he could give I also never dreamed of any sort of insistence on sexual expression With such love as he could give I was quite ready to make myself content The true measure of love wrote a uranian schoolmaster to me once is self sacrifice not What will you give but What will you give up Not What will you do for him but What will you forego for his sake I quote this gladly for the conventional English moralists regard an invert as a kind of deformed beast I can only say that I tried to realize the ideal which these words express No moralist would have helped me one whit The parents also separated us They have done much harm by their mistake How difficult it is for parents to allow freedom to their children Their ideal is successful constraint not free self discovery But in spite of them and in spite of the separation I know that my friend and I have helped each other There is one fear parents have which I believe is unwarranted As far as I have seen I do not conclude that the early expression of homosexual love prevents heterosexual love from developing later Where this love is a part of the individual s inborn nature it will show itself I do however believe that a noble homogenic love in early life will sometimes help a lad to avoid a low standard of heterogenic attachment The Greeks did well at their best time in cultivating and ennobling the homogenic love Amongst us as can be understood by all who know the working of society taboos it is the baser forms that are unhindered the noblest forms that are debased We urnings are I think dependent upon individual love Many of us I know need to work for an individual to do our best Is this the outcome of the woman in the uranian temperament And the tragedy of our fate is that we whose souls vibrate only to the touch of the hand of Eros are faced with the fiercest taboo of all that can give our lives meaning The other taboos have been given up one by one Will not this the last of the taboos soon vanish I have known lives darkened by it weakened by it crushed out by it How long are the western moralists to maim and brand and persecute where they do not understand The next case belongs to a totally different class from all the preceding histories These all British or American were obtained privately they are not the inmates of prisons or of asylums and in most cases they have never consulted a physician concerning their abnormal instincts They pass through life as ordinary sometimes as honored members of society The following case which happens to be that of an American is acquainted with both the prison and the lunatic asylum There are several points of interest in his history and he illustrates the way in which sexual inversion can become a matter of medico legal importance I think however that I am justified in believing that the proportion of sexually inverted persons who reach the police court or the lunatic asylum is not much larger in proportion to the number of sexually inverted persons among us than it is among my cases For the documents on which I have founded the history of Guy Olmstead I am indebted to the kindness of doctor Talbot of Chicago well known from his studies of abnormalities of the jaws and face so often associated with nervous and mental abnormality He knew the man who addressed to him the letters from which I here quote HISTORY XXVI On the twenty eighth of March eighteen ninety four at noon in the open street in Chicago Guy T Olmstead fired a revolver at a letter carrier named William L Clifford He came up from behind and deliberately fired four shots the first entering Clifford s loins the other three penetrating the back of his head so that the man fell and was supposed to be fatally wounded Olmstead made little attempt to escape as a crowd rushed up with the usual cry of Lynch him but waved his revolver exclaiming I ll never be taken alive and when a police officer disarmed him Don t take my gun let me finish what I have to do This was evidently an allusion as will be seen later on to an intention to destroy himself He eagerly entered the prison van however to escape the threatening mob Olmstead who was thirty years of age was born near Danville Ill in which city he lived for many years Both parents were born in Illinois His father some twenty years ago shot and nearly killed a wealthy coal operator induced to commit the crime it is said by a secret organization of a hundred prominent citizens to whom the victim had made himself obnoxious by bringing suits against them for trivial causes The victim became insane but the criminal was never punished and died a few years later at the age of forty four This man had another son who was considered peculiar Guy Olmstead began to show signs of sexual perversity at the age of twelve He was seduced we are led to believe by a man who occupied the same bedroom Olmstead s early history is not clear from the data to hand It appears that he began his career as a schoolteacher in Connecticut and that he there married the daughter of a prosperous farmer but shortly after he fell in love with her male cousin whom he describes as a very handsome young man This led to a separation from his wife and he went West He was never considered perfectly sane and from October eighteen eighty six to May eighteen eighty nine he was in the Kankakee Insane Asylum His illness was reported as of three years duration and caused by general ill health heredity doubtful habits good occupation that of a schoolteacher His condition was diagnosed as paranoia On admission he was irritable alternately excited and depressed He returned home in good condition At this period and again when examined later Olmstead s physical condition is described as on the whole normal and fairly good Height five feet eight inches weight one hundred fifty nine pounds Special senses normal genitals abnormally small with rudimentary penis His head is asymmetrical and is full at the occiput slightly sunken at the bregma and the forehead is low His cephalic index is seventy eight The hair is sandy and normal in amount over head face and body His eyes are gray small and deeply set the zygomae are normal The nose is large and very thin There is arrested development of upper jaw The ears are excessively developed and malformed The face is very much lined the nasolabial fissure is deeply cut and there are well marked horizontal wrinkles on the forehead so that he looks at least ten years older than his actual age The upper jaw is of partial V shape the lower well developed The teeth and their tubercles and the alveolar process are normal The breasts are full The body is generally well developed the hands and feet are large Olmstead s history is defective for some years after he left Kankakee In October eighteen ninety two we hear of him as a letter carrier in Chicago During the following summer he developed a passion for William Clifford a fellow letter carrier about his own age also previously a schoolteacher and regarded as one of the most reliable and efficient men in the service For a time Clifford seems to have shared this passion or to have submitted to it but he quickly ended the relationship and urged his friend to undergo medical treatment offering to pay the expenses himself Olmstead continued to write letters of the most passionate description to Clifford and followed him about constantly until the latter s life was made miserable In December eighteen ninety three Clifford placed the letters in the postmaster s hands and Olmstead was requested to resign at once Olmstead complained to the Civil Service Commission at Washington that he had been dismissed without cause and also applied for reinstatement but without success In the meanwhile apparently on the advice of friends he went into hospital and in the middle of February eighteen ninety four his testicles were removed No report from the hospital is to hand The effect of removing the testicles was far from beneficial and he began to suffer from hysterical melancholia A little later he went into hospital again On March nineteenth he wrote to doctor Talbot from the Mercy Hospital Chicago I returned to Chicago last Wednesday night but felt so miserable I concluded to enter a hospital again and so came to Mercy which is very good as hospitals go But I might as well go to Hades as far as any hope of my getting well is concerned I am utterly incorrigible utterly incurable and utterly impossible At home I thought for a time that I was cured but I was mistaken and after seeing Clifford last Thursday I have grown worse than ever so far as my passion for him is concerned Heaven only knows how hard I have tried to make a decent creature out of myself but my vileness is uncontrollable and I might as well give up and die I wonder if the doctors knew that after emasculation it was possible for a man to have erections commit masturbation and have the same passion as before I am ashamed of myself I hate myself but I can t help it I have friends among nice people play the piano love music books and everything that is beautiful and elevating yet they can t elevate me because this load of inborn vileness drags me down and prevents my perfect enjoyment of anything Doctors are the only ones who understand and know my helplessness before this monster I think and work till my brain whirls and I can scarce refrain from crying out my troubles This letter was written a few days before the crime was committed When conveyed to the police station Olmstead completely broke down and wept bitterly crying Oh Will Will come to me Why don t you kill me and let me go to him At this time he supposed he had killed Clifford A letter was found on him as follows Mercy March twenty seventh To Him Who Cares to Read Fearing that my motives in killing Clifford and myself may be misunderstood I write this to explain the cause of this homicide and suicide Last summer Clifford and I began a friendship which developed into love He then recited the details of the friendship and continued After playing a Liszt rhapsody for Clifford over and over he said that when our time to die came he hoped we would die together listening to such glorious music as that Our time has now come to die but death will not be accompanied by music Clifford s love has alas turned to deadly hatred For some reason Clifford suddenly ended our relations and friendship In his cell he behaved in a wildly excited manner and made several attempts at suicide so that he had to be closely watched A few weeks later he wrote to doctor Talbot Cook County Gaol April twenty three I feel as though I had neglected you in not writing you in all this time though you may not care to hear from me as I have never done anything but trespass on your kindness But please do me the justice of thinking that I never expected all this trouble as I thought Will and I would be in our graves and at peace long before this But my plans failed miserably Poor Will was not dead and I was grabbed before I could shoot myself I think Will really shot himself and I feel certain others will think so too when the whole story comes out in court I can t understand the surprise and indignation my act seemed to engender as it was perfectly right and natural that Will and I should die together and nobody else s business Do you know I believe that poor boy will yet kill himself for last November when I in my grief and anger told his relations about our marriage he was so frightened hurt and angry that he wanted us both to kill ourselves I acquiesced gladly in this proposal to commit suicide but he backed out in a day or two I am glad now that Will is alive and am glad that I am alive even with the prospect of years of imprisonment before me but which I will cheerfully endure for his sake And yet for the last ten months his influence has so completely controlled me both body and soul that if I have done right he should have the credit for my good deeds and if I have done wrong he should be blamed for the mischief as I have not been myself at all but a part of him and happy to merge my individuality into his Olmstead was tried privately in July No new points were brought out He was sentenced to the Criminal Insane Asylum Shortly afterward while still in the prison at Chicago he wrote to doctor Talbot As you have been interested in my case from a scientific point of view there is a little something more I might tell you about myself but which I have withheld because I was ashamed to admit certain facts and features of my deplorable weakness Among the few sexual perverts I have known I have noticed that all are in the habit of often closing the mouth with the lower lip protruding beyond the upper Usually due to arrested development of upper jaw I noticed the peculiarity in mister Clifford before we became intimate and I have often caught myself at the trick Before that operation my testicles would swell and become sore and hurt me and have seemed to do so since just as a man will sometimes complain that his amputated leg hurts him Then too my breasts would swell and about the nipples would become hard and sore and red Since the operation there has never been a day that I have been free from sharp shooting pains down the abdomen to the scrotum being worse at the base of the penis Now that my fate is decided I will say that really my passion for mister Clifford is on the wane but I don t know whether the improvement is permanent or not I have absolutely no passion for other men and have begun to hope now that I can yet outlive my desire for Clifford or at least control it I have not yet told of this improvement in my condition because I wished people to still think I was insane so that I would be sure to escape being sent to the penitentiary I know I was insane at the time I tried to kill both Clifford and myself and feel that I don t deserve such a dreadful punishment as being sent to a State prison However I think it was that operation and my subsequent illness that caused my insanity rather than passion for Clifford I should very much like to know if you really consider sexual perversion an insanity When discharged from the Criminal Insane Asylum Olmstead returned to Chicago and demanded his testicles from the City Postmaster whom he accused of being in a systematized conspiracy against him He asserted that the postmaster was one of the chief agents in a plot against him dating from before the castration He was then sent to the Cook Insane Hospital It seems probable that a condition of paranoia is now firmly established The following cases are all bisexual attraction being felt toward both sexes usually in predominant degree toward the male HISTORY XXVII H C American aged twenty eight of independent means unmarried the elder of two children His history may best be given in his own words I am on both sides distantly of English ancestry the first colonists of my name having come to New England in sixteen thirty Both my mother s and my father s families have been prolific in soldiers and statesmen my mother s contributed one president to the United States So far as I am aware none of my antecedents have betrayed mental vagaries except a maternal uncle who from overstudy became for a year insane I am a graduate of two universities with degrees in arts and medicine After a year as physician in a hospital I relinquished medicine altogether to follow literature a predilection since early boyhood I awoke to sexual feeling at the age of seven when at a small private school glimpsing bare thighs above the stockings of girl schoolmates I dimly exulted This fetishism as it grew more definite centered at last upon the thighs and then the whole person of one girl in particular My first sexually tinged dream was of her that while she stood near I impinged my penis upon a red hot anvil and then in beatific self immolation exhibited the charred stump to her wondering round eyes This love however abated at the coming of a new girl to the school who not more beautiful but more buxom made stronger appeal to my nascent sexuality One afternoon in the loft of her father s stable she induced me to disrobe herself setting the example The erection our mutual handlings produced on me was without conscious impulse I felt only a childish curiosity on beholding our genital difference But the episode started extravagant whimsies one of which persistently obsessed me with these obviously compensatory differences why might not the girl and I effect some sort of copulation This fantasy drawn exclusively from that unique experience charmed with its grotesqueness only for at that time my sense of sex was but inchoate and my knowledge of it was nothing The bizarre conceit submitted to the equally ignorant girl and approved was borne to the paternal hay loft and there with much bungling brought to surprising and pleasurable consummation In the four ensuing years I repeated the act not seldom with this girl and with others When I was eleven my sister and I were taken by our parents to Europe where we remained six years attending school each winter in a different city and during the summer travelling in various countries Abroad my lust was glutted to the full the amenable girl playmate was ubiquitous whom I plied with ardor at Swiss hotels German watering places French pensions where not Toward puberty I first repaired at times to prostitutes Masturbation excepting a few experiments I never resorted to Few of my schoolmates avowedly practised it Of homosexuality my sole hearing was through the classics where with no long pondering I opined it merely our modern comradery poetically aggrandized masquerading in antique habiliments and phraseology It never came home to me it attuned to no tone in the scale of my sympathies I possessed no touchstone for transmitting the recitals of those ambiguous amours into fiery messages The relation to my own sex was intellectually an occasional friendship devoid of strong affection physically a mild antagonism the naked body of a man was slightly repellant Statues of women evoked both carnal and esthetic response of men no emotions whatever save a deepening of that native antipathy Similarly in paintings in literature the drama the men served but as foils for the delicious maidens who visited my aerial seraglios and lapped me in roseate dreamings In my eighteenth year we returned to America where I entered the university The course of my love of women was now a little erratic normal connection began to lose fascination As long ago I had formulated untutored the rationale of coitus so now imagination groping in the dark conceived a fresh fillip for the appetite cunnilinctus But this though for a while quite adequate soon ceased to gratify At this juncture Christmas of my first college year I was appointed editor of a small magazine an early stricture of whose new conduct was paucity of love stories Such improvident neglect was in keeping with my altering view of women a view accorded to me by self dissipation of the glamour through which they had been wont to appear I had wandered somehow behind the scenes and beheld no footlights of sex intervening the once so radiant fairies resolved into a raddled humanity as likable as ever but desirable no longer Soon after this the Oscar Wilde case was bruiting about The newspaper accounts of it while illuminating flashed upon me no light of self revelation they only amended some idle conjectures as to certain mystic vices I had heard whispered of Here and there a newspaper allusion still too recondite was painstakingly clarified by an effeminate fellow student who I fancy now would have shown no reluctance had I begged him to adduce practical illustration I purchased too photographs of Oscar Wilde scrutinizing them under the unctuous auspices of this same emasculate and blandiloquent mentor If my interest in Oscar Wilde arose from any other emotion than the rather morbid curiosity then almost universal I was not conscious of it Erotic dreams precluded hitherto by coition came now to beset me The persons of these dreams were and still are invariably women with this one remembered exception I dreamed that Oscar Wilde one of my photographs of him incarnate approached me with a buffoon languishment and perpetrated fellatio an act verbally expounded shortly before by my oracle For a month or more recalling this dream disgusted me The few subsequent endeavors tentative and half hearted to repristinate my venery were foredoomed partly because I had feared they were to failure erection was incomplete ejaculation without pleasure There seemed a fallacy in this behavior Why coitus without sensual desire for it No sense of duty impelled me nor dread of sexual aberration The explanation is this attraction to females was not expunged simply sublimed my imagination no longer importing women from observation created its own delectable sirens grown exacting and transcendental petitioned reality in vain Substance had receded for good now and soon even these tormenting shadows of it became ever dimmer and dimmer until they too at length faded into nothingness The antipodes of the sexual sphere turned more and more toward the light of my tolerance Inversion till now stained with a slight repugnance became esthetically colorless at last and then delicately retinted at first solely with pity for its victims but finally the color deepening with half conscious inclination to attach it to myself as a remote contingency This revolution however was not without external impetus The prejudiced tone of a book I was reading Krafft Ebing s Psychopathia Sexualis by prompting resentment led me on to sympathy My championing purely abstract though it was to begin with none the less involved my looking at things with eyes hypothetically inverted an orientation for the sake of argument After a while insensibly and at no one moment hypothesis merged into reality I myself was inverted That occasional and fictitious inversion had never I believe superposed this true inversion rather a true inversion those many years dormant had simply responded finally to a stimulus strong and prolonged enough as a man awakens when he is loudly called In presenting myself thus sexually transformed I do not aver having had at the outset any definitive inclination The instinct so freshly evolved remained for a while obscure Its primary expression was a feebly sensuous interest in the physical character of boys in their feminine resemblances especially To this interest I opposed no discountenance for wantonness with women under many and diverse conditions having long ago medicined my sexual conscience to lethargy no access of reasons came to me now for its refreshment On the other hand intellectual delight in the promises of the new world as well as sensuality conduced to its deliberate exploration Still for a year the yearning settled with true lust upon no object more concrete than youths whose only habitation was my fancy A young surgeon having read my copy of Psychopathia Sexualis fell one evening to discussing inverts with such relish that I inquired ingenuously if he himself was one He colored whether confirmatively or otherwise I could not guess in spite of his vehement no Presently he very subtly recanted his denial But to his counter question I maintained my own no lest he propose some sexual act a point the esthetics of my developing inversion would not yet concede the boys of my imagination being still predominant One evening soon after this he convoyed me to several of the cafe s where inverts are accustomed to foregather These trysting places were much alike a long hall with sparse orchestra at one end marble topped tables lining the walls leaving the floor free for dancing Round the tables sat boys and youths Adonises both by art and nature ready for a drink or a chat with the chance Samaritan and shyly importunate for the pleasures for which upstairs were small rooms to let One of the boys supported by the orchestra sang the Jewel Song out of Faust His voice had the limpid treble purity of a clarinet and his face the beauty of an angel The song concluded we invited him to our table where he sat sipping neat brandy as he mockingly encountered my book begotten queries The boy prostitutes gracing these halls he apprised us bore fanciful names some of well known actresses others of heroes in fiction his own being Dorian Gray Rivals he complained had assumed the same appellation but he was the original Dorian the others were jealous impostors His curly hair was golden his cheeks were pink his lips coral red parted incessantly to reveal the glistening pearliness of his teeth Yet though deeming him the beautifulest youth in the world I experienced no sexual interest either in him or in the other boys who indeed were all beautiful beauty was their chief asset Dorian further dilated on the splendor of his female attire satin corsets low cut evening gowns et cetera donned on gala nights to display his gleaming shoulders and dimpled plump white arms Thus arrayed he bantered he would bewitch even me now so impassive until I should throw myself in tears of happiness into his loving embrace My first venture upon fellatio was a month later with the young surgeon I confessed the whim to try it and he acceded Though this nauseous and fatiguing act very imperfectly performed was prompted mostly by curiosity there arose soon a passional hankering for repetition In short appetence for fellatio grew slowly from the night of that mawkish fiasco and waxed eventually into a sovereign want Perhaps miscarriage of that initiatory experiment was due to precipitance incubation of my perverse instinct being not yet complete A hiatus of a month now supervened in which while further fellatio was not attempted my mind came always nearer to a reconcilement with the grossness of the act and began to discover for its creatures some correlation in pretty boys beheld in the flesh One evening in Broadway I conceived suddenly a full fledged desire for a youth issuing from an hotel as I passed Our glances met and dwelled together At a shop window he first accosted me He was an invert With him in his room at the hotel whence I had seen him emerge I passed an apocalyptic night Thereafter commerce with boys only in the spirit ceased to be an end the images were carnalized stepped from their framework into the streets That boy that god out of the machine I see him clearly his brown curling hair his eyes blue as the sea his chest both arched and so plump his rounded arms his taper waist the graceful swell of his hips and full snowy thighs I recall as of yesterday the dimples in his knees the slenderness of his ankles the softness of his little feet with insteps pink like the inside of a shell How I gloated over his ample roundness his rich undulations In the last eight years I have performed fellatio never pedicatio with more than three hundred men and boys My preference is for boys between fifteen and twenty refined pretty girlish and themselves homosexual Personally barring this love for males I am in all ways masculine given to outdoor sports and to smoking and drinking moderately In appearance I am but a boy of eighteen My face and figure are generally considered beautiful I am clean shaved with black curling hair red cheeks and brown eyes features delicate and regular body of medium height everywhere practically hairless By years of training I have attained alike great strength and classic proportions the muscular contours smoothly rounded with adipose tissue My hands and feet are small My penis though perfectly shaped is rather enormous erect ten and a half inches in length seven and a quarter inches in circumference Some abetment of my apostasy from orthodox methods was no doubt this hypertrophy of the penis which already in my twentieth year had acquired its present redundance rendering coitus impracticable with most women I essayed and painful where insertion was effected Since falling heir to inversion a unique recurrence of normal desire six years ago persuaded me to attempt coitus with eleven or twelve prostitutes and strangely enough with much of the old time salacity and full erection but as it chanced always with too great disparity of parts for success A certain preciosity in the manner of this communication may be put down partly to the nature of the literary avocations with which the writer is by preference occupied and partly no doubt more fundamentally to the special character of his predominantly esthetic temperament and attraction to the exotic An attraction for exotic experiences will not however suffice to account for the rather late development of homosexual tendencies a late development which may be held to place this case in the retarded group of inverts H C has himself pointed out to me that his aversion to women beginning to appear in the eighteenth year was already well pronounced before he had ever heard definitely of specific homosexual acts and fully a year before he experienced the slightest sexual interest in men or boys Moreover while it is true that the actual tendency to homosexual attraction only appeared after he had read Krafft Ebing and come in contact with inverts such influences would not suffice to change the sexual nature of a normally constituted man It may be added that H C is not attracted to normal males As regards his moral attitude he remarks I have no scruples in the indulgence of my passion I perceive the moral objections advanced but how speculative they are and constructive while immediately inversion is the source of so much good He looks upon the whole sexual question as largely a matter of taste I regard the foregoing case as of considerable interest It presents what is commonly supposed to be a very common type of inversion Oscar Wilde being the supreme exemplar in which a heterosexual person apparently becomes homosexual by the exercise of intellectual curiosity and esthetic interest In reality the type is far from common indeed an intellectual curiosity and an esthetic interest strong enough even apparently to direct the sexual impulse in any new channel are themselves far from common Moreover a critical reading of this history suggests that the apparent control over the sexual impulse by reason is merely a superficial phenomenon Here as ever reason is but a tool in the hands of the passions The apparent causes are really the results we are witnessing the gradual emergence of a retarded homosexual impulse HISTORY XXVIII English aged forty surgeon Sexual experiences began early about the age of ten when a companion induced him to play at intercourse with their sisters He experienced no pleasure A little later a servant girl began to treat him affectionately and at last called him into her bedroom when she was partially undressed fondled and kissed his member and taught him to masturbate her On subsequent occasions she attempted a simulation of intercourse which gave her satisfaction but failed to induce emission in him On returning to school mutual masturbation was practised with schoolfellows and the first emission took place at the age of fourteen On leaving school he became a slave to the charms of women and had frequent coitus about the age of seventeen but he preferred masturbating girls and especially in persuading girls of good position to whom the experience was entirely novel to allow him to take liberties with them At twenty five he became engaged and mutual masturbation was practised to excess during the engagement after marriage connection generally took place twice every twenty four hours until pregnancy At this time he writes I stayed at the house of an old school fellow due of my lovers of old days There were so many guests that I shared my friend s bedroom The sight of his body gave rise to lustful feelings and when the light was out I stole across to his bed He made no objection and we passed the night in mutual masturbation We passed the next fortnight together and I never took the same pleasure in coitus with my wife though I did my duty She died five years later and I devoted myself heart and soul to my friend until his death by accident last year Since then I have lost all interest in life I am indebted for this case to a well known English alienist who remarks that the patient is fairly healthy to look at but with neurasthenia and tendency to melancholia and neurotic temperament The body is masculine and pubic hair abundant One testicle shows wasting HISTORIES XXIX AND XXX I give the following narrative in the words of an intimate friend of one of the cases in question My attention was first drawn to the study of inversion though I then regarded all forms of it as depraving and abominable at a public school where in our dormitory a boy of fifteen initiated his select friends into the secrets of mutual masturbation which he had learned from his brother a midshipman I gave no heed to this at the time though I remembered it in after years when immersed in Plato Lucretius and the Epicurean writers But my attention was riveted to it at the age of twenty when I spent a holiday with A a companion with whom I was and still am on terms of great friendship We enjoyed many things in common studied together and discussed most unconventional matters but not this Previously we had always occupied separate sleeping apartments on this occasion we were abroad in a country place and were compelled to put up with what we could get We not only had to share a room but a bed I was not surprised at his throwing his arm over me as I knew he was extraordinarily attached to me and I had always felt a brute for not returning his affection so warmly But I was surprised when later I awoke to find him occupied in fellatio and endeavoring to obtain my response Had it been anyone else I should have resented strongly such a liberty and our acquaintance would have ended but I cared for him too well though never very demonstrative This episode led to discussion of the topic He told me that his sexual strength was great that he had tested it in many ways and that it was essential to his well being that he should have satisfaction in some way He loathed prostitution and considered it degrading he felt physically attracted to some women and intellectually to others but the two elements were never combined and though he had been intimate with a few he felt that it was not right to them as he could not marry them because he held too high an ideal of marriage He had always felt attracted to his own sex and had kept up a Platonic friendship with a college chum X to whom I knew he was passionately attached for some years Both considered it perfectly moral and both felt better for it Both abhor pedicatio X however would never discuss the subject and seemed half ashamed of it A on the other hand though showing a great self respect in all things else feels no shame though he says he would never discuss it except with close friends or if asked for private advice A is the elder child of a military officer His parents were twenty one and nineteen respectively at the time of his birth Both parents are healthy and the two children both boys have good constitutions though the elder has the better He is of medium height and slender limbs proud carriage handsome and intellectual face classic Greek type excellent complexion charming manners and good temper The penis is large the foreskin very short He is fond of philosophy natural science history and literature He is reflective and patient rather than smart but strong willed and very active when roused never resting till he has accomplished what he wants even if this takes years He sings excellently and is fond of cycling boating swimming and mountain climbing He enjoys excellent health and has never had a day s illness since he was twelve years of age He says the only time he cannot sleep has been when in bed with some one who could not or would not satisfy him He requires satisfaction at least once a week twice or thrice in the hot season He never smokes nor drinks beer or spirits He is still single but believes that marriage would meet all his needs X is also an oldest child of young and healthy parents between twenty one and twenty four at his birth of different class father a builder He is of pleasing but not handsome appearance very sensitive very neat and methodical in all things not very strong willed and very reserved to women He is of very studious disposition especially fond of philosophy politics and natural science a good musician Takes moderate exercise but rather easily fatigued Is generally healthy but not overstrong He is a vegetarian and was brought up as a free thinker Until two years ago he was never attracted toward a girl indeed he disliked girls but he is now engaged For about eighteen months he has relinquished homosexuality but has suffered from dreams bad digestion and peevishness since He thinks the only remedy is marriage which he is pushing on He regards homosexuality as quite natural and normal though his desires are not strong and once a fortnight has always satisfied him He was led to the practice by the reasoning of A and because he felt a certain vague need and this comforted him He thinks it a matter of temperament and not to be discussed except by scientists He says he could never perform it except with his dearest friend whose request he could not resist He has a long foreskin flesh like a woman s and is well proportioned Both men are ardent for social reform the one actively the other passively engaged in it Both also regard the law as to homosexuality as absurd and demoralizing They also think that the law prohibiting polygamy is largely the cause of prostitution as many women are prevented from living honest lives and being cared for by someone and many men could marry one woman for physical satisfaction and another for intellectual They were devoted to each other when I first knew them they are still friends but separated by distance Both are exceedingly honorable and the latter is truthful to a fault According to later information X had married and his homosexual tendencies were almost completely in abeyance partly perhaps owing to the fact that he now lives quietly in the country A has surprised his friends by his ardent attachment to a lady of about his own age to whom he has become engaged He declares that he loves this woman better than any man but nevertheless he still feels strong passion for his men friends It is evident that the homosexual tendency in A is distinctly more pronounced than in his friend X As is found more often in bisexual than in homosexual persons he is of predominantly masculine type possesses great vitality and desires to exert all his faculties He has a sound nervous system and is very free from all nervousness He has written a scientific treatise and can study undisturbed amid violent noises His voice is manly in singing deep base He can whistle He is not vain though well formed and his hands are delicate His favorite color is green The demonstrative warmth of his affection for his friends is the chief feminine trait noted in him He rarely dreams and has never had an erotic dream this he explains by saying earlier than Freud that all dreams not caused by physical conditions are wish dreams and as he always satisfies his sexual needs at once with a friend or by masturbation his sexual needs have no opportunity of affecting his subconscious life There may be some doubt as to the classification of the two foregoing cases they are not personally known to me The following case with which I have been acquainted for many years I regard as clearly a genuine example of bisexuality HISTORY XXXI Englishman independent means aged fifty two married His ancestry is of a complicated character Some of his mother s forefathers in the last and earlier centuries are supposed to have been inverted He remembers liking the caresses of his father s footmen when he was quite a little boy He dreams indifferently about men and women and has strong sexual feeling for women Can copulate but does not insist on this act there is a tendency to refined voluptuous pleasure He has been married for many years and there are several children by the marriage He is not particular about the class or age of the men he loves He feels with regard to older men as a women does and likes to be caressed by them He is immensely vain of his physical beauty he shuns pedicatio and does not much care for the sexual act but likes long hours of voluptuous communion during which his lover admires him He feels the beauty of boyhood At the same time he is much attracted by young girls He is decidedly feminine in his dress manner of walking love of scents ornaments and fine things His body is excessively smooth and white the hips and buttocks rounded Genital organs normal His temperament is feminine especially in vanity irritability and petty preoccupations He is much preoccupied with his personal appearance and fond of admiration on one occasion he was photographed naked as Bacchus He is physically and morally courageous He has a genius for poetry and speculation with a tendency to mysticism He feels the discord between his love for men and society also between it and his love for his wife He regards it as in part at least hereditary and inborn in him HISTORY XXXII C R physician age thirty eight Nationality Irish with a Portuguese strain My mother came of an old Quaker family I was quite unaware of sexual differences until I was about fourteen as I was carefully kept separate from my sisters and although from time to time strange longings which I did not understand possessed me I was a virgin in thought and deed until that period of life When I was fourteen a cousin some years older than myself came to stay with us and shared my bed To my surprise he took hold of my penis and rubbed it for a time when a most pleasant feeling seized me and increased until a discharge came out of my organ he then asked me to do the same to him We frequently repeated the process during the following month I was quite unaware of any harm resulting The same year I went to school but none of my schoolmates for some time even suggested such actions until a friend staying with us for the holidays one day in the bathroom repeated the process and pressed his penis between my thighs when a similar discharge took place I shortly found out that several of my school friends and male cousins had the same desires and an elder brother of my first introducer into sexuality repeatedly spent the night with me when we would amuse ourselves in a similar way A little later my mother being away from home I shared my father s bed and he took my penis in his hand and pulled my foreskin back I in return took hold of his and found that he had an erection I proceeded to rub him when he stopped me and told me that I should not do so that when I was a little older I should love a woman to do it and that if I did not rub myself and allow other boys to do so I would enjoy myself much more I am quite certain that my father was inverted as he frequently if sleeping with me used to press my naked body against his and he always had a strong erection On one occasion he rubbed me until I had a discharge and then turning over on his back made me take his penis in my hand and rub him for a few minutes I used to jest frequently with my father as from my seventeenth year my penis was larger than his I will return to my father a little later When I was seventeen a college friend shared my bed and when undressing he said that he envied me my penis being so much larger than his after getting into bed he asked me to turn on my side and I found that he was attempting pedicatio I was astonished at his doing so when he informed me that next to a woman this process gave most pleasure However nothing resulted and this is the only experience of pedicatio that I have ever had When I was eighteen one evening a college chum introduced me to a woman and she was the first I ever had connection with We went behind some rocks and she took hold of my penis and pressed it into her body lying against me My father evidently suspected me when I came home and a few days afterward told me that it was very dangerous to have anything to do with women that I should wait until I was older that when a boy became a man he ought to have a woman occasionally and that if I ever had a nasty disease I should promptly tell him so that I could be properly cured At college I found several chums who were fond of sharing my bed and indulging in mutual masturbation pressing our bodies together face to face until there was mutual discharge but never again anyone who tried anal connection A short time afterward I was in Brussels and I paid my first visit to a brothel a place close to the Cathedral I picked a girl of about eighteen from eight naked beauties paraded for my choice She was avaricious and demanded ten francs I had paid twenty for my room and had only two left I wanted her to play with me but she only seized the penis and pulled me to her with such vigorous action that I discharged very rapidly I was so disgusted with the result that I masturbated when I returned to my boarding house A year later I paid Portugal a visit and my friends there frequently brought me to brothels and also introduced me to ladies of easy virtue I had connection with them the Portuguese prostitutes never suggested anything unnatural and in no instance did a male approach me for sexual purposes When I became a medical student I used to visit a Turkish bath frequently on one occasion I playfully slapped a friend on the buttocks when my father who was present told me not to do so as it was not proper conduct in public that if I liked to do so to him or one or two others it was no harm in private Until I was twenty one in the bath my father always covered his penis from my view but after I attained my majority he always exposed himself and repeatedly showed me pictures of naked women he also taught me the use of the condom In my twenty fourth year a tall handsome man who used to frequent the baths one day sat down beside me and playfully knocked my toes with his he then pressed his naked thigh against mine and a little later in the cooling room slipped his hand under my sheet and grasped my penis he then asked me to meet him a few days later in the baths saying I would be pleased with what he would do I kept the appointment and he took me into the hottest room where we lay on the floor in a few minutes he turned on his side and threw one of his legs across me I got frightened and jumped up he had a powerful erection but I refused to lie down again although he pulled his foreskin back to excite my desires I was afraid of being surprised by another bather Twice on future occasions I met this man and he made advances I believe that I would have yielded then if we had met at a private house Shortly afterward I met an elderly gentleman at the baths who also made advances to me but from fear I resisted him I also disliked him as he had a foul breath and bad teeth besides I was now able to go to the Continent and enjoy female charms to my heart s desire After qualification I joined the army in South Africa and to my astonishment found many of my comrades fond of male society one officer who had been wounded shared my bedroom at a military hospital and when undressing frequently admired my penis we used to play with each other until we had powerful erections but we never masturbated or tried any unnatural vice I used to have connection with women as frequently as I could and I frequently visited the Turkish baths and found that several clients were abnormal including one of the masseurs the latter enjoyed playing with my penis kissing and tickling me I married at twenty eight My married life has been normal and my wife and I are still in love with one another we have had several children My last sexual experiences have been in Australia once in Sydney at the baths a fellow bather playfully began tickling me when I had an erection he grasped my penis I jumped up and he asked me to do anything that I liked with him I refused Once on board a coasting steamer a fellow passenger used to expose himself posing as a statue we became very familiar and he wanted me to spend a night with him I also refused his offers I am very healthy and strong fond of riding fishing and shooting I lead a very active life I am neither musician nor artist but fond of hearing music and I admire works of art In person I am six feet high inclined to fat my body is very strong my penis is six inches long in repose and eight in erection I can without fatigue discharge twice in the night and have connection at least twice a week My scrotum is tense and both testicles large I am rather slow at discharging I have never had any desire to have connection with any other woman since marriage but several times I have met men who attracted me I have a friend another doctor who is very familiar with me and if we spend a night together we will play with each other I have a great desire for him to circumcize me We have never indulged in anything beyond feeling or pressing our bodies together like schoolboys My favorite color is green My erotic dreams when I have any are of my wife or of a male lover Sexual inversion is more widespread than is popularly supposed and I have never had any twinge of conscience after any of my affairs I regard the homosexual instinct as quite natural and except in regard to my wife it is stronger in my case than the heterosexual instinct I have never initiated a youth into the sexual life or had any desire to seduce a girl Boys under seventeen or persons of lower social class have no attraction for me HISTORY XXXIII M O thirty years of age born in the United States of English father and of mother whose father was Scotch the rest of his ancestry being English of long standing in America with a very little admixture of Dutch blood 
8028_233366_000001_000001	train-clean-360	He is five feet eight inches in height and has brown hair and eyes 
none	none	No hereditary troubles so far as known In childhood for some time threatened with chorea Is subject to tonsillitis and a stubborn though not severe form of indigestion induced by sedentary habits 
8028_233366_000001_000004	train-clean-360	He is of quick nervous temperament 
8028_233366_000001_000005	train-clean-360	Has an aversion from most outdoor sports but a great esthetic attraction to nature 
none	none	Highly educated 
8028_233366_000002_000000	train-clean-360	As far back as he can remember he lived in a house from which his parents removed when he was four years old 
8028_233366_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Before this removal he remembers two distinctly sexual experiences 
8028_233366_000002_000002	train-clean-360	A cousin five years older was in the bathroom seated and M O was feeling his sexual organs his mother called him out 
none	none	On another occasion he was in a wagonhouse with a girl of his own age 
8028_233366_000002_000004	train-clean-360	They were lying on a carriage seat attempting intercourse 
8028_233366_000002_000005	train-clean-360	The girl s older sister came in and found them 
8028_233366_000002_000006	train-clean-360	She said I am going to tell mamma you know she said for you not to do that any more With each of these clear memories comes the strong impression that it was but one among many 
8028_233366_000002_000007	train-clean-360	Five years ago M O met a man of his own age who had lived in that neighborhood at the same time Comparing notes they found that nearly all the small children in it had been given to such practices 
none	none	The neighborhood was a thoroughly respectable middle class one 
8028_233366_000003_000000	train-clean-360	From it M O removed to another of just about the same character and lived there until he was eleven years old 
8028_233366_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Of this period his memories are very fresh and abundant 
8028_233366_000003_000002	train-clean-360	With a single exception all the children between five and fourteen years of age appear to have indulged freely in promiscuous sexual play 
8028_233366_000003_000003	train-clean-360	In little companies of from four to twelve they went where trees or long grass hid them from observation and exhibited their persons to one another sometimes also they handled one another but not in the way of masturbation 
none	none	Of this last M O was wholly ignorant Sometimes when but two or three were together intercourse was attempted 
8028_233366_000003_000006	train-clean-360	In M O s case there was eager sexual curiosity and a more or less keen desire but actual contact brought no great satisfaction 
none	none	On two or three occasions girls practised fellatio and he then reciprocated with cunnilinctus but without pleasure 
8028_233366_000003_000008	train-clean-360	In all these plays he is sure that girls took the initiative as often as boys did 
none	none	During all this period M O had now one girl sweetheart and now another 
8028_233366_000004_000001	train-clean-360	This was conventional among the children and was fostered by the banter of older persons 
8028_233366_000004_000002	train-clean-360	M O s sexual curiosity was certainly greater in regard to the opposite sex 
8028_233366_000004_000003	train-clean-360	At this time however his homosexual interests appeared 
none	none	With a boy two or more years older he frequently went to some hiding place where they looked at each other s organs and handled them 
8028_233366_000004_000005	train-clean-360	He and another boy were once in an abandoned garden and they took off all their clothes the better to examine each other 
8028_233366_000004_000006	train-clean-360	The other boy then offered to kiss M O s fundament and did so 
8028_233366_000004_000007	train-clean-360	It caused a surprisingly keen and distinctly sexual sensation the first sexual shock that he can remember experiencing 
8028_233366_000004_000008	train-clean-360	He refused to reciprocate however when asked 
8028_233366_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Toward the end of this period there was a new and increasing development of another sort not recognized then as at all sexual in character 
8028_233366_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He began to feel toward certain boys in a way very different and much keener than he had done thus far toward girls although at the time he made no comparisons 
8028_233366_000005_000002	train-clean-360	For instance there was a boy whom he considered very pretty 
8028_233366_000005_000003	train-clean-360	They visited each other often and spent long times playing together 
8028_233366_000005_000004	train-clean-360	In school they looked and looked at each other until delicious uncontrollable giggling spells came on 
8028_233366_000005_000005	train-clean-360	Sexual matters were never discussed or thought of 
none	none	These experiences were in their way very sentimental and ideal 
8028_233366_000005_000007	train-clean-360	M O is sure that with himself the main consideration was always the other boy s beauty 
none	none	He began to recall with great fondness a certain much older and very handsome youth who had lived near him in the first neighborhood and had at the time shown him various little friendly attentions He seldom saw him now and hardly sought to do so yet was immensely pleased by a casual word or look from him in the schoolyard and much interested when other people spoke of him A cousin about two years younger than M O often visited him and slept with him They were very fond of each other and handled each other s organs When M O was about eleven years of age the family removed to a distant neighborhood where there were almost no children of his own age and where any association with those in the one just left was practically impossible 
8028_233366_000007_000001	train-clean-360	From this time until the changes of puberty were well under way his sexual life contrasted strongly in its solitude with the former promiscuity 
none	none	He remembers liking to wrestle with two or three schoolboys and to get their heads between his legs He thinks they were not aware of his sexual impulses 
8028_233366_000007_000004	train-clean-360	He flirted consciously flirted with certain school girls but never even suggested anything sexual to them 
8028_233366_000007_000005	train-clean-360	He read a few family medical books 
none	none	One day lying on an old uneven couch innocently enough at first he induced a new and delicious sensation altogether different from any he had ever dreamed of something far beyond the satisfaction of mere curiosity 
8028_233366_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He repeated the thing and before long produced emissions 
8028_233366_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Masturbation soon followed Certain days he would perform the act two or three times but again he would avoid it for days 
8028_233366_000008_000003	train-clean-360	He began at once to fight the tendency and felt very guilty and very ashamed for indulging it He prayed for help and at times wept over his failures to break the habit so quickly formed 
none	none	For a certain period after two or three years he seemed to have succeeded but he observed that he had intense erotic dreams with copious emissions regularly every eight days Just then certain newspaper advertisements fell under his eye and these persuaded him that he had produced in himself a diseased condition He never resorted to the remedies advertised but he was discouraged in his efforts to overcome the bad habit and since the evil effects appeared to consist only in the seminal losses he concluded that he might as well have the greater enjoyment of masturbation For a short time he remembers that he had an intense but revolting interest in the sexual organs of animals especially horses The males were much more interesting Gradually he began to develop entirely from within the ideal of a male comrade a beautiful emotional boy between whom and himself there might exist a powerful romantic passion 
8028_233366_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He lay for hours dreaming of this and inventing thrilling situations Suddenly at church he became acquainted with the very youth Edmund who seemed to satisfy all his longings 
none	none	M O was then one hundred sixty one two and Edmund fifteen A real wooing ensued Edmund finally yielding to the physical appeals of M O after several fits of misgiving The yielding was in the end complete however The two spent night after night together enjoying intercrural intercourse and sometimes mutual masturbation 
8028_233366_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Their parents may have been slightly uneasy at times but the connection continued uninterruptedly for a year and a half or more 
8028_233366_000010_000007	train-clean-360	In the meantime M O occasionally had relations with other boys but never wavered in his real preference for Edmund 
none	none	For girls he had no sexual desire whatever though he was much associated with them 
8028_233366_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Then M O and Edmund went to college at different places but they met in vacations and wrote frequent and ardent love letters Both had genuine attacks of love sickness and of jealousy 
8028_233366_000011_000001	train-clean-360	As M O looks back on this first love passion he can by no means regret it 
8028_233366_000011_000002	train-clean-360	It doubtless had great formative influence 
8028_233366_000012_000000	train-clean-360	After the first year at college Edmund transferred to another school farther away from M O and the opportunities for meeting became rarer but their affection was maintained and the intercourse resumed whenever it was possible 
none	none	Gradually however Edmund became interested in women and finally married M O also formed relations repeatedly with college friends and occasionally with others 
8028_233366_000013_000000	train-clean-360	On the whole M O preferred boys a year or two younger than himself but as he grew older the age difference increased 
none	none	At thirty he regarded himself as virtually engaged to a youth of seventeen one unusually mature however and much larger than himself 
8028_233366_000014_000000	train-clean-360	M O is always unhappy unless his affections have fairly free course 
8028_233366_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Life has been very disappointing to him in other respects 
8028_233366_000014_000002	train-clean-360	His greatest joys have come to him in this way 
8028_233366_000014_000003	train-clean-360	If he is able to consummate his present plan of union with the youth just referred to he will feel that his life has been crowned by what is for him the best possible end otherwise he declares he would not care to live at all 
none	none	He admires male beauty passionately 
8028_233366_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Feminine beauty he perceives objectively as he would any design of flowing curves and delicate coloring but it has no sexual charm for him whatever Women have put themselves in his way repeatedly but he finds himself more and more irritated by their specifically feminine foibles 
none	none	With men generally he is much more patient and sympathetic 
8028_233366_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The first literature that appealed to him was Plato s dialogues first read at twenty years of age 
none	none	Until then he had not known but what he stood alone in his peculiarity 
8028_233366_000016_000002	train-clean-360	He read what he could of classic literature 
8028_233366_000016_000003	train-clean-360	He enjoys Pater appreciating his attitude toward his own sex 
8028_233366_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Four or five years later he came across Raffalovich s book and ever since has felt a real debt of gratitude to its author 
8028_233366_000017_000000	train-clean-360	M O has no wish to injure society at large 
8028_233366_000017_000001	train-clean-360	As an individual he holds that he has the same right to be himself that anyone else has 
8028_233366_000017_000002	train-clean-360	He thinks that while boys of from thirteen to fifteen might possibly be rendered inverts those who reach sixteen without it cannot be bent that way 
none	none	They may be devoted to an invert enough in other ways to yield him what he wishes sexually but they will remain essentially normal themselves His observations are based on about thirty homosexual relationships that have lasted various lengths of time 
8028_233366_000018_000000	train-clean-360	M O feels strongly the poetic and elevated character of his principal homosexual relationships but he shrinks from appearing too sentimental 
8028_233366_000019_000000	train-clean-360	With regard to the traces of feminism in inverts he writes 
none	none	Up to the age of eleven I associated much with a cousin five years older the one referred to above and took great delight in a game we often played in which I was a girl a never ending romance a non sexual love story
8028_233366_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Somewhat later and until puberty I took great delight in acting but generally took female roles wearing skirts shawls beads wigs head dresses 
8028_233366_000021_000001	train-clean-360	When I was about thirteen my family began to make fun of me for it 
none	none	I played secretly for a while and then the desire for it left never to return There still lingers however a minor interest which began before puberty in valentines 
8028_233366_000022_000001	train-clean-360	My feeling for them is much like my feeling for flowers 
8028_233366_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Before I reached puberty I was sometimes called a sissy by my father 
none	none	Such taunts humiliated me more than anything else has ever done After puberty my father no longer applied the term and gradually other persons ceased to tease me that way The sting of it lasted though and led me more than once to ask intimate friends both men and women if they considered me at all feminine 
8028_233366_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Every one of them has been very emphatically of the opinion that my rational life is distinctively masculine being logical impartial skeptical 
8028_233366_000023_000005	train-clean-360	One or two have suggested that I have a finer discrimination than most men and that I take care of my rooms somewhat as a woman might though this does not extend to the style of decorations 
none	none	One man said that I lacked sympathy with certain grosser manifestations of masculine character such as smoking Some women think me unusually observing of women s dress My own is by no means effeminate In a muscular way I have average strength but am supple far beyond what is usual 
8028_233366_000023_000009	train-clean-360	If trained for it early I believe I would have made a good contortionist 
none	none	I have never had the least inclination to use tobacco generally take neither tea nor coffee and seldom any liquor never malt liquors 
8028_233366_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The dessert is always the best part of the meal 
8028_233366_000024_000002	train-clean-360	These tastes I attribute largely to my sedentary life 
none	none	When out camping I observed a marked change in the direction of heartier food and mild stimulants
8028_233366_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 My physical courage has never been put to the test but I observe that others appear to count on it 
none	none	I am very aggressive in matters of religious political social opinion 
8028_233366_000025_000002	train-clean-360	In moral courage I am either reckless or courageous I do not know which 
8028_233366_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I am perhaps a better whistler than most men 
8028_233366_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 When I was quite little my grandmother taught me to do certain kinds of fancy work and I continued to do a little from time to time until I was twenty four 
8028_233366_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Then I became irritated over a piece that troubled me put it in the fire and have not wanted to touch any since 
none	none	As a pet economy I continue to do nearly all of my own mending I have a decided aversion for much jewelry 
8028_233366_000028_000001	train-clean-360	My estheticism is very pronounced as compared with most of the men with whom I associate although I have never been able to give it much scope It makes for cleanliness order and general good taste 
8028_233366_000028_000002	train-clean-360	My dress is economical and by no means fastidious yet it seems to be generally approved 
8028_233366_000028_000003	train-clean-360	I have been complimented often on my ability to select appropriate presents clothing and to arrange a room 
8028_233366_000029_000000	train-clean-360	M O states that he practises the love bite at times though very gently 
8028_233366_000029_000001	train-clean-360	He often wants to pinch one who interests him sexually 
none	none	He considers very silly the statement somewhere made that inverts are always liars 
8028_233366_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Very few people he says are perfectly honest and the more dangerous society makes it for a man to be so the less likely he is to be 
none	none	While he himself has been unable in two or three instances to keep promises made to withhold from sexual intercourse with certain attractive individuals he has never otherwise been guilty of untruth about his homosexual relations 
8028_233366_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The foregoing narrative was received eight years ago 
8028_233366_000031_000001	train-clean-360	During this interval M O s health has very greatly improved 
8028_233366_000031_000002	train-clean-360	There has been a marked increase in outdoor activities and interests 
8028_233366_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Two years since M O consulted a prominent specialist who performed a thorough psychoanalysis 
none	none	He informed M O that he was less strongly homosexual than he himself supposed and recommended marriage with some young and pretty woman He attributed the homosexual bent to M O s having had his nose broken at the age of six by the birth of a younger brother who from that time on received all the attention and petting 
8028_233366_000032_000003	train-clean-360	M O had continued up to that age very affectionate toward his mother and dependent on her 
8028_233366_000032_000004	train-clean-360	He can remember friends and neighbors commenting on it 
none	none	At first M O was inclined to reject this suggestion of the specialist but on long reflection he inclines to believe that it was indeed a very important factor though not the sole one From his later observations of children and comparisons of these with memories of his own childhood M O says he is sure he was affectionate and demonstrative much beyond the average 
8028_233366_000032_000007	train-clean-360	His greatest craving was for affection and his greatest grief the fancied belief that no one cared for him 
8028_233366_000032_000008	train-clean-360	At ten or eleven he attempted suicide for this reason 
8028_233366_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Also as a result of the psychoanalysis but trying to eliminate the influence of suggestion he recollects and emphasizes more the attraction he felt toward girls before the age of twelve 
8028_233366_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Had his sexual experiences subsequently proved normal he doubts if those before twelve could be held to give evidence of homosexuality but only of precocious nervous and sexual irritability greatly heightened and directed by the secret practices of the children with whom he associated 
none	none	He does not see why these experiences should have given him a homosexual bent any more than a heterosexual one

8028_233366_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Such interest as did exist ceased wholly or almost so as the relation with Edmund developed There was no aversion from the company of girls and women however the intellectual friendships were mainly with them while the emotional ones were with boys

none	none	In spite of his precocious sexuality M O had from the very first an extreme disgust for obscene stories and for any association of sexual things with filthy words and anecdotes Owing in part to this and in part to his temperamental skepticism he disbelieved what associates told him regarding sexual emissions only becoming convinced when he actually experienced them and the facts of reproduction he denied indignantly until he read them in a medical work Until he was well over twenty five the physical aversion from any thought of reproduction was intense He knows other normal young men who have felt the same way but he believes it would be prevented or overcome by sex education such as is now being introduced in American schools

none	none	Resuming his narrative at the point where the earlier communication left it M O says that about a year after that time the youth of seventeen to whom he had considered himself virtually engaged withdrew from the agreement so far as it bore on his own future but not from the sentimental relation as it existed Although separated most of the time by distance the physical relation was resumed whenever they met Subsequently however the young man fell in love with a young woman and became engaged to her

Women Among Women of Ability Among the Lower Races Temporary Homosexuality in Schools et cetera Histories Physical and Psychic Characteristics of Inverted Women The Modern Development of Homosexuality Among Women Homosexuality is not less common in women than in men In the seriocomic theory of sex set forth by Aristophanes in Plato s Symposium males and females are placed on a footing of complete equality and however fantastic the theory suffices to indicate that to the Greek mind so familiar with homosexuality its manifestations seemed just as likely to occur in women as in men That is undoubtedly the case Like other anomalies indeed in its more pronounced forms it may be less frequently met with in women in its less pronounced forms almost certainly it is more frequently found A Catholic confessor a friend tells me informed him that for one man who acknowledges homosexual practices there are three women For the most part feminine homosexuality runs everywhere a parallel course to masculine homosexuality and is found under the same conditions It is as common in girls as in boys it has been found under certain conditions to abound among women in colleges and convents and prisons as well as under the ordinary conditions of society Perhaps the earliest case of homosexuality recorded in detail occurred in a woman one hundred thirty seven and it was with the investigation of such a case in a woman that Westphal may be said to have inaugurated the scientific study of inversion Moreover inversion is as likely to be accompanied by high intellectual ability in a woman as in a man The importance of a clear conception of inversion is indeed in some respects under present social conditions really even greater in the case of women than of men For if as has sometimes been said of our civilization this is a man s world the large proportion of able women inverts whose masculine qualities render it comparatively easy for them to adopt masculine avocations becomes a highly significant fact one hundred thirty eight It has been noted of distinguished women in all ages and in all fields of activity that they have frequently displayed some masculine traits one hundred thirty nine Even the first great woman in history as she has been called by a historian of Egypt Queen Hatschepsu was clearly of markedly virile temperament and always had herself represented on her monuments in masculine costume and even with a false beard one hundred forty Other famous queens have on more or less satisfactory grounds been suspected of a homosexual temperament such as Catherine II of Russia who appears to have been bisexual and Queen Christina of Sweden whose very marked masculine traits and high intelligence seem to have been combined with a definitely homosexual or bisexual temperament one hundred forty one Great religious and moral leaders like Madame Blavatsky and Louise Michel have been either homosexual or bisexual or at least of pronounced masculine temperament one hundred forty two Great actresses from the eighteenth century onward have frequently been more or less correctly identified with homosexuality as also many women distinguished in other arts one hundred forty three Above all Sappho the greatest of women poets the peer of the greatest poets of the other sex in the supreme power of uniting art and passion has left a name which is permanently associated with homosexuality It can scarcely be said that opinion is unanimous in regard to Sappho and the reliable information about her outside the evidence of the fragments of her poems which have reached us is scanty Her fame has always been great in classic times her name was coupled with Homer s But even to antiquity she was somewhat of an enigma and many legends grew up around her name such as the familiar story that she threw herself into the sea for the love of Phaon What remains clear is that she was regarded with great respect and admiration by her contemporaries that she was of aristocratic family that she was probably married and had a daughter that at one time she had to take her part in political exile and that she addressed her girl friends in precisely similar terms to those addressed by Alcaeus to youths We know that in antiquity feminine homosexuality was regarded as especially common in Sparta Lesbos and Miletus Horace who was able to read Sappho s complete poems states that the objects of her love plaints were the young girls of Lesbos while Ovid who played so considerable a part in weaving fantastic stories round Sappho s name never claimed that they had any basis of truth It was inevitable that the early Christians should eagerly attack so ambiguous a figure and Tatian Oratio ad Graecos cap fifty two reproached the Greeks that they honored statues of the tribade Sappho a prostitute who had celebrated her own wantonness and infatuation The result is that in modern times there have been some who placed Sappho s character in a very bad light and others who have gone to the opposite extreme in an attempt at rehabilitation Thus W Mure in his History of the Language and Literature of Ancient Greece eighteen fifty four vol iii pp two hundred seventy two three hundred twenty six four hundred ninety six eight dealing very fully with Sappho is disposed to accept many of the worst stories about her though he has no pronounced animus and as regards female homosexuality which he considers to be far more venial than male homosexuality he remarks that in modern times it has numbered among its votaries females distinguished for refinement of manners and elegant accomplishments Bascoul on the other hand will accept no statements about Sappho which conflict with modern ideals of complete respectability and even seeks to rewrite her most famous ode in accordance with the colorless literary sense which he supposes that it originally bore J M F Bascoul La Chaste Sappho et le Mouvement Feministe a Athenes nineteen eleven Wilamowitz Moellendorff Sappho und Simonides nineteen thirteen also represents the antiquated view formerly championed by Welcker according to which the attribution of homosexuality is a charge of vice to be repudiated with indignation Most competent and reliable authorities today however while rejecting the accretions of legend around Sappho s name and not disputing her claim to respect are not disposed to question the personal and homosexual character of her poems All ancient tradition and the character of her extant fragments says Prof J A Platt Encyclopedia Britannica eleventh ed art Sappho show that her morality was what has ever since been known as Lesbian What exactly that Lesbian morality involved we cannot indeed exactly ascertain It is altogether idle as A Croiset remarks of Sappho Histoire de la Litterature Grecque vol ii ch v to discuss the exact quality of this friendship or this love or to seek to determine with precision the frontiers which language itself often seems to seek to confuse of a friendship more or less esthetic and sensual of a love more or less Platonic See also J M Edmonds Sappho in the Added Light of the New Fragments nineteen twelve Iwan Bloch similarly concludes Ursprung der Syphilis vol ii nineteen eleven p five hundred seven that Sappho probably combined as modern investigation shows to be easily possible lofty ideal feelings with passionate sensuality exactly as happens in normal love It must also be said that in literature homosexuality in women has furnished a much more frequent motive to the artist than homosexuality in men Among the Greeks indeed homosexuality in women seldom receives literary consecration and in the revival of the classical spirit at the Renaissance it was still chiefly in male adolescents as we see for instance in Marino s Adone that the homosexual ideal found expression After that date male inversion was for a long period rarely touched in literature save briefly and satirically while inversion in women becomes a subject which might be treated in detail and even with complacence Many poets and novelists especially in France might be cited in evidence Ariosto it has been pointed out has described the homosexual attractions of women Diderot s famous novel La Religieuse which when first published was thought to have been actually written by a nun deals with the torture to which a nun was put by the perverse lubricity of her abbess for whom it is said Diderot found a model in the Abbess of Chelles a daughter of the Regent and thus a member of a family which for several generations showed a marked tendency to inversion Diderot s narrative has been described as a faithful description of the homosexual phenomena liable to occur in convents Feminine homosexuality especially in convents was often touched on less seriously in the eighteenth century Thus we find a homosexual scene in Les Plaisirs du Cloitre a play written in seventeen seventy three Le Theatre d Amour an XVIIIe Siecle nineteen ten Balzac who treated so many psychological aspects of love in a more or less veiled manner has touched on this in La Fille aux Yeux d Or in a vague and extravagantly romantic fashion Gautier made the adventures of a woman who was predisposed to homosexuality and slowly realizes the fact the central motive of his wonderful romance Mademoiselle de Maupin eighteen thirty five He approached the subject purely as an artist and poet but his handling of it shows remarkable insight Gautier based his romance to some extent on the life of Madame Maupin or as she preferred to call herself Mademoiselle Maupin who was born in sixteen seventy three her father s name being d Aubigny dressed as a man and became famous as a teacher of fencing afterward as an opera singer She was apparently of bisexual temperament and her devotion to women led her into various adventures She ultimately entered a convent and died at the age of thirty four with a reputation for sanctity E C Clayton Queens of Song vol i pp fifty two sixty one F Karsch Mademoiselle Maupin Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol v nineteen oh three pp six hundred ninety four seven hundred six A still greater writer Flaubert in Salammbo eighteen sixty two made his heroine homosexual Zola has described sexual inversion in Nona and elsewhere Some thirty years ago a popular novelist A Belot published a novel called Mademoiselle Giraud ma Femme which was much read the novelist took the attitude of a moralist who is bound to treat frankly but with all decorous propriety a subject of increasing social gravity The story is that of a man whose bride will not allow his approach on account of her own liaison with a female friend continued after marriage This book appears to have given origin to a large number of novels some of which touched the question with considerable less affectation of propriety Among other novelists who have dealt with the matter may be mentioned Guy de Maupassant La Femme de Paul Bourget Crime d Amour Catulle Mendes Mephistophela and Willy in the Claudine series Among poets who have used the motive of homosexuality in women with more or less boldness may be found Lamartine Regina Swinburne first series of Poems and Ballads Verlaine Parallelement and Pierre Louys Chansons de Bilitis The last named book a collection of homosexual prose poems attracted considerable attention on publication as it was an attempt at mystification being put forward as a translation of the poems of a newly discovered Oriental Greek poetess Bilitis more usually Beltis is the Syrian name for Aphrodite Les Chansons de Bilitis are not without charm but have been severely dealt with by Wilamowitz Moellendorff Sappho und Simonides nineteen thirteen p sixty three et seq as a travesty of Hellenism betraying inadequate knowledge of Greek antiquity More interesting as the work of a woman who was not only highly gifted but herself of homosexual temperament are the various volumes of poems published by Renee Vivien This lady whose real name was Pauline Tarn was born in eighteen seventy seven her father was of Scotch descent and her mother an American lady from Honolulu As a child she was taken to Paris and was brought up as a French girl She travelled much and at one time took a house at Mitylene the chief city of ancient Lesbos She had a love of solitude hated publicity and was devoted to her women friends especially to one whose early death about nineteen hundred was the great sorrow of Pauline Tarn s life She is described as very beautiful very simple and sweet natured and highly accomplished in many directions She suffered however from nervous overtension and incurable melancholy Toward the close of her life she was converted to Catholicism and died in nineteen oh nine at the age of thirty two She is buried in the cemetery at Passy Her best verse is by some considered among the finest in the French language Charles Brun Pauline Tarn Notes and Queries twenty two Aug nineteen fourteen the same writer who knew her well has also written a pamphlet Renee Vivien Sansot Paris nineteen eleven Her chief volumes of poems are Etudes et Preludes nineteen oh one Cendres et Poussieres nineteen oh two Evocations nineteen oh three A novel Une Femme M Apparut nineteen oh four is said to be to some extent autobiographical Renee Vivien also wrote a volume on Sappho with translations and a further volume of poems Les Kitharedes suggested by the fragments which remain of the minor women poets of Greece followers of Sappho It is moreover noteworthy that a remarkably large proportion of the cases in which homosexuality has led to crimes of violence or otherwise come under medico legal observation has been among women It is well know that the part taken by women generally in open criminality and especially in crimes of violence is small as compared with men one hundred forty four In the homosexual field as we might have anticipated the conditions are to some extent reversed Inverted men in whom a more or less feminine temperament is so often found are rarely impelled to acts of aggressive violence though they frequently commit suicide Inverted women who may retain their feminine emotionality combined with some degree of infantile impulsiveness and masculine energy present a favorable soil for the seeds of passional crime under those conditions of jealousy and allied emotions which must so often enter into the invert s life The first conspicuous example of this tendency in recent times is the Memphis case eighteen ninety two in the United States Arthur Macdonald Observation de Sexualite Pathologique Feminine Archives d Anthropologie Criminelle May eighteen ninety five see also Krafft Ebing Psychopathia Sexualis Eng trans of tenth ed p five hundred fifty In this case a congenital sexual invert Alice Mitchell planned a marriage with Freda Ward taking a male name and costume This scheme was frustrated by Freda s sister and Alice Mitchell then cut Freda s throat There is no reason to suppose that she was insane at the time of the murder She was a typical invert of a very pronounced kind Her mother had been insane and had homicidal impulses She herself was considered unbalanced and was masculine in her habits from her earliest years Her face was obviously unsymmetrical and she had an appearance of youthfulness below her age She was not vicious and had little knowledge of sexual matters but when she kissed Freda she was ashamed of being seen while Freda could see no reason for being ashamed She was adjudged insane There have been numerous cases in America more recently One case for some details concerning which I am indebted to doctor J G Kiernan of Chicago is that of the Tiller Sisters two quintroons who for many years had acted together under that name in cheap theaters One who was an invert with a horror of men dating from early girlhood was sexually attached to the other who was without inborn inversion and was eventually induced by a man to leave the invert The latter overcome by jealousy broke into the apartment of the couple and shot the man dead She was tried and sent to prison for life A defense of insanity was made but for this there was no evidence In another case also occurring in Chicago reported in Medicine June eighteen ninety nine and Alienist and Neurologist October eighteen ninety nine a trained nurse lived for fourteen years with a young woman who left her on four different occasions but was each time induced to return finally however she left and married whereupon the nurse shot the husband who was not however fatally wounded The culprit in this case had been twice married but had not lived with either of her husbands it was stated that her mother had died in an asylum and that her brother had committed suicide She was charged with disorderly conduct and subjected to a fine In another later case in Chicago a Russian girl of twenty two named Anna Rubinowitch shot from motives of jealousy another Russian girl to whom she had been devoted from childhood and then fatally shot herself The relations between the two girls had been very intimate Our love affair is one purely of the soul Anna Rubinowitch was accustomed to say we love each other on a higher plane than that of earth I am informed that there were in fact physical relationships the sexual organs were normal This continued with great devotion on each side until Anna s sweetheart began to show herself susceptible to the advances of a male wooer This aroused uncontrollable jealousy in Anna whose father it may be noted had committed suicide by shooting some years previously Homosexual relationships are also a cause of suicide among women Such a case was reported in Massachusetts early in nineteen oh one A girl of twenty one had been tended during a period of nervous prostration apparently of hysterical nature by a friend and neighbor fourteen years her senior married and having children An intimate friendship grew up equally ardent on both sides The mother of the younger woman and the husband of the other took measures to put a stop to the intimacy and the girl was sent away to a distant city stolen interviews however still occurred Finally when the obstacles became insurmountable the younger woman bought a revolver and deliberately shot herself in the temple in presence of her mother dying immediately Though sometimes thought to act rather strangely she was a great favorite with all handsome very athletic fond of all outdoor sports an energetic religious worker possessing a fine voice and was an active member of many clubs and societies The older woman belonged to an aristocratic family and was loved and respected by all In another case in New York in nineteen oh five a retired sailor Captain John Weed who had commanded transatlantic vessels for many years was admitted to a Home for old sailors and shortly after became ill and despondent and cut his throat It was then found that Captain Weed was really a woman I am informed that the old sailor s despondency and suicide were due to enforced separation from a female companion The infatuation of young girls for actresses and other prominent women may occasionally lead to suicide Thus in Philadelphia a few years ago a girl of nineteen belonging to a very wealthy family beautiful and highly educated acquired an absorbing infatuation for Miss Mary Garden the prima donna with whom she had no personal acquaintance The young girl would kneel in worship before the singer s portrait and studied hairdressing and manicuring in the hope of becoming Miss Garden s maid When she realized that her dream was hopeless she shot herself with a revolver Cases more or less resembling those here brought forward occur from time to time in all parts of the civilized world Reports mostly from current newspapers of such cases as well as of simple transvestism or Eonism in both women and men will be found in the publications of the Berlin Wissenschaftlich humanitaeren Komitee the Monatsberichte up to nineteen oh nine then in the Vierteljahrsberichte and from nineteen thirteen onward in the Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen Yet until recently comparatively little has been known of sexual inversion in women Even so lately as nineteen oh one after the publication of the first edition of the present Study Krafft Ebing wrote that scarcely fifty cases had been recorded The chief monographs devoted but little space to women Krafft Ebing himself in the earlier editions of Psychopathia Sexualis gave little special attention to inversion in women although he published a few cases Moll however included a valuable chapter on the subject in his Kontraere Sexualempfindung narrating numerous cases and inversion in women also received special attention in the present Study Hirschfeld however in his Homosexualitaet nineteen fourteen is the first authority who has been able to deal with feminine homosexuality as completely company ordinate with masculine homosexuality The two manifestations masculine and feminine are placed on the same basis and treated together throughout the work It is no doubt not difficult to account for this retardation in the investigation of sexual inversion in women Notwithstanding the severity with which homosexuality in women has been visited in a few cases for the most part men seem to have been indifferent toward it when it has been made a crime or a cause for divorce in men it has usually been considered as no offense at all in women one hundred forty five Another reason is that it is less easy to detect in women we are accustomed to a much greater familiarity and intimacy between women than between men and we are less apt to suspect the existence of any abnormal passion And allied with this cause we have also to bear in mind the extreme ignorance and the extreme reticence of women regarding any abnormal or even normal manifestation of their sexual life A woman may feel a high degree of sexual attraction for another woman without realizing that her affection is sexual and when she does realize this she is nearly always very unwilling to reveal the nature of her intimate experience even with the adoption of precautions and although the fact may be present to her that by helping to reveal the nature of her abnormality she may be helping to lighten the burden of it on other women Among the numerous confessions voluntarily sent to Krafft Ebing there is not one by a woman There is again the further reason that well marked and fully developed cases of inversion are probably rarer in women though a slighter degree may be more common in harmony with the greater affectability of the feminine organism to slight stimuli and its lesser liability to serious variation one hundred forty six The same aberrations that are found among men are however everywhere found among women Feminine inversion has sometimes been regarded as a vice of modern refined civilization Yet it was familiar to the Anglo Saxons and Theodore s Penitential in the seventh century assigned a penance of three years considerably less than that assigned to men or for bestiality to a woman fornicating with a woman Among the women of savages in all parts of the world homosexuality is found though it is less frequently recorded than among men one hundred forty seven In New Zealand it is stated on the authority of Moerenhout though I have not been able to find the reference that the women practised Lesbianism In South America where inversion is common among men we find similar phenomena in women Among Brazilian tribes Gandavo one hundred forty eight wrote There are certain women among these Indians who determine to be chaste and know no man These leave every womanly occupation and imitate the men They wear their hair the same way as the men they go to war with them or hunting bearing their bows they continue always in the company of men and each has a woman who serves her and with whom she lives This has some analogy with the phenomena seen among North American men doctor Holder who has carefully studied the bote tells me that he has met no corresponding phenomena in women There is no doubt however that homosexuality among women is well known to the American Indians in various regions Thus the Salish Indians of British Columbia have a myth of an old woman who had intercourse with a young woman by means of a horn used as a penis one hundred forty nine In the mythology of the Assiniboine Indians of Canada and Montana and the Fox Indians of Iowa there are also legends of feminine homosexuality supposed to have been derived from the Algonkin Cree Indians who were closely connected with both one hundred fifty According to the Assiniboine legend a man s wife fell in love with his sister and eloped with her a boneless child being the result of the union the husband pursued the couple and killed his wife as well as the child no one cared to avenge her death The Fox legend entitled Two Maidens who Played the Harlot with Each Other runs as follows It is said that once on a time long ago there were two young women who were friends together It is told that there were also two youths who tried to woo the two maidens but they were not able even so much as to talk with them After awhile the youths began to suspect something wrong So once during the summer when the two maidens started away to peel off bark the youths followed staying just far enough behind to keep them in sight While the girls were peeling the bark the youths kept themselves hidden After awhile they no longer heard the sound of the maidens at work Whereupon they began to creep up to where they were When they drew nigh behold the maidens were in the act of taking off their clothes The first to disrobe flung herself down on the ground and lay there Pray what are these girls going to do was the feeling in the hearts of the youths And to their amazement the girls began to lie with each other Thereupon the youths ran to where the girls were She who was lying on top instantly fell over backward Her clitoris was standing out and had a queer shape it was like a turtle s penis Thereupon the maidens began to plead with the youths Oh don t tell on us they said Truly it is not of our own free desire that we have done this thing We have done it under the influence of some unknown being It is said that afterward one of the maidens became big with child In the course of time she gave birth and the child was like a soft shell turtle In Bali according to Jacobs as quoted by Ploss and Bartels homosexuality is almost as common among women as among men though it is more secretly exercised the methods of gratification adopted are either digital or lingual or else by bringing the parts together tribadism Baumann who noted inversion among the male negro population of Zanzibar finds that it is also not rare among women Although Oriental manners render it impossible for such women to wear men s clothes openly they do so in private and are recognized by other women by their man like bearing as also by the fact that women s garments do not suit them They show a preference for masculine occupations and seek sexual satisfaction among women who have the same inclinations or else among normal women who are won over by presents or other means In addition to tribadism or cunnilinctus they sometimes use an ebony or ivory phallus with a kind of glans at one end or sometimes at both ends in the latter case it can be used by two women at once and sometimes it has a hole bored through it by which warm water can be injected it is regarded as an Arab invention and is sometimes used by normal women shut up in harems and practically deprived of sexual satisfaction one hundred fifty one Among the Arab women according to Kocher homosexual practices are rare though very common among Arab men In Egypt however according to Godard Kocher and others it is almost fashionable and every woman in the harem has a friend In Turkey homosexuality is sometimes said to be rare among women But it would appear to be found in the harems and women s baths of Turkey as well as of Islam generally Brantome in the sixteenth century referred to the Lesbianism of Turkish women at the baths and Leo Africanus in the same century mentioned the tribadism of Moorish women and the formal organization of tribadic prostitution in Fez There was an Osmanli Sapphic poetess Mihiri whose grave is at Amasia and Vambery and Achestorides agree as to the prevalence of feminine homosexuality in Turkey one hundred fifty two Among the negroes and mulattoes of French creole countries according to Corre homosexuality is very common I know a lady of great beauty he remarks a stranger in Guadalupe and the mother of a family who is obliged to stay away from the markets and certain shops because of the excessive admiration of mulatto women and negresses and the impudent invitations which they dare to address to her one hundred fifty three He refers to several cases of more or less violent sexual attempts by women on young colored girls of twelve or fourteen and observes that such attempts by men on children of their own sex are much rarer In China according to Matignon and in Cochin China according to Lorion homosexuality does not appear to be common among women In India however it is probably as prevalent among women as it certainly is among men In the first edition of this Study I quoted the opinion of doctor Buchanan then Superintendant of the Central Gaol of Bengal at Bhagalpur who informed me that he had never come across a case and that his head gaoler had never heard of such a thing in twenty five years experience Another officer in the Indian Medical Service assures me however that there cannot be the least doubt as to the frequency of homosexuality among women in India either inside or outside gaols I am indebted to him for the following notes on this point That homosexual relationships are common enough among Indian women is evidenced by the fact that the Hindustani language has five words to denote the tribade one dugana two zanakhe three sa tar four chapathai and five chapatbaz The modus operandi is generally what Martial calls geminos committere cunnos but sometimes a phallus called saburah is employed The act itself is called chapat or chapti and the Hindustani poets Nazir Rangin Jan S aheb treat of Lesbian love very extensively and sometimes very crudely Jan S aheb a woman poet sings to the effect that intercourse with a woman by means of a phallus is to be preferred to the satisfaction offered by a male lover The common euphemism employed when speaking of two tribades who live together is that they live apart So much for the literary evidence as to the prevalence of what mirable dictu doctor Buchanan s gaoler was ignorant of Now for facts In the gaol of R the superintendent discovered a number of phalli in the females inclosure they were made of clay and sun dried and bore marks of use In the gaol of S was a woman who as is usual with tribades in India wore male attire and was well known for her sexual proclivities An examination revealed the following Face much lined mammae of masculine type but nipples elongated and readily erectile gluteal and iliac regions quite of masculine type as also the thighs clitoris with enlarged glands readily erectile nymphae thickened and enlarged vulvar orifice patent for she had in early youth been a prostitute the voice was almost contralto Her partner was of low type but eminently feminine in configuration and manner In this case I heard that the man went to a local ascetic and begged his intercession with the deity so that she might impregnate her partner The Hindoo medical works mention the possibility of a woman uniting with another woman in sexual embraces and begetting a boneless fetus Short History of Aryan Medical Science p forty four In the town of D there lived apart two women one a Brahmin the other a grazier their modus operandi was tribadism as an eyewitness informed me In S I was called in to treat the widow of a wealthy Mohammedan I had occasion to examine the pudenda and found what Martineau would have called the indelible stigmata of early masturbation and later sapphism She admitted the impeachment and confessed that she was on the best of terms with her three remarkably well formed and good looking handmaidens This lady said that she began masturbation at an early age just like all other women and that sapphism came after the age of puberty Another Mohammedan woman whom I knew and who had a very large clitoris told me that she had been initiated into Lesbian love at twelve by a neighbor and had intermittently practised it ever since I might also instance two sisters of the gardener caste both widows who lived apart and indulged in simultaneous sapphism That sometimes the actors in tribadism are most vigorous is shown by the fact that in the central gaol of swelling of the vulva was admitted to have been caused by the embraces of two female convicts The subordinate who told me this mentioned it quite incidentally while relating his experiences as hospital assistant at this gaol When I questioned him he stated that the woman whom he was called to treat told him that she could never satisfy herself with men but only with women He added that tribadism was quite common in the gaol The foregoing sketch may serve to show that homosexual practices certainly and probably definite sexual inversion are very widespread among women in very many and various parts of the world though it is likely that as among men there are variations geographical racial national or social in the frequency or intensity of its obvious manifestations Thus in the eighteenth century Casanova remarked that the women of Provence are specially inclined to Lesbianism In European prisons homosexual practices flourish among the women fully as much it may probably be said as among the men There is indeed some reason for supposing that these phenomena are here sometimes even more decisively marked than among men one hundred fifty four This prevalence of homosexuality among women in prison is connected with the close relationship between feminine criminality and prostitution The frequency of homosexual practices among prostitutes is a fact of some interest and calls for special explanation for at the first glance it seems in opposition to all that we know concerning the exciting causes of homosexuality Regarding the fact there can be no question one hundred fifty five It has been noted by all who are acquainted with the lives of prostitutes though opinion may differ as to its frequency In Berlin Moll was told in well informed quarters the proportion of prostitutes with Lesbian tendencies is about twenty five per cent This was almost the proportion at Paris many years ago according to Parent Duchatelet today according to Chevalier it is larger and Bourneville believes that seventy five per cent of the inmates of the Parisian venereal hospitals have practised homosexuality Hammer in Germany has found among sixty six prostitutes that forty one were homosexual one hundred fifty six Hirschfeld thinks that inverted women are specially prone to become prostitutes one hundred fifty seven Eulenburg believes on the other hand that the conditions of their life favor homosexuality among prostitutes a homosexual union seems to them higher purer more innocent and more ideal one hundred fifty eight There is however no fundamental contradiction between these two views they are probably both right In London so far as my inquiries extend homosexuality among prostitutes is very much less prevalent and in a well marked form is confined to a comparatively small section I am indebted to a friend for the following note From my experience of the Parisian prostitute I gather that Lesbianism in Paris is extremely prevalent indeed one might almost say normal In particular most of the chahut dancers of the Moulin Rouge Casino de Paris and the other public balls are notorious for going in couples and for the most part they prefer not to be separated even in their most professional moments with the other sex In London the thing is naturally much less obvious and I think much less prevalent but it is certainly not infrequent A certain number of well known prostitutes are known for their tendencies in this direction which do not however interfere in any marked way with the ordinary details of their profession I do not personally know of a single prostitute who is exclusively Lesbian I have heard vaguely that there are one or two such anomalies But I have heard a swell cocotte at the Corinthian announce to the whole room that she was going home with a girl and no one doubted the statement Her name indeed was generally coupled with that of a fifth rate actress Another woman of the same kind has a little clientele of women who buy her photographs in Burlington Arcade In the lower ranks of the profession all this is much less common One often finds women who have simply never heard of such a thing they know of it in regard to men but not in regard to women And they are for the most part quite horrified at the notion which they consider part and parcel of French beastliness Of course almost every girl has her friend and when not separately occupied they often sleep together but while in separate rare cases this undoubtedly means all that it can mean for the most part so far as one can judge it means no more than it would mean among ordinary girls It is evident that there must be some radical causes for the frequency of homosexuality among prostitutes One such cause doubtless lies in the character of the prostitute s relations with men these relations are of a professional character and as the business element becomes emphasized the possibility of sexual satisfaction diminishes at the best also there lacks the sense of social equality the feeling of possession and scope for the exercise of feminine affection and devotion These the prostitute must usually be forced to find either in a bully or in another woman one hundred fifty nine Apart from this fact it must be borne in mind that in a very large number of cases prostitutes show in slight or more marked degree many of the signs of neurotic heredity one hundred sixty and it would not be surprising if they present the germs of homosexuality in an unusually high degree The life of the prostitute may well develop such latent germs and so we have an undue tendency to homosexuality just as we have it among criminals and to a much less extent among persons of genius and intellect Homosexuality is specially fostered by those employments which keep women in constant association not only by day but often at night also without the company of men This is for instance the case in convents and formerly at all events however it may be today homosexuality was held to be very prevalent in convents This was especially so in the eighteenth century when very many young girls without any religious vocation were put into convents one hundred sixty one The same again is today the case with the female servants in large hotels among whom homosexual practices nave been found very common one hundred sixty two Laycock many years ago noted the prevalence of manifestations of this kind which he regarded as hysterical among seamstresses lace makers et cetera confined for hours in close contact with one another in heated rooms The circumstances under which numbers of young women are employed during the day in large shops and factories and sleep in the establishment two in a room or even two in a bed are favorable to the development of homosexual practices In England it is seldom that anyone cares to investigate these phenomena though they certainly exist They have been more thoroughly studied elsewhere Thus in Rome Niceforo who studied various aspects of the lives of the working classes succeeded in obtaining much precise information concerning the manners and customs of the young girls in dressmaking and tailoring work rooms He remarks that few of those who see the virtuous daughters of the people often not more than twelve years old walking along the streets with the dressmaker s box under their arm modestly bent head and virginal air realize the intense sexual preoccupations often underlying these appearances In the work rooms the conversation perpetually revolves around sexual subjects in the absence of the mistress or forewoman and even in her presence the slang that prevails in the work rooms leads to dialogues with a double meaning A state of sexual excitement is thus aroused which sometimes relieves itself mentally by psychic onanism sometimes by some form of masturbation one girl admitted to Niceforo that by allowing her thoughts to dwell on the subject while at work she sometimes produced physical sexual excitement as often as four times a day See also vol i of these Studies Auto erotism Sometimes however a vague kind of homosexuality is produced the girls excited by their own thoughts and their conversation being still further excited by contact with each other In summer in one work room some of the girls wear no drawers and they unbutton their bodices and work with crossed legs more or less uncovered In this position the girls draw near and inspect one another some boast of their white legs and then the petticoats are raised altogether for more careful comparison Many enjoy this inspection of nudity and experience real sexual pleasure From midday till two P M during the hours of greatest heat when all are in this condition and the mistress in her chemise and sometimes with no shame at the workers presence even without it falls asleep on the sofa all the girls without one exception masturbate themselves The heat seems to sharpen their desires and morbidly arouse all their senses The voluptuous emotions restrained during the rest of the day break out with irresistible force stimulated by the spectacle of each other s nakedness some place their legs together and thus heighten the spasm by the illusion of contact with a man In this way they reach mutual masturbation It is noteworthy however Niceforo points out that these couples for mutual masturbation are never Lesbian couples Tribadism is altogether absent from the factories and work rooms He even believes that it does not exist among girls of the working class He further describes how in another work room during the hot hours of the day in summer when no work is done some of the girls retire into the fitting room and having fastened their chemises round their legs and thighs with pins so as to imitate trousers play at being men and pretend to have intercourse with the others Niceforo Il Gergo cap vi eighteen ninety seven Turin I have reproduced these details from Niceforo s careful study because although they may seem to be trivial at some points they clearly bring out the very important distinction between a merely temporary homosexuality and true inversion The amusements of these young girls may not be considered eminently innocent or wholesome but on the other hand they are not radically morbid or vicious They are strictly and even consciously play they are dominated by the thought that the true sexual ideal is normal relationship with a man and they would certainly disappear in the presence of a man It must be remembered that Niceforo s observations were made among girls who were mostly young In the large factories where many adult women are employed the phenomena tend to be rarer but of much less trivial and playful character At Wolverhampton some forty years ago the case was reported of a woman in a galvanizing store who after dinner indecently assaulted a girl who was a new hand Two young women held the victim down and this seems to show that homosexual vice was here common and recognized No doubt this case is exceptional in its brutality It throws however a significant light on the conditions prevailing in factories In Spain in the large factories where many adult women are employed especially in the great tobacco factory at Seville Lesbian relationships seem to be not uncommon Here the women work in an atmosphere which in summer is so hot that they throw off the greater part of their clothing to such an extent that a bell is rung whenever a visitor is introduced into a work room in order to warn the workers Such an environment predisposes to the formation of homosexual relationships When I was in Spain some years ago an incident occurred at the Seville Fabrica de Tabacos which attracted much attention in the newspapers and though it was regarded as unusual it throws light on the life of the workers One morning as the women were entering the work room and amid the usual scene of animation changing their Manila shawls for the light costume worn during work one drew out a small clasp knife and attacking another rapidly inflicted six or seven wounds on her face and neck threatening to kill anyone who approached Both these cigarreras were superior workers engaged in the most skilled kind of work and had been at the factory for many years In appearance they were described as presenting a striking contrast the aggressor who was forty eight years of age was of masculine air tall and thin with an expression of firm determination on her wrinkled face the victim on the other hand whose age was thirty was plump and good looking and of pleasing disposition The reason at first assigned for the attack on the younger woman was that her mother had insulted the elder woman s son It appeared however that a close friendship had existed between the two women that latterly the younger woman had formed a friendship with the forewoman of her work room and that the elder woman animated by jealousy then resolved to murder both this design was frustrated by the accidental absence of the forewoman that day In theaters the abnormal sexuality stimulated by such association in work is complicated by the general tendency for homosexuality to be connected with dramatic aptitude a point to which I shall have to refer later on I am indebted to a friend for the following note Passionate friendships among girls from the most innocent to the most elaborate excursions in the direction of Lesbos are extremely common in theaters both among actresses and even more among chorus and ballet girls Here the pell mell of the dressing rooms the wait of perhaps two hours between the performances during which all the girls are cooped up in a state of inaction and of excitement in a few crowded dressing rooms afford every opportunity for the growth of this particular kind of sentiment In most of the theaters there is a little circle of girls somewhat avoided by the others or themselves careless of further acquaintanceship who profess the most unbounded devotion to one another Most of these girls are equally ready to flirt with the opposite sex but I know certain ones among them who will scarcely speak to a man and who are never seen without their particular pal or chum who if she gets moved to another theater will come around and wait for her friend at the stage door But here again it is but seldom that the experience is carried very far The fact is that the English girl especially of the lower and middle classes whether she has lost her virtue or not is extremely fettered by conventional notions Ignorance and habit are two restraining influences from the carrying out of this particular kind of perversion to its logical conclusions It is therefore among the upper ranks alike of society and of prostitution that Lesbianism is most definitely to be met with for here we have much greater liberty of action and much greater freedom from prejudices With girls as with boys it is in the school at the evolution of puberty that homosexuality usually first shows itself It may originate in a way mainly peripheral or mainly central In the first case two children perhaps when close to each other in bed more or less unintentionally generate in each other a certain amount of sexual irritation which they foster by mutual touching and kissing This is a spurious kind of homosexuality the often precocious play of the normal instinct In the girl who is congenitally predisposed to homosexuality it will continue and develop in the majority it will be forgotten as quickly as possible not without shame in the presence of the normal object of sexual love I may quote as fairly typical the following observation supplied by a lady who cannot be called inverted Like so many other children and girls I was first taught self indulgence by a girl at school and I passed on my knowledge to one or two others with one of whom I remember once when we were just sixteen spending the night sensually We were horribly ashamed after and that was the only time When I was only eight there was a girl of thirteen who liked to play with my body and taught me to play with hers though I rather disliked doing so We slept together and this went on at intervals for six months These things for the sake of getting enjoyment and not with any passion are not uncommon with children but less common I think than people sometimes imagine I believe I could recall without much difficulty the number of times such things happened with me In the case I mentioned when I did for one night feel or try to excite in myself and my girl companion of sixteen sensual passion we had as little children slept together a few times and done these things and meeting after an absence just at that age recalled our childish memories and were carried away by sexual impulse But I never felt any peculiar affection or passion for her even at the time nor she for me We only felt that our sensual nature was strong at the time and had betrayed us into something we were ashamed of and therefore we avoided letting ourselves sleep too close after that day I think we disliked each other and were revolted whenever we thought of that night feeling that each had degraded the other and herself The cases in which the source is mainly central rather than peripheral nevertheless merge into the foregoing with no clear line of demarcation In such cases a girl forms an ardent attachment for another girl probably somewhat older than herself often a schoolfellow sometimes her schoolmistress upon whom she will lavish an astonishing amount of affection and devotion There may or not be any return usually the return consists of a gracious acceptance of the affectionate services The girl who expends this wealth of devotion is surcharged with emotion but she is often unconscious or ignorant of the sexual impulse and she seeks for no form of sexual satisfaction Kissing and the privilege of sleeping with the friend are however sought and at such times it often happens that even the comparatively unresponsive friend feels more or less definite sexual emotion pudendal turgescence with secretion of mucus and involuntary twitching of the neighboring muscles though little or no attention may be paid to this phenomenon and in the common ignorance of girls concerning sex matters it may not be understood In some cases there is an attempt either instinctive or intentional to develop the sexual feeling by close embraces and kissing This rudimentary kind of homosexual relationship is I believe more common among girls than among boys and for this there are several reasons one a boy more often has some acquaintance with sexual phenomena and would frequently regard such a relationship as unmanly two the girl has a stronger need of affection and self devotion to another person than a boy has three she has not under our existing social conditions which compel young women to hold the opposite sex at arm s length the same opportunities of finding an outlet for her sexual emotions while four conventional propriety recognizes a considerable degree of physical intimacy between girls thus at once encouraging and cloaking the manifestations of homosexuality The ardent attachments which girls in schools and colleges form to each other and to their teachers constitute a subject which is of considerable psychological interest and of no little practical importance one hundred sixty three These girlish devotions on the borderland between friendship and sexual passion are found in all countries where girls are segregated for educational purposes and their symptoms are on the whole singularly uniform though they vary in intensity and character to some extent from time to time and from place to place sometimes assuming an epidemic form They have been most carefully studied in Italy where Obici and Marchesini an alienist and a psychologist working in conjunction have analyzed the phenomena with remarkable insight and delicacy and much wealth of illustrative material one hundred sixty four But exactly the same phenomena are everywhere found in English girls schools even of the most modern type and in some of the large American women s colleges they have sometimes become so acute as to cause much anxiety one hundred sixty five On the whole however it is probable that such manifestations are regarded more indulgently in girls than in boys schools and in view of the fact that the manifestations of affection are normally more pronounced between girls than between boys this seems reasonable The head mistress of an English training college writes My own assumption on such matters has been that affection does naturally belong to the body as well as the mind and between two women is naturally and innocently expressed by caresses I have never therefore felt that I ought to warn any girl against the physical element in friendship as such The test I should probably suggest to them would be the same as one would use for any other relation was the friendship helping life as a whole making them keener kinder more industrious et cetera or was it hindering it Passionate friendships of a more or less unconsciously sexual character are common even outside and beyond school life It frequently happens that a period during which a young woman falls in love at a distance with some young man of her acquaintance alternates with periods of intimate attachment to a friend of her own sex No congenital inversion is usually involved It generally happens in the end either that relationship with a man brings the normal impulse into permanent play or the steadying of the emotions in the stress of practical life leads to a knowledge of the real nature of such feelings and a consequent distaste for them In some cases on the other hand such relationships especially when formed after school life are fairly permanent An energetic emotional woman not usually beautiful will perhaps be devoted to another who may have found some rather specialized lifework but who may be very unpractical and who has probably a very feeble sexual instinct she is grateful for her friends s devotion but may not actively reciprocate it The actual specific sexual phenomena generated in such cases vary very greatly The emotion may be latent or unconscious it may be all on one side it is often more or less recognized and shared Such cases are on the borderland of true sexual inversion but they cannot be included within its region Sex in these relationships is scarcely the essential and fundamental element it is more or less subordinate and parasitic There is often a semblance of a sex relationship from the marked divergence of the friends in physical and psychic qualities and the nervous development of one or both the friends is sometimes slightly abnormal We have to regard such relationships as hypertrophied friendships the hypertrophy being due to unemployed sexual instinct The following narrative is written by a lady who holds a responsible educational position A friend of mine two or three years older than myself I am thirty one and living in the same house with me has been passing through a very unhappy time Long nervous strain connected with this has made her sleep badly and apt to wake in terrible depression about three o clock in the morning In the early days of our friendship about eight months ago she occasionally at these times took refuge with me After a while I insisted on her consulting a doctor who advised her amongst other things not to sleep alone Thenceforth for two or three months I induced her to share my room After a week or two she generally shared my bed for a time at the beginning of the night as it seemed to help her to sleep Before this about the second or third time that she came to me in the early morning I had been surprised and a little frightened to find how pleasant it was to me to have her and how reluctant I was that she should go away When we began regularly to sleep in the same room the physical part of our affection grew rapidly very strong It is natural for me generally to caress my friends but I soon could not be alone in a room with this one without wanting to have my arms round her It would have been intolerable to me to live with her without being able to touch her We did not discuss it but it was evident that the desire was even stronger in her than in me For some time it satisfied us fully to be in bed together One night however when she had had a cruelly trying day and I wanted to find all ways of comforting her I bared by breast for her to lie on Afterward it was clear that neither of us could be satisfied without this She groped for it like a child and it excited me much more to feel that than to uncover my breast and arms altogether at once Much of this excitement was sexually localized and I was haunted in the daytime by images of holding this woman in my arms I noticed also that my inclination to caress my other women friends was not diminished but increased All this disturbed me a good deal The homosexual practices of which I had read lately struck me as merely nasty I could not imagines myself tempted to them at the same time the whole matter was new to me for I had never wanted anyone even to share my bed before I had read that sex instinct was mysterious and unexpected and I felt that I did not know what might come next I knew only one elder person whom for wide mindedness gentleness and saintliness I could bear to consult and to this person a middle aged man I wrote for advice He replied by a long letter of the most tender warning I had better not weaken my influence with my friend he wrote by going back suddenly or without her consent but I was to be very wary of going further there was fire about I tried to put this into practice by restraining myself constantly in our intercourse by refraining from caressing her for instance when I wanted to caress her and knew that she wanted it The only result seemed to be that the desire was more tormenting and constant than ever If at this point my friend had happened to die or go away and the incident had come to an end I should probably have been left nervous in these matters for years to come I should have faltered in the opinion I had always held that bodily expressions of love between women were as innocent as they were natural and I might have come nearer than I ever expected to the doctrine of those convent teachers who forbid their girls to embrace one another for fear an incalculable instinct should carry them to the edge of an abyss As it was after a while I said a little on the subject to my friend herself I had been inclined to think that she might share my anxiety but she did not share it at all She said to me that she did not like these thoughts that she cared for me more than She had ever done for any person except one now causing most of her unhappiness and wanted me in all possible ways and that it would make her sad to feel that I was trying not to want her in one way because I thought it was wrong On my part I knew very well how much she did need and want me I knew that in relations with others she was spending the greatest effort in following a course that I urged on her and was doing what I thought right in spite of the most painful pressure on her to do wrong and that she needed all the support and comfort I could give her It seemed to me after our conversation that the right path for me lay not in giving way to fears and scruples but in giving my friend straightforwardly all the love I could and all the kinds of love I could I decided to keep my eyes open for danger but meanwhile to go on We were living alone together at the time and thenceforward we did as we liked doing As soon as we could we moved to a bed where we could sleep together all night In the day when no one was there we sat as close together as we wished which was very close We kissed each other as often as we wanted to kiss each other which was very many times a day The results of this so far as I can see have been wholly good We love each other warmly but no temptation to nastiness has ever come and I cannot see now that it is at all likely to come With custom the localized physical excitement has practically disappeared and I am no longer obsessed by imagined embraces The spiritual side of our affection seems to have grown steadily stronger and more profitable since the physical side has been allowed to take its natural place A class in which homosexuality while fairly distinct is only slightly marked is formed by the women to whom the actively inverted woman is most attracted These women differ in the first place from the normal or average woman in that they are not repelled or disgusted by lover like advances from persons of their own sex They are not usually attractive to the average man though to this rule there are many exceptions Their faces may be plain or ill made but not seldom they possess good figures a point which is apt to carry more weight with the inverted woman than beauty of face Their sexual impulses are seldom well marked but they are of strongly affectionate nature On the whole they are women who are not very robust and well developed physically or nervously and who are not well adapted for child bearing but who still possess many excellent qualities and they are always womanly One may perhaps say that they are the pick of the women whom the average man would pass by No doubt this is often the reason why they are open to homosexual advances but I do not think it is the sole reason So far as they may be said to constitute a class they seem to possess a genuine though not precisely sexual preference for women over men and it is this coldness rather than lack of charm which often renders men rather indifferent to them The actively inverted woman usually differs from the woman of the class just mentioned in one fairly essential character a more or less distinct trace of masculinity She may not be and frequently is not what would be called a mannish woman for the latter may imitate men on grounds of taste and habit unconnected with sexual perversion while in the inverted woman the masculine traits are part of an organic instinct which she by no means always wishes to accentuate The inverted woman s masculine element may in the least degree consist only in the fact that she makes advances to the woman to whom she is attracted and treats all men in a cool direct manner which may not exclude comradeship but which excludes every sexual relationship whether of passion or merely of coquetry Usually the inverted woman feels absolute indifference toward men and not seldom repulsion And this feeling as a rule is instinctively reciprocated by men At the same time bisexual women are at least as common as bisexual men HISTORY XXXIV Miss S aged thirty eight living in a city of the United States a business woman of fine intelligence prominent in professional and literary circles Her general health is good but she belongs to a family in which there is a marked neuropathic element She is of rather phlegmatic temperament well poised always perfectly calm and self possessed rather retiring in disposition with gentle dignified bearing She says she cannot care for men but that all her life has been glorified and made beautiful by friendship with women whom she loves as a man loves women Her character is however well disciplined and her friends are not aware of the nature of her affections She tries not to give all her love to one person and endeavors as she herself expresses it to use this gift of loving as a stepping stone to high mental and spiritual attainments She is described by one who has known her for several years as having a high nature and instincts unerringly toward high things HISTORY XXXV Miss B artist of German ancestry on the paternal side Among her brothers and sisters one is of neurotic temperament and another is inverted She is herself healthy She has no repugnance to men and would even like to try marriage if the union were not permanent but she has seldom felt any sexual attraction to a man In one exceptional instance early in life realizing that she was not adapted for heterosexual relationships she broke off the engagement she had formed Much later in life she formed a more permanent relationship with a man of congenial tastes She is attracted to women of various kinds though she recognizes that there are some women to whom only men are attracted Many years since she had a friend to whom she was very strongly attached but the physical manifestations do not appear to have become pronounced After that her thoughts were much occupied by several women to whom she made advances which were not encouraged to pass beyond ordinary friendship In one case however she formed an intimate relationship with a girl somewhat younger than herself and a very feminine personality who accepted Miss B s ardent love with pleasure but in a passive manner and did not consider that the relationship would stand in the way of her marrying though she would on no account tell her husband The relationship for the first time aroused Miss B s latent sexual emotions She found sexual satisfaction in kissing and embracing her friend s body but there appeared to be no orgasm The relationship made a considerable change in her and rendered her radiant and happy In her behavior toward men Miss B reveals no sexual shyness Men are not usually attracted to her There is nothing striking in her appearance her person and manners though careless are not conspicuously man like She is fond of exercise and smokes a good deal HISTORY XXXVI Miss H aged thirty Among her paternal relatives there is a tendency to eccentricity and to nervous disease Her grandfather drank her father was eccentric and hypochondriacal and suffered from obsessions Her mother and mother s relatives are entirely healthy and normal in disposition At the age of four she liked to see the nates of a little girl who lived near When she was about six the nurse maid sitting in the fields used to play with her own parts and told her to do likewise saying it would make a baby come she occasionally touched herself in consequence but without producing any effect of any kind When she was about eight she used to see various nurse maids uncover their children s sexual parts and show them to each other She used to think about this when alone and also about whipping She never cared to play with dolls and in her games always took the part of a man Her first rudimentary sex feelings appeared at the age of eight or nine and were associated with dreams of whipping and being whipped which were most vivid between the ages of eleven and fourteen when they died away on the appearance of affection for girls She menstruated at twelve Her earliest affection at the age of thirteen was for a schoolfellow a graceful coquettish girl with long golden hair and blue eyes Her affection displayed itself in performing all sorts of small services for this girl in constantly thinking about her and in feeling deliciously grateful for the smallest return At the age of fourteen she had a similar passion for a girl cousin she used to look forward with ecstasy to her visits and especially to the rare occasions when the cousin slept with her her excitement was then so great that she could not sleep but there was no conscious sexual excitement At the age of fifteen or sixteen she fell in love with another cousin her experiences with this girl were full of delicious sensations if the cousin only touched her neck a thrill went through her body which she now regards as sexual Again at seventeen she had an overwhelming passionate fascination for a schoolfellow a pretty commonplace girl whom she idealized and etherealized to an extravagant extent This passion was so violent that her health was to some extent impaired but it was purely unselfish and there was nothing sexual in it On leaving school at the age of nineteen she met a girl of about the same age as herself very womanly but not much attracted to men This girl became very much attached to her and sought to gain her love After some time Miss H was attracted by this love partly from the sense of power it gave her and an intimate relation grew up This relation became vaguely physical Miss H taking the initiative but her friend desiring such relations and taking extreme pleasure in them they used to touch and kiss each other tenderly especially on the mons veneris with equal ardor They each experienced a strong pleasurable feeling in doing this and sexual erethism but no orgasm and it does not appear that this ever occurred Their general behavior to each other was that of lovers but they endeavored as far as possible to hide this fact from the world This relation lasted for several years and would have continued had not Miss H s friend from religious and moral scruples put an end to the physical relationship Miss H had been very well and happy during this relationship the interference with it seems to have exerted a disturbing influence and also to have aroused her sexual desires though she was still scarcely conscious of their real nature Soon afterward another girl of exceedingly voluptuous type made love to Miss H to which the latter yielded giving way to her feelings as well as to her love of domination She was afterward ashamed of this episode though the physical element in it had remained vague and indefinite Her remorse was so great that when her friend repenting her scruples implored her to let their relationship be on the same footing as of old Miss H in her return resisted every effort to restore the physical relation She kept to this resolution for some years and sought to divert her thoughts into intellectual channels When she again formed an intimate relationship it was with a congenial friend and lasted for several years She has never masturbated Occasionally but very rarely she has had dreams of riding accompanied by pleasurable sexual emotions she cannot recall any actual experience to suggest this though fond of riding She has never had any kind of sexual dreams about a man of late years she has occasionally had erotic dreams about women Her feeling toward men is friendly but she has never had sexual attraction toward a man She likes them as good comrades as men like each other She enjoys the society of men on account of their intellectual attraction She is herself very active in social and intellectual work Her feeling toward marriage has always been one of repugnance She can however imagine a man whom she could love or marry She is attracted to womanly women sincere reserved pure but courageous in character She is not attracted to intellectual women but at the same time cannot endure silly women The physical qualities that attract her most are not so much beauty of face as a graceful but not too slender body with beautiful curves The women she is drawn to are usually somewhat younger than herself Women are much attracted to her and without any effort on her part She likes to take the active part and protecting role with them She is herself energetic in character and with a somewhat neurotic temperament She finds sexual satisfaction in tenderly touching caressing and kissing the loved one s body There is no cunnilinctus which she regards with abhorrence She feels more tenderness than passion There is a high degree of sexual erethism when kissing but orgasm is rare and is produced by lying on the friend or by the friend lying on her without any special contact She likes being herself kissed but not so much as taking the active part She believes that homosexual love is morally right when it is really part of a person s nature and provided that the nature of homosexual love is always made plain to the object of such affection She does not approve of it as a mere makeshift or expression of sensuality in normal women She has sometimes resisted the sexual expression of her feelings once for years at a time but always in vain The effect on her of loving women is distinctly good she asserts both spiritually and physically while repression leads to morbidity and hysteria She has suffered much from neurasthenia at various periods but under appropriate treatment it has slowly diminished The inverted instinct is too deeply rooted to eradicate but it is well under control HISTORY XXXVII Miss M the daughter of English parents both musicians who were both of what is described as intense temperament and there is a neurotic element in the family though no history of insanity or alcoholism and she is herself free from nervous disease At birth she was very small In a portrait taken at the age of four the nose mouth and ears are abnormally large and she wears a little boy s hat As a child she did not care for dolls or for pretty clothes and often wondered why other children found so much pleasure in them As far back as my memory goes she writes I cannot recall a time when I was not different from other children I felt bored when other little girls came to play with me though I was never rough or boisterous in my sports Sewing was distasteful to her Still she cared little more for the pastimes of boys and found her favorite amusement in reading especially adventures and fairy tales She was always quiet timid and self conscious The instinct first made its appearance in the latter part of her eighth or the first part of her ninth year She was strongly attracted by the face of a teacher who used to appear at a side window on the second floor of the school building and ring a bell to summon the children to their classes The teacher s face seemed very beautiful but sad and she thought about her continually though not coming in personal contact with her A year later this teacher was married and left the school and the impression gradually faded away There was no consciousness of sex at this time she wrote no knowledge of sexual matters or practices and the feelings evoked were feelings of pity and compassion and tenderness for a person who seemed to be very sad and very much depressed It is this quality or combination of qualities which has always made the appeal in my own case I may go on for years in comparative peace when something may happen in spite of my busy practical life to call it all out The next feelings were experienced when she was about eleven years of age A young lady came to visit a next door neighbor and made so profound an impression on the child that she was ridiculed by her playmates for preferring to sit in a dark corner on the lawn where she might watch this young lady rather than to play games Being a sensitive child after this experience she was careful not to reveal her feelings to anyone She felt instinctively that in this she was different from others Her sense of beauty developed early but there was always an indefinable feeling of melancholy associated with it The twilight a dark night when the stars shone brightly these had a very depressing effect upon her but possessed a strong attraction nevertheless and pictures appealed to her At the age of twelve she fell in love with a schoolmate two years older than herself who was absorbed in the boys and never suspected this affection she wept bitterly because they could not be confirmed at the same time but feared to appear undignified and sentimental by revealing her feelings The face of this friend reminded her of one of Dolce s Madonnas which she loved Later on at the age of sixteen she loved another friend very dearly and devoted herself to her care There was a tinge of masculinity among the women of this friend s family but it is not clear if she can be termed inverted This was the happiest period of Miss M s life Upon the death of this friend who had long been in ill health eight years afterward she resolved never to let her heart go out to anyone again Specific physical gratification plays no part in these relationships The physical sexual feelings began to assert themselves at puberty but not in association with her ideal emotions In that connection she writes I would have considered such things a sacrilege I fought them and in a measure successfully The practice of self indulgence which might have become a daily habit was only occasional Her image evoked at such times drove away such feelings for which I felt a repugnance much preferring the romantic ideal feelings In this way quite unconscious of the fact that I was at all different from any other person I contrived to train myself to suppress or at least to dominate my physical sensations when they arose That is the reason why friendship and love have always seemed such holy and beautiful things to me I have never connected the two sets of feelings I think I am as strongly sexed as anyone but I am able to hold a friend in my arms and experience deep comfort and peace without having even a hint of physical sexual feeling Sexual expression may be quite necessary at certain times and right under certain conditions but I am convinced that free expression of affection along sentimental channels will do much to minimize the necessity for it along specifically sexual channels I have gone three months without the physical outlet The only time I was ever on the verge of nervous prostration was after having suppressed the instinct for ten months The other feelings which I do not consider as sexual feelings at all so fill my life in every department love literature poetry music professional and philanthropic activities that I am able to let the physical take care of itself When the physical sensations come it is usually when I am not thinking of a loved one at all I could dissipate them by raising my thought to that spiritual friendship I do not know if this was right and wise I know it is what occurred It seems a good thing to practise some sort of inhibition of the centers and acquire this kind of domination One bad result however was that I suffered much at times from the physical sensations and felt horribly depressed and wretched whenever they seemed to get the better of me I have been able she writes successfully to master the desire for a more perfect and complete expression of my feelings and I have done so without serious detriment to my health I love few people she writes again but in these instances when I have permitted my heart to go out to a friend I have always experienced most exalted feelings and have been made better by them morally mentally and spiritually Love is with me a religion With regard to her attitude toward the other sex she writes I have never felt a dislike for men but have good comrades among them During my childhood I associated with both girls and boys enjoying them all but wondering why the girls cared to flirt with boys Later in life I have had other friendships with men some of whom cared for me much to my regret for naturally I do not care to marry She is a musician and herself attributes her nature in part to artistic temperament She is of good intelligence and shows remarkable talent for various branches of physical science She is about five feet four inches in height and her features are rather large The pelvic measurements are normal and the external sexual organs are fairly normal in most respects though somewhat small At a period ten years subsequent to the date of this history further examination under anesthetics by a gynecologist showed no traces of ovary on one side The general conformation of the body is feminine But with arms palms up extended in front of her with inner sides of hands touching she cannot bring the inner sides of forearms together as nearly every woman can showing that the feminine angle of arm is lost She is left handed and shows a better development throughout on the left side She is quiet and dignified but has many boyish tricks of manner and speech which seem to be instinctive she tries to watch herself continually however in order to avoid them affecting feminine ways and feminine interests but always being conscious of an effort in so doing Miss M can see nothing wrong in her feelings and until at the age of twenty eight she came across the translation of Krafft Ebing s book she had no idea that feelings like mine were under the ban of society as he puts it or were considered unnatural and depraved She would like to help to bring light on the subject and to lift the shadow from other lives I emphatically protest she says against the uselessness and the inhumanity of attempts to cure inverts I am quite sure they have perfect right to live in freedom and happiness as long as they live unselfish lives One must bear in mind that it is the soul that needs to be satisfied and not merely the senses HISTORY XXXVIII Miss V aged thirty five Throughout early life up to adult age she was a mystery to herself and morbidly conscious of some fundamental difference between herself and other people There was no one she could speak to about this peculiarity In the effort to conquer it or to ignore it she became a hard student and has attained success in the profession she adopted A few years ago she came across a book on sexual inversion which proved to be a complete revelation to her of her own nature and by showing her that she was not an anomaly to be regarded with repulsion brought her comfort and peace She is willing that her experiences should be published for the sake of other women who may be suffering as in the past she has suffered I am a teacher in a college for women I am thirty four years old and of medium size Up to the age of thirty I looked much younger and since older than my age Until twenty one I had a strikingly child like appearance My physique has nothing masculine in it that I am aware of but I am conscious that my walk is mannish and I have very frequently been told that I do things such as sewing just like a man My voice is quite low but not coarse I dislike household work but am fond of sports gardening et cetera When so young that I cannot remember it I learned to whistle a practice at which I am still expert When a young girl I learned to smoke and should still enjoy it Several men have been good friends of mine but very few suitors I scarcely ever feel at ease with a man but women I understand and can nearly always make my friends I am of Scotch Irish descent My father s family were respectable prosperous religious people my mother s family only semi respectable hard livers shrewd but not intelligent industrious and money getting but fond of drinking and carousing There were many illegitimates among them Both grandmothers though of little education were unusual women Of my four maternal uncles three drank heavily When forty three my mother gave birth to me the youngest of eight children Of those who grew to adult years two seem quite normal sexually one is exceedingly erratic entirely unprincipled has been a thief and a forger is a probable bigamist and has betrayed several respectable women Aside from his having inordinate desire I know of no sexual abnormality Another brother married and a father as a boy was much given to infatuations for men I fancy this never went beyond infatuation and of late years has not been noticeable A third brother single though much courted by women on account of his good looks and personal charm is wholly unresponsive has no gallantry nor was ever to my knowledge a suitor He is however fond of the society of women especially those older than he He has a somewhat effeminate voice and walk Though he has begun of late years to smoke and drink a little these habits sit rather oddly upon him When a child one of his favorite make believe games was to pretend that he was a famous woman singer At school he was always found hanging around the older girls As a child I loved to stay in the fields refused to wear a sunbonnet used to pretend I was a boy climbed trees and played ball I liked to play with dolls but I did not fondle them or even make them dresses When my hair was clipped I was delighted and made everyone call me John I used to like to wear a man s broad brimmed hat and make corn cob pipes I was very fond of my father and tried to imitate him as much as possible Where animals were concerned I was entirely fearless I think I was not a sexually precocious child though I seem to have always known in a dim way that there were two sexes Very early I had a sense of shame at having my body exposed I remember on one occasion I could not be persuaded to undress before a young girl visitor At that time I must have been about three When I was four a neighbor who had often petted me took me on his lap and clasped my hand around his penis Though he was interrupted in a moment this made a lasting impression on me I had no physical sensation nor did I have any conception of the significance of the act Yet I had a slight feeling of repulsion and I must have dimly felt that it was wrong for I did not tell my mother I was not accustomed to confide in her for though truthful I was secretive At the age of five I commenced to attend a district school I remember that on my first day I was Greatly attracted by a little girl who wore a bright red dress My first definite knowledge of sex came in this way I was attending Sabbath school and had become ambitious to read the Bible through I had gotten as far as the account of the birth of Esau and Jacob which aroused my curiosity So I asked my mother the meaning of some word in the passage She seemed embarrassed and evaded my question This attitude stimulated my curiosity further and I re read the chapter until I understood it pretty well Later I was further enlightened by girl playmates I fancy I enjoyed listening to their talk and repeating what I knew on account of the mystery and secrecy with which sex subjects are surrounded rather than any sensual delight I cannot recall any act of mine growing directly from sexual feeling until I was ten years old Several other little girls and myself two or three times exposed private parts of our bodies to each other In one instance at least I was the instigator This act gave me some pleasure though no distinct physical sensation One incident I recall that happened when I was about ten A girl cousin and myself had been playing house together I do not recall what immediately led to it but we began to address each other as boys and tried to urinate through long tubes of some sort I also recall feeling a vague interest in this process in animals and observing them closely in the act From this time until I was about fourteen I grew ruder more boisterous and uncontrollable Prior to this I had been a quite tractable child When twelve I became interested in a boy in my grade at school and tried to attract him but failed Once at a children s party where we were playing kissing games I tried to get him to kiss me but he was unresponsive I do not recall bothering myself about him after that A year later I had a boy chum about whom my schoolmaster teased me I thought this ridiculous At the age of thirteen I menstruated a fact that caused me shame and anger Gradually I grew to feel myself peculiar why I cannot explain I did not seem to myself to be like other girls of my acquaintance I adopted as a defense a brusque and defiant air I spent a good deal of time playing alone in our backyard where I made a pair of stilts practised rope walking and such things At school I felt I was not liked by the nicer girls and began to associate with girls whom I now believe were immoral but whom I then supposed did nothing worse than talk in an obscene manner I copied their conversation and grew more reckless and uncontrollable The principal of the high school I was attending I learned afterward said I was the hardest pupil to control she had ever had About this time I read a book where a girl was represented as saying she had a boy s soul in a girl s body The applicability of this to myself struck me at once and I read the sentence to my mother who disgusted me by appearing shocked During this period I began to fall in love a practice which clung to me until I was nearly thirty years old I recall various older women with whom I became much enamored and one man Of these there was only one with whom I became acquainted well enough to show any affection another was a teacher and another was a young married woman at whom I used to gaze ardently during an entire church service Toward all my women teachers I had a somewhat sentimental attitude They stimulated me while the men gave me a wholly impersonal feeling This abnormal sentimentality may have been caused or at least was increased by the reading of novels some of a highly voluptuous nature I began to read novels at seven and from eleven to fourteen I absorbed a great many undesirable ones This lead to my picturing my future with a lover fancying myself in romantic scenes and being caressed and embraced I had always supposed I should marry When about five I decided that when I grew up I would marry a certain young man who used to come to our house Several years later he married to my real disappointment I had no affection for him but merely thought he would make a desirable husband During my unhappy adolescence I heard that a former playmate was going to visit at my home I began to look forward to the visit with much eagerness and at her arrival was much excited I wished to stay alone with her and to caress her and when we slept together I pressed my body against her in a sensual manner which act she permitted but without passion I was greatly excited and could scarcely sleep This was the first time I had acted in such a way and after she left I felt shame and dislike for her At future meetings there was never the least sensuality we never referred to the first visit and are still friends though not intimate A diary which I kept during my fourteenth and fifteenth years is filled with romantic sentiments and endearing terms applied successively to three girls of my own age I had but a speaking acquaintance with them but I was strongly infatuated with all One boy was also the object of adoration During my thirteenth year I became for a time very religious and devoted to religious exercises This passed and by my fourteenth year I had become heretical but was still keenly sensitive to religious influences When barely sixteen I slept one night with a woman of low morals She acted toward me in a sensual manner and aroused my sexual feelings I felt at the time that this was a sin but I was carried away by passion Afterward I hated this woman and despised myself I then went away to a company educational boarding school Here for the first time I became happy A girl of my own age of fine character and noticeable refinement fell in love with me and caused me to reciprocate On retrospection I believe this to have been a genuine and beautiful love on both sides After a few months however our relation at my initiative and against my friend s will became a physical one We expressed our affection by mutual caresses close embraces and lying on each other s bodies I sometimes touched her sexual organs sensually All this contact gave me exquisite thrills After three years we had a misunderstanding and separated I was greatly grieved and troubled for many years and came to regret greatly the physical relationship that had existed between us My friend at length fell in love and married I had several other slighter infatuations for women was courted by several men to whom I remained cold and bored except in one instance where I was somewhat touched and finally found a lasting friendship with a woman who had fallen deeply in love with me in her school days and had never been able to care for any one else She is a woman of considerable literary talent and of good general ability and high ideals She is usually much liked by men Her love for me is the most real thing in the world for me and seems the most permanent At first my feeling for her was almost purely physical although there were no sexual relations I hated this feeling and have succeeded in overcoming it pretty largely At times after long separations we have embraced with great passion at least on my part This has always had a bad physical effect on me At present however it very rarely occurs We both consider sexual feelings degrading and deleterious to real love Whether at any time we have had complete physical satisfaction or gratification I hardly know I have experienced very keen physical pleasure mingled with what I took to be great mental exaltation and quickening of the emotions This condition was brought about by close contact with the body of my friend usually by lying upon it But if by gratification it is meant that desire having been completely satisfied ceases temporarily I think I have never had that experience If I did it was when I was about eighteen when I lived with a girl friend in intimate relations Of late years at any rate it has never happened to me and an embrace however close always leaves me with a desire for a closer union both physical and spiritual So a few years since I came to the conclusion that it was impossible to obtain physical satisfaction through the woman I loved I came to this conclusion because of the bad physical effects of contact My sexual organs became highly sensitive and inflamed and I suffered pain from the inflammation and resulting leucorrhea Should I allow myself to indulge in caresses this condition would return My friend fortunately though very affectionate and demonstrative toward me has very little sexual passion The idea that our relationship is based upon it is very repugnant to her I was at one time a few years since much discouraged and almost hopeless of being able to overcome my appetite and I decided that we could not associate unless I succeeded At present with help I have very largely succeeded in living with my friend on a basis of normal though affectionate and tender companionship I have been helped more and have learned more through this companionship than through anything else The keen pleasure that I have felt when in responsive contact I never experienced in masturbation So far as I remember it never took place till I was well along in my teens and was never an habitual practice except the first summer I was separated from a school friend whom I loved Thoughts of her aroused feelings which I attempted to satisfy in this way but the entire sensuality of the act soon led me to refrain and to see that that was not what I wanted A peculiar incident that might have some significance occurred to me about five years ago I was sitting in a small room where a seminar was being conducted The leader of the discussion was a man about fifty whom I looked up to on account of his attainments and respected as a man though I knew him socially very slightly I had lost a night s sleep from toothache and was feeling nervous I was giving my entire attention to the subject in hand when suddenly I felt a very strong physical compulsion toward that man I did not know what I was going to do but I felt on the point of losing all control of myself I was afraid to leave for fear the slightest movement would throw me into a panic The attraction was entirely physical and like nothing I had felt before And I had a strange feeling that its cause was in the man himself that he was willing it I was like a spectator It was some moments before the assemblage broke up when my possession completely disappeared and never recurred Regarding dreams I will say that not until the past year or two have I been conscious of having clear cut dreams with definite happenings They seemed usually to leave only vague impressions such as a feeling that I had been riding horseback or trying to perform some hard task Sexual dreams I do not recall having had for several years except that occasionally I am awakened by a feeling of uncomfortable sexual desire which seems usually caused by a need to urinate Between the ages of seventeen and twenty two approximately I frequently perhaps several times a month would have vague sexual dreams These always I think occurred when I happened to be sleeping with someone whom in my dream I would mistake for my intimate friend and would awaken myself by embracing my bedfellow with sometimes a slight sometimes considerable degree of passion I have finally arrived at some understanding of my own temperament and am no longer miserable and melancholy I regret that I am not a man because I could then have a home and children HISTORY XXXIX Miss D actively engaged in the practice of her profession aged forty Heredity good nervous system sound general health on the whole satisfactory Development feminine but manner and movements somewhat boyish Menstruation scanty and painless Hips normal nates small sexual organs showing some approximation toward infantile type with large labia minora and probably small vagina Tendency to development of hair on body and especially lower limbs The narrative is given in her own words Ever since I can remember anything at all I could never think of myself as a girl and I was in perpetual trouble with this as the real reason When I was five or six years old I began to say to myself that whatever anyone said if I was not a boy at any rate I was not a girl This has been my unchanged conviction all through my life When I was little nothing ever made me doubt it in spite of external appearance I regarded the conformation of my body as a mysterious accident I could not see why it should have anything to do with the matter The things that really affected the question were my own likes and dislikes and the fact that I was not allowed to follow them I was to like the things which belonged to me as a girl frocks and toys and games which I did not like at all I fancy I was more strongly boyish than the ordinary little boy When I could only crawl my absorbing interest was hammers and carpet nails Before I could walk I begged to be put on horses backs so that I seem to have been born with the love of tools and animals which has never left me I did not play with dolls though my little sister did I was often reproached for not playing her games I always chose boys toys tops and guns and horses I hated being kept indoors and was always longing to go out By the time I was seven it seemed to me that everything I liked was called wrong for a girl I left off telling my elders what I did like They confused and wearied me by their talk of boys and girls I did not believe them and could hardly imagine that they believed themselves By the time I was eight or nine I used to wonder whether they were dupes or liars or hypocrites or all three I never believed or trusted a grown person in consequence I led my younger brothers in everything I was not at all a happy little child and often cried and was made irritable I was so confused by the talk about boys and girls I was held up as an evil example to other little girls who virtuously despised me When I was about nine years old I went to a day school and began to have a better time From nine to thirteen I practically shaped my own life I learned very little at school and openly hated it but I read a great deal at home and got plenty of ideas I lived however mainly out of doors whenever I could get out I spent all my pocket money on tools rabbits pigeons and many other animals I became an ardent pigeon catcher not to say thief though I did not knowingly steal My brothers were as devoted to the animals as I was The men were supposed to look after them but we alone did so We observed mated separated and bred them with considerable skill We had no language to express ourselves but one of our own We were absolutely innocent and sweetly sympathetic with every beast I don t think we ever connected their affairs with those of human beings but as I do not remember the time when I did not know all about the actual facts of sex and reproduction I presume I learned it all in that way and life never had any surprises for me in that direction Though I saw many sights that a child should not have seen while running about wild I never gave them a thought all animals great and small from rabbits to men had the same customs all natural and right My initiation here was in my eyes as nearly perfect as a child s should be I never asked grown people questions I thought all those in charge of me coarse and untruthful and I disliked all ugly things and suggestions Every half holiday I went out with the boys from my brothers school They always liked me to play with them and though not pleasant tongued boys were always civil and polite to me I organized games and fortifications that they would never have imagined for themselves led storming parties and instituted some rather dangerous games of a fighting kind I taught my brothers to throw stones Sometimes I led adventures such as breaking into empty houses I liked being out after dark In the winter I made and rigged boats and went sailing them and I went rafting and pole leaping I became a very good jumper and climber could go up a rope bowl overhand throw like a boy and whistle three different ways I collected beetles and butterflies and went shrimping and learned to fish I had very little money to spend but I picked things up and I made all traps nets cages et cetera myself I learned from every working man I could get hold of the use of all ordinary carpenters tools and how to weld hot iron pave lay bricks and turf and so on When I was about eleven my parents got more mortified at my behavior and perpetually threatened me with a boarding school I was told for months how it would take the nonsense out of me shape me turn me into a young lady My going was finally announced to me as a punishment to me for being what I was Certainly the horror of going to this school and the cruel and unsympathetic way that I was sent there gave me a shock that I never got over The only thing that reconciled me to going was my intense indignation with those who sent me I appealed to be allowed to learn Latin and boys subjects but was laughed at I was so helpless that I knew I could not run away without being caught or I would have run away anywhere from home and school I never cried or fretted but burnt with anger and went like a trapped rabbit In no words can I describe the severity of the nervous shock or the suffering of my first year at school The school was noted for its severity and I heard that at one period the elder girls ran away so often that they wore a uniform dress I knew two who had run away The teachers in my time were ignorant self indulgent women who cared nothing for the girls or their education and made much money out of them There was a suspicious reformatory atmosphere and my money was taken from me and my letters read I was intensely shy I hated the other girls There were no refinements anywhere I had no privacy in my room which was always overcrowded we had no hot water no baths improper food and no education We were not allowed to wear enough clean linen and for five years I never felt clean I never had one moment to myself was not allowed to read anything had even not enough lesson books was taught nothing to speak of except a little inferior music and drawing I never got enough exercise and was always tired and dull and could not keep my digestion in order My pride and self respect were degraded in innumerable ways I suffered agonies of disgust and the whole thing was a dreary penal servitude I did not complain I made friends with a few of the girls Some of the older girls were attracted to me Some talked of men and love affairs to me but I was not greatly interested No one ever spoke of any other matters of sex to me or in my hearing but most of the girls were shy with me and I with them In about two years time the teachers got to like me and thought me one of their nicest girls I certainly influenced them and got them to allow the girls more privileges I lay great stress upon the physical privations and disgust that I felt during these years The mental starvation was not quite so great because it was impossible for them to crush my mind as they did my body That it all materially aided to arrest the development of my body I am certain It is difficult to estimate sexual influences of which as a child I was practically unaware I certainly admired the liveliest and cleverest girls and made friends with them and disliked the common lumpy uneducated type that made two thirds of my companions The lively girls liked me and I made several nice friends whom I have kept ever since One girl of about fifteen took a violent liking for me and figuratively speaking licked the dust from my shoes I would never take any notice of her When I was nearly sixteen one of my teachers began to notice me and be very kind to me She was twenty years older than I was She seemed to pity my loneliness and took me out for walks and sketching and encouraged me to talk and think It was the first time in my life that anyone had ever sympathized with me or tried to understand me and it was a most beautiful thing to me I felt like an orphan child who had suddenly acquired a mother and through her I began to feel less antagonistic to grown people and to feel the first respect I had ever felt for what they said She petted me into a state of comparative docility and made the other teachers like and trust me My love for her was perfectly pure and I thought of her s as simply maternal She never roused the least feeling in me that I can think of as sexual I liked her to touch me and she sometimes held me in her arms or let me sit on her lap At bedtime she used to come and say good night and kiss me upon the mouth I think now that what she did was injudicious to a degree and I wish I could believe it was as purely unselfish and kind as it seemed to me then After I had left school I wrote to her and visited her during a few years Once she wrote to me that if I could give her employment she would come and live with me Once when she was ill with neurasthenia her friends asked me to go to the seaside with her which I did Here she behaved in an extraordinary way becoming violently jealous over me with another elderly friend of mine who was there I could hardly believe my senses and was so astonished and disgusted that I never went near her again She also accused me of not being loyal to her to this day I have no idea what she meant She then wrote and asked me what was wrong between us and I replied that after the words she had had with me my confidence in her was at an end It gave me no particular pang as I had by this time outgrown the simple gratitude of my childish days and not replaced it by any stronger feeling All my life I have had the profoundest repugnance to having any words with other women I was much less interested in sex matters than other children of my age I was altogether less precocious though I knew more I imagine than other girls Nevertheless by the time I was fifteen social matters had begun to interest me greatly It is difficult to say how this happened as I was forbidden all books and newspapers except in my holidays when I had generally a reading orgy though not the books I needed or wanted I had abundant opportunities for speculation but no materials for any profitable thinking Dreaming was forced upon me I dreamed fairy tales by night and social dreams by day In the nightdreams sometimes in the day dreams I was always the prince or the pirate rescuing beauty in distress or killing the unworthy I had one dream which I dreamed over and over again and enjoyed and still sometimes dream In this I was always hunting and fighting often in the dark there was usually a woman or a princess whom I admired somewhere in the background but I have never really seen her Sometimes I was a stowaway on board ship or an Indian hunter or a backwoodsman making a log cabin for my wife or rather some companion My daythoughts were not about the women round about me or even about the one who was so kind to me they were almost impersonal I went on at any rate from myself to what I thought the really ideal and built up a very beautiful vision of solid human friendship in which there was everything that was strong and wholesome on either side but very little of sex To imagine this in its fullness I had to imagine all social family and educational conditions vastly different from anything I had come across From this my thoughts ran largely on social matters In whatever direction my thoughts ran I always surveyed them from the point of view of a boy I was trying to wait patiently till I could escape from slavery and starvation and trying to keep the open mind I have spoken of though I never opened a book of poetry or a novel or a history but I slipped naturally back into my non girl s attitude and read it through my own eyes All my surface life was a sham and only through books which were few did I ever see the world naturally A consideration of social matters led me to feel very sorry for women whom I regarded as made by a deliberate process of manufacture into the fools I thought they were and by the same process that I myself was being made one I felt more and more that men were to be envied and women pitied I lay stress on this for it started in me a deliberate interest in women as women I began to feel protective and kindly toward women and children and to excuse women from their responsibility for calamities such as my school career I never imagined that men required or would have thanked me for any sort of sympathy But it came about in these ways and without the least help that I can trace that by the time I was nineteen years of age I was keenly interested in all kinds of questions pity for downtrodden women suffrage questions marriage laws questions of liberty freedom of thought care of the poor views of Nature and Man and God All these things filled my mind to the exclusion of individual men and women As soon as I left school I made a headlong plunge into books where these things were treated I had the answers to everything to find after a long period of enforced starvation I had to work for my knowledge No books or ideas came near me but what I went in search of Another thing that helped me to take an expansive view of life at this time was my intense love of Nature All birds and animals affected me by their beauty and grace and I have always kept a profound sympathy with them as well as some subtle understanding which enables me to tame them at times remarkably I not only loved all other creatures but I believed that men and women were the most beautiful things in the universe and I would rather look at them unclothed than on any other thing as my greatest pleasure I was prepared to like them because they were beautiful When the time came for me to leave school I rather dreaded it chiefly because I dreaded my life at home I had a great longing at this time to run away and try my fortune anywhere possibly if I had been stronger I might have done so But I was in very poor health through the physical crushing I had had and in very poor spirits through this and my mental repression I still knew myself a prisoner and I was bitterly disappointed and ashamed at having no education I afterward had myself taught arithmetic and other things The next period of my life which covered about six years was not less important to my development and was a time of extreme misery to me It found me on leaving school almost a child This time between eighteen and twenty four should I think count as my proper period of puberty which probably in most children occupies the end years of their school life It was at this time that I began to make a good many friends of my own and to become aware of psychical and sexual attractions I had never come across any theories on the subject but I decided that I must belong to a third sex of some kind I used to wonder if I was like the neuter bees I knew physical and psychical sex feeling and yet I seemed to know it quite otherwise from other men and women I asked myself if I could endure living a woman s life bearing children and doing my duty by them I asked myself what hiatus there could be between my bodily structure and my feelings and also what was the meaning of the strong physical feelings which had me in their grip without choice of my own Experience of physical sex sensations first began about sixteen in sleep masturbation was accidentally discovered at the age of nineteen abandoned at twenty eight and then at thirty four deliberately resumed as a method of purely physical relief These three things simply would not be reconciled and I said to myself that I must find a way of living in which there was as little sex of any kind as possible There was something that I simply lacked that I never doubted Curiously enough I thought that the ultimate explanation might be that there were men s minds in women s bodies but I was more concerned in finding a way of life than in asking riddles without answers I thought that one day when I had money and opportunity I would dress in men s clothes and go to another country in order that I might be unhampered by sex considerations and conventions I determined to live an honorable upright but simple life I had no idea at first that homosexual attractions in women existed afterward observations on the lower animals put the idea into my head I made no preparation in my mind for any sexual life though I thought it would be a dreary business repressing my body all my days My relations with other women were entirely pure My attitude toward my sexual physical feelings was one of reserve and repression and I think the growing conviction of my radical deficiency somewhere would have made intimate affection for anyone with any demonstration in it a kind of impropriety for which I had no taste However between twenty one and twenty four other things happened to me During these few years I saw plenty of men and plenty of women As regards the men I liked them very well but I never thought the man would turn up with whom I should care to live Several men were very friendly with me and three in particular used to write me letters and give me much of their confidence I invited two of them to visit at my house All these men talked to me with freedom and even told me about their sexual ideas and doings One asked me to believe that he was leading a good life the other two owned that they were not One discussed the question of homosexuality with me he has never married I liked one of them a good deal being attracted by his softness and gentleness and almost feminine voice It was hoped that I would take to him and he very cautiously made love to me I allowed him to kiss me a few times and wrote him a few responsive letters wondering what I liked in him Someone then commented on the acquaintance and said marriage and I woke up to the fact that I did not really want him at all I think he found the friendship too insipid and was glad to be out of it All these men were a trifle feminine in characteristics and two played no games I thought it odd that they should all express admiration for the very boyish qualities in me that other people disliked A fourth man something of the same type told another friend that he always felt surprised at how freely he was able to talk to me but that he never could feel that I was a woman Two of these were brilliantly clever men two were artists At the same period or earlier I made a number of women friends and of course saw more of them I chose out some and some chose me I think I attracted them as much as or even more than they attracted me I do not quite remember if this was so though I can say for certain that it was so at school There were three or four bright clever young women whom I got to know then with whom I was great friends We were interested in books social theories politics art Sometimes I visited them or we went on exploring expeditions to many country places or towns They all in the end either had love affairs or married I know that in spite of all our free conversations they never talked to me as they did to each other we were always a little shy with each other But I got very fond of at least four of them I admired them and when I was tired and worried I often thought how easily if I had been a man I could have married and settled down with one or the other I used to think it would be delightful to have a woman to work for and take care of My attraction to these women was very strong but I don t think they knew it I seldom even kissed them but I should often have cheerfully given them a good hugging and kissing if I had thought it a right or proper thing to do I never wanted them to kiss me half so much as I wanted to kiss them In these years I felt this with every woman I admired Occasionally I experienced slight erections when close to other women I am sure that no deliberate thought of mine caused them and as I had them at other times too when I was not expecting them I think it may have been accidental What I felt with my mind and what I felt with my body always at this time seemed apart I cannot accurately describe the interest and attraction that women then were to me I only know I never felt anything like it for men All my feelings of desire to do kindnesses to give presents to be liked and respected and all such natural small matters referred to women not to men and at this time both openly and to myself I said unhesitatingly that I liked women best It must be remembered that at this time a dislike for men was being fostered in me by those who wanted me to marry and this must have counted for more than I now remember As regards my physical sexual feelings which were well established during these few years I don t think I often indulged in any erotic imaginations worth estimating but so far as I did at all I always imagined myself as a man loving a woman I cannot recall ever imagining the opposite but I seldom imagined anything at all and I suppose ultimate sex sensations know no sex But as time went on and my physical and psychical feelings met at any rate in my own mind I became fully aware of the meaning of love and even of homosexual possibilities I should probably have thought more of this side of things except that during this time I was so worried by the difficulty of living in my home under the perpetual friction of comparison with other people My life was a sham I was an actor never off the boards I had to play at being a something I was not front morning till night and I had no cessation of the long fatigue I had had at school in addition I had sex to deal with actively and consciously Looking back on these twenty four years of my life I only look back on a round of misery The nervous strain was enormous and so was the moral strain Instead of a child I felt myself whenever I desired to please anyone else a performing monkey My pleasures were stolen or I was snubbed for taking them I was not taught and was called a fool My hand was against everybody s How it was that with my high spirits and vivid imagination I did not grow up a moral imbecile full of perverted instincts I do not know I describe myself as a docile child but I was full of temptations to be otherwise There were times when I was silent before people but if I had had a knife in my hand I could have stuck it into them If it had been desired to make me a thoroughly perverted being I can imagine no better way than the attempt to mould me by force into a particular pattern of girl Looking at my instincts in my first childhood and my mental confusion over myself I do not believe the most sympathetic and scientific treatment would have turned me into an average girl but I see no reason why proper physical conditions should not have induced a better physical development and that in its turn have led to tastes more approximate to those of the normal woman That I do not even now desire to be a normal woman is not to the point Instead of any such help I suffered during the time that should have been puberty from a profound mental and physical shock which was extended over several years and in addition I suffered from the outrage of every fine and wholesome feeling I had These things by checking my physical development gave I am perfectly convinced a traumatic impetus to my general abnormality and this was further kept up by demanding of me at the dawn of my real sexual activity and when still practically a child an interest in men and marriage which I was no more capable of feeling than any ordinary boy or girl of fifteen If you had taken a boy of thirteen and given him all my conditions bound him hand and foot when you became afraid of him petted him into docility and then placed him in the world and while urging normal sexuality upon him on the one hand made him disgusted with it on the other what would have been the probable result Looking back I can only say I think the results in my own case were marvellously good and that I was saved from worse by my own innocence and by the physical backwardness which nature probably in mercy bestowed upon me I find it difficult to sum up the way in which I affect other women and they me I can only record my conviction that I do affect a large number whether abnormally or not I don t know but I attract them and it would be easy for some of them to become very fond of me if I gave them a chance They are also I am certain more shy with me than they are with other women I find it difficult also to sum up their effect on me I only know that some women attract me and some tempt me physically and have done ever since I was about twenty two or twenty three I know that psychically I have always been more interested in women than in men but have not considered them the best companions or confidants I feel protective towards them never feel jealous of them and hate having differences with them And I feel always that I am not one of them If there had been any period in my life when health and temptation and money and opportunity had made homosexual relations easy I cannot say how I should have resisted I think that I have never had any such relations simply because I have in a way been safeguarded from them For a long time I thought I must do without all actual sexual relations and acted up to that If I had thought any relations right and possible I think I should have striven for heterosexual experiences because of the respect that I had cultivated indeed I think always had for the normal and natural If I had thought it right to indulge any sort of gratification which was within my reach I think I might probably have chosen the homosexual as being perhaps more satisfying and more convenient I always wanted love and friendship first later I should have been glad of something to satisfy my sex hunger too but by that time I could have done without it or I thought so At a period rather later than that dealt with in this narrative the subject of it became strongly attracted to a man who was of somewhat feminine and abnormal disposition But on consideration she decided that it would not be wise to marry him The commonest characteristic of the sexually inverted woman is a certain degree of masculinity or boyishness As I have already pointed out transvestism in either women or men by no means necessarily involves inversion In the volume of Women Adventurers edited by missus Norman for the Adventure Series there is no trace of inversion in most of these cases indeed love for a man was precisely the motive for adopting male garments and manners Again Colley Cibber s daughter Charlotte Charke a boyish and vivacious woman who spent much of her life in men s clothes and ultimately wrote a lively volume of memoirs appears never to have been attracted to women though women were often attracted to her believing her to be a man it is indeed noteworthy that women seem with special frequency to fall in love with disguised persons of their own sex one hundred sixty six There is however a very pronounced tendency among sexually inverted women to adopt male attire when practicable In such cases male garments are not usually regarded as desirable chiefly on account of practical convenience nor even in order to make an impression on other women but because the wearer feels more at home in them Thus Moll mentions the case of a young governess of sixteen who while still unconscious of her sexual perversion used to find pleasure when everyone was out of the house in putting on the clothes of a youth belonging to the family Cases have been recorded of inverted women who spent the greater part of their lives in men s clothing and been generally regarded as men I may cite the case of Lucy Ann Slater alias the reverend Joseph Lobdell recorded by Wise Alienist and Neurologist eighteen eighty three She was masculine in character features and attire In early life she married and had a child but had no affection for her husband who eventually left her As usual in such cases her masculine habits appeared in early childhood She was expert with the rifle lived the life of a trapper and hunter among the Indians and was known as the Female Hunter of Long Eddy She published a book regarding those experiences I have not been able to see it but it is said to be quaint and well written She regarded herself as practically a man and became attached to a young woman of good education who had also been deserted by her husband The affection was strong and emotional and of course without deception It was interrupted by her recognition and imprisonment as a vagabond but on the petition of her wife she was released I may be a woman in one sense she said but I have peculiar organs which make me more a man than a woman She alluded to an enlarged clitoris which she could erect she said as a turtle protrudes its head but there was no question of its use in coitus She was ultimately brought to the asylum with paroxysmal attacks of exaltation and erotomania without self abuse apparently and corresponding periods of depression and she died with progressive dementia I may also mention the case briefly recorded in the Lancet February twenty two eighteen eighty four of a person called John Coulter who was employed for twelve years as a laborer by the Belfast Harbor Commissioners When death resulted from injuries caused in falling down stairs it was found that this person was a woman She was fifty years of age and had apparently spent the greater part of her life as a man When employed in early life as a manservant on a farm she had married her mistress s daughter The pair were married for twenty nine years but during the last six years lived apart owing to the husband s dissipated habits No one ever suspected her sex She was of masculine appearance and good muscular development The wife took charge of the body and buried it A more recent case of the same kind is that of Murray Hall who died in New York in nineteen oh one Her real name was Mary Anderson and she was born at Govan in Scotland Early left an orphan on the death of her only brother she put on his clothes and went to Edinburgh working as a man Her secret was discovered during an illness and she finally went to America where she lived as a man for thirty years making money and becoming somewhat notorious as a Tammany politician a rather riotous man about town The secret was not discovered till her death when it was a complete revelation even to her adopted daughter She married twice the first marriage ended in separation but the second marriage seemed to have been happy for it lasted twenty years when the wife died She associated much with pretty girls and was very jealous of them She seems to have been slight and not very masculine in general build with a squeaky voice but her ways attitude and habits were all essentially masculine She associated with politicians drank somewhat to excess though not heavily swore a great deal smoked and chewed tobacco sang ribald songs could run dance and fight like a man and had divested herself of every trace of feminine daintiness She wore clothes that were always rather too large in order to hide her form baggy trousers and an overcoat even in summer She is said to have died of cancer of the breast I quote from an account which appears to be reliable contained in the Weekly Scotsman February nine nineteen oh one Another case described in the London papers is that of Catharine Coome who for forty years successfully personated a man and adopted masculine habits generally She married a lady s maid with whom she lived for fourteen years Having latterly adopted a life of fraud her case gained publicity as that of the man woman In nineteen oh one the death on board ship was recorded of Miss Caroline Hall of Boston a water color painter who had long resided in Milan Three years previously she discarded female dress and lived as husband to a young Italian lady also an artist whom she had already known for seven years She called herself mister Hall and appeared to be a thoroughly normal young man able to shoot with a rifle and fond of manly sports The officers of the ship stated that she smoked and drank heartily joked with the other male passengers and was hail fellow well met with everyone Death was due to advanced tuberculosis of the lungs hastened by excessive drinking and smoking Ellen Glenn alias Ellis Glenn a notorious swindler who came prominently before the public in Chicago during nineteen oh five was another man woman of large and masculine type She preferred to dress as a man and had many love escapades with women She can fiddle as well as anyone in the State said a man who knew her can box like a pugilist and can dance and play cards In Seville a few years ago an elderly policeman who had been in attendance on successive governors of that city for thirty years was badly injured in a street accident He was taken to the hospital and the doctor there discovered that the policeman was a woman She went by the name of Fernando Mackenzie and during the whole of her long service no suspicion whatever was aroused as to her sex She was French by birth born in Paris in eighteen thirty six but her father was English and her mother Spanish She assumed her male disguise when she was a girl and served her time in the French army then emigrated to Spain at the age of thirty five and contrived to enter the Madrid police force disguised as a man She married there and pretended that her wife s child was her own son She removed to Seville still serving as a policeman and was engaged there as cook and orderly at the governor s palace She served seven successive governors In consequence of the discovery of her sex she has been discharged from the police without the pension due to her her wife had died two years previously and Fernando spent all she possessed on the woman s funeral Mackenzie had a soft voice a refined face with delicate features and was neatly dressed in male attire When asked how she escaped detection so long she replied that she always lived quietly in her own house with her wife and did her duty by her employers so that no one meddled with her In Chicago in nineteen oh six much attention was attracted to the case of Nicholai de Raylan confidential secretary to the Russian Consul who at death of tuberculosis at the age of thirty three was found to be a woman She was born in Russia and was in many respects very feminine small and slight in build but was regarded as a man and even as very manly by both men and women who knew her intimately She was always very neat in dress fastidious in regard to shirts and ties and wore a long waisted coat to disguise the lines of her figure She was married twice in America being divorced by the first wife after a union lasting ten years on the ground of cruelty and misconduct with chorus girls The second wife a chorus girl who had been previously married and had a child was devoted to her husband Both wives were firmly convinced that their husband was a man and ridiculed the idea that he could be a woman I am informed that De Raylan wore a very elaborately constructed artificial penis In her will she made careful arrangements to prevent detection of sex after death but these were frustrated as she died in a hospital In saint Louis in nineteen oh nine the case was brought forward of a young woman of twenty two who had posed as a man for nine years Her masculine career began at the age of thirteen after the Galveston flood which swept away all her family She was saved and left Texas dressed as a boy She worked in livery stables in a plough factory and as a bill poster At one time she was the adopted son of the family in which she lived and had no difficulty in deceiving her sisters by adoption as to her sex On coming to saint Louis in nineteen oh two she made chairs and baskets at the American Rattan Works associating with fellow workmen on a footing of masculine equality One day a workman noticed the extreme smallness and dexterity of her hands Gee Bill you should have been a girl How do you know I m not she retorted In such ways her ready wit and good humor always disarmed suspicion as to her sex She shunned no difficulties in her work or in her sports we are told and never avoided the severest tests She drank she swore she courted girls she worked as hard as her fellows she fished and camped she told stories with the best of them and she did not flinch when the talk grew strong She even chewed tobacco Girls began to fall in love with the good looking boy at an early period and she frequently boasted of her feminine conquests with one girl who worshipped her there was a question of marriage On account of lack of education she was restricted to manual labor and she often chose hard work At one time she became a boiler maker s apprentice wielding a hammer and driving in hot rivets Here she was very popular and became local secretary of the International Brotherhood of Boiler makers In physical development she was now somewhat of an athlete She could outrun any of her friends on a sprint she could kick higher play baseball and throw the ball overhand like a man and she was fond of football As a wrestler she could throw most of the club members The physician who examined her for an insurance policy remarked You are a fine specimen of physical manhood young fellow Take good care of yourself Finally in a moment of weakness she admitted her sex and returned to the garments of womanhood In London in nineteen twelve a servant girl of twenty three was charged in the Acton Police Court with being disorderly and masquerading having assumed man s clothes and living with another girl taller and more handsome than herself as husband and wife She had had slight brain trouble as a child and was very intelligent with a too active brain in her spare time she had written stories for magazines The two girls became attached through doing Christian social work together in their spare time and resolved to live as husband and wife to prevent any young man from coming forward The husband became a plumber s mate and displayed some skill at fisticuffs when at length discovered by the wife s brother Hence her appearance in the Police Court Both girls were sent back to their friends and situations found for them as day servants But as they remained devoted to each other arrangements were made for them to live together Another case that may be mentioned is that of Cora Anderson the man woman of Milwaukee who posed for thirteen years as a man and during that period lived with two women as her wives without her disguise being penetrated Her Confessions were published in the Day Book of Chicago during May nineteen fourteen It would be easy to bring forward other cases A few instances of marriage between women will be found in the Alienist and Neurologist Nov nineteen oh two p four hundred ninety seven In all such cases more or less fraud has been exercised I know of one case probably unique in which the ceremony was gone through without any deception on any side a congenitally inverted Englishwoman of distinguished intellectual ability now dead was attached to the wife of a clergyman who in full cognizance of all the facts of the case privately married the two ladies in his own church When they still retain female garments these usually show some traits of masculine simplicity and there is nearly always a disdain for the petty feminine artifices of the toilet Even when this is not obvious there are all sorts of instinctive gestures and habits which may suggest to female acquaintances the remark that such a person ought to have been a man The brusque energetic movements the attitude of the arms the direct speech the inflexions of the voice the masculine straightforwardness and sense of honor and especially the attitude toward men free from any suggestion either of shyness or audacity will often suggest the underlying psychic abnormality to a keen observer In the habits not only is there frequently a pronounced taste for smoking cigarettes often found in quite feminine women but also a decided taste and toleration for cigars There is also a dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework and other domestic occupations while there is often some capacity for athletics As regards the general bearing of the inverted woman in its most marked and undisguised form I may quote an admirable description by Prof Zuccarelli of Naples of an unmarried middle class woman of thirty five While retaining feminine garments her bearing is as nearly as possible a man s She wears her thin hair thrown carelessly back alla Umberto and fastened in a simple knot at the back of her head The breasts are little developed and compressed beneath a high corset her gown is narrow without the expansion demanded by fashion Her straw hat with broad plaits is perhaps adorned by a feather or she wears a small hat like a boy s She does not carry an umbrella or sunshade and walks out alone refusing the company of men or she is accompanied by a woman as she prefers offering her arm and carrying the other hand at her waist with the air of a fine gentleman In a carriage her bearing is peculiar and unlike that habitual with women Seated in the middle of the double seat her knees being crossed or else the legs well separated with a virile air and careless easy movements she turns her head in every direction finding an acquaintance here and there with her eye saluting men and women with a large gesture of the hand as a business man would In conversation her pose is similar she gesticulates much is vivacious in speech with much power of mimicry and while talking she arches the inner angles of her eyebrow making vertical wrinkles at the center of her forehead Her laugh is open and explosive and uncovers her white rows of teeth With men she is on terms of careless equality Inversione congenita dell istinto sessuale in una donna L Anomalo February eighteen eighty nine The inverted woman Hirschfeld truly remarks Die Homosexualitaet p one hundred fifty eight is more full of life of enterprise of practical energy more aggressive more heroic more apt for adventure than either the heterosexual woman or the homosexual man Sometimes he adds her mannishness may approach reckless brutality and her courage becomes rashness This author observes however in another place p two hundred seventy two that in addition to this group of inverted women with masculine traits there is another group not less large of equally inverted women who are outwardly as thoroughly feminine as are normal women This is not an observation which I am able to confirm It appears to me that the great majority of inverted women possess some masculine or boyish traits even though only as slight as those which may occasionally be revealed by normal women Extreme femininity in my observation is much more likely to be found in bisexual than in homosexual women just as extreme masculinity is much more likely to be found in bisexual than in homosexual men While inverted women frequently though not always convey an impression of mannishness or boyishness there are no invariable anatomical characteristics associated with this impression There is for instance no uniform tendency to a masculine distribution of hair Nor must it be supposed that the presence of a beard in a woman indicates a homosexual tendency Bearded women as Hirschfeld remarks are scarcely ever inverted and it would seem that the strongest reversals of secondary sexual characters less often accompany homosexuality than slighter modifications of these characters one hundred sixty seven A faint moustache and other slight manifestations of hypertrichosis also by no means necessarily indicate homosexuality To some extent it is a matter of race thus in the Pera district of Constantinople Weissenberg among nearly seven hundred women between about eighteen and fifty years of age noted that ten per cent showed hair on the upper lip they were most often Armenians the Greeks coming next one hundred sixty eight There has been some dispute as to whether apart from homosexuality hypertrichosis in a woman can be regarded as an indication of a general masculinity This is denied by Max Bartels in his elaborate study Ueber abnorme Behaarung beim Menschen Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie eighteen seventy six p one hundred twenty seven eighteen eighty one p two hundred nineteen and as regards insanity by L Harris Liston Cases of Bearded Women British Medical Journal June two eighteen ninety four On the other hand J H Claiborne Hypertrichosis in Women New York Medical Journal June thirteen nineteen fourteen believes that hair on the face and body in a woman is a sign of masculinity women with hypertrichosis possess masculine traits There seems to be very little doubt that fully developed bearded women are in most possibly not all cases decidedly feminine in all other respects A typical instance is furnished by Annie Jones the Esau Lady of Virginia She belonged to a large and entirely normal family but herself possessed a full beard with thick whiskers and moustache of an entirely masculine type she also showed short dark hair on arms and hands resembling a man Apart from this heterogeny she was entirely normal and feminine At the age of twenty six when examined in Berlin the hair of the head was very long the expression of the face entirely feminine the voice also feminine the figure elegant the hands and feet entirely of feminine type the external and internal genitalia altogether feminine Annie Jones was married Max Bartels who studied Annie Jones and published her portrait Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie eighteen ninety one Heft three p two hundred forty three remarks that in these respects Annie Jones resembles other bearded women they marry have children and are able to suckle them A beard in women seems as Dupre and Duflos believe Revue Neurologique Aug thirty nineteen oh one to be more closely correlated with neuropathy than with masculinity comparing a thousand sane women with a thousand insane women in Paris they found unusual degree of hair or down on the face in twenty three per cent of the former and fifty per cent of the latter but even the sane bearded women frequently belonged to neuropathic families A tendency to slight widely diffused hypertrichosis of the body generally not localized or highly developed on the face seems much more likely than a beard to be associated with masculinity even when it occurs in little girls Thus Virchow once presented to the Berlin Anthropological Society a little girl of five of this type who also possessed a deep and rough voice Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie eighteen ninety one Heft four p four hundred sixty nine A typical example of slight hypertrichosis in a woman associated with general masculine traits is furnished by a description and figure of the body of a woman of fifty six in an anatomical institute furnished by C Strauch Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie nineteen oh one Heft six p five hundred thirty four In this case there was a growth of hair around both nipples and a line of hair extended from the pubes to the navel both these two dispositions of hair are very rare in women In Vienna among nearly seven hundred women Coe only found a tendency to hair distribution toward the navel in about one per cent While the hair in this subject was otherwise fairly normal there were many approximations to the masculine type in other respects the muscles were strongly developed the bones massive the limbs long the joints powerful the hands and feet large the thorax well developed the lower jaw massive there was an absence of feminine curves on the body and the breasts were scarcely perceptible At the same time the genital organs were normal and there had been childbirth It was further notable that this woman had committed suicide by self strangulation a rare method which requires great resolution and strength of will as at any moment of the process the pressure can be removed There seems little doubt that inverted women frequently tend to show minor anomalies of the piliferous system and especially slight hypertrichosis and a masculine distribution of hair Thus in a very typical case of inversion in an Italian girl of nineteen who dressed as a man and ran away from home the down on the arms and legs was marked to an unusual extent and there was very abundant hair in the armpits and on the pubes with a tendency to the masculine distribution one hundred sixty nine Of the three cases described in this chapter which I am best acquainted with one possesses an unusually small amount of hair on the pubes and in the axillae oligotrichosis terminalis approximating to the infantile type while another presents a complex and very rare piliferous heterogeny There is marked dark down on the upper lip the pubic hair is thick and there is hair on toes and feet and legs to umbilicus there are also a few hairs around the nipples A woman physician in the United States who knows many female inverts similarly tells me that she has observed the tendency to growth of hair on the legs If as is not improbable inversion is associated with some abnormal balance in the internal secretions it is not difficult to understand this tendency to piliferous anomalies and we know that the thyroid secretion for instance and much more the testicular and ovarian secretions have a powerful influence on the hair Ballantyne some years ago in discussing congenital hypertrichosis Manual of Antenatal Pathology nineteen oh two pp three hundred twenty one six concluded that the theory of arrested development is best supported by the facts persistence of lanugo is such an arrest and hypertrichosis may largely be considered a persistence of lanugo Such a conclusion is still tenable though it encounters some difficulties and inconsistencies and it largely agrees with what we know of the condition as associated with inversion in women But we are now beginning to see that this arrested development may be definitely associated with anomalies in the internal secretions and even with special chemical defects in these secretions Virile strength has always been associated with hair as the story of Samson bears witness Ammon found among Baden conscripts L Anthropologie eighteen ninety six p two hundred eighty five that when the men were divided into classes according to the amount of hair on body the first class with least hair have the smallest circumference of testicle the fewest number of men with glans penis uncovered the largest number of infantile voices the largest proportion of blue eyes and fair hair the smallest average height weight and chest circumference while in all these respects the men with hairy bodies were at the other extreme It has been known from antiquity that in men early castration affects the growth of hair It is now known that in women the presence or absence of the ovary and other glands affects the hair as well as sexual development Thus Hegar Beitraege zur Geburtshuelfe und Gynaekologie vol i p one hundred eleven eighteen ninety eight described a girl with pelvis of infantile type and uterine malformation who had been unusually hairy on face and body from infancy with masculine arrangement of hair on pubes and abdomen menstruation was scanty breasts atrophic the hair was of lanugo type we see here how in women infantile and masculine characteristics are associated with and both probably dependent on defects in the sexual glands Plant Centralblatt fuer Gynaekologie No nine eighteen ninety six described another girl with very small ovaries rudimentary uterus small vagina and prominent nymphae in whom menstruation was absent hair on head long and strong but hair absent in armpits and scanty on mons veneris These two cases seem inconsistent as regards hair and we should now wish to know the condition of the other internal glands The thyroid for instance it is now known controls the hair as well as do the sexual glands and the thyroid as Gautier has shown Academie de Medecine July twenty four nineteen hundred elaborates arsenic and iodine which nourish the skin and hair he found that the administration of sodium cacodylate to young women produced abundant growth of hair on head Again the kidneys and especially the adrenal glands influence the hair It has long been known that in girls with congenital renal tumors there is an abnormally early growth of axillary and pubic hair Goldschwend Praeger medizinische Wochenschrift Nos thirty seven and thirty eight nineteen ten has described the case of a woman of thirty nine with small ovaries and adrenal tumor in whom hair began to grow on chin and cheeks See also C T Ewart Lancet May nineteen nineteen fifteen Once more the glans hypophysis also affects hair growth and it has been found by Levi quoted in Archives d Anthropologie Criminelle August September nineteen twelve p seven hundred eleven that the administration of hypophysis extract to an infantile hairless woman of twenty seven without sexual feeling produced a general tendency to growth of hair Such facts not only help to explain the anomalies of hair development but also indicate the direction in which we may find an explanation of the anomalies of the sexual impulse Apart from the complicated problem presented by the hair there are genuine approximations to the masculine type The muscles tend to be everywhere firm with a comparative absence of soft connective tissue so that an inverted woman may give an unfeminine impression to the sense of touch A certain tonicity of the muscles has indeed often been observed in homosexual women Hirschfeld found that two thirds of inverted women are more muscular than normal women while on the other hand he found that among inverted men the musculature was often weak Not only is the tone of the voice often different but there is reason to suppose that this rests on a basis of anatomical modification At Moll s suggestion Flatau examined the larynx in a large number of inverted women and found in several a very decidedly masculine type of larynx or an approach to it especially in cases of distinctly congenital origin Hirschfeld has confirmed Flatau s observations on this point It may be added that inverted women are very often good whistlers Hirschfeld even knows two who are public performers in whistling It is scarcely necessary to remark that while the old proverb associates whistling in a woman with crowing in a hen whistling in a woman is no evidence of any general physical or psychic inversion As regards the sexual organs it seems possible so far as my observations go to speak more definitely of inverted women than of inverted men In all three of the cases concerning whom I have precise information among those whose histories are recorded in the present chapter there is more or less arrested development and infantilism In one a somewhat small vagina and prominent nymphae with local sensitiveness are associated with oligotrichosis In another the sexual parts are in some respects rather small while there is no trace of ovary on one side In the third case together with hypertrichosis the nates are small the nymphae large the clitoris deeply hooded the hymen thick and the vagina probably small These observations though few are significant and they accord with those of other observers one hundred seventy Krafft Ebing well described a case which I should be inclined to regard as typical of many sexual organs feminine in character but remaining at the infantile stage of a girl of ten small clitoris prominent cockscomb like nymphae small vagina scarcely permitting normal intercourse and very sensitive Hirschfeld agrees in finding common an approach to the type described by Krafft Ebing atrophic anomalies he regards as more common than hypertrophic and he refers to thickness of hymen and a tendency to notably small uterus and ovaries The clitoris is more usually small than large women with a large clitoris as Parent Duchatelet long since remarked seem rarely to be of masculine type Notwithstanding these tendencies however sexual inversion in a woman is as a rule not more obvious than in a man At the same time the inverted woman is not usually attractive to men She herself generally feels the greatest indifference to men and often cannot understand why a woman should love a man though she easily understands why a man should love a woman She shows therefore nothing of that sexual shyness and engaging air of weakness and dependence which are an invitation to men The man who is passionately attracted to an inverted woman is usually of rather a feminine type For instance in one case present to my mind he was of somewhat neurotic heredity of slight physical development not sexually attractive to women and very domesticated in his manner of living in short a man who might easily have been passionately attracted to his own sex While the inverted woman is cold or at most comradely in her bearing toward men she may become shy and confused in the presence of attractive persons of her own sex even unable to undress in their presence and full of tender ardor for the woman whom she loves one hundred seventy one Homosexual passion in women finds more or less complete expression in kissing sleeping together and close embraces as in what is sometimes called lying spoons when one woman lies on her side with her back turned to her friend and embraces her from behind fitting her thighs into the bend of her companion s legs so that her mons veneris is in dose contact with the other s buttocks and slight movement then produces mild erethism One may also lie on the other s body or there may be mutual masturbation Mutual contact and friction of the sexual parts seem to be comparatively rare but it seems to have been common in antiquity for we owe to it the term tribadism which is sometimes used as a synonym of feminine homosexuality and this method is said to be practised today by the southern Slav women of the Balkans one hundred seventy two The extreme gratification is cunnilinctus or oral stimulation of the feminine sexual organs not usually mutual but practised by the more active and masculine partner this act is sometimes termed by no means satisfactorily Sapphism and Lesbianism one hundred seventy three An enlarged clitoris is but rarely found in inversion and plays a very small part in the gratification of feminine homosexuality Kiernan refers to a case occurring in America in which an inverted woman married and a mother possessed a clitoris which measured twenty one two inches when erect Casanova described an inverted Swiss woman otherwise feminine in development whose clitoris in excitement was longer than his little finger and capable of penetration one hundred seventy four The older literature contains many similar cases In most such cases however we are probably concerned with some form of pseudohermaphroditism and the clitoris may more properly be regarded as a penis there is thus no inversion involved one hundred seventy five While the use of the clitoris is rare in homosexuality the use of an artificial penis is by no means uncommon and very widespread In several of the modern cases in which inverted women have married women such as those of Sarolta Vay and De Raylan the belief of the wife in the masculinity of the husband has been due to an appliance of this kind used in intercourse The artificial penis the olisbos or baubon was well known to the Greeks and is described by Herondas Its invention was ascribed by Suidas to the Milesian women and Miletus according to Aristophanes in the Lysistrata was the chief place of its manufacture one hundred seventy six It was still known in medieval times and in the twelfth century Bishop Burchard of Worms speaks of its use as a thing which some women are accustomed to do In the early eighteenth century Margaretha Lincken again in Germany married another woman with the aid of an artificial male organ one hundred seventy seven The artificial penis is also used by homosexual women in various parts of the world Thus we find it mentioned in legends of the North American Indians and it is employed in Zanzibar and Madagascar one hundred seventy eight The various phenomena of sadism masochism and fetichism which are liable to arise spontaneously or by suggestion in the relationships of normal lovers as well as of male inverts may also arise in the same way among inverted women though probably not often in a very pronounced form Moll however narrates a case Kontraere Sexualempfindung eighteen ninety nine pp five hundred sixty five seventy in which various minor but very definite perversions were combined with inversion A young lady of twenty six of good heredity from the age of six had only been attracted to her own sex and even in childhood had practised mutual cunnilinctus She was extremely intelligent and of generous and good natured disposition with various masculine tastes but on the whole of feminine build and with completely feminine larynx During seven years she lived exclusively with one woman She found complete satisfaction in active cunnilinctus During the course of this relationship various other methods of excitement and gratification arose it seems for the most part spontaneously She found much pleasure in urolagnic and coprolagnic practices In addition to these and similar perversions the subject liked being bitten especially in the lobule of the ear and she was highly excited when whipped by her friend who should if possible be naked at the time only the nates must be whipped and only a birch rod be used or the effect would not be obtained These practices would not be possible to her in the absence of extreme intimacy and mutual understanding and they only took place with the one friend In this case the perverse phenomena were masochistic rather than sadistic Many homosexual women however display sadistic tendencies in a more or less degree Thus doctor Kiernan tells me of an American case with which he was professionally concerned with doctor Moyer see also paper by Kiernan and Moyer in Alienist and Neurologist May nineteen oh seven of a sadistic inverted woman in a small Illinois city married and with two young children She was of undoubted neuropathic stock and there was a history of pre marital masturbation and bestiality with a dog She was a prominent club woman in her city and a leader in religious and social matters as is often the case with sadists she was pruriently prudish and there was strong testimony to her chaste and modest character by clergymen club women and local magnates The victim of her sadistic passion was a girl she had adopted from a Home but whom she half starved On this girl she inflicted over three hundred wounds Many of these wounds were stabs with forks and scissors which merely penetrated the skin This was especially the case with those inflicted on the breasts labia and clitoris During the infliction of these she experienced intense excitement but this excitement was under control and when she heard anyone approaching she instantly desisted She was found sane and responsible at the time of these actions but the jury also found that she had since become insane and she was sent to an Insane Hospital after recovery to serve a sentence of two years in prison The alleged insanity doctor Kiernan adds was of the dubious manic and depressive variety and perhaps chiefly due to wounded pride The inverted woman is an enthusiastic admirer of feminine beauty especially of the statuesque beauty of the body unlike in this the normal woman whose sexual emotion is but faintly tinged by esthetic feeling In her sexual habits we perhaps less often find the degree of promiscuity which is not uncommon among inverted men and we may perhaps agree with Moll that homosexual women are more often apt to love faithfully and lastingly than homosexual men Hirschfeld remarks that inverted women are not usually attracted in girlhood by the autoerotic and homosexual vices of school life one hundred seventy nine and nearly all the women whose histories I have recorded in this chapter felt a pronounced repugnance to such manifestations and cherished lofty ideals of love Inverted women are not rarely married Moll from various confidences which he has received believes that inverted women have not the same horror of normal coitus as inverted men this is probably due to the fact that the woman under such circumstances can retain a certain passivity In other cases there is some degree of bisexuality although as among inverted men the homosexual instinct seems usually to give the greater relief and gratification It has been stated by many observers in America in France in Germany and in England that homosexuality is increasing among women one hundred eighty There are many influences in our civilization today which encourage such manifestations one hundred eighty one The modern movement of emancipation the movement to obtain the same rights and duties as men the same freedom and responsibility the same education and the same work must be regarded as on the whole a wholesome and inevitable movement But it carries with it certain disadvantages one hundred eighty two Women are very justly coming to look upon knowledge and experience generally as their right as much as their brothers right But when this doctrine is applied to the sexual sphere it finds certain limitations Intimacies of any kind between young men and young women are as much discouraged socially now as ever they were as regards higher education the mere association of the sexes in the lecture room or the laboratory or the hospital is discouraged in England and in America While men are allowed freedom the sexual field of women is becoming restricted to trivial flirtation with the opposite sex and to intimacy with their own sex having been taught independence of men and disdain for the old theory which placed women in the moated grange of the home to sigh for a man who never comes a tendency develops for women to carry this independence still farther and to find love where they find work These unquestionable influences of modern movements cannot directly cause sexual inversion but they develop the germs of it and they probably cause a spurious imitation This spurious imitation is due to the fact that the congenital anomaly occurs with special frequency in women of high intelligence who voluntarily or involuntarily influence others Kurella Bloch and others believe that the woman movement has helped to develop homosexuality see e g I Bloch Beitraege zur AEtiologie der

abhorrence to the tending of children Her disposition was altogether masculine she was not for mincing obscenity but would talk freely whatever came uppermost She never had any children and was not taxed with debauchery No man can say or affirm that ever she had a sweetheart or any such fond thing to dally with her a mastiff was the only living thing she cared for Her life was not altogether honest but not so much from any organic tendency to crime it seems as because her abnormal nature and restlessness made her an outcast She was too fond of drink and is said to have been the first woman who smoked tobacco Nothing is said or suggested of any homosexual practices but we see clearly here what may be termed the homosexual diathesis one hundred sixty seven Hirschfeld Die

the Second s Court the Memoires de Ghrammont tell us Miss Hobart was credited with Lesbian tendencies Soon the rumor true or false of this singularity spread through the court They were gross enough there never to have heard of that refinement of ancient Greece in the tastes of tenderness and the idea came into their heads that the illustrious Hobart who seemed so affectionate to pretty women must be different from what she appeared This passage is interesting because it shows us how rare was the exception A century later however homosexuality among English women seems to have been regarded by the French as common and Bacchaumont on January one seventeen seventy three when recording that Mlle Heinel of the Opera was settling in England added Her taste for women will there find attractive satisfaction for though Paris furnishes many tribades it is said that London is herein superior one hundred eighty one I believe writes a well informed American correspondent that sexual inversion is increasing among Americans both men and women and the obvious reasons are first the growing independence of the women their lessening need for marriage secondly the nervous strain that business competition has brought upon the whole nation In a word the rapidly increasing masculinity in women and the unhealthy nervous systems of the men offer the ideal factors for the production of sexual inversion in their children one hundred eighty two Homosexual women like homosexual men now insert advertisements in the newspapers seeking a friend Naecke Zeitungsannoncen von weiblichen

Suggestion and Other Exciting Causes of Inversion Masturbation Attitude Toward Women Erotic Dreams Methods of Sexual Relationship Pseudo sexual Attraction Physical Sexual Abnormalities Artistic and Other Aptitudes Moral Attitude of the Invert Before stating briefly my own conclusions as to the nature of sexual inversion I propose to analyze the facts brought out in the histories which I have been able to study one hundred eighty three RACE All my cases eighty in number are British and American twenty living in the United States and the rest being British Ancestry from the point of view of race was not made a matter of special investigation It appears however that at least forty four are English or mainly English at least ten are Scotch or of Scotch extraction two are Irish and four others largely Irish four have German fathers or mothers another is of German descent on both sides while two others are of remote German extraction two are partly and one entirely French two have a Portuguese strain and at least two are more or less Jewish Except the apparently frequent presence of the German element there is nothing remarkable in this ancestry HEREDITY It is always difficult to deal securely with the significance of heredity or even to establish a definite basis of facts I have by no means escaped this difficulty for in some cases I have not even had an opportunity of cross examining the subjects whose histories I have obtained Still the facts so far as they emerge have some interest I possess some record of heredity in sixty two of my cases Of these not less than twenty four or in the proportion of nearly thirty nine per cent assert that they have reason to believe that other cases of inversion have occurred in their families and while in some it is only a strong suspicion in others there is no doubt whatever In one case there is reason to suspect inversion on both sides Usually the inverted relatives have been brothers sisters cousins or uncles In one case a bisexual son seems to have had a bisexual father This hereditary character of inversion which was denied by Naecke is a fact of great significance and as it occurs in cases with which I am well acquainted I can have no doubt concerning the existence of the tendency The influence of suggestion may often be entirely excluded especially when the persons are of different sex Both Krafft Ebing and Moll noted a similar tendency Von Roemer states that in one third of his cases there was inversion in other members of the family Hirschfeld also found that there is a relatively high proportion of cases of family inversion Twenty six so far as can be ascertained belong to reasonably healthy families minute investigation would probably reduce the number of these and it is noteworthy that even in some of the healthy families there was only one child born of the parents marriage In twenty eight cases there is more or less frequency of morbidity or abnormality eccentricity alcoholism neurasthenia insanity or nervous disease on one or both sides in addition to inversion or apart from it In some of these cases the inverted offspring is the outcome of the union of a very healthy with a thoroughly morbid stock in some others there is a minor degree of abnormality on both sides GENERAL HEALTH It is possible to speak with more certainty of the health of the individual than of that of his family Of the eighty cases fifty three or about two thirds may be said to enjoy good and sometimes even very good health though occasionally there is some slight qualification to be made In twenty two cases the health is delicate or at best only fair in these cases there is sometimes a tendency to consumption and often marked neurasthenia and a more or less unbalanced temperament Four cases are morbid to a considerable degree the remaining case has had insane delusions which required treatment in an asylum A considerable proportion included among those as having either good or fair health may be described as of extremely nervous temperament and in most cases they so describe themselves a certain proportion of these combine great physical and especially mental energy with this nervousness all these are doubtless of neurotic temperament one hundred eighty four Very few can be said to be conspicuously lacking in energy On the whole therefore a large proportion of these inverted individuals are passing through life in an unimpaired state of health which enables them to do at least their fair share of work in the world in a considerable proportion of my cases that work is of high intellectual value Only in five cases it will be seen or at most six can the general health be said to be distinctly bad This result may perhaps seem surprising It must however be remembered that my cases do not on the whole represent the class which alone the physician is usually able to bring forward i e the sexual inverts who are suffering from a more or less severe degree of complete nervous breakdown There is no frequent relationship between homosexuality and insanity and such homosexuality as is found in asylums is mostly of a spurious character This point was specially emphasized by Naecke e g Homosexualitaet und Psychose Zeitschrift fuer Psichiatrie vol lxviii No three nineteen eleven He quoted the opinions of various distinguished alienists as to the rarity with which they had met genuine inverts and recorded his own experiences He had never met a genuine invert in the asylum throughout his extensive experience although he was quite willing to admit that there may be unrecognized inverts in asylums and one patient informed him after leaving that he was inverted and had attracted the attention of the police both before and afterward though nothing happened in the asylum Among fifteen hundred patients in the asylum during one year active pedicatio occurred in about one per cent of cases these patients being frequently idiots or imbeciles and at the same time masturbators solitary or mutual Hirschfeld informed Naecke that among homosexual persons hysterical conditions not usually on hereditary basis are fairly common and neurasthenia of high degree decidedly frequent but though stages of depression are common he had never seen pure melancholia and very seldom mania but paranoiac delusional ideas frequently and he agreed with Bryan of Broadmoor that religious delusions are not uncommon General paralysis occurs but is comparatively rare and the same may be said of dementia praecox On the whole although Hirschfeld was unable to give precise figures there was no reason whatever to suppose an abnormal prevalence of insanity This was Naecke s own view It is quite true Naecke concluded that homosexual actions occur in every form of psychosis especially in congenital and secondary dements and at periods of excitement but we are here more concerned with pseudo homosexuality than with true inversion Hirschfeld finds that seventy five per cent inverts are of sound heredity this seems too large a proportion in any case allowance must be made for differences in method and minuteness of investigation I am fairly certain that thorough investigation would very considerably enlarge the proportion of cases with morbid heredity At the same time this enlargement would be chiefly obtained by bringing minor abnormalities to the front and it would then have to be shown how far the families of average or normal persons are free from such abnormalities The question is sometimes asked What family is free from neuropathic taint At present it is difficult to answer this question precisely There is good ground to believe that a fairly large proportion of families are free from such taint In any case it seems probable that the families to which the inverted belong do not usually present such profound signs of nervous degeneration as we were formerly led to suppose What we vaguely call eccentricity is common among them insanity is much rarer FIRST APPEARANCE OF HOMOSEXUAL INSTINCT Out of seventy two cases in eight the instinct veered round to the same sex in adult age or at all events after puberty in three of these there had been a love disappointment with a woman no other cause than this can be assigned for the transition but it is noteworthy that in at least two of these cases the sexual instinct is undeveloped or morbidly weak while a third individual is of somewhat weak physique and another has long been in delicate health In a further case also somewhat morbid the development was rather more complicated In sixty four cases or in a proportion of eighty eight per cent the abnormal instinct began in early life without previous attraction to the opposite sex one hundred eighty five In twenty seven of these it dates from about puberty usually beginning at school In thirty nine cases the tendency began before puberty between the ages of five and eleven usually between seven and nine sometimes as early as the subject can remember It must not be supposed that in these numerous cases of the early appearance of homosexuality the manifestations were of a specifically physical character although erections are noted in a few cases For the most part sexual manifestations at this early age whether homosexual or heterosexual are purely psychic one hundred eighty six SEXUAL PRECOCITY AND HYPERESTHESIA It is a fact of considerable interest and significance that in so large a number of my cases there was distinct precocity of the sexual emotions both on the physical and psychic sides There can be little doubt that as many previous observers have found inversion tends strongly to be associated with sexual precocity I think it may further be said that sexual precocity tends to encourage the inverted habit where it exists Why this should be so is obvious if we believe as there is some reason for believing that at an early age the sexual instinct is comparatively undifferentiated in its manifestations The precocious accentuation of the sexual impulse leads to definite crystallization of the emotions at a premature stage It must be added that precocious sexual energy is likely to remain feeble and that a feeble sexual energy adapts itself more easily to homosexual relationships in which there is no definite act to be accomplished than to normal relationships It is difficult to say how many of my cases exhibit sexual weakness In six or seven it is evident and it may be suspected in many others especially in those who are and often describe themselves as sensitive or nervous as well as in those whose sexual development was very late In many cases there is marked hyperesthesia or irritable weakness Hyperesthesia simulates strength and while there can be little doubt that some sexual inverts and more especially bisexuals do possess unusual sexual energy in others it is but apparent the frequent repetition of seminal emissions for example may be the result of weakness as well as of strength It must be added that this irritability of the sexual centers is in a considerable proportion of inverts associated with marked emotional tendencies to affection and self sacrifice In the extravagance of his affection and devotion it has been frequently observed the male invert resembles many normal women SUGGESTION AND OTHER EXCITING CAUSES OF INVERSION In eighteen of my cases it is possible that some event or special environment in early life had more or less influence in turning the sexual instinct into homosexual channels or in calling out a latent inversion In three cases a disappointment in normal love seems to have produced a profound nervous and emotional shock acting as we seem bound to admit on a predisposed organism and developing a fairly permanent tendency to inversion In eight cases there was seduction by an older person but in at least four or five of these there was already a well marked predisposition In at least eight other cases example usually at school may probably be regarded as having exerted some influence It is noteworthy that in very few of my cases can we trace the influence of any definite suggestion as asserted by Schrenck Notzing who believes that in the causation of sexual inversion as undoubtedly in the causation of erotic fetichism we must give the first place to accidental factors of education and external influence He records the case of a little boy who innocently gazed in curiosity at the penis of his father who was urinating and had his ears boxed whence arose a train of thought and feeling which resulted in complete sexual inversion In two of the cases I have reported we have parallel incidents and here we see clearly that the homosexual tendency already existed I do not question the occurrence of such incidents but I refuse to accept them as supplying the causation of inversion and in so doing I am supported by all the evidence I am able to obtain I am in agreement with a correspondent who wrote Considering that all boys are exposed to the same order of suggestions sight of a man s naked organs sleeping with a man being handled by a man and that only a few of them become sexually perverted I think it reasonable to conclude that those few were previously constituted to receive the suggestion In fact suggestion seems to play exactly the same part in the normal and abnormal awakening of sex I would go so far as to assert that for normal boys and girls the developed sexual organs of the adult man or woman from their size hairiness and the mystery which envelops them nearly always exert a certain fascination whether of attraction or horror one hundred eighty seven But this has no connection with homosexuality and scarcely with sexuality at all Thus in one case known to me a boy of six or seven took pleasure in caressing the organs of another boy twice his own age who remained passive and indifferent yet this child grew up without ever manifesting any homosexual instinct The seed of suggestion can only develop when it falls on a suitable soil If it is to act on a fairly normal nature the perverted suggestion must be very powerful or iterated and even then its influence will probably only be temporary disappearing in the presence of the normal stimulus one hundred eighty eight Not only is suggestion unnecessary to develop a sexual impulse already rooted in the organism but when exerted in an opposite direction it is powerless to divert that impulse We see this illustrated in several of the cases whose histories I have presented Thus in one case a boy was seduced by the housemaid at the age of fourteen and even derived pleasure from the girl yet none the less the native homosexual instinct asserted itself a year later In another case heterosexual suggestions were offered and accepted in early life yet notwithstanding the homosexual attraction was slowly evolved from within I have therefore but little to say of the influence of suggestion which was formerly exalted to a position of the first importance in books on sexual inversion This is not because I underestimate the great part played by suggestion in many fields of normal and abnormal life It is because I have been able to find but few decided traces of it in sexual inversion In many cases doubtless there may be some slight elements of suggestion in developing the inversion though they cannot be traced one hundred eighty nine Their importance seems usually questionable even when they are discovered Take Schrenck Notzing s case of the little boy whose ears were boxed for what his father considered improper curiosity I find it difficult to realize that a mighty suggestion can thereby be generated unless a strong emotion exists for it to unite with in that case the seed falls on prepared soil Is the wide prevalence of normal sexuality due to the fact that so many little boys have had their ears boxed for taking naughty liberties with women If so I am quite prepared to accept Schrenck Notzing s explanation as a complete account of the matter I know of one case indeed in which an element of what may fairly be called suggestion can be detected It is that of a physician who had always been on very friendly terms with men but had sexual relations exclusively with women finding fair satisfaction until the confessions of an inverted patient one day came to him as a revelation thereafter he adopted inverted practices and ceased to find any attraction in women But even in this case as I understand the matter suggestion merely served to reveal his own nature to the man For a physician to adopt the perverted habits which the visit of a chance patient suggests to him can scarcely be a phenomenon of pure suggestion We have no reason to suppose that this physician practised every perversion he heard of from patients he adopted that which fitted his own nature one hundred ninety In another case homosexual advances were made to a youth and accepted but he had already been attracted to men in childhood Again in another case there were homosexual influences in the boyhood of a subject who became bisexual but as the subject s father was of similar bisexual temperament we can attach no potency to the mere suggestions In another case we find homosexual influence in childhood but the child was already delicate shy nervous and feminine clearly possessing a temperament predestined to develop in a homosexual direction The irresistible potency of the inner impulse is well illustrated in a case presented by Hirschfeld and Burchard My daughter Erna said the subject s mother showed boyish inclinations at the age of three and they increased from year to year She never played with dolls only with tin soldiers guns and castles She would climb trees and jump ditches she made friends with the drivers of all the carts that came to our house and they would place her on the horse s back The annual circus was a joy to her for all the year Even as a child of four she was so fearless on horseback that lookers on shouted Bravo and all declared she was a born horsewoman It was her greatest wish to be a boy She would wear her elder brother s clothes all day notwithstanding her grandmother s indignation Cycling gymnastics boating swimming were her passion and she showed skill in them As she grew older she hated prettily adorned hats and clothes I had much trouble with her for she would not wear pretty things The older she grew the more her masculine and decided ways developed This excited much outcry and offence People found my daughter unfeminine and disagreeable but all my trouble and exhortations availed nothing to change her Now this young woman whom all the influences of a normal feminine environment failed to render feminine was not physiologically a woman at all the case proved to be the unique instance of an individual possessing all the external characteristics of a woman combined with internal testicular tissue capable of emitting true masculine semen through the feminine urethra No suggestions of the environment could suffice to overcome this fundamental fact of internal constitution Hirschfeld and Burchard Spermasekretion aus einer weiblichen Harnroehre Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift No fifty two nineteen eleven I may here quote three American cases not previously published for which I am indebted to Prof G Frank Lydston of Chicago They seem to me to illustrate the only kind of suggestions which play much part in the evolution of inversion I give them in doctor Lydston s words CASE I A man forty five years of age attracted by the allusion to my essay on Social Perversion contained in the English translation of Krafft Ebing s Psychopathia Sexualis consulted me regarding the possible cure of his condition This individual was a finely educated very intelligent man who was an excellent linguist had considerable musical ability and was in the employ of a firm whose business was such as to demand on the part of its employes considerable legal acumen clerical ability and knowledge of real estate transactions This man stated that at the age of puberty without any knowledge of perversity of sexual feeling he was thrown intimately in contact with males of more advanced years who took various means to excite his sexual passions the result being that perverted sexual practices were developed which were continued for a number of years He thereafter noticed an aversion to women At the solicitations of his family he finally married without any very intelligent idea as to what if anything might be expected of him in the marital relation Absolute impotence indeed repugnance for association with his wife was the lamentable sequence A divorce was in contemplation when fortunately for all parties concerned the wife suddenly died Being a man of more than ordinary intelligence this individual prior to seeking my aid had sought vainly for some remedy for his unfortunate condition He stated that he believed there was an element of heredity in his case his father having been a dipsomaniac and one brother having died insane He nevertheless stated it to be his opinion that notwithstanding the hereditary taint he would have been perfectly normal from a sexual standpoint had it not been for acquired impressions at or about the period of puberty This man presented a typically neurotic type of physique complained of being intensely nervous was prematurely gray of only fair stature and had an uncontrollable nystagmus which he said had existed for some fifteen years As might be expected treatment in this case was of no avail I began the use of hypnotic suggestion at the hands of an expert professional hypnotist The patient being called out of the State finally gave up treatment and I have no means of knowing what his present condition is CASE II A lady patient of mine who happened to be an actress and consequently a woman of the world brought to me for an opinion some correspondence which had passed between her younger brother and a man living in another State with whom he was on quite intimate terms In one of these letters various flying trips to Chicago for the purpose of meeting the lad who by the way was only seventeen years of age were alluded to It transpired also as evidenced by the letters that on several occasions the young lad had been taken on trips in Pullman cars by his friend who was a prominent railroad official The character of the correspondence was such as the average healthy man would address to a woman with whom he was enamored It seemed that the author of the correspondence had applied to his boy affinity the name Cinderella and the protestations of passionate affection that were made toward Cinderella certainly would have satisfied the most exacting woman The young lad subsequently made a confession to me and I put myself in correspondence with his male friend with the result that he called upon me and I obtained a full history of the case The method of indulgence in this case was the usual one of oral masturbation in which the lad was the passive party I was unable to obtain any definite data regarding the family history of the elder individual in this case but understand that there was a taint of insanity in his family He himself was a robust fine looking man above middle age who was well educated and very intelligent as he necessarily must have been because of the prominent position he held with an important railway company I will state as a matter of interest that the lad in this case who is now twenty three years of age has recently consulted me for impotentia coeundi manifesting a frigidity for women and from the young man s statements I am convinced that he is well on the road to confirmed sexual perversion An interesting point in this connection is that the young man s sister the actress already alluded to has recently had an attack of acute mania I have had other unpublished cases that might be of interest but these two are somewhat classical and typify to a greater or less degree the majority of other cases I will however mention one other case occurring in a woman CASE III A married woman forty years of age Has been deserted by her husband because of her perverted sexuality Neurotic history on both sides of the family and several cases of insanity on mother s side In this case affinity for the same sex and perverted desire for the opposite sex existed a combination by no means infrequent Hypnotic suggestion tried but without success Cause was evidently suggestion and example on the part of another female pervert with whom she associated before her marriage Marriage was late at age of thirty five In all these cases there was an element of what may be called suggestion but it was really much more than this it was probably in each case active seduction by an elder person of a predisposed younger person It will be observed that in each case there was at the least an organic neurotic basis for suggestion and seduction to work on I cannot regard these cases as entitled to modify our attitude toward suggestion MASTURBATION Moreau believed that masturbation was a cause of sexual inversion and Krafft Ebing looked upon it as leading to all sorts of sexual perversions the same opinion was currently repeated by many writers It is not now accepted Moll emphatically rejected the idea that masturbation can be the cause of inversion Naecke repeatedly denies that masturbation any more than seduction can ever produce true inversion Hirschfeld attaches to it no etiological significance Many years ago I gave special attention to this point and reached a similar conclusion That masturbation especially at an early age may sometimes enfeeble the sexual activities and aid the manifestations of inversion I certainly believe But beyond this there is little in the history of my male cases to indicate masturbation as a cause of inversion It is true that forty four out of fifty one admit that they have practised masturbation at all events occasionally or at some period in their lives and it is possible that this proportion is larger than that found among normal people Even if so however it is not difficult to account for bearing in mind the fact that the homosexual person has not the same opportunities as has the heterosexual person to gratify his instincts and that masturbation may sometimes legitimately appear to him as the lesser of two evils one hundred ninety one Not only has masturbation been practised at no period in at least seven of the cases for concerning several I have no information but in several others it was never practised until long after the homosexual instinct had appeared in one case not till the age of forty and then only occasionally In at least eight it was only practised at puberty in at least eight however it began before the age of puberty at least nine left off before about the age of twenty Unfortunately as yet we have little definite evidence as to the prevalence and extent of masturbation among normal individuals Among the women masturbation is found in at least five cases out of seven In one case there was no masturbation until comparatively late in life and then only at rare intervals and under exceptional circumstances In another case some years after the homosexual attraction had been experienced it was practised though not in excess from the age of puberty for about four years and then abandoned during these years the physical sexual feelings were more imperative than they were afterward felt to be In two cases masturbation was learned spontaneously soon after puberty and in one of these practised in excess before the manifestations of inversion became definite In all cases the subjects are emphatic in asserting that this practice neither led to nor was caused by the homosexual attraction which they regard as a much higher feeling and it must be added that the occasional practice of masturbation is very far from rare among fairly normal women one hundred ninety two While this is so I am certainly inclined to believe that an early and excessive indulgence in masturbation though not an adequate cause is a favoring condition for the development of inversion and that this is especially so in women The sexual precocity indicated by early and excessive masturbation doubtless sometimes reveals an organism already predisposed to homosexuality But apart from this when masturbation arises spontaneously at an early age on a purely physical basis it seems to tend to produce a divorce between the physical and the psychic aspects of sexual love The sexual manifestations are all diverted into this physical direction and the child is ignorant that such phenomena are normally allied to love then when a more spiritual attraction appears with adolescent development this divorce is perpetuated Instead of the physical and psychic feelings appearing together when the age for sexual attraction comes the physical feelings are prematurely twisted from their natural end and it becomes abnormally easy for a person of the same sex to step in and take the place rightfully belonging to a person of the opposite sex This has certainly seemed to me the course of events in some cases I have observed ATTITUDE TOWARD THE OPPOSITE SEX In seventeen cases of whom five are married and others purposing to marry there is sexual attraction to both sexes a condition formerly called psycho sexual hermaphroditism but now more usually bisexuality In such cases although there is pleasure and satisfaction in relationships with both sexes there is usually a greater degree of satisfaction in connection with one sex Most of the bisexual prefer their own sex It is curiously rare to find a person whether man or woman who by choice exercises relationships with both sexes and prefers the opposite sex This would seem to indicate that the bisexual may really be inverts In any case bisexuality merges imperceptibly into simple inversion In at least sixteen of fifty two cases of simple inversion in men there has been connection with women in some instances only once or twice in others during several years but it was always with an effort or from a sense of duty and anxiety to be normal they never experienced any real pleasure in the act or sense of satisfaction after it Four of these cases are married but martial relationships usually ceased after a few years At least four others were attracted to women when younger but are not now another once felt sexually attracted to a boyish woman but never made any attempt to obtain any relationships with her three or four others again have tried to have connection with women but failed The largest proportion of my cases have never had any sexual intimacy with the opposite sex one hundred ninety three and some of these experience what in the case of the male invert is sometimes called horror feminae But while woman as an object of sexual desire is in such cases disgusting to them and it is usually difficult for a genuine invert to have connection with a woman except by setting up images of his own sex for the most part inverts are capable of genuine friendships irrespective of sex It is perhaps not difficult to account for the horror much stronger than that normally felt toward a person of the same sex with which the invert often regards the sexual organs of persons of the opposite sex It cannot be said that the sexual organs of either sex under the influence of sexual excitement are esthetically pleasing they only become emotionally desirable through the parallel excitement of the beholder When the absence of parallel excitement is accompanied in the beholder by the sense of unfamiliarity as in childhood or by a neurotic hypersensitiveness the conditions are present for the production of intense horror feminae or horror masculis as the case may be It is possible that as Otto Rank argues in his interesting study Die Naktheit im Sage und Dichtung this horror of the sexual organs of the opposite sex to some extent felt even by normal people is embodied in the Melusine type of legend one hundred ninety four EROTIC DREAMS Our dreams follow as a general rule the impulses that stir our waking psychic life The normal man or woman in sexual vigor dreams of loving a person of the opposite sex the inverted man dreams of loving a man the inverted woman of loving a woman one hundred ninety five Dreams thus have a certain value in diagnosis more especially since there is less unwillingness to confess to a perverted dream than to a perverted action Ulrichs first referred to the significance of the dreams of inverts At a later period Moll pointed out that they have some value in diagnosis when we are not sure how far the inverted tendency is radical Then Naecke repeatedly emphasized the importance of dreams as constituting he believed the most delicate test we possess in the diagnosis of homosexuality one hundred ninety six this was an exaggerated view which failed to take into account the various influences which may deflect dreams Hirschfeld has made the most extensive investigation on this point and found that among one hundred inverts eighty seven had exclusively homosexual dreams while most of the rest had no dreams at all one hundred ninety seven Among my cases only four definitely state that there are no erotic dreams while thirty one acknowledge that the dreams are concerned more or less with persons of the same sex Of these at least sixteen assert or imply that their dreams are exclusively of the same sex Two though apparently inverted congenitally have had erotic dreams of women in one case more frequently than of men these two exceptions have no apparent explanation Another appears to have sexual dreams of a nightmare character in which women appear In another case there were always at first dreams of women but this subject had sometimes had connection with prostitutes and is not absolutely indifferent to women while another whose dreams remain heterosexual had in early life some attraction to girls In the cases of distinct bisexuality there is no unanimity two dream of their own sex two dream of both sexes one usually dreams of the opposite sex and one man while dreaming of both dislikes those dreams in which women figure In at least three cases dreams of a sexual character began at the age of eight or earlier The phenomena presented by erotic dreams alike in normal and abnormal persons are somewhat complex and dreams are by no means a sure guide to the dreamer s real sexual attitude The fluctuations of dream imagery may be illustrated by the experiences of one of my subjects who thus indirectly summarises his own experiences When he was quite a child he used to be haunted by gross and grotesque dreams of naked adult men which must have been erotic At the age of puberty he dreamed in two ways but always about males One species of vision was highly idealistic a radiant and lovely young man s face with floating hair appeared to him on a background of dim shadows The other was obscene being generally the sight of a groom s or carter s genitals in a state of violent erection He never dreamed erotically or sentimentally about women but when the dream was frightful the terror making personage was invariably female In ordinary dreams women of his family or acquaintance played a trivial part At the age of twenty four having determined to conquer his homosexual passions he married found no difficulty in cohabiting with his wife and begat several children although he took but little passionate delight in the sexual act He still continued to dream exclusively of men for several years and the obscene visions became more frequent than the idealistic Gradually coarse and uninteresting erotic dreams of women began to haunt his mind in sleep A curious particular regarding the new type of vision was that he never dreamed of whole females only of their sexual parts seen in a blur and the seminal emissions which attended the mental pictures left a feeling of fatigue and disgust In course of time his wife and he agreed to live separately so far as sexual relations are concerned He then indulged his passion for males and wholly lost those rudimentary female dreams which had been developed during the period of nuptial cohabitation Not only is it possible for the genuine invert to be trained into heterosexual erotic dreams but homosexual dreams may occasionally be experienced by persons who are and always have been exclusively heterosexual I could bring forward much evidence on this point Cf Auto erotism in vol i of these Studies Both men and women who have always been of pronounced heterosexual tendency without a trace of inversion are liable to rare homosexual dreams not necessarily involving orgasm or even definite sexual excitement and sometimes accompanied by a feeling of repugnance As an example I may present a dream which had no known origin of an exclusively heterosexual lady aged forty two she dreamed she was in bed with another woman unknown to her and lying on her own stomach while with her right hand stretched out she was feeling the other s sexual parts She could distinctly perceive the clitoris vagina et cetera she felt a sort of disgust with herself for what she was doing but continued until she awoke she then found herself lying on her stomach as in the dream and at first thought she must have been touching herself but realized that this could not have been the case Niceforo who believes that inversion may develop out of masturbation considers that dreams of masturbation by association of ideas may take on an inverted character Le Psicopatie Sessuale eighteen ninety seven pp thirty five sixty nine this however must be rare and will not account for most of the dreams in question Naecke and Colin Scott some years ago independently referred to cases in which normal persons were liable to homosexual dreams and Fere Revue de Medecine Dec eighteen ninety eight referred to a man who had a horror of women but appeared only to manifest homosexuality in his dreams Naecke Archiv fuer Kriminal Anthropologie nineteen oh seven Heft I two calls dreams which represent a reaction of opposition to the dreamer s ordinary life contrast dreams Hirschfeld who accepts Naecke s contrast dreams in relation to homosexuality considers that they indicate a latent bisexuality We may admit this is so in the same sense in which a complementary color image called up by another color indicates the possibility of perceiving that color In most cases however it seems to me that homosexual dreams in normal persons may be simply explained as due to the ordinary confusion and transition of dream imagery See Ellis The World of Dreams especially ch ii Methods of Sexual Relationship The exact mode in which an inverted instinct finds satisfaction is frequently of importance from the medico legal standpoint one hundred ninety eight from a psychological standpoint it is of minor significance being chiefly of interest as showing the degree to which the individual has departed from the instinctive feelings of his normal fellow beings Taking fifty seven inverted men of whom I have definite knowledge I find that twelve restrained by moral or other considerations have never had any physical relationship with their own sex In some twenty two cases the sexual relationship rarely goes beyond close physical contact and fondling or at most mutual masturbation and intercrural intercourse In ten or eleven cases fellatio oral excitation frequently in addition to some form of mutual masturbation and usually though not always as the active agency is the form preferred In fourteen cases actual pedicatio one hundred ninety nine usually active not passive has been exercised In these cases however pedicatio is by no means always the habitual or even the preferred method of gratification It seems to be the preferred method in about seven cases Several who have never experienced it including some who have never practised any form of physical relationship state that they feel no objection to pedicatio some have this feeling in regard to active others in regard to passive pedicatio The proportion of inverts who practise or have at some time experienced pedicatio thus revealed nearly twenty five per cent is large in Germany Hirschfeld finds it to be only eight per cent and Merzbach only six I believe however that a wider induction from a larger number of English and American cases would yield a proportion much nearer to that found in Germany two hundred PSEUDOSEXUAL ATTRACTION It is sometimes supposed that in homosexual relationships one person is always active physically and emotionally the other passive Between men at all events this is very frequently not the case and the invert cannot tell if he feels like a man or like a woman Thus one writes In bed with my friend I feel as he feels and he feels as I feel The result is masturbation and nothing more or desire for more on my part I get it over too as soon as possible in order to come to the best sleeping arms round each other or talking so It remains true however that there may usually be traced what it is possible to call pseudosexual attraction by which I mean a tendency for the invert to be attracted toward persons unlike himself so that in his sexual relationships there is a certain semblance of sexual opposition Numa Praetorius considers that in homosexuality the attraction of opposites the attraction for soldiers and other primitive vigorous types plays a greater part than among normal lovers two hundred one This pseudosexual attraction is however as Hirschfeld points out two hundred two and as we see by the Histories here presented by no means invariable M N writes To me it appears that the female element must of necessity exist in the body that desires the male and that nature keeps her law in the spirit though she breaks it in the form The rest is all a matter of individual temperament and environment The female nature of the invert hampered though it is by its disguise of flesh is still able to exert an extraordinary influence and calls insistently upon the male This influence seems called into action most violently in the presence of males possessed of strong sexual magnetism of their own Such men are generally more or less conscious of the influence and the result is either a vague appreciation which will make the male wonder why he gets on so well with the invert or else the influence will be realized to be something incongruous and unnatural and will be resented accordingly Sometimes indeed the reciprocated feeling circumstance and opportunity permitting will prove strong enough to induce sexual relations Reason will then generally overpower instinct and the feeling aroused unaware will probably be changed into repulsion Further the influence reacts in the same way on women who particularly if they are strongly sexual experience involuntary sensations of dislike or antagonism on association with inverts There is however one terrible reality for the invert to face no matter how much he may wish to avoid it and seek to deceive himself There exists for him an almost absolute lack of any genuine satisfaction either in the way of the affections or desires His whole life is passed in vainly seeking and desiring the male the antithesis of his nature and in consorting with inverts he must perforce be content with the male in form only the shadow without the substance Indeed one invert necessarily regards another as being of the same undesired female sex as himself and for this reason it will be found that while friendships between inverts frequently exist and these are characteristically feminine unstable and liable to betrayal love attachments are less common and when they occur must naturally be based upon considerable self deception Venal gratifications are always of course as possible as they are unsatisfactory and here perhaps some of the peculiarities of taste accompanying inversion may admit of elucidation In considering the peculiar predilection shown by inverts for youths of inferior social position for the wearers of uniforms and for extreme physical development and virility not necessarily accompanied by intellectuality regard must be had to the probable conduct of women placed in a position of complete irresponsibility combined with absolute freedom of action and every opportunity for promiscuity It seems to me that the importance of recognizing the underlying female element in inversion cannot be too strongly insisted upon The majority of inverts writes Z differ in no detail of their outward appearance their physique or their dress from normal men They are athletic masculine in habit frank in manner passing through society year after year without arousing a suspicion of their inner temperament were it not so society would long ago have had its eyes opened to the amount of perverted sexuality it harbors These lines were written not in opposition to the more subtle distinctions pointed out above but in refutation of the vulgar error which confuses the typical invert with the painted and petticoated creatures who appear in police courts from time to time and whose portraits are presented by Lombroso Legludic et cetera On another occasion the same writer remarked while expressing general agreement with the idea of a pseudosexual attraction The liaison is by no means always sought and begun by the person who is abnormally constituted I mean that I can cite cases of decided males who have made up to inverts and have found their happiness in the reciprocated passion One pronounced male of this sort again once said to me men are so much more affectionate than women Precisely the same words were used by one of my subjects Also the liaison springs up now and then quite accidentally through juxtaposition when it is difficult to say whether either at the outset had an inverted tendency of any marked quality In these cases the sexual relation seems to come on as a heightening of comradely affection and is found to be pleasurable sometimes I think discovered to be safe as well as satisfying On the other hand so far as I know it is extremely rare to observe a permanent liaison between two pronounced inverts The tendency to pseudosexual attraction in the homosexual would thus seem to involve a preference for normal persons How far this is the case it seems difficult to state positively Usually one may say an invert falls in love exactly as in the case of a normal person without any intellectual calculation as to the temperamental ability to return the affection which the object of his love may possess Naturally however there cannot be any adequate return of the affection in the absence of an actual or latent homosexual disposition On this point an American correspondent H C with a wide knowledge of inversion in many lands writes One of your correspondents declares that inverts long for sexual relations with normal men rather than with one another If this be true I have never once found it exemplified in all my wide experience of inverts and I have submitted his assertion to more than fifty These have replied invariably that unless a man is himself homosexual nearly all the pleasure of fellatio is absent The fact is the majority of inverts flock together not from exigency but from choice The mere sexual act is if anything far less the sole object between inverts than it is between normal men and women Why should the invert sigh for intercourse with normal men where mutual confidences and sympathies and love would be out of the question Personally I decline to commit fellatio with a man who is given to women the thought of it is repugnant to me And this is the attitude with every invert I have questioned The nearest approach to confirmation of your correspondent s theory has been when an extremely feminine invert here and there has admitted the wish that a certain normal man were inverted Indeed the temperamental gamut of inversion is itself broad enough to embrace the most widely divergent ideals As my furthest reaching demands attain fruition in the gentle and pretty boy so his own robuster affinity resides in me If inverts were actually women then indeed the normal male would be their ideal But inverts are not women Inverts are males capable of passionate friendship and their ideal is the male who will give them passionate friendship in return In at least twenty four probably many more of my male cases there is a marked contrast and in a still larger number a less marked contrast between the subject and the individuals he is attracted to either he is of somewhat feminine and sensitive nature and admires more simple and virile natures or he is fairly vigorous and admires boys who are often of lower social class Inverted women also are attracted to more clinging feminine persons two hundred three A sexual attraction for boys is no doubt as Moll points out that form of inversion which comes nearest to normal sexuality for the subject of it usually approaches nearer to the average man in physical and mental disposition The reason of this is obvious boys resemble women and therefore it requires a less profound organic twist to become sexually attracted to them Anyone who has watched private theatricals in boys schools will have observed how easy it is for boys to personate women successfully and it is well known that until the middle of the seventeenth century women s parts on the stage were always taken by boys whether or not with injury to their own or other people s morals two hundred four It is also worthy of note that in Greece where homosexuality flourished so extensively and apparently with so little accompaniment of neurotic degeneration it was often held that only boys under eighteen should be loved so that the love of boys merged into love of women About eighteen of my cases are most strongly attracted to youths preferably of about the age of eighteen to twenty and they are for the most part among the more normal and healthy of the cases A preference for older men or else a considerable degree of indifference to age alone is more common and perhaps indicates a deeper degree of perversion Putting aside the age of the object desired it must be said that there is a distinctly general though not universal tendency for sexual inverts to approach the feminine type either in psychic disposition or physical constitution or both two hundred five I cannot say how far this is explained by the irritable nervous system and delicate health which are so often associated with inversion though this is certainly an important factor Although the invert himself may stoutly affirm his masculinity and although this femininity may not be very obvious its wide prevalence may be asserted with considerable assurance and by no means only among the small minority of inverts who take an exclusively passive role though in these it is usually most marked In this I am confirmed by Q who writes In all or certainly almost all the cases of congenital male inverts excluding psycho sexual hermaphrodites that I know there has been a remarkable sensitiveness and delicacy of sentiment sympathy and an intuitive habit of mind such as we generally associate with the feminine sex even though the body might be quite masculine in its form and habit two hundred six When however a distinguished invert said to Moll We are all women that we do not deny he put the matter in too extreme a form The feminine traits of the homosexual are not usually of a conspicuous character I believe that inverts of plainly feminine nature are rare exceptions wrote Naecke two hundred seven and that statement may be accepted even by those who emphasize the prevalence of feminine traits among inverts In inverted women some degree of masculinity or boyishness is equally prevalent and it is not usually found in the women to whom they are attracted Even in inversion the need for a certain sexual opposition the longing for something which the lover himself does not possess still prevails It expresses itself sometimes in an attraction between persons of different race and color I am told that in American prisons for women Lesbian relationships are specially frequent between white and black women two hundred eight A similar affinity is found among the Arabs says Kocher and if an Arab woman has a Lesbian friend the latter is usually European In Cochin China too according to Lorion while the Chinese are chiefly active pederasts the Annamites are chiefly passive It must however be remembered that in normal love homogamy the attraction of the like prevails over heterogamy the attraction of the unlike which is chiefly confined to those features which belong to the sphere of the secondary sexual characters two hundred nine the same appears to be true in inversion and the homosexual are probably on the whole more attracted by the traits which they seem to themselves to possess than by those which are foreign to themselves two hundred ten PHYSICAL ABNORMALITIES The circumstances under which many of my cases were investigated often made information under this head difficult to obtain or to verify In at least four cases the penis is very large while in at least three it is small and undeveloped with small and flabby testes It seems probable that variations in these two directions are both common but it is doubtful whether they possess as much significance as the tendency to infantilism of the sexual organs in inverted women seems to possess Hirschfeld considers that the genital organs of inverts resemble those of normal people He finds however that phimosis is rather common two hundred eleven More significant perhaps than specifically genital peculiarities are the deviations found in the general conformation of the body two hundred twelve In at least two cases there are well developed breasts in one the breasts swelling and becoming red two hundred thirteen In one case there are menstrual phenomena physical and psychic recurring every four weeks In several cases the hips are broad and the arms rounded while some are skillful in throwing a ball One was born with a double squint At least two were seven months children In the previous chapter I have referred to the tendency to hypertrichosis and occasionally oligotrichosis among inverted women among the men it is the latter condition which seems more common and in several cases the bodies are hairless or with but scanty hair A few are left handed though not perhaps an abnormal proportion two hundred fourteen The sexual characters of the handwriting are in some cases clearly inverted the men writing a feminine hand and the women a masculine hand two hundred fifteen A high feminine voice is sometimes found two hundred sixteen A marked characteristic of many inverts though one not easy of precise definition is their youthfulness of appearance and frequently child like faces equally in both sexes This has often been remarked two hundred seventeen and is pronounced among many of my subjects The frequent inability of male inverts to whistle was first pointed out by Ulrichs and Hirschfeld has found it in twenty three per cent Many of my cases confess to this inability while some of the women inverts can whistle admirably Although this inability of male inverts is only found among a minority I am quite satisfied that it is well marked among a considerable minority One of my correspondents M N writes to me With regard to the general inability of inverts to whistle I am not able to do so myself their fondness for green my favorite color their feminine caligraphy skill at female occupations et cetera these all seem to me but indications of the one principle To go still farther and include trivial things few inverts even smoke in the same manner and with the same enjoyment as a man they have seldom the male facility at games cannot throw at a mark with precision or even spit Nearly all these peculiarities indicate a minor degree of nervous disturbance and lead to modification as my correspondent points out in a feminine direction It is scarcely necessary to add that they by no means necessarily imply inversion Shelley for instance was unable to whistle though he never gave an indication of inversion but he was a person of somewhat abnormal and feminine organization and he illustrates the tendency of these apparently very insignificant functional anomalies to be correlated with other and more important psychic anomalies The greater part of these various anatomical peculiarities and functional anomalies point more or less clearly to the prevalence among inverts of a tendency to infantilism combined with feminism in men and masculinism in women two hundred eighteen This tendency is denied by Hirschfeld but it is often well indicated among the subjects whose histories I have been able to present and is indeed suggested by Hirschfeld s own elaborate results so that it can scarcely be passed over I regard it as highly significant and it is in harmony with all that we are learning to know regarding the important part played by the internal secretions alike in inversion and the general bodily modifications in an infantile feminine and masculine direction If we are justified in believing that there is a tendency for inverted persons to be somewhat arrested in development approaching the child type we may connect this fact with the sexual precocity sometimes marked in inverts for precocity is commonly accompanied by rapid arrest of development A correspondent who is himself inverted furnishes the following notes of cases he is well acquainted with I quote them here as they illustrate the anomalies commonly found one A male eldest child of typically neurotic family Three children in all two male and one female The other two are somewhat eccentric unsocial and sexually frigid one in a marked degree The curious point about this case is that A the only one of the family possessed of mental ability and social qualifications should be inverted Parents marriage was very ill assorted and inharmonious the father being of great stature and the mother abnormally small and of highly nervous temperament both of feeble health Ancestry unfortunate especially on mother s side two B male invert younger of two sons no other children has extremely feminine disposition and appearance of considerable personal attraction and has great musical talent Penis very small and marked

resembles mother and girl who is of great physical development resembles father The same correspondent adds I have noticed little abnormal with regard to the genital formation of inverts There are however frequent abnormalities of proportion in their figures the hands and feet being noticeably smaller and more shapely the waist more marked the body softer and less muscular Almost invariably there is either cranial malformation or the head approaches the feminine in type and shape ARTISTIC AND OTHER APTITUDES All avocations are represented among inverts Among the subjects here dealt with are found at one end of the scale numerous manual workers and at the other end an equal number sometimes of aristocratic family who exercise no profession at all There are twelve physicians nine men of letters at least seven are engaged in commercial life six are artists architects or composers four are or have been actors These figures cannot give any clue to the relative extent of inversion in various occupations but they indicate that no class of occupation furnishes a safeguard against inversion There are however certain avocations to which inverts seem especially called two hundred nineteen One of the chief of these is literature The apparent predominance of physicians is easily explicable The frequency with which literature is represented is probably more genuine Here indeed inverts seem to find the highest degree of success and reputation At least half a dozen of my subjects are successful men of letters and I could easily add others by going outside the group of Histories included in this study They especially cultivate those regions of belles lettres which lie on the borderland between prose and verse Though they do not usually attain much eminence in poetry they are often very accomplished writers of verse They may be attracted to history but rarely attempt tasks of great magnitude involving much patient labor though to this rule there are exceptions Pure science seems to have relatively little attraction for the homosexual two hundred twenty An examination of my Histories reveals the interesting fact that forty five of the subjects or in the proportion of fifty six per cent possess artistic aptitudes of varying degree Galton found from the investigation of nearly one thousand persons that the average showing artistic tastes in England was only about thirty per cent It must also be said that my figures are probably below the truth as no special point was made of investigating the matter and also that in some cases the artistic ability is of high order It is suggested that Adler s theory of Minderwertigkeit according to which we react strenuously against our congenital organic defects and fortify them into virtues may be applied to the invert s acquirement of artistic abilities G Rosenstein Die Theorien der Organminderwertigkeit und die Bisexualitaet Jahrbuch fuer Psychoanalytische Forschungen vol ii nineteen ten p three hundred ninety eight This theory is in some cases of valuable application but it seems doubtful to me whether it is very profitable in the present connection The artistic aptitudes of inverts may better be regarded as part of their organic tendencies than as a reaction against those tendencies In this connection I may quote the remarks of an American correspondent himself homosexual Regarding the connection between inversion and artistic capacity so far as I can see the temperament of every invert seems to strive to find artistic expression crudely or otherwise Inverts as a rule seek the paths of life that lie in pleasant places their resistance to opposing obstacles is elastic their work is never strenuous if they can help it and their accomplishments hardly ever of practical use This is all true of the born artist as well Both inverts and artists are inordinately fond of praise both yearn for a life where admiration is the reward for little energy In a word they seem to be born tired begotten by parents who were tired too Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p sixty six gives a list of pictures and sculptures which specially appeal to the homosexual Prominent among them are representations of saint Sebastian Gainsborough s Blue Boy Vandyck s youthful men the Hermes of Praxiteles Michelangelo s Slave Rodin s and Meunier s working men types As regards music my cases reveal the aptitude which has been remarked by others as peculiarly common among inverts It has been extravagantly said that all musicians are inverts it is certain that various famous musicians among the dead and the living have been homosexual Ingegnieros speaks of a genito musical synaesthesia analogous to color hearing in this connection Calesia states Archivio di Psichiatria nineteen hundred p two hundred nine that sixty per cent inverts are musicians Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p five hundred regards this estimate as excessive but he himself elsewhere states p one hundred seventy five that ninety eight per cent of male inverts are greatly attracted to music the women being decidedly less attracted Oppenheim in a paper summarized in the Neurologische Centralblatt for June one nineteen ten and the Alienist and Neurologist for Nov nineteen ten well remarks that the musical disposition is marked by a great emotional instability and this instability is a disposition to nervousness It is thus that neurasthenia is so common among musicians The musician has not been rendered nervous by the music but he owes his nervousness as also it may be added his disposition to homosexuality to the same disposition to which he owes his musical aptitude Moreover the musician is frequently one sided in his gifts and the possession of a single hypertrophied aptitude is itself closely related to the neuropathic and psychopathic diathesis The tendency to dramatic aptitude found among a large proportion of my subjects who have never been professional actors has attracted the attention of previous investigators in this field two hundred twenty one Thus Moll refers to the frequency of artistic and especially dramatic talent among inverts and remarks that the cause is doubtful After pointing out that the lie which they have to be perpetually living renders inverts always actors he goes on to say Apart from this it seems to me that the capacity and the inclination to conceive situations and to represent them in a masterly manner corresponds to an abnormal predisposition of the nervous system just as does sexual inversion so that both phenomena are due to the same source I am in agreement with this statement the congenitally inverted may I believe be looked upon as a class of individuals exhibiting nervous characters which to some extent approximate them to persons of artistic genius The dramatic and artistic aptitudes of inverts are therefore partly due to the circumstances of the invert s life which render him necessarily an actor and in some few cases lead him into a love of deception comparable with that of a hysterical woman and partly it is probable to a congenital nervous predisposition allied to the predisposition to dramatic aptitude One of my correspondents has long been interested in the frequency of inversion among actors and actresses He knew an inverted actor who told him he adopted the profession because it would enable him to indulge his proclivity but on the whole he regards this tendency as due to hitherto unconsidered imaginative flexibilities and curiosities in the individual The actor ex hypothesi is one who works himself by sympathy intellectual and emotional into states of psychological being that are not his own He learns to comprehend nay to live himself into relations which were originally alien to his nature The capacity for doing this what makes a born actor implies a faculty for extending his artistically acquired experience into life In the process of his trade therefore he becomes at all points sensitive to human emotions and sexuality being the most intellectually undetermined of the appetites after hunger the actor might discover in himself a sort of sexual indifference out of which a sexual aberration could easily arise A man devoid of this imaginative flexibility could not be a successful actor The man who possesses it would be exposed to divagations of the sexual instinct under esthetical or merely wanton influences Something of the same kind is applicable to musicians and artists in whom sexual inversion prevails beyond the average They are conditioned by their esthetical faculty and encouraged by the circumstances of their life to feel and express the whole gamut of emotional experience Thus they get an environment which unless they are sharply otherwise differentiated leads easily to experiments in passion All this joins on to what you call the variational diathesis of men of genius But I should seek the explanation of the phenomenon less in the original sexual constitution than in the exercise of sympathetic assimilative emotional qualities powerfully stimulated and acted on by the conditions of the individual s life The artist the singer the actor the painter are more exposed to the influences out of which sexual differentiation in an abnormal direction may arise Some persons are certainly made abnormal by nature others of this sympathetic artistic temperament may become so through their sympathies plus their conditions of life It is possible there may be some element of truth in this view which my correspondent regarded as purely hypothetical In this connection I may perhaps mention a moral quality which is very often associated with dramatic aptitude and also with minor degrees of nervous degeneration and that is vanity and the love of applause While among a considerable section of inverts it is not more marked than among the non inverted if not indeed less marked among another section it is found in an exaggerated degree In at least one of my cases vanity and delight in admiration both as regards personal qualities and artistic productions reach an almost morbid extent And the quotations from letters written by various others of my subjects show a curious complacency in the description of their personal physical characters markedly absent in other cases It is suggested by Alexander Schmid on the basis of Adler s views that this vanity which sometimes in the inverted artist becomes an exalted pride as of a guardian of sacred mysteries may be regarded as an effort to secure a compensation for the consciousness of feminine defect two hundred twenty two The extreme type of this preoccupation with personal beauty is represented by the history of himself sent by a young Italian of good family to Zola in the hope itself a sign of vanity that the distinguished novelist would make it the subject of one of his works The history is reproduced in the Archives d Anthropologie Criminelle eighteen ninety four and in L Homosexualite et les Types Homosexuels nineteen ten by doctor Laupts G Saint Paul I quote the following passage At the age of eighteen I was with few differences what I am now at twenty three I am rather below the medium height one point sixty five metres well proportioned slender but not lean My torso is superb a sculptor could find nothing against it and would not find it very different from that of Antinotis My back is very arched perhaps too much so and my hips are very developed my pelvis is broad like a woman s my knees slightly approximate my feet are small my hands superb the fingers curved back and with glistening nails rosy and polished cut squarely like those of ancient statues My neck is long and round the nape charmingly adorned with downy hairs My head is charming and at eighteen was more so The oval of it is perfect and strikes all by its infantine form At twenty three I am to be taken for seventeen at most My complexion is white and rosy deepening at the faintest emotion The forehead is not beautiful it recedes slightly and is hollow at the temples but fortunately it is half covered by long hair of a dark blonde which curls naturally The head is perfect in form because of the curly hair but on examination there is an enormous protuberance at the occiput My eyes are oval of a gray blue with dark chestnut eyelashes and thick arched eyebrows My eyes are very liquid but with dark circles and bistered and they are subject to slight temporary inflammation My mouth is fairly large with thick red lips the lower pendent they tell me I have the Austrian mouth My teeth are dazzling though three are decayed and stopped fortunately they cannot be seen My ears are small and with very colored lobes My chin is very fat and at eighteen it was smooth and velvety as a woman s at present there is a slight beard always shaved Two beauty spots black and velvety on my left cheek contrast with my blue eyes My nose is thin and straight with delicate nostrils and a slight almost insensible curve My voice is gentle and people always regret that I have not learned to sing This description is noteworthy as a detailed portrait of a sexual invert of a certain type the whole history is interesting and instructive Certain peculiarities in taste as regards costume have rightly or wrongly been attributed to inverts apart from the tendency of a certain group to adopt feminine habits and may here be mentioned Tardieu many years ago referred to the taste for keeping the neck uncovered This peculiarity may occasionally be observed among inverts especially the more artistic among them The cause does not appear to be precisely vanity so much as that physical consciousness which is so curiously marked in inverts and induces the more feminine among them to cultivate feminine grace of form and the more masculine to emphasize the masculine athletic habit It has also been remarked that inverts exhibit a preference for green garments In Rome cinaedi were for this reason called galbanati Chevalier remarks that some years ago a band of pederasts at Paris wore green cravats as a badge This decided preference for green is well marked in several of my cases of both sexes and in some at least the preference certainly arose spontaneously Green as Jastrow and others have shown is very rarely the favorite color of adults of the Anglo Saxon race though some inquirers have found it to be more commonly a preferred color among children especially girls and it is more often preferred by women than by men two hundred twenty three The favorite color among normal women and indeed very often among normal men though here not so often as blue is red and it is notable that of recent years there has been a fashion for a red tie to be adopted by inverts as their badge This is especially marked among the fairies as a fellator is there termed in New York It is red writes an American correspondent himself inverted that has become almost a synonym for sexual inversion not only in the minds of inverts themselves but in the popular mind To wear a red necktie on the street is to invite remarks from newsboys and others remarks that have the practices of inverts for their theme A friend told me once that when a group of street boys caught sight of the red necktie he was wearing they sucked their fingers in imitation of fellatio Male prostitutes who walk the streets of Philadelphia and New York almost invariably wear red neckties It is the badge of all their tribe The rooms of many of my inverted friends have red as the prevailing color in decorations Among my classmates at the medical school few ever had the courage to wear a red tie those who did never repeated the experiment MORAL ATTITUDE OF THE INVERT There is some interest in tracing the invert s own attitude toward his anomaly and his estimate of its morality As my cases are not patients seeking to be cured of their perversion this attitude cannot be taken for granted I have noted the moral attitude in fifty seven cases In eight the subjects loathe themselves and have fought in vain against their perversion which they often regard as a sin Nine or ten are doubtful and have little to say in justification of their condition which they regard as perhaps morbid a moral disease One while thinking it right to gratify his natural instincts admits that they may be vices The remainder a large majority including all the women are on the other hand emphatic in their assertion that their moral position is precisely the same as that of the normally constituted individual on the lowest ground a matter of taste and at least two state that a homosexual relationship should be regarded as sacramental a holy matrimony two or three even regard inverted love as nobler than ordinary sexual love several add the proviso that there should be consent and understanding on both sides and no attempt at seduction The chief regret of two or three is the double life they are obliged to lead When inverts have clearly faced and realized their own nature it is not so much it seems their conscience that worries them or even the fear of the police as the attitude of the world An American correspondent writes It is the fear of public opinion that hangs above them like the sword of Damocles This fear is the heritage of all of us It is not the fear of conscience and is not engendered by a feeling of wrongdoing Rather it is a silent submission to prejudices that meet us on every side The true normal attitude of the sexual invert and I have known hundreds with regard to his particular passion is not essentially different from that of the normal man with regard to his It is noteworthy that even when the condition is regarded as morbid and even when a life of chastity has on this account been deliberately chosen it is very rare to find an invert expressing any wish to change his sexual ideals The male invert cannot find and has no desire to find any sexual charm in a woman for he finds all possible charms united in a man And a woman invert writes I cannot conceive a sadder fate than to be a woman an average woman reduced to the necessity of loving a man It will be seen that my conclusions under this head are in striking contrast to those of Westphal who believed that every invert regarded himself as morbid and probably show a much higher proportion of self approving inverts than any previous series two hundred twenty four This is largely due to the fact that the cases were not obtained from the consulting room and that they represent in some degree the intellectual aristocracy of inversion including individuals who often not without severe struggles have found consolation in the example of the Greeks or elsewhere and have succeeded in attaining a modus vivendi with the moral world as they have come to conceive it FOOTNOTES one hundred eighty three The following analysis is based on somewhat fuller versions of my Histories than it was necessary to publish in the preceding chapters as well as on various other Histories which are not here published at all Numerous apparent discrepancies may thus be explained one hundred eighty four This frequency of nervous symptoms is in accordance with the most reliable observation everywhere Thus Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p one hundred seventy seven states that of five hundred inverts sixty two per cent showed nervous symptoms of one kind or another sleeplessness sleepiness tremors stammering et cetera one hundred eighty five Hirschfeld finds that fifty four per cent of inverts become conscious of their anomaly under the age of fourteen The anomaly may however be present at this early age but not consciously until later Hence the larger percentage recorded above one hundred eighty six In this connection I may quote an observation by Raffalovich It is natural that the invert should very clearly recall the precocity of his inclinations In the existence of every invert a moment arrives when he discovers the enigma of his homosexual tastes He then classes all his recollections and to justify himself in his own eyes he remembers that he has been what he is from his earliest childhood Homosexuality has colored all his young life he has thought over it dreamed over it reflected over it very often in perfect innocence When he was quite small he imagined that he had been carried off by brigands by savages at five or six he dreamed of the warmth of their chests and of their naked arms He dreamed that he was their slave and he loved his slavery and his masters He has had not the least thought that is crudely sexual but he has discovered his sentimental vocation one hundred eighty seven Leppmann mentions a case certainly extreme and abnormal of a little girl of eight who spent the night hidden on the roof merely in order to be able to observe in the morning the sexual organs of an adult male cousin Bulletin de l Union Internationale de Droit Penal eighteen ninety six p one hundred eighteen one hundred eighty eight I fully admit as all investigators must the difficulty of tracing the influence of early suggestions especially in dealing with persons who are unaccustomed to self analysis Sometimes it happens especially in regard to erotic fetichism that while direct questioning fails to reach any early formative suggestion such influence is casually elicited on a subsequent occasion one hundred eighty nine I may add that I see no fundamental irreconcilability between the point of view here adopted and the facts brought forward and wrongly interpreted by Schrenck Notzing In his Beitraege zur AEtiologie der Contraerer Sexualempfindung Vienna eighteen ninety five this writer states The neuropathic disposition is congenital as is the tendency to precocious appearance of the appetites the lack of psychic resistance and the tendency to imperative associations but that heredity can extend to the object of the appetite and influence the contents of these characters is not shown Psychological experiences are against it and the possibility which I have shown of changing these impulses by experiment and so removing their danger to the character of the individual It need not be asserted that heredity extends to the object of the appetite but simply that heredity culminates in an organism which is sexually best satisfied by that object It is also a mistake to suppose that congenital characters cannot be in some cases largely modified by such patient and laborious processes as those carried on by Schrenck Notzing In the same pamphlet this writer refers to moral insanity and idiocy as supporting his point of view It is curious that both these congenital manifestations had independently occurred to me as arguments against his position The experiences of Elmira Reformatory and Bicetre not to mention institutions of more recent establishment long since showed that both the morally insane and the idiotic can be greatly improved by appropriate treatment Schrenck Notzing seems to be unduly biased by his interest in hypnotism and suggestion one hundred ninety If an invert acquires under the influence of external conditions Fere wrote with truth L Instinct Sexuel p two hundred thirty eight it is because he was born with an aptitude for such acquisition an aptitude lacking in those who have been subjected to the same conditions without making the same acquisitions one hundred ninety one One of my subjects writes Inverts are I think naturally more liable to indulge in self gratification than normal people partly because of the perpetual suppression and disappointment of their desires and also because of the fact that they actually possess in themselves the desired form of the male This idea is a little difficult of explanation but you can readily imagine to what frenzies of self abuse a normal man would be impelled supposing that he included in his own the form of the female one hundred ninety two I do not here enter upon the consideration of the normal prevalence and significance of masturbation and allied phenomena as I have dealt with this subject in the study of Auto erotism in volume i of these Studies one hundred ninety three Hirschfeld also finds among German inverts Die Homosexualitaet ch iii that the majority though a smaller majority than I find in England and the United States have not had intercourse with women fifty three per cent he states including a few married men have never even attempted coitus and over fifty per cent are presumably impotent The number of inverted women who have never had intercourse with men is still larger one hundred ninety four Otto Rank Imago Heft three nineteen thirteen one hundred ninety five Erotic dreams have been discussed in Auto erotism vol i of these Studies and the wider bearings of the subject in another work The Study of Dreams Many references to the extensive literature will be found in both these places one hundred ninety six E g Archiv fuer Psychiatrie eighteen ninety nine Archiv fuer Kriminal Anthropologie nineteen hundred one hundred ninety seven Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p seventy one et seq Hirschfeld considers that the dreams of the inverted fall into two groups one in which the dreamer imagines he is embracing a person of the same sex and another in which he imagines that he is himself of the opposite sex The latter class of dreams constituting a pseudo heterosexual group seems to me to be rare and they may moreover occur in heterosexual persons one hundred ninety eight See Thoinot and Weysse Medico legal Aspects of Moral Offenses pp one hundred sixty five two hundred ninety one et cetera one hundred ninety nine Pedicatio or paedicatio is the most generally accepted technical term for the sodomitical intromission of the penis into the anus It is usually derived from the Greek pais boy but some authorities have derived it from pedex or podex anus The terms paiderastia and pederast are sometimes used to indicate the same act and agent This use however is undesirable It is best to confine the word paiderastia to its proper use as the name of the special institution of Greek boy love It may be added that the Greeks themselves had many names as many as seventy four for paiderastia See on this subject of nomenclature Iwan Bloch Der Ursprung der Syphilis vol ii pp five hundred twenty seven five hundred sixty three two hundred It is the grosser forms of perversion which are first revealed in every field In the first edition of this Study the predominance of pedicatio was still greater it is not practised by any of the subjects of the Histories added to the present edition though several see no objection to it two hundred one Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol viii nineteen oh six p seven hundred twelve two hundred two Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p two hundred seventy six et seq two hundred three Men remarks Q tend to fall in love with boys or youths boys or youths with grown men feminine natures with virile natures and vice versa and different races with each other two hundred four Stubbes in his Anatomy of Abuses affirmed that players and play haunters in their secret conclaves play the Sodomites and refers to some recent examples of men who had been desperately enamoured of player boys thus clad in women s apparel so far as to solicit them by words by letters even actually to abuse them Later on in sixteen thirty three Prynne in his Histrio Mastix part one p two hundred eight et seq strongly condemned this putting on of woman s array by actors on the same ground and adds that he has heard credibly reported of a scholar of Balliol College that he was violently enamoured of a boy player In Japan again where as in China woman s parts on the stage are taken by men not always youths the homosexuality of these players became during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries so notorious that they constituted a class requiring special regulation as Joro or prostitutes two hundred five This was remarked by even the earliest modern writers on homosexuality like Hoessli See Hirschfeld Vom Wesen der Liebe Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol viii nineteen oh six p one hundred twenty four et seq two hundred six Similarly Numa Praetorius asserts Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol viii p seven hundred thirty two that even the most virile homosexual men exhibit feminine traits and adds that we could scarcely expect it to be otherwise when we find how constantly homosexual women show masculine traits two hundred seven Naecke Die Diagnose der Homosexualitaet Neurologisches Centralblatt April sixteen nineteen oh eight two hundred eight So also among American boarding school girls Thus Margaret Otis Journal of Abnormal Psychology June nineteen thirteen has described the attraction which negro girls exert on white girls at school The correspondence of these lovers and sometimes their method of sex gratification may occasionally be of an even coarsely passionate nature two hundred nine See Sexual Selection in Man vol iv of these Studies two hundred ten Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p two hundred eighty three found that fifty five per cent of inverts are attracted to qualities unlike their own and forty five per cent to qualities resembling their own without regard to whether these qualities belonged to the secondary sexual sphere It may be added that as regards the age of the persons they are attracted to Hirschfeld p two hundred eighty one admits two main groups each including about forty five per cent of the homosexual ephebophils attracted to youths between fourteen and twenty one and androphils attracted to adults in the prime of life This division as may be seen from the histories included in the present volume seems to hold good of British and American inverts two hundred eleven Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet ch v two hundred twelve Krafft Ebing tells of an inverted physician a man of masculine development and tastes who had had sexual relations with six hundred more or less inverted men He observed no tendency to sexual malformation among them but very frequently an approximation to a feminine form of body as well as insufficient hair delicate complexion and high voice Well developed breasts were not rare and some ten per cent showed a taste for feminine occupations two hundred thirteen A similar condition of gynecomasty has been observed in connection with inversion by Moll Laurent Wey et cetera Olano La Secrecion Mamaria en los Invertidos Sexuales Archivos de Criminologia May nineteen oh two p three hundred five further observed a certain amount of mammary secretion in an inverted man twenty years of age in Lima two hundred fourteen Hirschfeld finds seven per cent inverts left handed and six per cent partly so Fliess attaches special importance to left handedness in inversion believing that in left handed men feminine secondary sexual characters are marked and in left handed women masculine sexual character Der Ablauf des Lebens nineteen oh six I am not prepared to deny this statement but more evidence is needed two hundred fifteen This point has been discussed by Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet pp one hundred fifty six eight two hundred sixteen Bloch The Sexual Life of Our Time p five hundred attaches importance to this peculiarity but it must be remembered that a high pitched voice occurs frequently in undoubtedly heterosexual men in whom it seems often associated with high intellectual ability Havelock Ellis A Study of British Genius p two hundred two hundred seventeen See e g Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p one hundred fifty one two hundred eighteen On the general signs of these conditions see e g H Meige L Infantilisme Le Feminisme et les Hermaphrodites Antiques L Anthropologie eighteen ninety five also Hastings Gilford Infantilism Lancet February twenty eight and March seven nineteen fourteen two hundred nineteen Merzbach has dealt with the tendency of inverts to adopt special professions Homosexualitaet und Beruf Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol iv nineteen oh two two hundred twenty Moll s experience in Germany also reveals the prevalence of inversion among literary men though of all occupations he found the highest proportion among actors Jaeger has referred to the frequency of homosexuality among barbers I have been told that among London hairdressers homosexuality is so prevalent that there is even a special attitude which the client may adopt in the chair to make known that he is an invert doctor Kiernan informs me that in Chicago also inversion is specially prevalent among barbers and he adds that he is acquainted with two cases among women barbers a relatively large proportion It is not difficult to understand this bearing in mind the close physical association between the barber and his client W G was a barber s assistant writes one of my subjects and I took an immense fancy to him at first sight He used to lather me and the touch of his fingers was a delight Later on he shaved me and I always looked forward to going to the barber s If he were not able to attend to me I felt an incredible sinking of heart The whole day seemed dull and useless I used to make a mark in my pocket diary every time he shaved me two hundred twenty one See e g Vom Weibmann auf der Buehne Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol iii nineteen oh one p three hundred thirteen It is curious to find a medico legal record of this connection long before inversion was recognized In June eighteen thirty three see Annual Register under this date a man died who had lived as a kept woman under the name of Eliza Edwards He was very effeminate in appearance with beautiful hair in ringlets two feet long and a cracked voice he played female parts in the theater in the first line of tragedy and appeared as a most lady like woman The coroner s jury strongly recommended to the proper authorities that some means may be adopted in the disposal of the body which will mark the ignominy of the crime two hundred twenty two A Schmid Zur Homosexualitaet Zentralblatt fuer Psychoanalyse vol i nineteen thirteen p two hundred thirty seven two hundred twenty three See for a summary of various statistics in several countries Havelock Ellis Man and Woman fifth ed nineteen fourteen p one hundred seventy four also ib The Psychology of Red Popular Science Monthly August and September nineteen hundred two hundred twenty four The proportion is not so large however as Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p three hundred fourteen now finds in Germany where inverts are better informed on the subject of this anomaly for here ninety five per cent regard their feelings as natural CHAPTER VI THE THEORY OF SEXUAL INVERSION What is Sexual Inversion Causes of Diverging Views The Theory of Suggestion Unworkable Importance of the Congenital Element in Inversion The Freudian Theory Embryonic Hermaphroditism as a Key to Inversion Inversion as a Variation or Sport Comparison with Color blindness Color hearing and Similar Abnormalities What is an Abnormality Not Necessarily a Disease Relation of Inversion to Degeneration Exciting Causes of Inversion Not Operative in the Absence of Predisposition The analysis of these cases leads directly up to a question of the first importance What is sexual inversion Is it as many would have us believe an abominably acquired vice to be stamped out by the prison or is it as a few assert a beneficial variety of human emotion which should be tolerated or even fostered Is it a diseased condition which qualifies its subject for the lunatic asylum or is it a natural monstrosity a human sport the manifestations of which must be regulated when they become antisocial There is probably an element of truth in more than one of these views Very widely divergent views of sexual inversion are largely justified by the position and attitude of the investigator It is natural that the police official should find that his cases are largely mere examples of disgusting vice and crime It is natural that the asylum superintendent should find that we are chiefly dealing with a form of insanity It is equally natural that the sexual invert himself should find that he and his inverted friends are not so very unlike ordinary persons We have to recognize the influence of professional and personal bias and the influence of environment There have been two main streams of tendency in the views regarding sexual inversion one seeking to enlarge the sphere of the acquired represented by Binet who however recognized predisposition Schrenck Notzing and recently the Freudians the other seeking to enlarge the sphere of the congenital represented by Krafft Ebing Moll Fere and today by the majority of authorities There is as usually happens truth in both these views But inasmuch as those who represent the acquired view often deny any congenital element we are called upon to discuss the question The view that sexual inversion is entirely explained by the influence of early association or of suggestion is an attractive one and at first sight it seems to be supported by what we know of erotic fetichism by which a woman s hair or foot or even clothing becomes the focus of a man s sexual aspirations But it must be remembered that what we see in erotic fetichism is merely the exaggeration of a normal impulse every lover is to some extent excited by his mistress s hair or foot or clothing Even here therefore there is really what may fairly be regarded as a congenital element and moreover there is reason to believe that the erotic fetichist usually displays the further congenital element of hereditary neurosis Therefore the analogy with erotic fetichism does not bring much help to those who argue that inversion is purely acquired It must also be pointed out that the argument for acquired or suggested inversion logically involves the assertion that normal sexuality is also acquired or suggested If a man becomes attracted to his own sex simply because the fact or the image of such attraction is brought before him then we are bound to believe that a man becomes attracted to the opposite sex only because the fact or the image of such attraction is brought before him Such a theory is unworkable In nearly every country of the world men associate with men and women with women if association and suggestion were the only influential causes then inversion instead of being the exception ought to be the rule throughout the human species if not indeed throughout the whole zooelogical series We should moreover have to admit that the most fundamental human instinct is so constituted as to be equally well adapted for sterility as for that propagation of the race which as a matter of fact we find dominant throughout the whole of life We must therefore put aside entirely the notion that the direction of the sexual impulse is merely a suggested phenomenon such a notion is entirely opposed to observation and experience and will with difficulty fit into a rational biological scheme The Freudians alike of the orthodox and the heterodox schools have sometimes contributed unintentionally or not to revive the now antiquated conception of homosexuality as an acquired phenomenon and that by insisting that its mechanism is a purely psychic though unconscious process which may be readjusted to the normal order by psychoanalytic methods Freud first put forth a comprehensive statement of his view of homosexuality in the original and pregnant little book Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie nineteen oh five and has elsewhere frequently touched on the subject as have many other psychoanalysts including Alfred Adler and Stekel who no longer belong to the orthodox Freudian school When inverts are psycho analytically studied Freud believes it is found that in early childhood they go through a phase of intense but brief fixation on a woman usually the mother or perhaps sister Then an internal censure inhibiting this incestuous impulse they overcome it by identifying themselves with women and taking refuge in Narcissism the self becoming the sexual object Finally they look for youthful males resembling themselves whom they love as their mothers loved them Their pursuit of men is thus determined by their flight from women This view has been set forth not only by Freud but by Sadger Stekel and many others two hundred twenty five Freud himself however is careful to state that this process only represents one type of stunted sexual activity and that the problem of inversion is complex and diversified This view may be said to assume a bisexual constitution as normal and homosexuality arises by the suppression owing to some accident of the heterosexual component and the path through an autoerotic process of Narcissism to homosexuality On this general Freudian conception of homosexuality numerous variations have been based and separate features specially emphasized by individual psychoanalysts Thus Sadger considers that beneath the male individual loved by the invert a female is concealed and that this fact may be revealed by psychoanalysis which removes the upper layer of the psychic palimpsest he believes that this disposition of the invert is favored by a frequent mixture of male and female traits in his near relatives originally it is not man whom the homosexual man loves and desires but man and woman together in one form the heterosexual element is later suppressed and then pure inversion is left Further developing Freud s view of the importance of anal eroticism Freud Sammlung Kleiner Schriften zur Neurosenlehre vol ii Sadger thinks that it is even the rule for a passive invert to have experienced anal eroticism in childhood and been frequently subjected to enemas which have led to the desire for the anal intromission of the penis Medizinische Klinik nineteen oh nine No two Jekels pushes this doctrine further and declares that all inverts are really passive the invert is in his love he states both subject and object he identifies himself with his mother and sees in the object of his love his own youthful person And what Jekels asks is the aim of this mental arrangement It can scarcely by other he replies than in the part of the mother to stimulate the anal region of the object which has now become himself and to procure the same pleasure which in childhood he experienced when his mother satisfied his anal eroticism Jekels regards this view as the continuation and concretization of Freud s interpretation and the main point in homosexuality even when apparently passive becomes the craving for anal erotic satisfaction L Jekels Einige Bemerkungen zur Trieblehre Internationale Zeitschrift fuer Aerztliche Psychoanalyse Sept nineteen thirteen Most psychoanalysts are cautious in denying a constitutional or congenital basis to inversion though they leave it in the background Ferenczi in an interesting attempt to classify the homosexual Internationale Zeitschrift fuer Aerztliche Psychoanalyse March nineteen fourteen remarks Psychoanalytic investigation shows that under the name of homosexuality the most various psychic states are thrown together on the one hand true constitutional anomalies inversion or subject homoeroticism on the other hand psychoneurotic obsessional conditions object homoeroticism or obsessional homoeroticism The individual of the first kind essentially feels himself a woman who wishes to be loved by a man while the other represents a neurotic flight from women rather than sympathy to men The constitutional basis is very definitely accepted by Rudolf Ortvay who points out Internationale Zeitschrift fuer Aerztliche Psychoanalyse Jan nineteen fourteen that the biological doctrine of recessives and dominants in heredity helps to make clear the emergence or suppression of homosexuality on a bisexual disposition Infantile events he adds which according to Freud decide the sexual relations of adults can only exert their operation on the foundation of an organic predisposition infantile impressions being determined by hereditary predisposition Isador Coriat on the other hand while recognizing two forms of inversion incomplete and complete boldly asserts that it is never congenital and never transmitted through heredity it is always originated through a definite unconscious mechanism Coriat Homosexuality New York Medical Journal March twenty two nineteen thirteen Adler s view of homosexuality as of other allied conditions differs from that of most psychoanalysts by insisting on the presence of an original organic defect which the subject seeks to fortify into a point of strength he accepts two chief components of inversion a vagueness as to sexual differences and a process of self assurance in the form of rebellion and defiance and even the feminism of the invert may become a method of gaining power A Adler Ueber den Neuroesen Charakter nineteen twelve p twenty one The mechanism of the genesis of homosexuality put forward by Freud need not be dismissed offhand Freud has often manifested the insight of genius and he refrains from molding his conceptions in those inflexible shapes which have sometimes been adopted by the more dogmatic psychoanalysts who have followed him Nor need we be unduly shocked by the incestuous air of the Oedipus Complex two hundred twenty six as it is commonly called which figures as a component of the process The word incest though it has been used by Freud himself seems scarcely a proper word to apply to the vague and elementary feelings of children especially when those feelings scarcely pass beyond a stage of non localized and therefore really presexual feelings in the ordinary use of the term sexual which may be regarded as natural and normal The Freudian conception is misrepresented and prejudiced by the statement that it involves incest two hundred twenty seven When a child loves its mother with an entire love that love necessarily involves the germs which in later life become separated and developed into sexual love but it is inaccurate to term this love of the child incestuous It is quite easily conceivable that the psychic mechanism of the establishment of homosexuality has in some cases corresponded to the course described by Freud It may also be admitted that as psychoanalysts claim the pronounced horror feminae occasionally found in male inverts may plausibly be regarded as the reversal of an early and disappointed feminine attraction But it is impossible to regard this mechanism as invariable or even frequent It is quite true and I have found ample evidence of the fact that inverts are often very closely attached to their mothers even to a greater degree indeed than is the rule among normal children and often like to be in constant association with their mothers But this attraction is quite misunderstood if it is regarded as a peculiarly sexual attraction Indeed the whole point of the attraction is that the inverted boy vaguely feels his own feminine disposition and so shuns the uncongenial amusements and society of his own sex for the sympathy and community of tastes which he finds concentrated in his mother So far from such association being evidence of sexual attraction it might more reasonably be regarded as evidence of its absence just as the association of boys among themselves and of girls among themselves even in company educational schools is proof of the prevalence of heterosexual rather than of homosexual feeling Confirmation of this point of view may be found in the fact overlooked and sometimes even denied by psychoanalysts that frequently even in early childhood and simultaneously with this community of feeling with his mother the homosexual boy is already experiencing the predominant fascination of the male He feels it long before the age at which Narcissism is apt to occur or at which self consciousness has become sufficiently developed to allow the internal censure on unpermitted emotions to operate or any flight from them to take place Moreover while most authorities have rarely been able to find any clear evidence of the sexual attraction of male inverts in childhood to mother or sister two hundred twenty eight an attraction of this kind to father or brother seems less difficult to find and if found it is incompatible with the typical Freudian process In my own observation among the Histories here recorded there are at least two clear examples of such an attraction in childhood It must further be said that any theory of the etiology of homosexuality which leaves out of account the hereditary factor in inversion cannot be admitted The evidence for the frequency of homosexuality among the near relatives of the inverted is now indisputable I have traced it in a considerable proportion of cases and in many of these the evidence is unquestionable and altogether independent of the statement of the subject himself whose opinion may be held to be possibly biased or unreliable two hundred twenty nine This hereditary factor seems indeed to be called for by the Freudian theory itself On that theory we need to know how it is that the subject passes through psychic phases and reaches an emotional disposition so unlike that of normal persona The existence of a definite hereditary tendency in a homosexual direction removes that difficulty Freud himself recognizes this and clearly asserts congenital psycho sexual constitution which must involve predisposition On a general survey therefore it would appear that on the psychic side we may accept the reality of unconscious dynamic processes which in particular cases may be of the Freudian or similar type But while the study of such mechanisms may illuminate the psychology of homosexuality they leave untouched the fundamental organic factors now accepted by most authorities two hundred thirty The rational way of regarding the normal sexual instinct is as an inborn organic impulse reaching full development about the time of puberty two hundred thirty one During the period of development suggestion and association may come in to play a part in defining the object of the emotion the soil is now ready but the variety of seeds likely to thrive in it is limited That there is a greater indefiniteness in the aim of the sexual impulse at this period we may well believe This is shown not only by occasional tentative signs of sexual emotion directed toward the same sex in childhood but by the frequently ideal and unlocalized character of the normal passion even at puberty But the channel of sexual emotion is not thereby turned into an abnormal path Whenever this happens we are bound to believe and we have many grounds for believing that we are dealing with an organism which from the beginning is abnormal The same seed of suggestion is sown in various soils in the many it dies out in the few it flourishes The cause can only be a difference in the soil If then we must postulate a congenital abnormality in order to account satisfactorily for at least a large proportion of sexual inverts wherein does that abnormality consist Ulrichs explained the matter by saying that in sexual inverts a male body coexists with a female soul anima muliebris in corpore virile inclusa Even writers of scientific eminence like Magnan and Gley have adopted this phrase in a modified form considering that in inversion a female brain is combined with a male body or male glands This is however not an explanation It merely crystallizes into an epigram the superficial impression of the matter two hundred thirty two We can probably grasp the nature of the abnormality better if we reflect on the development of the sexes and on the latent organic bisexuality in each sex At an early stage of development the sexes are indistinguishable and throughout life the traces of this early community of sex remain The hen fowl retains in a rudimentary form the spurs which are so large and formidable in her lord and sometimes she develops a capacity to crow or puts on male plumage Among mammals the male possesses useless nipples which occasionally even develop into breasts and the female possesses a clitoris which is merely a rudimentary penis and may also develop The sexually inverted person does not usually possess any gross exaggeration of these signs of community with the opposite sex But as we have seen there are a considerable number of more subtle approximations to the opposite sex in inverted persons both on the physical and the psychic side Putting the matter in a purely speculative shape it may be said that at conception the organism is provided with about fifty per cent of male germs and about fifty per cent of female germs and that as development proceeds either the male or the female germs assume the upper hand until in the maturely developed individual only a few aborted germs of the opposite sex are left In the homosexual however and in the bisexual we may imagine that the process has not proceeded normally on account of some peculiarity in the number or character of either the original male germs or female germs or both the result being that we have a person who is organically twisted into a shape that is more fitted for the exercise of the inverted than of the normal sexual impulse or else equally fitted for both two hundred thirty three The conception of the latent bisexuality of all males and females cannot fail to be fairly obvious to intelligent observers of the human body It emerges at an early period in the history of philosophic thought and from the first was occasionally used for the explanation of homosexuality Plato s myth in the Banquet and the hermaphroditic statues of antiquity show how acute minds working ahead of science exercised themselves with these problems For a fully illustrated study of the ancient conception of hermaphroditism in sculpture see L S A M von Roemer Ueber die Androgynische Idee des Lebens Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol v nineteen oh three pp seven hundred eleven nine hundred thirty nine Parmenides following Alcmaeon the philosophic physician who discovered that the brain is the central organ of intellect remarks Gomperz Greek Thinkers Eng tr vol i p one hundred eighty three used the idea of variation in the proportion of male and female generative elements to account for idiosyncrasies of sexual character After an immense interval Hoessli the inverted Swiss man milliner in his Eros eighteen thirty eight put forth the Greek view anew Schopenhauer again from the philosophical side recognized the bisexuality of the human individual see Juliusburger Allgemeine Zeitschrift fuer Psychiatrie nineteen twelve p six hundred thirty and Ulrichs from eighteen sixty two onward adopted a similar doctrine on a Platonic basis to explain the Uranian constitution After this the idea began to be more precisely developed from the scientific side though not at first with reference to homosexuality and more especially by the great pioneers of the doctrine of Evolution Darwin emphasized the significance of the facts on this point as later Weismann while Haeckel who was one of the earliest Darwinians has in recent years clearly recognized the bearing on the interpretation of homosexuality of the fact that the ancestors of the vertebrates were hermaphrodites as vertebrates themselves still are in their embryonic disposition Haeckel in Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen April nineteen thirteen pp two hundred sixty two three two hundred eighty seven This view had however been set forth at an earlier date by individual physicians notably in America by Kiernan American Lancet eighteen eighty four and Medical Standard November and December eighteen eighty eight and Lydston Philadelphia Medical and Surgical Reporter September eighteen eighty nine and Addresses and Essays eighteen ninety two In eighteen ninety three in his L Inversion Sexuelle Chevalier a pupil of Lacassagne who had already applied the term hermaphrodisme moral to this anomaly explained congenital homosexuality by the idea of latent bisexuality doctor G de Letamendi Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Madrid in a paper read before the International Medical Congress at Rome in eighteen ninety four set forth a principle of panhermaphroditism a hermaphroditic bipolarity which involved the existence of latent female germs in the male latent male germs in the female which latent germs may strive for and sometimes obtain the mastery In February eighteen ninety six the first version of the present chapter setting forth the conception of inversion as a psychic and somatic development on the basis of a latent bisexuality was published in the Centralblatt fuer Nervenheilkunde und Psychiatrie Kurella ib May eighteen ninety adopted a somewhat similar view even arguing that the invert is a transitional form between the complete man or woman and the hermaphrodite In Germany a patient of Krafft Ebing had worked out the same idea connecting inversion with fetal bisexuality eighth edition Psychopathia Sexualis p two hundred twenty seven Krafft Ebing himself at first simply asserted that whether congenital or acquired there must be Belastung inversion is a degenerate phenomenon a functional sign of degeneration Krafft Ebing Zur Erklaerung der contraeren Sexualempfindung Jahrbuch fuer Psychiatrie eighteen ninety four In the later editions of Psychopathia Sexualis however eighteen ninety six and onward and notably in Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol iii nineteen oh one he went farther adopting the explanation on the lines of original bisexuality English translation of tenth edition pp three hundred thirty six seven In much the same language as I have used he argued that there has been a struggle in the centers homosexuality resulting when the center antagonistic to that represented by the sexual gland conquers and psycho sexual hermaphroditism resulting when both centers are too weak to obtain victory in either case such disturbance not being a psychic degeneration or disease but simply an anomaly comparable to a malformation and quite consonant with psychic health This is the view now widely accepted by investigators of sexual inversion Much material bearing on the history of this conception has been brought together by Hirschfeld in Die Homosexualitaet ch xix and previously in Vom Wesen der Liebe Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol viii nineteen oh six pp one hundred eleven one hundred thirty three A similar or allied view is now constantly met with in writers of scientific authority who are only incidentally concerned with the study of sexual inversion Thus Halban Die Entstehung des Geschlechtscharaktere Archiv fuer Gynaekologie nineteen oh three regards hermaphroditism which he would extend to the psychic sphere as a state in which a double sexual impulse determines the course of fetal and later development Shattock and Seligmann True Hermaphroditism in the Domestic Fowl with Remarks on Allopterotism Transactions of Pathological Society of London vol lvii part i nineteen oh six pointing out that mere atrophy of the ovary cannot account for the appearance in the hen bird of male characters which are not retrogressive but progressive argues that such birds are really bisexual or hermaphrodite either by the single ovary being really bisexual as was the case with a fowl they examined or that the sexual glands are paired one being male and the other female or else that there is misplaced male tissue in a neighboring viscus like the adrenal or kidney the male elements asserting themselves when the female elements degenerate Hermaphroditism they conclude far from being a phenomenon altogether abnormal amongst the higher vertebrates should be viewed rather as a reversion to the primitive ancestral phase in which bisexualism was the normal disposition True hermaphroditism in man being established the question arises whether lesser grades do not occur Remote evidence of bisexuality in the human subject may perhaps be afforded by the psychical phenomenon of sexual perversion and inversion Similarly in a case of unilateral secondary male character in an otherwise female pheasant C J Bond has more recently shown Section of Zooelogy Birmingham Meeting of British Medical Association British Medical Journal Sept twenty nineteen thirteen that an ovi testis was present with degenerating ovarian tissue and developing testicular tissue and such islands of actively growing male tissue can frequently be found he states in the degenerating ovaries of female birds which have put forth male plumage Sir John Bland Sutton referring to the fact that the external conformation of the body affords no positive certainty as to the nature of the internal sexual glands adds British Medical Journal Oct thirty nineteen oh nine It is a fair presumption that some examples of sexual frigidity and sex perversion may be explained by the possibility that the individuals concerned may possess sexual glands opposite in character to those indicated by the external configuration of their bodies Looking at the matter more broadly and fundamentally in its normal aspects Heape declares Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society vol xiv part ii nineteen oh seven that there is no such thing as a pure male or female animal but that all contain a dominant and recessive sex except those hermaphrodites in which both sexes are equally represented There seems to me ample evidence for the conclusion that there is no such thing as a pure male or female F H A Marshall again in his standard manual The Physiology of Reproduction nineteen ten p six hundred fifty five et seq is inclined to accept the same view If it be true he remarks that all individuals are potentially bisexual and that changed circumstances leading to a changed metabolism may in exceptional circumstances even in adult life cause the development of the recessive characters it would seem extremely probable that the dominance of one set of sexual characters over the other may be determined in some cases at an early stage of development in response to a stimulus which may be either internal or external So also Berry Hart Atypical Male and Female Sex Ensemble a paper read before Edinburgh Obstetrical Society British Medical Journal June twenty nineteen fourteen p thirteen fifty five regards the normal male or female as embodying a maximum of the potent organs of his or her own sex with a minimum of non potent organs of the other sex with secondary sex traits congruent Any increase in the minimum gives a diminished maximum and non congruence of the secondary characters We thus see that the ancient medico philosophic conception of organic bisexuality put forth by the Greeks as the key to the explanation of sexual inversion after sinking out of sight for two thousand years was revived early in the nineteenth century by two amateur philosophers who were themselves inverted Hoessli Ulrichs as well as by a genuine philosopher who was not inverted Schopenhauer Then the conception of latent bisexuality independently of homosexuality was developed from the purely scientific side by Darwin and evolutionists generally In the next stage this conception was adopted by the psychiatric and other scientific authorities on homosexuality Krafft Ebing and the majority of other students Finally embryologists physiologists of sex and biologists generally not only accept the conception of bisexuality but admit that it probably helps to account for homosexuality In this way the idea may be said to have passed into current thought We cannot assert that it constitutes an adequate explanation of homosexuality but it enables us in some degree to understand what for many is a mysterious riddle and it furnishes a useful basis for the classification not only of homosexuality but of the other mixed or intermediate sexual anomalies in the same group The chief of these intermediate sexual anomalies are one physical hermaphroditism in its various stages two gynandromorphism or eunuchoidism in which men possess characters resembling those of males who have been early castrated and women possess similarly masculine characters three sexo esthetic inversion or Eonism Hirschfeld s transvestism or cross dressing in which outside the specifically sexual emotions men possess the tastes of women and women those of men Hirschfeld has discussed these intermediate sexual stages in various works especially in Geschlechtsuebergaenge nineteen oh five Die Transvestiten nineteen ten and ch xi of Die Homosexualitaet Hermaphroditism the reality of which has only of late been recognized and is still disputed and pseudohermaphroditism in their physical variations are fully dealt with in the great work richly illustrated Hermaphroditismus beim Menschen by F L von Neugebauer of Warsaw Neugebauer published an earlier and briefer study of the subject in the Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol iv nineteen oh two pp one one hundred seventy six with a bibliography in vol viii nineteen oh six of the same Jahrbuch pp six hundred eighty five seven hundred Hirschfeld emphasizes the fact that neither hermaphroditism nor eunuchoidism is commonly associated with homosexuality and that a large proportion of the cases of transvestism as defined by him are heterosexual True inversion seems however to be not infrequently found among pseudohermaphrodites Neugebauer records numerous cases Magnan has published a case in a girl brought up as a youth Gazette medical de Paris March thirty one nineteen eleven and Lapointe a case in a man brought up as a girl Revue de psychiatrie nineteen eleven p two hundred nineteen Such cases may be accounted for by the training and associations involved by the early error in recognition of sex and perhaps still more by a really organic predisposition to homosexuality although the sexual psychic characters are not necessarily bound up with the coexistence of corresponding sexual glands Halban Archiv fuer Gynaekologie nineteen oh three goes so far as to class the homosexual as real pseudohermaphrodites exactly comparable to a man with a female breast or a woman with a beard and proposes to term homosexuality pseudohermaphroditus masculinus psychicus This however is an unnecessary and scarcely satisfactory confusion To place the group of homosexual phenomena among other intermediate groups on the organic bisexual basis is a convenient classification It can scarcely be regarded as a complete explanation It is probable that we may ultimately find a more fundamental source of these various phenomena in the stimulating and inhibiting play of the internal secretions two hundred thirty four Our knowledge of the intimate association between the hormones and sexual phenomena is already sufficient to make such an explanation intelligible the complex interaction of the glandular internal secretions and their liability to varying disturbance in balance may well suffice to account for the complexity of the phenomena It would harmonize with what we know of the occasional delayed manifestations of homosexuality and would not clash with their congenital nature for we know that a disordered state of the thymus for instance may be hereditary and it is held that status lymphaticus may be either inborn or acquired two hundred thirty five Normal sexual characters seem to depend largely upon the due company ordination of the internal secretions and it is reasonable to suppose that sexual deviations depend upon their inco ordination If a man is a man and a woman a woman because in Blair Bell s phrase of the totality of their internal secretions the intermediate stages between the man and the woman must be due to redistribution of those internal secretions two hundred thirty six We know that various internal secretions possess an influential sexual effect Thus the atrophy of the thymus seems to be connected with sexual development at puberty the thyroid reinforces the genital glands adrenal overdevelopment can produce in a female the secondary characteristics of the male as well as cause precocious development of maleness et cetera An alteration in the metabolism as F H A Marshall suggests even in comparatively late life may initiate changes in the direction of the opposite sex Metabolic chemical processes may thus be found to furnish a key to complex and subtle sexual variations alike somatic and psychic although we must still regard such processes as arising on an inborn predisposition Whatever its ultimate explanation sexual inversion may thus fairly be considered a sport or variation one of those organic aberrations which we see throughout living nature in plants and in animals It is not here asserted as I would carefully point out that an inverted sexual instinct or organ for such instinct is developed in early embryonic life such a notion is rightly rejected as absurd What we may reasonably regard as formed at an early stage of development is strictly a predisposition that is to say such a modification of the organism that it becomes more adapted than the normal or average organism to experience sexual attraction to the same sex The sexual invert may thus be roughly compared to the congenital idiot to the instinctive criminal to the man of genius who are all not strictly concordant with the usual biological variation because this is of a less subtle character but who become somewhat more intelligible to us if we bear in mind their affinity to variations Symonds compared inversion to color blindness and such a comparison is reasonable Just as the ordinary color blind person is congenitally insensitive to those red green rays which are precisely the most impressive to the normal eye and gives an extended value to the other colors finding that blood is the same color as grass and a florid complexion blue as the sky so the invert fails to see emotional values patent to normal persons transferring those values to emotional associations which for the rest of the world are utterly distinct Or we may compare inversion to such a phenomenon as color hearing in which there is not so much defect as an abnormality of nervous tracks producing new and involuntary combinations Just as the color hearer instinctively associates colors with sounds like the young Japanese lady who remarked when listening to singing That boy s voice is red so the invert has his sexual sensations brought into relationship with objects that are normally without sexual appeal two hundred thirty seven And inversion like color hearing is found more commonly in young subjects tending to become less marked or to die out after puberty Color hearing while an abnormal phenomenon it must be added cannot be called a diseased condition and it is probably much less frequently associated with other abnormal or degenerative stigmata than is inversion there is often a congenital element shown by the tendency to hereditary transmission while the associations are developed in very early life and are too regular to be the simple result of suggestion two hundred thirty eight All such organic variations are abnormalities It is important that we should have a clear idea as to what an abnormality is Many people imagine that what is abnormal is necessarily diseased That is not the case unless we give the word disease an inconveniently and illegitimately wide extension It is both inconvenient and inexact to speak of color blindness criminality and genius as diseases in the same sense as we speak of scarlet fever or tuberculosis or general paralysis as diseases Every congenital abnormality is doubtless due to a peculiarity in the sperm or oval elements or in their mingling or to some disturbance in their early development But the same may doubtless be said of the normal dissimilarities between brothers and sisters It is quite true that any of these aberrations may be due to antenatal disease but to call them abnormal does not beg that question If it is thought that any authority is needed to support this view we can scarcely find a weightier than that of Virchow who repeatedly insisted on the right use of the word anomaly and who taught that though an anomaly may constitute a predisposition to disease the study of anomalies pathology as he called it teratology as we may perhaps prefer to call it is not the study of disease which he termed nosology the study of the abnormal is perfectly distinct from the study of the morbid Virchow considers that the region of the abnormal is the region of pathology and that the study of disease must be regarded distinctly as nosology Whether we adopt this terminology or whether we consider the study of the abnormal as part of teratology is a secondary matter not affecting the right understanding of the term anomaly and its due differentiation from the term disease At the Innsbruck meeting of the German Anthropological Society in eighteen ninety four Virchow thus expressed himself In old days an anomaly was called pathos and in this sense every departure from the norm is for me a pathological event If we have ascertained such a pathological event we are further led to investigate what pathos was the special cause of it This cause may be for example an external force or a chemical substance or a physical agent producing in the normal condition of the body a change an anomaly pathos This can become hereditary under some circumstances and then become the foundation for certain small hereditary characters which are propagated in a family in themselves they belong to pathology even although they produce no injury For I must remark that pathological does not mean harmful it does not indicate disease disease in Greek is nosos and it is nosology that is concerned with disease The pathological under some circumstances can be advantageous Correspondenz blatt Deutsch Gesellschaft fuer Anthropologie eighteen ninety four These remarks are of interest when we are attempting to find the wider bearings of such an anomaly as sexual inversion This same distinction has more recently been emphasized by Professor Aschoff Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift February three nineteen ten of British Medical Journal April nine nineteen ten p eight hundred ninety two as against Ribbert and others who would unduly narrow the conception of pathos Aschoff points out that not merely for the sake of precision and uniformity of terminology but of clear thinking it is desirable that we should retain a distinction in regard to which Galen and the ancient physicians were very definite They used pathos as the wider term involving affection affectio in general not necessarily impairment of vital tissue when that was involved there was nosos disease We have to recognize the distinction even if we reject the terminology A word may be said as to the connection between sexual inversion and degeneration In France especially since the days of Morel the stigmata of degeneration are much spoken of Sexual inversion is frequently regarded as one of them i e as an episodic syndrome of a hereditary disease taking its place beside other psychic stigmata such as kleptomania and pyromania Krafft Ebing long so regarded inversion it is the view of Magnan one of the earliest investigators of homosexuality two hundred thirty nine and it was adopted by Moebius Strictly speaking the invert is degenerate he has fallen away from the genus So is a color blind person But Morel s conception of degenerescence has unfortunately been coarsened and vulgarized two hundred forty As it now stands we gain little or no information by being told that a person is a degenerate It is only as Naecke constantly argued when we find a complexus of well marked abnormalities that we are fairly justified in asserting that we have to deal with a condition of degeneration Inversion is sometimes found in such a condition I have indeed already tried to suggest that a condition of diffused minor abnormality may be regarded as a basis of congenital inversion In other words inversion is bound up with a modification of the secondary sexual characters But these anomalies and modifications are not invariable two hundred forty one and are not usually of a serious character inversion is rare in the profoundly degenerate It is undesirable to call these modifications stigmata of degeneration a term which threatens to disappear from scientific terminology to become a mere term of literary and journalistic abuse So much may be said concerning a conception or a phrase of which far too much has been made in popular literature At the best it remains vague and unfitted for scientific use It is now widely recognized that we gain little by describing inversion as a degeneration Naecke who attached significance to the stigmata of degeneration when numerous was especially active in pointing out that inverts are not degenerate and frequently returned to this point Loewenfeld Freud Hirschfeld Bloch Rohleder all reject the conception of sexual inversion as a degeneracy Moll is still unable to abandon altogether the position that since inversion involves a disharmony between psychic disposition and physical conformation we must regard it as morbid but he recognizes like Krafft Ebing that it is properly viewed as being on the level of a deformity that is an abnormality comparable to physical hermaphroditism A Moll Sexuelle Zwischenstufen Zeitschrift fuer aerztliche Fortbildung No twenty four nineteen oh four Naecke repeatedly emphasized the view that inversion is a congenital non morbid abnormality thus in the last year of his life he wrote Zeitschrift fuer die Gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie vol xv Heft five nineteen thirteen We must not conceive of homosexuality as a degeneration or a disease but at most as an abnormality due to a disturbance of development Loewenfeld always a cautious and sagacious clinical observer agreeing with Naecke and Hirschfeld regards inversion as certainly an abnormality but not therefore morbid it may be associated with disease and degeneration but is usually simply a variation from the norm not to be regarded as morbid or degenerate and not diminishing the value of the individual as a member of society Loewenfeld Ueber die sexuelle Konstitution nineteen eleven p one hundred sixty six also Zeitschrift fuer Sexualwissenschaft Feb nineteen oh eight and Sexual Probleme April nineteen oh eight Aletrino of Amsterdam pushes the view that inversion is a non morbid abnormality to an undue extreme by asserting that the uranist is a normal variety of the species Homo sapiens Uranisme et Degenerescence Archives d Anthropologie Criminelle Aug Sept nineteen oh eight inversion may be regarded as in the correct sense of the word here adopted a pathological abnormality but not as an anthropological human variety comparable to the Negro or the Mongolian man For further opinions in favor of inversion as an anomaly see Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p three hundred eighty eight et seq Sexual inversion therefore remains a congenital anomaly to be classed with other congenital abnormalities which have psychic concomitants At the very least such congenital abnormality usually exists as a predisposition to inversion It is probable that many persons go through the world with a congenital predisposition to inversion which always remains latent and unroused in others the instinct is so strong that it forces its own way in spite of all obstacles in others again the predisposition is weaker and a powerful exciting cause plays the predominant part We are thus led to the consideration of the causes that excite the latent predisposition A great variety of causes has been held to excite to sexual inversion It is only necessary to mention those which I have found influential The first to come before us is our school system with its segregation of boys and girls apart from each other during the periods of puberty and adolescence Many inverts have not been to school at all and many who have been pass through school life without forming any passionate or sexual relationship but there remain a large number who date the development of homosexuality from the influences and examples of school life The impressions received at the time are not less potent because they are often purely sentimental and without any obvious sensual admixture Whether they are sufficiently potent to generate permanent inversion alone may be doubtful but if it is true that in early life the sexual instincts are less definitely determined than when adolescence is complete it is conceivable though unproved that a very strong impression acting even on a normal organism may cause arrest of sexual development on the psychic side Another exciting cause of inversion is seduction By this I mean the initiation of the young boy or girl by some older and more experienced person in whom inversion is already developed and who is seeking the gratification of the abnormal instinct This appears to be a not uncommon incident in the early history of sexual inverts That such seduction sometimes an abrupt and inconsiderate act of mere sexual gratification could by itself produce a taste for homosexuality is highly improbable in individuals not already predisposed it is far more likely to produce disgust as it did in the case of the youthful Rousseau He only can be seduced as Moll puts it who is capable of being seduced No doubt it frequently happens in these as so often in more normal seductions that the victim has offered a voluntary or involuntary invitation Another exciting cause of inversion to which little importance is usually attached but which I find to have some weight is disappointment in normal love It happens that a man in whom the homosexual instinct is yet only latent or at all events held in a state of repression tries to form a relationship with a woman This relationship may be ardent on one or both sides but often doubtless from the latent homosexuality of the lover it comes to nothing Such love disappointments in a more or less acute form occur at some time or another to nearly everyone But in these persons the disappointment with one woman constitutes motive strong enough to disgust the lover with the whole sex and to turn his attention toward his own sex It is evident that the instinct which can thus be turned round can scarcely be strong and it seems probable that in some of these cases the episode of normal love simply serves to bring home to the invert the fact that he is not made for normal love In other cases it seems especially those that are somewhat feeble minded and unbalanced a love disappointment really does poison the normal instinct and a more or less impotent love for women becomes an equally impotent love for men The prevalence of homosexuality among prostitutes may be to a large extent explained by a similar and better founded disgust with normal sexuality two hundred forty two These three influences therefore example at school seduction disappointment in normal love all of them drawing the subject away from the opposite sex and concentrating him on his own sex are exciting causes of inversion but they require a favorable organic predisposition to act on while there are a large number of cases in which no exciting cause at all can be found but in which from earliest childhood the subject s interest seems to be turned on his own sex and continues to be so turned throughout life At this point I conclude the analysis of the psychology of sexual inversion as it presents itself to me I have sought only to bring out the more salient points neglecting minor points neglecting also those groups of inverts who may be regarded as of secondary importance The average invert moving in ordinary society is a person of average general health though very frequently with hereditary relationships that are markedly neurotic He is usually the subject of a congenital predisposing abnormality or complexus of minor abnormalities making it difficult or impossible for him to feel sexual attraction to the opposite sex and easy to feel sexual attraction to his own sex This abnormality either appears spontaneously from the first by development or arrest of development or it is called into activity by some accidental circumstance FOOTNOTES two hundred twenty five See passim Jahrbuch fuer Psychoanalytische Forschungen Zentralblatt fuer Psychoanalyse and Internationale Zeitschrift

relations may be tinctured by all degrees of sexual love some of which are so faint and vague that they cannot be considered unnatural or abnormal it is misleading to term them incestuous The Russian novelist Artzibascheff in his Sanine described a brother s affection for his sister as thus touched with a perception of her sexual charm I refer to the French translation and the book has consequently been much abused as incestuous though the attitude described is very pale and conventional compared to the romantic passion sung in Shelley s Laon and Cythna or the tragic exaltation of the same passion in Ford s great play Tis Pity She s a Whore two hundred twenty eight Thus Numa Praetorius a sagacious observer with a very wide and thorough knowledge of homosexuality finds himself quite unable to accept the Oedipus Complex explanation of inversion Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen July nineteen fourteen p three hundred sixty two two hundred twenty nine It cannot be maintained that the frequency of inversion among the near relatives of inverts is a chance coincidence for it must be remembered that few estimates of the prevalence of inversion yield a higher proportion than three per cent two hundred thirty See also a discussion of the Freudian view by Hirschfeld who concludes Die Homosexualitaet p three hundred forty four that we can only accept the Freudian mechanism as rare and in all cases subordinate to organic predisposition two hundred thirty one It has been denied by some Meynert Naecke et cetera that there is any sexual instinct at all I may as well therefore explain in what sense I use the word See also Analysis of the Sexual Impulse in vol iii of these Studies I mean an inherited aptitude the performance of which normally demands for its full satisfaction the presence of a person of the opposite sex It might be asserted that there is no such thing as an instinct for food that it is all imitation et cetera In a sense this is true but the automatic basis remains A chicken from an incubator needs no hen to teach it to eat It seems to discover eating and drinking as it were by chance at first eating awkwardly and eating everything until it learns what will best satisfy its organic mechanism There is no instinct for food it may be but there is an instinct which is only satisfied by food It is the same with the sexual instinct The tentative and omnivorous habits of the newly hatched chicken may be compared to the uncertainty of the sexual instinct at puberty while the sexual pervert is like a chicken that should carry on into adult age an appetite for worsted and paper It may be added here that the question of the hereditary nature of the sexual instinct has been exhaustively discussed and decisively affirmed by Moll in his Untersuchungen ueber die Libido Sexualis eighteen ninety eight Moll attaches importance to the inheritance of the normal aptitudes for sexual reaction in an abnormally weak degree as a factor in the development of sexual perversions two hundred thirty two This view was revived in a modified form by Naecke Zeitschrift fuer die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie vol xv Heft five nineteen thirteen who supposed that there may be an anatomical homosexual center in the brain i e a feminine libido center in the inverted man and a masculine libido center in the inverted woman He expressed a hope that in the future the brains of inverted persons would be more carefully investigated two hundred thirty three I do not present this view as more than a picture which helps us to realize the actual phenomena which we witness in homosexuality although I may add that so able a teratologist as doctor J W Ballantyne considers that it seems a very possible theory two hundred thirty four This explanation of homosexuality has already been tentatively put forth Thus Iwan Bloch Sexual Life of Our Time ch xix Appendix vaguely suggests a new theory of homosexuality as dependent on chemical influences Hirschfeld also believes Die Homosexualitaet ch xx that the study of the internal secretions is the path to the deepest foundations of inversion two hundred thirty five A E Garrod

using the word degeneration thus Marro in his great work I Caratteri del Delinquenti made a notable attempt to analyze the phenomena lumped together as degenerate into three groups atypical atavistic and morbid two hundred forty one Hirschfeld and Burchard among two hundred inverts found pronounced stigmata of degeneration in only sixteen per cent Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet ch xx two hundred forty two Alcohol has sometimes been considered an important exciting cause of homosexuality and alcoholism is certainly not uncommon in the heredity of inverts according to Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p three hundred eighty six it is well marked in one of the parents in over twenty one per cent of cases But it probably has no more influence as an exciting cause in the individual homosexual person than in the individual heterosexual person From the Freudian standpoint indeed Abraham believes Zeitschrift fuer Sexualwissenschaft Heft eight nineteen oh eight that even in normal persons alcohol removes the inhibition from a latent homosexuality and Juliusburger from the same standpoint Zentralblatt fuer Psychoanalyse Heft ten and eleven nineteen twelve thinks that the alcoholic tendency is unconsciously aroused by the homosexual impulse in order to reach its own gratification But we may accept Naecke s conclusions Allgemeine Zeitschrift fuer Psychiatrie vol lxviii nineteen eleven p eight hundred fifty two that one alcohol cannot produce homosexuality in persons not predisposed that two it may arouse it in those who are predisposed that three the action of alcohol is the same on the homosexual as the heterosexual and that four alcoholism is not common among inverts CHAPTER VII CONCLUSIONS The Prevention of Homosexuality The Influence of the School Coeducation The Treatment of Sexual Inversion Castration Hypnotism Associational Therapy Psycho analysis Mental and Physical Hygiene Marriage The Children of Inverts The Attitude of Society The Horror Aroused by Homosexuality Justinian The Code Napoleon The State of the Law in Europe Today Germany England What Should be our Attitude toward Homosexuality Having now completed the psychological analysis of the sexual invert so far as I have been able to study him it only remains to speak briefly of the attitude of society and the law First however a few words as to the medical and hygienic aspects of inversion The preliminary question of the prevention of homosexuality is in too vague a position at present to be profitably discussed So far as the really congenital invert is concerned prevention can have but small influence but sound social hygiene should render difficult the acquisition of homosexual perversity or what has been termed pseudo homosexuality It is the school which is naturally the chief theater of immature and temporary homosexual manifestations partly because school life largely coincides with the period during which the sexual impulse frequently tends to be undifferentiated and partly because in the traditions of large and old schools an artificial homosexuality is often deeply rooted Homosexuality in English schools has already been briefly referred to in chapter iii As a precise and interesting picture of the phenomena in French schools I may mention a story by Albert Nortal Les Adolescents Passionnes nineteen thirteen written immediately after the author left college though not published until more than twenty five years later and clearly based on personal observation and experience As regards German schools see e g Moll Untersuchungen ueber die Libido Sexualis p four hundred forty nine et seq and for sexual manifestations in early life generally the same author s Sexual Life of the Child also Hirschfeld Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol v nineteen oh three p forty seven et seq and for references Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet p forty six et seq While much may be done by physical hygiene and other means to prevent the extension of homosexuality in schools two hundred forty three it is impossible and even undesirable to repress absolutely the emotional manifestations of sex in either boys or girls who have reached the age of puberty two hundred forty four It must always be remembered that profoundly rooted organic impulses cannot be effectually combated by direct methods Writing of a period two centuries ago Casanova in relating his early life as a seminarist trained to the priesthood describes the precautions taken to prevent the youths entering each other s beds and points out the folly of such precautions two hundred forty five As that master of the human heart remarks such prohibitions intensify the very evil they are intended to prevent by invoking in its aid the impulse to disobedience natural to every child of Adam and Eve and the observation has often been repeated by teachers since We probably have to recognize that a way to render such manifestations wholesome as well as to prepare for the relationships of later life is the adoption so far as possible of the method of coeducation of the sexes two hundred forty six not of course necessarily involving identity of education for both sexes since a certain amount of association between the sexes helps to preserve the healthiness of the sexual emotional attitude Association between the sexes will not of course prevent the development of congenital inversion In this connection it is pointed out by Bethe that it was precisely in Sparta and Lesbos where homosexuality was most ideally cultivated that the sexes so far as we know associated more freely than in any other Greek State two hundred forty seven The question of the treatment of homosexuality must be approached with discrimination caution and skepticism Nowadays we can have but little sympathy with those who at all costs are prepared to cure the invert There is no sound method of cure in radical cases At one time the seemingly very radical method of castration was advocated and occasionally carried out as in a case I have recorded in a previous chapter History XXVI Like all methods of treatment it is sometimes believed to have been successful by those who carried it out Usually after a short period it is found to be unsuccessful and in some cases the condition especially the mental condition is rendered worse It is not difficult to understand why this should be Sexual inversion is not a localized genital condition It is a diffused condition and firmly imprinted on the whole psychic state There may be reasons for castration or the slighter operation of vasectomy but although sexual tension may be thereby diminished no authority now believes that any such operation will affect the actual inversion Castration of the body in adult age cannot be expected to produce castration of the mind Moll Fere Naecke Bloch Rohleder Hirschfeld are all either opposed to castration for inversion or very doubtful as to any beneficial results In a case communicated to me by doctor Shufeldt an invert had himself castrated at the age of twenty six to diminish sexual desire make himself more like a woman and to stop growth of beard But the only apparent physical effect he wrote was to increase my weight ten per cent and render me a semi invalid for the rest of my life After two years my sexuality decreased but that may have been due to satiety or to advancing years I was also rendered more easily irritated over trifles and more revengeful Terrible criminal auto suggestions came into my head never experienced before Fere Revue de Chirurgie March ten nineteen oh five published the case of an invert of English origin who had been castrated The inverted impulse remained unchanged as well as sexual desire and the aptitude for erection but neurasthenic symptoms which had existed before were aggravated he felt less capable to resist his impulses became migratory in his habits of life and addicted to the use of laudanum In a case recorded by C H Hughes Alienist and Neurologist Aug nineteen fourteen the results were less unsatisfactory in this case the dorsal nerve of the penis was first excised without any result see also Alienist and Neurologist Feb nineteen oh four p seventy as regards worse than useless results of cutting the pudic nerve and a year or so later the testes were removed and the patient gained tranquillity and satisfaction his homosexual inclinations appeared to go and he began to show inclination for asexualized women being specially anxious to meet with a woman whose ovaries had been removed on account of inversion Reference may also be made to Naecke Die Ersten Kastrationen aus sozialen Grunden auf europaeischen Boden Neurologisches Centralblatt nineteen oh nine No five and E Wilhelm in Juristisch psychiatrische Grenzfragen vol viii Heft six and seven nineteen eleven More trust has usually been placed in the psychotherapeutical than the surgical treatment of homosexuality At one time hypnotic suggestion was carried out very energetically on homosexual subjects Krafft Ebing seems to have been the first distinguished advocate of hypnotism for application to the homosexual doctor von Schrenck Notzing displayed special zeal and persistency in this treatment He undertook to treat even the most pronounced cases of inversion by courses lasting more than a year and involving in at least one case nearly one hundred and fifty hypnotic sittings he prescribed frequent visits to the brothel previous to which the patient took large doses of alcohol by prolonged manipulations a prostitute endeavored to excite erection a process attended with varying results It appears that in some cases this course of treatment was attended by a certain sort of success to which an unlimited good will on the part of the patient it is needless to say largely contributed The treatment was however usually interrupted by continual backsliding to homosexual practices and sometimes naturally the cure involved a venereal disorder The patient was enabled to marry and to beget children two hundred forty eight It is a method of treatment which seems to have found few imitators This we need not regret The histories I have recorded in previous chapters show that it is not uncommon for even a pronounced invert to be able sometimes to effect coitus It often becomes easy if at the time he fixes his thoughts on images connected with his own sex But the perversion remains unaffected the subject is merely as one of Moll s inverts expressed it practising masturbation per vaginam Such treatment is a training in vice and as Raffalovich points out the invert is simply perverted and brought down to the vicious level which necessarily accompanies perversity two hundred forty nine There can be no doubt that in slight and superficial cases of homosexuality suggestion may really exert an influence We can scarcely expect it to exert such influence when the homosexual tendency is deeply rooted in an organic inborn temperament In such cases indeed the subject may resist suggestion even when in the hypnotic state This is pointed out by Moll a great authority on hypnotism and with much experience of its application to homosexuality but never inclined to encourage an exaggerated notion of its efficacy in this field Forel who was also an authority on hypnotism was equally doubtful as to its value in relation to inversion especially in clearly inborn cases Krafft Ebing at the end said little about it and Naecke who was himself without faith in this method of treating inversion stated that he had been informed by the last homosexual case treated by Krafft Ebing by hypnotism that in spite of all good will on the patient s side the treatment had been quite useless Fere also had no belief in the efficacy of suggestive treatment nor has Merzbach nor Rohleder Numa Praetorius states that the homosexual subjects he is acquainted with who had been so treated were not cured and Hirschfeld remarks that the inverts cured by hypnotism were either not cured or not inverted two hundred fifty Moll has shown his doubt as to the wide applicability of suggestive therapeutics in homosexuality by developing in recent years what he terms association therapy In nearly all perverse individuals he points out there is a bridge more or less weak no doubt which leads to the normal sexual life By developing such links of association with normality Moll believes it may be possible to exert a healing influence on the homosexual Thus a man who is attracted to boys may be brought to love a boyish woman two hundred fifty one Indications of this kind have long been observed and utilized though not developed into a systematic method of treatment In the case of bisexual individuals or of youthful subjects whose homosexuality is not fully developed it is probable that this method is beneficial It is difficult to believe however that it possesses any marked influence on pronounced and developed cases of inversion two hundred fifty two Somewhat the same aim as Moll s association therapy though on the basis of a more elaborate theory is sought by Freud s psychoanalytic method of treating homosexuality For the psychoanalytic theory to which reference was made in the previous chapter the congenital element of inversion is a rare and usually unimportant factor the chief part is played by perverse psychic mechanisms It is the business of psychoanalysis to straighten these out and from the bisexual constitution which is regarded as common to every one to bring into the foreground the heterosexual elements and so to reconstruct a normal personality developing new sexual ideals from the patient s own latent and subconscious nature Sadger has especially occupied himself with the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexuality and claims many successes two hundred fifty three Sadger admits that there are many limits to the success of this treatment and that it cannot affect the inborn factors of homosexuality when present Other psychoanalysts are less sanguine as to the cure of inversion Stekel appears to have stated that he has never seen a complete cure by psychoanalysis and Ferenezi is not able to give a good account of the results especially as regards what he terms obsessional homosexuality he states that he has never succeeded in effecting a complete cure although obsessions in general are especially amenable to psychoanalysis two hundred fifty four I have met with at least two homosexual persons who had undergone psychoanalytic treatment and found it beneficial One however was bisexual so that the difficulties in the way of the success granting it to be real were not serious In the other case the inversion persisted after treatment exactly the same as before The benefit he received was due to the fact that he was enabled to understand himself better and to overcome some of his mental difficulties The treatment therefore in his case was not a method of cure but of psychic hygiene of what Hirschfeld would call adaptation therapy There can be no doubt that even if we put aside all effort at cure and regard an invert s condition as inborn and permanent a large and important field of treatment here still remains As we have seen in the two previous chapters sexual inversion cannot be regarded as essentially an insane or psychopathic state two hundred fifty five But it is frequently associated with nervous conditions which may be greatly benefited by hygiene and treatment without any attempt at all to overcome a homosexual attitude which may be too deeply rooted to be changed The invert is specially liable to suffer from a high degree of neurasthenia often involving much nervous weakness and irritability loss of self control and genital hyperesthesia two hundred fifty six Hirschfeld finds that over sixty seven per cent inverts suffer from nervous troubles and among the cases dealt with in the present Study as shown in chapter v slight nervous functional disturbances are very common These are conditions which may be ameliorated and they may be treated in much the same way as if no inversion existed by physical and mental tonics or if necessary sedatives by regulated gymnastics and out of door exercises and by occupations which employ without overexerting the mind Very great and permanent benefit may be obtained by a prolonged course of such mental and physical hygiene the associated neurasthenic conditions may be largely removed with the morbid fears suspicions and irritabilities that are usually part of neurasthenia and the invert may be brought into a fairly wholesome and tonic condition of self control The inversion is not thus removed But if the patient is still young and if the perversion does not appear to be deeply rooted in the organism it is probable that provided his own good will is aiding general hygienic measures together with removal to a favorable environment may gradually lead to the development of the normal sexual impulse If it fails to do so it becomes necessary to exercise great caution in recommending stronger methods Purely Platonic association with the other sex Moll points out leads to better results than any prescribed attempt at coitus For even when such attempt is successful it is not usually possible to regard the results with much satisfaction Not only is the acquisition of the normal instinct by an invert very much on a level with the acquisition of a vice but probably it seldom succeeds in eradicating the original inverted instinct two hundred fifty seven What usually happens is that the person becomes capable of experiencing both impulses not a specially satisfactory state of things It may be disastrous especially if it leads to marriage as it may do in an inverted man or still more easily in an inverted woman The apparent change does not turn out to be deep and the invert s position is more unfortunate than his original position both for himself and for his wife two hundred fifty eight It may be observed in the Histories brought forward in chapter iii that the position of married inverts we must of course put aside the bisexual is usually more distressing than that of the unmarried Among my cases fourteen per cent are married Hirschfeld finds that sixteen per cent of inverts are married and fifty per cent are impotent he is unable to find a single cure of homosexuality and seldom any improvement due to marriage nearly always the impulse remains unaffected The invert s happiness is however often affected for the worse and not least by the feeling that he is depriving his wife of happiness An invert who had left his country through fear of arrest and married a rich woman who was in love with him said to Hirschfeld Five years imprisonment would not have been worse than one year of marriage two hundred fifty nine In a marriage of this kind the homosexual partner and the normal partner however ignorant of sexual matters are both conscious often with equal pain that even in the presence of affection and esteem and the best will in the world there is something lacking The instinctive and emotional element which is the essence of sexual love and springs from the central core of organic personality cannot voluntarily be created or even assumed two hundred sixty For the sake of the possible offspring also marriage is to be avoided It is sometimes entirely for the sake of children that the invert desires to marry But it must be pointed out that homosexuality is undoubtedly in many cases inherited Often it is true the children turn out fairly well but in many cases they bear witness that they belong to a neurotic and failing stock two hundred sixty one Hirschfeld goes so far as to say that it is always so and concludes that from the eugenic standpoint the marriage of a homosexual person is always very risky In a large number of cases such marriages prove sterile The tendency to sexual inversion in eccentric and neurotic families seems merely to be nature s merciful method of winding up a concern which from her point of view has ceased to be profitable As a rule inverts have no desire to be different from what they are and if they have any desire for marriage it is usually only momentary Very pathetic appeals for help are however sometimes made I may quote from a letter addressed to me by a gentleman who desired advice on this matter In part I write to you as a moralist and in part as to a physician doctor Q has published a book in which without discussion hypnotic treatment of such cases was reported as successful I am eager to know if your opinion remains what it was This new assurance comes from a man whose moral firmness and delicacy are unquestionable but you will easily imagine how one might shrink from the implantation of new impulses in the unconscious self since newly created inclinations might disturb the conditions of life At any rate in my ignorance of hypnotism I fear that the effort to give the normal instinct might lead to marriage without the assurance that the normal instinct would be stable I write therefore to explain my present condition and crave your counsel It is with the greatest reluctance that I reveal the closely guarded secret of my life I have no other abnormality and have not hitherto betrayed my abnormal instinct I have never made any person the victim of passion moral and religious feelings were too powerful I have found my reverence for other souls a perfect safeguard against any approach to impurity I have never had sexual interest in women Once I had a great friendship with a beautiful and noble woman without any mixture of sexual feeling on my part I was ignorant of my condition and I have the bitter regret of having caused in her a hopeless love proudly and tragically concealed to her death My friendships with men younger men have been colored by passion against which I have fought continually The shame of this has made life a hell and the horror of this abnormality since I came to know it as such has been an enemy to my religious faith Here there could be no case of a divinely given instinct which I was to learn to use in a rational and chaste fashion under the control of spiritual loyalty The power which gave me life seemed to insist on my doing that for which the same power would sting me with remorse If there is no remedy I must either cry out against the injustice of this life of torment between nature and conscience or submit to the blind trust of baffled ignorance If there is a remedy life will not seem to be such an intolerable ordeal I am not pleading that I must succumb to impulse I do not doubt that a pure celibate life is possible so far as action is concerned But I cannot discover that friendship with younger men can go on uncolored by a sensuous admixture which fills me with shame and loathing The gratification of passion normal or abnormal is repulsive to esthetic feeling I am nearly forty two and I have always diverted myself from personal interests that threatened to become dangerous to me More than a year ago however a new fate seemed to open to my unhappy and lonely life I became intimate with a young man of twenty of the rarest beauty of form and character I am confident that he is and always has been pure He lives an exalted moral and religious life dominated by the idea that he and all men are partners of the divine nature and able in the strength of that nature to be free from evil I believe him to be normal He shows pleasure in the society of attractive young women and in an innocent light hearted way refers to the time when he may be able to marry He is a general favorite but turned to me as to a friend and teacher He is poor and it was possible for me to guarantee him a good education I began to help him from the longings of a lonely life I wanted a son and a friend in my inward desolation I craved the companionship of this pure and happy nature I felt such a reverence for him that I hoped to find the sensuous element in me purged away by his purity I am indeed utterly incapable of doing him harm I am not morally weak nevertheless the sensuous element is there and it poisons my happiness He is ardently affectionate and demonstrative He spends the summers with me in Europe and the tenderness he feels for me has prompted him at times to embrace and kiss me as he always has done to his father Of late I have begun to fear that without will or desire I may injure the springs of feeling in him especially if it is true that the homosexual tendency is latent in most men The love he shows me is my joy but a poisoned joy It is the bread and wine of life to me but I dare not think what his ardent affection might ripen into I can go on fighting the battle of good and evil in my attachment to him but I cannot define my duty to him To shun him would be cruelty and would belie his trust in human fidelity Without my friendship he will not take my money the condition of a large career I might indeed explain to him what I explain to you but the ordeal and shame are too great and I cannot see what good it would do If he has the capacity of homosexual feeling he might be violently stimulated if he is incapable of it he would feel repulsion Suppose then that I should seek hypnotic treatment I still do not know what tricks an abnormal nature might play me when diverted by suggestion I might lose the joy of this friendship without any compensation I am afraid I am afraid Might I not be influenced to shun the only persons who inspire unselfish feeling Bear with this account of my story Many virtues are easy for me and my life is spent in pursuits of culture Alas that all the culture with which I am credited all the prayers and aspirations all the strong will and heroic resolves have not rid my nature of this evil bent What I long for is the right to love not for the mere physical gratification for the right to take another into the arms of my heart and profess all the tenderness I feel to find my joy in planning his career with him as one who is rightfully and naturally entitled to do so I crave this since I cannot have a son I leave the matter here When I read what I have written I see how pointless it is It is possible indeed that brooding over my personal calamity magnifies in my mind the sense of danger to this friend through me and that I only need to find the right relation of friendliness coupled with aloofness which will secure him against any too ardent attachment Certainly I have no fear that I shall forget myself Yet two things array themselves on the other side I rebel inwardly against the necessity of isolating myself as if I were a pestilence and I rebel against the taint of sensuous feeling The normal man can feel that his instinct is no shame when the spirit is in control I know that to the consciousness of others my instinct itself would be a shame and a baseness and I have no tendency to construct a moral system for myself I have to be sure moments when I declare to myself that I will have my sensuous gratification as well as other men but the moment I think of the wickedness of it the rebellion is soon over The disesteem of self the sense of taint the necessity of withdrawing from happiness lest I communicate my taint that is a spiritual malady which makes the ground tone of my existence one of pain and melancholy Should you have only some moral consolation without the promise of medical assistance I should feel grateful In such a case as this one can do little more than advise the sufferer that however painful his lot may be it is not without its consolations and that he would be best advised to pursue as cheerfully as may be the path that he has already long since marked out for himself The invert sometimes fails to realize that for no man with high moral ideals however normal he may be is the conduct of life easy and that if the invert has to be satisfied with affection without passion and to live a life of chastity he is doing no more than thousands of normal men have done voluntarily and contentedly As to hypnotism in such a case as this it is altogether unreasonable to expect that suggestion will supplant the deeply rooted organic impulses that have grown up during a lifetime We may thus conclude that in the treatment of inversion the most satisfactory result is usually obtained when it is possible by direct and indirect methods to reduce the sexual hyperesthesia which frequently exists and by psychic methods to refine and spiritualize the inverted impulse so that the invert s natural perversion may not become a cause of acquired perversity in others The invert is not only the victim of his own abnormal obsession he is the victim of social hostility We must seek to distinguish the part in his sufferings due to these two causes When I review the cases I have brought forward and the mental history of inverts I have known I am inclined to say that if we can enable an invert to be healthy selfrestrained and selfrespecting we have often done better than to convert him into the mere feeble simulacrum of a normal man An appeal to the paiderastia of the best Greek days and the dignity temperance even chastity which it involved will sometimes find a ready response in the emotional enthusiastic nature of the congenital invert Plato s Dialogues have frequently been found a source of great help and consolation by inverts The manly love celebrated by Walt Whitman in Leaves of Grass although it may be of more doubtful value for general use furnishes a wholesome and robust ideal to the invert who is insensitive to normal ideals two hundred sixty two Among recent books Iolaeus An Anthology of Friendship edited by Edward Carpenter may be recommended A similar book in German of a more extended character is Lieblingminne und Freudesliebe in der Weltliteratur edited by Elisar von Kupffer Mention may also be made of the Freundschaft nineteen twelve of Baron von Gleichen Russwurm a sort of literary history of friendship without specific reference to homosexuality although many writers of inverted tendency are introduced Platen s Tagebuecher are notable as the diary of an invert of high character and ideals The volumes of the Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen contain many studies bearing on the ideal and esthetic aspects of homosexuality Various modern poets of high ability have given expression to emotions of exalted or passionate friendship toward individuals of the same sex whether or not such friendship can properly be termed homosexual It is scarcely necessary to refer to In Memoriam in which Tennyson enshrined his affection for his early friend Arthur Hallam and developed a picture of the universe on the basis of that affection The poems of Edward Cracroft Lefroy are notable and mister John Gambril Nicholson has privately issued several volumes of verse A Chaplet of Southernwood A Garland of Ladslove et cetera showing delicate charm combined with high technical skill Some books mainly or entirely written in prose may fairly be included in the same group Such are In the Key of Blue by John Addington Symonds and the Memoirs of Arthur Hamilton published anonymously by a well known author A C Benson in which on somewhat Platonic lines the idea is worked out that the individual sufferer must pass from the love of one fair form to the love of abstract beauty and from the contemplation of his own suffering to the consideration of the root of all human suffering As regards the modern poetic literature of feminine homosexuality there is probably nothing to put beside the various volumes pathetic in their brave simplicity and sincerity of Renee Vivien see ante p two hundred Most other feminine singers of homosexuality have cautiously thrown a veil of heterosexuality over their songs Novels of a more or less definitely homosexual tone are now very numerous in English French German and other languages In English the homosexuality is for the most part veiled and the narrative deals largely with school life and boys in order that the emotional and romantic character of the relations described may appear more natural Thus Tim an anonymously published book by H O Sturgis eighteen ninety one described the devotion of a boy to an older boy at Eton and his death at an early age Jaspar Tristram by A W Clarke eighteen ninety nine again is a well written story of a schoolboy friendship of homosexual tone a boy is represented as feeling attraction to boys who are like girls and a girl became attractive to the hero because she is like a boy and recalls her brother whom he had formerly loved The Garden God A Tale of Two Boys by Forrest Reid nineteen oh five is another rather similar book in its way a charming and delicately written idyll Imre A Memorandum nineteen oh six by Xavier Mayne the pseudonym of an American author who has also written The Intersexes privately issued at Naples is a book of a different class representing the frankly homosexual passion of two mutually attracted men an Englishman who is supposed to write the story and a Hungarian officer it embodies a notable narrative of homosexual development which is probably more or less real In French there are a number of novels dealing with homosexuality sometimes sympathetically sometimes with artistic indifference sometimes satirically Andre Gide in L Immoraliste and other books Rachilde Madame Vallette Willy in the well known Claudine series may be mentioned among other writers of more or less distinction who have once or oftener dealt with homosexuality Special reference should be made to the Belgian author George Eekhoud whose Escal Vigor prosecuted at Bruges on its publication is a book of special power The homosexual stories of Essebac of which L Elu nineteen oh two is considered the best are of a romantic and sentimental character Lucien nineteen ten by Binet Valmer is a penetrating and scarcely sympathetic study of inversion Nortal s Les Adolescents Passionnes already mentioned p three hundred twenty five is a notably intimate and precise study of homosexuality in French schools It would be easy to mention many others In Germany during recent years many novels of homosexual character have been published They are not usually it would seem of high literary character but are sometimes notable as being more or less disguised narratives of real fact Body s Aus Eines Mannes Maedchenjahren is said to be a faithful autobiography Der Neue Werther eine Hellenische Passions geschichte by Narkissos nineteen oh two is also said to be authentic Another book that may be mentioned is Konradin s Ein Junger Platos Aus dem Leben eines Entgbeistes nineteen fourteen The German belletristic literature of homosexuality as well as that of other countries will be found adequately summarized and criticised by Numa Praetorius in the volumes of the Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen See also Hirschfeld s Die Homosexualitaet pp forty seven and ten eighteen et seq It is by some such method of self treatment as this that most of the more highly intelligent men and women whose histories I have already briefly recorded have at last slowly and instinctively reached a condition of relative health and peace both physical and moral The method of self restraint and self culture without self repression seems to be the most rational method of dealing with sexual inversion when that condition is really organic and deeply rooted It is better that a man should be enabled to make the best of his own strong natural instincts with all their disadvantages than that he should be unsexed and perverted crushed into a position which he has no natural aptitude to occupy As both Raffalovich and Fere have insisted it is the ideal of chastity rather than of normal sexuality which the congenital invert should hold before his eyes He may not have in him the making of l homme moyen sensuel he may have in him the making of a saint two hundred sixty three What good work in the world the inverted may do is shown by the historical examples of distinguished inverts and while it is certainly true that these considerations apply chiefly to the finer grained natures the histories I have brought together suffice to show that such natures constitute a considerable proportion of inverts The helplessly gross sexual appetite cannot thus be influenced but that remains true whether the appetite is homosexual or heterosexual and nothing is gained by enabling it to feed on women as well as on men A strictly ascetic life it needs scarcely be said is with difficulty possible for all persons either homosexual or heterosexual It is however outside the province of the physician to recommend his inverted patients to live according to their homosexual impulses even when those impulses seem to be natural to the person displaying them The most that the physician is entitled to do it seems to me is to present the situation clearly and leave to the patient a decision for which he must himself accept the responsibility Forel goes so far as to say that he sees no reason why inverts should not build cities of their own and marry each other if they so please since they can do no harm to normal adults while children can be protected from them two hundred sixty four Such notions are however too far removed from our existing social conventions to be worth serious consideration The standpoint here taken up it may be remarked by no means denies to the invert a right to the fulfillment of his impulses Numa Praetorius remarks it would seem justly that while the invert must properly be warned against unnatural sexual license and while those who are capable of continence do well to preserve it to deny all right to sexual activity to the invert merely causes those inverts who are incapable of self control to throw recklessly aside all restraints Zeitschrift fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol viii nineteen oh six p seven hundred twenty six The invert has the right to sexual indulgence it may be but he has also the duty to accept the full responsibility for his own actions and the necessity to recognize the present attitude of the society he lives in He cannot be advised to set himself in violent opposition to that society The world will not be a tolerable place for pronounced inverts until they are better understood and that will involve a radical change in general and even medical opinion An inverted physician of high character and successful in his profession writes to me on this point The first and easiest thing to do it seems to me is to convince the medical profession that we unfortunate people are not only as sane but as moral as our normal brothers and that we are even more alive to the supreme necessity of self control necessary from every point of view than they It is not license we want but justice it is the cruelty and prejudice of convention which we wish to abolish not the proper and just indignation of society with crimes against the social order We want to make it possible for us to satisfy our inborn instincts which are not concerned essentially with sexual acts so called alone without thereby becoming criminals One of us who would under any circumstances seduce a person of his own sex of immature age and particularly one whose sexual complexion was unknown deserves the severe punishment which would be meted out to a normal person who did the same to a young girl but no more while so long as no public offense is given there should be no penalty or obloquy whatever attached to sexual acts committed with full consent between mature persons These acts may or may not be wrong and immoral just as sexual acts between mature persons of different sexes may or may not be wrong or immoral But in neither case has the law any concern and public opinion should make no distinction between the two It is in the highest degree important that it should be clearly understood that we want no relaxation of moral obligations At present we suffer an inconceivably cruel wrong We have always to remember and there is indeed no possibility of forgetting that the question of homosexuality is a social question Within certain limits the gratification of the normal sexual impulse even outside marriage arouses no general or profound indignation and is regarded as a private matter rightly or wrongly the gratification of the homosexual impulse is regarded as a public matter This attitude is more or less exactly reflected in the law Thus it happens that whenever a man is openly detected in a homosexual act however exemplary his life may previously have been however admirable it may still be in all other relations every ordinary normal citizen however licentious and pleasure loving his own life may be feels it a moral duty to regard the offender as hopelessly damned and to help in hounding him out of society At very brief intervals cases occur and without reaching the newspapers are more or less widely known in which distinguished men in various fields not seldom clergymen suddenly disappear from the country or commit suicide in consequence of some such exposure or the threat of it It is probable that many obscure tragedies could find their explanation in a homosexual cause Some of the various tragic ways in which homosexual passions are revealed to society may be illustrated by the following communication from a correspondent not himself inverted who here narrates cases that came under his observation in various parts of the United States The cases referred to will be known to many but I have disguised the names of persons and places At the age of fourteen I was a chorister at church whose choirmaster an Englishman named M W M was an accomplished man seemingly a perfect gentleman and a devout churchman He never seemed to care for the society of ladies never mingled much with the men but sought companionship with the choristers of my age He frequently visited at the homes of his favorites to tea and when he asked the parents consent for George s or Frank s company on an excursion or to the theater and then to spend the night with him such request was invariably granted I shall ever remember my first night with him he began by fondling and caressing me quieting my alarm by assurances of not hurting me and after invoking me to secrecy and with promises of many future pleasures I consented to his desire or passion which he seemed to satisfy by an attempt at fellatio Was this depravity I would say No after reading his subsequent confession found in his room after his death by suicide This was brought about by his too intimate relations with the rector s son who contracted saint Vitus s dance and in the delirium of a fever that followed from nervous exhaustion told of him and his doings A thorough investigation took place and M fled a broken hearted and disgraced man who as the result of remorse relentless persecution and exposure through several years ended his life by drowning himself In his confession he spoke of having been raised under a very strong moral restraint and having lived an exemplary life with the exception of this strange desire that his will power could not control The next case is that of C H He came of an old family of brainy men who have and do yet occupy prominent places in the pulpit and the bar and was himself a gifted young attorney I knew him intimately as for six years he was a close neighbor and we were associated in lodge work He was an effeminate little fellow height five feet two inches weight one hundred five pounds very near sighted and he had a light voice not a treble or falsetto but still a voice that detracted materially from the beautiful rhetoric that flowed from his lips He had served his country as its representative in the Legislature and had received the nomination for senator over a hard fought political battle The last canvass and speeches were made at a town which was in consequence crowded That night H had to occupy a room with a stranger named E a travelling salesman There were two beds in this room mister E on the following day told several people that during the night he was awakened by H who had come over to his bed and had his mouth on his person and that he had threatened to kick him out of the room but that H pleaded with him and fell on his knees and swore that he had been overcome by a passion that he had heretofore controlled and begged of him not to expose him These facts coming to the notice of his opponents within twenty four hours they hastened to take advantage of it by placarding H as a second Oscar Wilde and stating the facts as far as decency and the law allowed H s friends came to him and gave him one of two alternatives if guilty either to kill himself or leave that section forever if not guilty to slay his traducer E H affirmed his innocence and in company with two friends C and J took the train for Learning there that E was at a town twelve miles east they hired a fast livery and drove overland They found E at the station awaiting the arrival of a train H with a pistol strode forward and in his excitement said You exposed me did you Being near sighted his aim proved wide of the mark E sprang forward and grappled with H for possession of the pistol and was fired upon by C and J who shot him in the back He expired in a few minutes his last statement being to the effect that H was guilty as accused H C and J were sentenced to the penitentiary for life During my six years acquaintance with H I knew of nothing derogatory to his character nor has anyone ever come forward to say that on any other occasion he ever displayed this weakness I know his early life had a pure atmosphere as he was an only child and the idol of both his parents who builded high their hopes of his future success and who survive this disgrace but are broken hearted The next case is that of the reverend T W professor at the University of mister W is a scholarly gentleman affable in his address eloquent in his oratory and a fine classical scholar He was exposed by some of his students who to use a slang phrase accused him of being a head worker At his examination by the faculty he confessed his weakness and said he could not control his unholy passion His resignation was accepted both by the church and the college and he left I know of a few other cases that have their peculiar traits and am confident that these persons did not become possessed of this habit through the so called indiscretions of youth as in every case their early life was freer from contamination than that of ninety per cent of the boys who on reaching man s estate have like myself no desire to deviate from the old fashioned way formulated by our ancient sire Adam It can scarcely be said that the consciousness of this attitude of society is favorable to the invert s attainment of a fairly sane and well balanced state of mind This is indeed one of the great difficulties in his way and often causes him to waver between extremes of melancholia and egotistic exaltation We regard all homosexuality with absolute and unmitigated disgust We have been taught to venerate Alexander the Great Epaminondas Socrates and other antique heroes but they are safely buried in the remote past and do not affect our scorn of homosexuality in the present It was in the fourth century at Rome that the strong modern opposition to homosexuality was first clearly formulated in law two hundred sixty five The Roman race had long been decaying sexual perversions of all kinds flourished the population was dwindling At the same time Christianity with its Judaic Pauline antagonism to homosexuality was rapidly spreading The statesmen of the day anxious to quicken the failing pulses of national life utilized this powerful Christian feeling Constantine Theodosius and Valentinian all passed laws against homosexuality the last at all events ordaining as penalty the vindices flammae but their enactments do not seem to have been strictly carried out In the year five hundred thirty eight Justinian professing terror of certain famines earthquakes and pestilences in which he saw the mysterious recompense which was meet prophesied by saint Paul two hundred sixty six issued his edict condemning unnatural offenders to the sword lest as the result of these impious acts as the preamble to his Novella seventy seven has it whole cities should perish together with their inhabitants for we are taught by Holy Scripture that through these acts cities have perished with the men in them two hundred sixty seven This edict which Justinian followed up by a fresh ordinance to the same effect constituted the foundation of legal enactment and social opinion concerning the matter in Europe for thirteen hundred years two hundred sixty eight In France the vindices flammae survived to the last saint Louis had handed over these sacrilegious offenders to the Church to be burned in seventeen fifty two pederasts were burned in the Place de Greve and only a few years before the Revolution a Capuchin monk named Pascal was also burned After the Revolution however began a new movement which has continued slowly and steadily ever since though it still divides European nations into two groups Justinian Charlemagne and saint Louis had insisted on the sin and sacrilege of sodomy as the ground for its punishment two hundred sixty nine It was doubtless largely as a religious offense that the Code Napoleon omitted to punish it The French law makes a clear and logical distinction between crime on the one hand vice and irreligion on the other only concerning itself with the former Homosexual practices in private between two consenting adult parties whether men or women are absolutely unpunished by the Code Napoleon and by French law of today Only under three conditions does the homosexual act come under the cognizance of the law as a crime one when there is outrage public a la pudeur i e when the act is performed in public or with a possibility of witnesses two when there is violence or absence of consent in whatever degree the act may have been consummated three when one of the parties is under age or unable to give valid consent in some cases it appears possible to apply Article three hundred thirty four of the penal code directed against habitual excitation to debauch of young persons of either sex under the age of twenty one This method of dealing with unnatural offenses has spread widely at first because of the political influence of France and more recently because such an attitude has commended itself on its merits In Belgium the law is similar to that of the Code Napoleon as it is also in Italy Spain Portugal Roumania Japan and numerous South American lands In Switzerland the law is a little vague and varies slightly in the different cantons but it is not severe in Geneva and some other cantons there is no penalty the general tendency is to inflict brief imprisonment when serious complaints have been lodged and cases can sometimes be settled privately by the magistrate The only large European countries in which homosexuality per se remains a penal offense appear to be Germany Austria Russia and England In several of the German States such as Bavaria and Hanover simple homosexuality formerly went unpunished but when the laws of Prussia were in eighteen seventy one applied to the new German Empire this ceased to be the case and unnatural carnality between males became an offense against the law This article of the German Code Section one hundred seventy five has caused great discussion and much practical difficulty because although the terms of the law make it necessary to understand by widernatuerliche Unzucht other practices besides paedicatio not every homosexual practice is included it must be some practice resembling normal coitus There is a widespread opinion that this article of the code should be abolished it appears that at one time an authoritative committee pronounced in favor of this step and their proposition came near adoption The Austrian law is somewhat similar to the German but it applies to women as well as to men this is logical for there is no reason why homosexuality should be punished in men and left unpunished in women In Russia the law against homosexual practices appears to be very severe involving in some cases banishment to Siberia and deprivation of civil rights but it can scarcely be rigorously executed The existing law in England is severe but simple Carnal knowledge per anum of either a man or a woman or an animal is punishable by a sentence of penal servitude with not less than three years or of imprisonment with not more than two years Even gross indecency between males however privately committed has been since eighteen eighty five a penal offense two hundred seventy The clause is open to criticism With the omission of the words or private it would be sound and in harmony with the most enlightened European legislation but it must be pointed out that an act only becomes indecent when those who perform it or witness it regard it as indecent The act which brought each of us into the world is not indecent it would become so if carried on in public If two male persons who have reached years of discretion consent together to perform some act of sexual intimacy in private no indecency has been committed If one of the consenting parties subsequently proclaims the act indecency may doubtless be created as may happen also in the case of normal sexual intercourse but it seems contrary to good policy that such proclamation should convert the act itself into a penal offense Moreover gross indecency between males usually means some form of mutual masturbation no penal code regards masturbation as an offense and there seems to be no sufficient reason why mutual masturbation should be so regarded two hundred seventy one The main point to be insured is that no boy or girl who has not reached years of discretion should be seduced or abused by an older person and this point is equally well guaranteed on the basis introduced by the Code Napoleon However shameful disgusting personally immoral and indirectly antisocial it may be for two adult persons of the same sex men or women to consent together to perform an act of sexual intimacy in private there is no sound or adequate ground for constituting such act a penal offense by law One of the most serious objections to the legal recognition of private gross indecency is the obvious fact that only in the rarest cases can such indecency become known to the police and we thus perpetrate what is very much like a legal farce The breaking of few laws as Moll truly observes regarding the German law so often goes unpunished as of this It is the same in England as is amply evidenced by the fact that of the English sexual inverts whose histories I have obtained not one so far as I am aware has ever appeared in a police court on this charge It may further be pointed out that legislation against homosexuality has no clear effect either in diminishing or increasing its prevalence This must necessarily be so as regards the kernel of the homosexual group if we are to regard a considerable proportion of cases as congenital In France homosexuality per se has been untouched by the law for a century yet it abounds chiefly it seems among the lowest in the community although the law is silent social feeling is strong and when as has been the case in one instance a man of undoubted genius has his name associated with this perversion it becomes difficult or impossible for the admirers of his work to associate with him personally very few cases of homosexuality have been recorded in France among the more intelligent classes the literature of homosexuality is there little more than the literature of male prostitution as described by police officials and as carried on largely for the benefit of foreigners In Germany and Austria where the law against homosexuality is severe it abounds also perhaps to a much greater extent than in France two hundred seventy two it certainly asserts itself more vigorously a far greater number of cases have been recorded than in any other country and the German literature of homosexuality is very extensive often issued in popular form and sometimes enthusiastically eulogistic In England the law is exceptionally severe yet according to the evidence of those who have an international acquaintance with these matters homosexuality is fully as prevalent as on the Continent some would say that it is more so Much the same is true of the United States though there is less to be seen on the surface It cannot therefore be said that legislative enactments have very much influence on the prevalence of homosexuality The chief effect seems to be that the attempt at suppression arouses the finer minds among sexual inverts to undertake the enthusiastic defense of homosexuality while coarser minds are stimulated to cynical bravado two hundred seventy three As regards the prevalence of homosexuality in the United States I may quote from a well informed American correspondent The great prevalence of sexual inversion in American cities is shown by the wide knowledge of its existence Ninety nine normal men out of a hundred have been accosted on the streets by inverts or have among their acquaintances men whom they know to be sexually inverted Everyone has seen inverts and knows what they are The public attitude toward them is generally a negative one indifference amusement contempt The world of sexual inverts is indeed a large one in any American city and it is a community distinctly organized words customs traditions of its own and every city has its numerous meeting places certain churches where inverts congregate certain cafes well known for the inverted character of their patrons certain streets where at night every fifth man is an invert The inverts have their own clubs with nightly meetings These clubs are really dance halls attached to saloons and presided over by the proprietor of the saloon himself almost invariably an invert as are all the waiters and musicians The frequenters of these places are male sexual inverts usually ranging from seventeen to thirty years of age sightseers find no difficulty in gaining entrance truly they are welcomed for the drinks they buy for the company and other reasons Singing and dancing turns by certain favorite performers are the features of these gatherings with much gossip and drinking at the small tables ranged along the four walls of the room The habitues of these places are generally inverts of the most pronounced type i e the completely feminine in voice and manners with the characteristic hip motion in their walk though I have never seen any approach to feminine dress there doubtless the desire for it is not wanting and only police regulations relegate it to other occasions and places You will rightly infer that the police know of these places and endure their existence for a consideration it is not unusual for the inquiring stranger to be directed there by a policeman The Oscar Wilde trial see ante p forty eight with its wide publicity and the fundamental nature of the questions it suggested appears to have generally contributed to give definiteness and self consciousness to the manifestations of homosexuality and to have aroused inverts to take up a definite attitude I have been assured in several quarters that this is so and that since that case the manifestations of homosexuality have become more pronounced One correspondent writes Up to the time of the Oscar Wilde trial I had not known what the condition of the law was The moral question in itself its relation to my own life and that of my friends I reckoned I had solved but I now had to ask myself how far I was justified in not only breaking the law but in being the cause of a like breach in others and others younger than myself I have never allowed the dictum of the law to interfere with what I deemed to be a moral development in any youth for whom I am responsible I cannot say that the trial made me alter my course of life of the rightness of which I was too convincingly persuaded but it made me much more careful and it probably sharpened my sense of responsibility for the young Reviewing the results of the trial as a whole it doubtless did incalculable harm and it intensified our national vice of hypocrisy But I think it also may have done some good in that it made those who like myself have thought and experienced deeply in the matter and these must be no small few ready to strike a blow when the time comes for what we deem to be right honorable and clean From America a lady writes with reference to the moral position of inverts though without allusion to the Wilde trial Inverts should have the courage and independence to be themselves and to demand an investigation If one strives to live honorably and considers the greatest good to the greatest number it is not a crime nor a disgrace to be an invert I do not need the law to defend me neither do I desire to have any concessions made for me nor do I ask my friends to sacrifice their ideals for me I too have ideals which I shall always hold All that I desire and I claim it as my right is the freedom to exercise this divine gift of loving which is not a menace to society nor a disgrace to me Let it once be understood that the average invert is not a moral degenerate nor a mental degenerate but simply a man or a woman who is less highly specialized less completely differentiated than other men and women and I believe the prejudice against them will disappear and if they live uprightly they will surely win the esteem and consideration of all thoughtful people I know what it means to an invert who feels himself set apart from the rest of mankind to find one human heart who trusts him and understands him and I know how almost impossible this is and will be until the world is made aware of these facts But while the law has had no more influence in repressing abnormal sexuality than wherever it has tried to do so it has had in repressing the normal sexual instinct it has served to foster another offense What is called blackmailing in England chantage in France and Erpressung in Germany in other words the extortion of money by threats of exposing some real or fictitious offense finds its chief field of activity in connection with homosexuality two hundred seventy four No doubt the removal of the penalty against simple homosexuality does not abolish blackmailing as the existence of this kind of chantage in France shows but it renders its success less probable On all these grounds and taking into consideration the fact that the tendency of modern legislation generally and the consensus of authoritative opinion in all countries are in this direction it seems reasonable to conclude that neither sodomy i e immissio membri in anum hominis vel mulieris nor gross indecency ought to be penal offenses except under certain special circumstances That is to say that if two persons of either or both sexes having reached years of discretion two hundred seventy five privately consent to practise some perverted mode of sexual relationship the law cannot be called upon to interfere It should be the function of the law in this matter to prevent violence to protect the young and to preserve public order and decency Whatever laws are laid down beyond this must be left to the individuals themselves to the moralists and to social opinion At the same time and while such a modification in the law seems to be reasonable the change effected would be less considerable than may appear at first sight In a very large proportion indeed of cases boys are involved It is instructive to observe that in Legludic s two hundred forty six cases including victims and aggressors together in France one hundred twenty seven or more than half were between the ages of ten and twenty and eighty two or exactly one third were between the ages of ten and fourteen A very considerable field of operation is thus still left for the law whatever proportion of cases may meet with no other penalty than social opinion That however social opinion law or no law will speak with no uncertain voice is very evident Once homosexuality was primarily a question of population or of religion Now we hear little either of its economic aspects or of its sacrilegiousness it is for us primarily a disgusting abomination i e a matter of taste of esthetics and while unspeakably ugly to the majority it is proclaimed as beautiful by a small minority I do not know that we need find fault with this esthetic method of judging homosexuality But it scarcely lends itself to legal purposes To indulge in violent denunciation of the disgusting nature of homosexuality and to measure the sentence by the disgust aroused or to regret as one English judge is reported to have regretted when giving sentence that gross indecency is not punishable by death is to import utterly foreign considerations into the matter The judges who yield to this temptation would certainly never allow themselves to be consciously influenced on the bench by their political opinions Yet esthetic opinions are quite as foreign to law as political opinions An act does not become criminal because it is disgusting To eat excrement as Moll remarks is extremely disgusting but it is not criminal The confusion which thus exists even in the legal mind between the disgusting and the criminal is additional evidence of the undesirability of the legal penalty for simple homosexuality At the same time it shows that social opinion is amply adequate to deal with the manifestations of inverted sexuality So much for the legal aspects of sexual inversion But while there can be no doubt about the amply adequate character of the existing social reaction to all manifestations of perverted sexuality the question still remains how far not merely the law but also the state of public opinion should be modified in the light of such a psychological study as we have here undertaken It is clear that this public opinion molded chiefly or entirely with reference to gross vice tends to be unduly violent in its reaction What then is the reasonable attitude of society toward the congenital sexual invert It seems to lie in the avoidance of two extremes On the one hand it cannot be expected to tolerate the invert who flouts his perversion in its face and assumes that because he would rather take his pleasure with a soldier or a policeman than with their sisters he is of finer clay than the vulgar herd On the other it might well refrain from crushing with undiscerning ignorance beneath a burden of shame the subject of an abnormality which as we have seen has not been found incapable of fine uses Inversion is an aberration from the usual course of nature But the clash of contending elements which must often mark the history of such a deviation results now and again by no means infrequently in nobler activities than those yielded by the vast majority who are born to consume the fruits of the earth It bears for the most part its penalty in the structure of its own organism We are bound to protect the helpless members of society against the invert If we go farther and seek to destroy the invert himself before he has sinned against society we exceed the warrant of reason and in so doing we may perhaps destroy also those children of the spirit which possess sometimes a greater worth than the children of the flesh Here we may leave this question of sexual inversion In dealing with it I have sought to avoid that attitude of moral superiority which is so common in the literature of this subject and have refrained from pointing out how loathsome this phenomenon is or how hideous that Such an attitude is as much out of place in scientific investigation as it is in judicial investigation and may well be left to the amateur The physician who feels nothing but disgust at the sight of disease is unlikely to bring either succor to his patients or instruction to his pupils That the investigation we have here pursued is not only profitable to us in succoring the social organism and its members but also in bringing light into the region of sexual psychology is now I hope clear to every reader who has followed me to this point There are a multitude of social questions which we cannot face squarely and honestly unless we possess such precise knowledge as has been here brought together concerning the part played by the homosexual tendency in human life Moreover the study of this perverted tendency stretches beyond itself O er that art Which you say adds to Nature is an art That Nature makes Pathology is but physiology working under new conditions The stream of nature still flows into the bent channel of sexual inversion and still runs according to law We have not wasted our time in this toilsome excursion With the knowledge here gained we are the better equipped to enter upon the study of the wider questions of sex FOOTNOTES two hundred forty three In this connection I may refer to Moll s Sexual Life of the Child to the writings of doctor Clement Dukes physician to Rugby School who fully recognizes the risks of school life and to the discussion on sexual vice in schools started by an address by the

authors conclude that it is today impossible to look upon inversion as the equivalent or the symptom of a psychopathic state though we have to recognize that it frequently coexists with morbid emotional states Naecke also in his extensive experience found that homosexuality is rare in asylums and slight in character he dealt with this question on various occasions see e g Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen vol viii nineteen oh six two hundred fifty six Krafft Ebing considered that the temporary or lasting association of homosexuality with neurasthenia having its root in congenital conditions is almost invariable and some authorities like Meynert have regarded inversion as an accidental growth on the foundation of neurasthenia two hundred fifty seven Fere expressed himself concerning the general treatment of homosexuality in the same sense and even more emphatically Fere L Instinct Sexuel eighteen ninety nine pp two hundred seventy two two hundred eighty six He considers that all forms of congenital inversion resist treatment and that since a change in the invert s instincts must be regarded rather as a perversion of the invert than a cure of the inversion one may be permitted to doubt not only the utility of the treatment but even the legitimacy of attempting it The treatment of sexual inversion he declared is as much outside the province of medicine as the restoration of color vision in the color blind The ideal which the physician and the teacher must place before the invert is that of chastity he must seek to harness his wagon to a star two hundred fifty eight I have been told by a distinguished physician who was consulted in the case of a congenital invert highly placed in the English government service who married in the hope of escaping his perversion and was not even able to consummate the marriage It is needless to insist on the misery which is created in such cases It is not of course denied that such marriages may not sometimes become eventually happy Thus Kiernan Psychical Treatment of Congenital Sexual Inversion Review of Insanity and Nervous Diseases June eighteen ninety four reports the case of a thoroughly inverted girl who married the brother of the friend to whom she was previously attached merely in order to secure his sister s companionship She was able to endure and even enjoy intercourse by imagining that her husband who resembled his sister was another sister Liking and esteem for the husband gradually increased and after the sister died a child was born who much resembled her the wife s esteem passed through love of the sister to intense natural love of the daughter as resembling the sister through this to normal love of the husband as the father and brother The final result may have been satisfactory but this train of circumstances could not have been calculated beforehand Moll is also opposed on the whole e g Deutsche medicinische Presse No six nineteen oh two to marriage and procreation by inverts two hundred fifty nine Hirschfeld Die Homosexualitaet ch xxi It might seem on theoretical grounds that the marriage of a homosexual man with a homosexual woman might turn out well Hirschfeld however states that he knows of fourteen such marriages and the theoretical expectation has not been justified three of the cases speedily terminated in divorce four of the couples lived separately and all but two of the remaining couples regretted the step they had taken I may add that in such a case even the expectation of happiness scarcely seems reasonable since neither of the parties can feel a true mating impulse toward the other two hundred sixty Hirschfeld also notes Die Homosexualitaet p ninety five that women often instinctively feel that there is something wrong in the love of their inverted husbands who may perhaps succeed in copulating but betray their deepest feelings by a repugnance to touch the sexual parts with the hand The homosexual woman also as Hirschfeld elsewhere points out with cases in illustration p eighty four may suffer seriously through being subjected to normal sexual relationships two hundred sixty one Fere reports the case of an invert of great intellectual ability who had never had any sexual relationships and was not averse from a chaste life he was urged by his doctor to acquire the power of normal intercourse and to marry on the ground that his perversion was merely a perversion of the imagination He did so and though he married a perfectly strong and healthy woman and was himself healthy except in so far as his perversion was concerned the offspring turned out disastrously The eldest child was an epileptic almost an imbecile and with strongly marked homosexual impulses the second and third children were absolute idiots the youngest died of convulsions in infancy Fere L Instinct Sexuel p two hundred sixty nine et seq No doubt this is not an average case but the numerous examples of the offspring of similar marriages brought forward by Hirschfeld op cit p three hundred ninety one scarcely present a much better result two hundred sixty two It is scarcely necessary to add that the same principle is adaptable to the case of homosexual women In all such cases writes an American woman physician I would recommend that the moral sense be trained and fostered and the persons allowed to keep their individuality being taught to remember always that they are different from others rather sacrificing their own feelings or happiness when necessary It is good discipline for them and will serve in the long run to bring them more favor and affection than any other course This quality or idiosyncrasy is not essentially evil but if rightly used may prove a blessing to others and a power for good in the life of the individual nor does it reflect any discredit upon its possessor two hundred sixty three The existence of an affinity between homosexuality and the religious temperament has been referred to in ch i as recognized in many parts of the world See for a more extended discussion Horneffer Der Priester and Bloch Die Prostitution vol i pp one hundred one one hundred ten The

homosexual or bisexual temperament two hundred sixty four Forel Die Sexuelle Frage p five hundred twenty eight Such ideas are of course often put forward by inverts themselves two hundred sixty five

one This point is brought forward by doctor Leon de Rode in his report on L Inversion Genitale et la Legislation prepared for the Third Brussels Congress of Criminal Anthropology in eighteen ninety

the States 
8028_233382_000006_000001	train-clean-360	I have lived with the tramps there for eight consecutive months besides passing numerous shorter periods in their company and my acquaintance with them is nearly of ten years standing 
none	none	My purpose in going among them has been to learn about their life in particular and outcast life in general 
8028_233382_000006_000003	train-clean-360	This can only be done by becoming part and parcel of its manifestations 
none	none	There are two kinds of tramps in the United States out of works and hoboes The out of works are not genuine vagabonds they really want work and have no sympathy with the hoboes 
8028_233382_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The latter are the real tramps They make a business of begging a very good business too and keep at it as a rule to the end of their days 
none	none	Whisky and Wanderlust or the love of wandering are probably the main causes of their existence but many of them are discouraged criminals men who have tried their hand at crime and find that they lack criminal wit They become tramps because they find that life on the road comes the nearest to the life they hoped to lead They have enough talent to do very well as beggars better generally speaking then the men who have reached the road simply as drunkards they know more about the tricks of the trade and are cleverer in thinking out schemes and stories All genuine tramps in America are however pretty much the same as far as manners and philosophy are concerned and all are equally welcome at the hang out two hundred seventy six The class of society from which they are drawn is generally the very lowest of all but there are some hoboes who have come from the very highest and these latter are frequently as vicious and depraved as their less well born brethren Concerning sexual inversion among tramps there is a great deal to be said and I cannot attempt to tell all I have heard about it but merely to give a general account of the matter Every hobo in the United States knows what unnatural intercourse means talking about it freely and according to my finding every tenth man practises it and defends his conduct Boys are the victims of this passion The tramps gain possession of these boys in various ways A common method is to stop for awhile in some town and gain acquaintance with the slum children They tell these children all sorts of stories about life on the road how they can ride on the railways for nothing shoot Indians and be perfeshunnels professionals and they choose some boy who specially pleases them 
8028_233382_000008_000006	train-clean-360	By smiles and flattering caresses they let him know that the stories are meant for him alone and before long if the boy is a suitable subject he smiles back just as slyly 
8028_233382_000008_000007	train-clean-360	In time he learns to think that he is the favorite of the tramp who will take him on his travels and he begins to plan secret meetings with the man 
none	none	The tramp of course continues to excite his imagination with stories and caresses and some fine night there is one boy less in the town On the road the lad is called a prushun and his protector a jocker The majority of prushuns are between ten and fifteen years of age but I have known some under ten and a few over fifteen Each is compelled by hobo law to let his jocker do with him as he will and many I fear learn to enjoy his treatment of them 
8028_233382_000008_000011	train-clean-360	They are also expected to beg in every town they come to any laziness on their part receiving very severe punishment 
8028_233382_000009_000000	train-clean-360	How the act of unnatural intercourse takes place is not entirely clear the hoboes are not agreed 
none	none	From what I have personally observed I should say that it is usually what they call leg work intercrural but sometimes immissio penis in anum the boy in either case lying on his stomach I have heard terrible stories of the physical results to the boy of anal intercourse One evening near Cumberland Pennsylvania I was an unwilling witness of one of the worst scenes that can be imagined 
8028_233382_000010_000001	train-clean-360	In company with eight hoboes I was in a freight car attached to a slowly moving train 
8028_233382_000010_000002	train-clean-360	A colored boy succeeded in scrambling into the car and when the train was well under way again he was tripped up and seduced to use the hobo euphemism by each of the tramps 
none	none	He made almost no resistance and joked and laughed about the business as if he had expected it This indeed I find to be the general feeling among the boys when they have been thoroughly initiated 
8028_233382_000010_000005	train-clean-360	At first they do not submit and are inclined to run away or fight but the men fondle and pet them and after awhile they do not seem to care 
none	none	Some of them have told me that they get as much pleasure out of the affair as the jocker does Even little fellows under ten have told me this and I have known them to willfully tempt their jockers to intercourse 
8028_233382_000010_000008	train-clean-360	What the pleasure consists in I cannot say 
none	none	The youngsters themselves describe it as a delightful tickling sensation in the parts involved and this is possibly all that it amounts to among the smallest lads 
8028_233382_000010_000010	train-clean-360	Those who have passed the age of puberty seem to be satisfied in pretty much the same way that the men are 
8028_233382_000010_000011	train-clean-360	Among the men the practice is decidedly one of passion 
none	none	The majority of them prefer a prushun to a woman and nothing is more severely judged than rape One often reads in the newspapers that a woman has been assaulted by a tramp but the perverted tramp is never the guilty party I believe however that there are a few hoboes who have taken to boys because women are so scarce on the road For every woman in hoboland there are a hundred men That this disproportion has something to do with the popularity of boys is made clear by the following case In a gaol where I was confined for a month during my life in vagabondage I got acquainted with a tramp who had the reputation of being a sod sodomist One day a woman came to the gaol to see her husband who was awaiting trial 
8028_233382_000011_000003	train-clean-360	One of the prisoners said he had known her before she was married and had lived with her 
none	none	The tramp was soon to be discharged and he inquired where the woman lived 
8028_233382_000011_000005	train-clean-360	On learning that she was still approachable he looked her up immediately after his release and succeeded in staying with her for nearly a month 
none	none	He told me later that he enjoyed his life with her much more than his intercourse with boys 
8028_233382_000011_000007	train-clean-360	I asked him why he went with boys at all and he replied Cause there ain t women enough 
8028_233382_000011_000008	train-clean-360	If I can t get them I ve got to have the other 
none	none	It is in gaols that one sees the worst side of this perversion 
8028_233382_000012_000001	train-clean-360	In the daytime the prisoners are let out into a long hall and can do much as they please at night they are shut up two and even four in a cell 
8028_233382_000012_000002	train-clean-360	If there are any boys in the crowd they are made use of by all who care to have them 
none	none	If they refuse to submit they are gagged and held down The sheriff seldom knows what goes on and for the boys to say anything to him would be suicidal There is a criminal ignorance all over the States concerning the life of these gaols and things go on that would be impossible in any well regulated prison 
8028_233382_000012_000006	train-clean-360	In one of these places I once witnessed the fiercest fight I have ever seen among hoboes a boy was the cause of it 
8028_233382_000012_000007	train-clean-360	Two men said they loved him and he seemed to return the affection of both with equal desire 
none	none	A fight with razors was suggested to settle who should have him two hundred seventy seven The men prepared for action while the crowd gathered round to watch 
8028_233382_000012_000009	train-clean-360	They slashed away for over half an hour cutting each other terribly and then their backers stopped them for fear of fatal results 
none	none	The boy was given to the one who was hurt the least Jealousy is one of the first things one notices in connection with this passion I have known them to withdraw entirely from the hang out life simply to be sure that their prushuns were not touched by other tramps Such attachments frequently last for years and some boys remain with their first jockers until they are emancipated Emancipation means freedom to snare some other boy and make him submit as the other had been obliged to submit when younger 
8028_233382_000014_000001	train-clean-360	As a rule the prushun is freed when he is able to protect himself 
none	none	If he can defend his honor from all who come he is accepted into the class of old stagers and may do as he likes 
8028_233382_000014_000003	train-clean-360	This is the one reward held out to prushuns during their apprenticeship 
none	none	They are told that some day they can have a boy and use him as they have been used Thus hoboland is always sure of recruits 
8028_233382_000015_000000	train-clean-360	It is difficult to say how many tramps are sexually inverted 
none	none	It is not even certainly known how many vagabonds there are in the country 
8028_233382_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I have stated in one of my papers on tramps that counting the boys there are between fifty and sixty thousand genuine hoboes in the United States 
8028_233382_000015_000003	train-clean-360	A vagabond in Texas who saw this statement wrote me that he considered my estimate too low 
8028_233382_000015_000004	train-clean-360	The newspapers have criticised it as too high but they are unable to judge 
8028_233382_000015_000005	train-clean-360	If my figures are as I believe at least approximately correct the sexually perverted tramps may be estimated at between five and six thousand this includes men and boys 
none	none	I have been told lately by tramps that the boys are less numerous than they were a few years ago They say that it is now a risky business to be seen with a boy and that it is more profitable as far as begging is concerned to go without them Whether this means that the passion is less fierce than it used to be or that the men find sexual satisfaction among themselves I cannot say definitely 
8028_233382_000016_000003	train-clean-360	But from what I know of their disinclination to adopt the latter alternative I am inclined to think that the passion may be dying out somewhat 
none	none	I am sure that women are not more numerous on the road than formerly and that the change if real has not been caused by them 
8028_233382_000016_000005	train-clean-360	So much for my finding in the United States 
none	none	In England where I have also lived with tramps for some time I have found very little contrary sexual feeling In Germany also excepting in prisons and work houses it seems very little known among vagabonds There are a few Jewish wanderers sometimes peddlers who are said to have boys in their company and I am told that they use them as the hoboes in the United States use their boys but I cannot prove this from personal observation In England I have met a number of male tramps who had no hesitation in declaring their preference for their own sex and particularly for boys but I am bound to say that I have seldom seen them with boys as a rule they were quite alone and they seem to live chiefly by themselves It is a noteworthy fact that both in England and Germany there are a great many women on the road or at all events so near it that intercourse with them is easy and cheap In Germany almost every town has its quarter of Stadt Schieze two hundred seventy eight women who sell their bodies for a very small sum They seldom ask over thirty or forty pfennigs for a night which is usually spent in the open air In England it is practically the same thing In all the large cities there are women who are glad to do business for three or four pence and those on the road for even less The general impression made on me by the sexually perverted men I have met in vagabondage is that they are abnormally masculine 
8028_233382_000019_000001	train-clean-360	In their intercourse with boys they always take the active part 
none	none	The boys have in some cases seemed to me uncommonly feminine but not as a rule In the main they are very much like other lads and I am unable to say whether their liking for the inverted relationship is inborn or acquired 
8028_233382_000019_000004	train-clean-360	That it is however a genuine liking in altogether too many instances I do not in the least doubt 
8028_233382_000019_000005	train-clean-360	As such and all the more because it is such it deserves to be more thoroughly investigated and more reasonably treated 
8028_233382_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Josiah Flynt who wrote the foregoing account of tramp life for the second edition of this volume was well known as author sociologist and tramp 
none	none	He was especially and it would seem by innate temperament the tramp which part he looked to perfection he himself referred to his weasoned face and diminutive form and felt completely at home in He was thus able to throw much light on the psychology of the tramp and his books such as Tramping with Tramps are valuable from this point of view 
8028_233382_000020_000003	train-clean-360	His real name was F Willard and he was a nephew of Miss Frances Willard 
none	none	He died in Chicago in nineteen oh seven at the age of thirty eight shortly after writing a frank and remarkable Autobiography 
8028_233382_000020_000005	train-clean-360	I am able to supplement his observations on tramps so far as England is concerned by the following passages from a detailed record sent to me by an English correspondent 
8028_233382_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I am a male invert with complete feminine sexual inclinations 
none	none	Different meetings with tramps led me to seek intimacy with them and for about twenty years I have gone on the tramp myself so that I might come in the closest contact with them in England Scotland and Wales
8028_233382_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 As in the United States there are two classes of tramps those who would work such as harvesters road makers et cetera and those who will not work but make tramping a profession 
none	none	Among both these classes my experience is that ninety per cent or I even would be bold enough to say one hundred per cent indulge in homosexuality when the opportunity occurs and I do not make any distinction between the two classes There are numerous reasons for this and I will state a few A certain number may prefer normal connection with a female but except for those who tramp in vans and a limited number who have donnas with them women are not available as prostitutes very seldom allow intimacy for love except when drunk Tramps are also afraid of any venereal disease as it means the misery of the Lock Hospital Most of them are sociable and prefer to tramp with a make With this mate with whom he sleeps and rests and boozes when they are in funds sexual intimacy naturally takes place as my experience has been that one of the two is male and the other female in their sexual desires but I have known instances where they have acted both roles Then male prostitution is to be had for nothing and even occasionally when a tramp meets a toff it is a means of earning money either fairly or otherwise I have never known a male tramp to refuse satisfaction if I offered a drink or two or a small sum of money One told me that he envied no lords or toffs as long as he got plenty of booze and buggery
8028_233382_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Another one who told me that he had been twenty five years on the road said that he could not endure to sleep alone He was a pedlar openly of cheap religious books and secretly of the vilest pamphlets and photographs 
8028_233382_000024_000001	train-clean-360	He had done time and he said the greatest punishment to him was not being able to have a make who would submit to penetration though he was not particular what form the sexual act took 
none	none	Another fine young man whom I chanced to meet the very day he had been released from a long sentence in prison for burglary and with whom I passed a night of incessant and almost brutal intimacy said his punishment was seeing men always about him and being unable to have connection with them 
8028_233382_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Another and very powerful influence in tramps toward homosexuality is that in the low lodging houses they are obliged to frequent a single bed is perhaps double to one with a bedmate whom perhaps he has never seen before and especially in hot weather when the rule is nakedness 
none	none	My sexual desires being for the male invert I have come most in contact with them and have found that they form much the larger class Among harvesters and seafaring tramps it is seldom you find a dandy such as I was considered and as such I was eagerly courted and any suggestion of intimacy on my part quickly responded to As regards the use of young boys for homosexual indulgence it is not common as it is too dangerous though I have known boys especially those belonging to vans or gypsies to prostitute themselves always for money On one occasion I saw a boy who created quite an outburst of lust of homosexual nature 
8028_233382_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The incident took place in a small seafaring town in Scotland one evening before a Fair was to be held 
none	none	It occurred in a low public house where a number of very rough and mostly drunken men were assembled 
8028_233382_000026_000003	train-clean-360	A blind man came in led by an extremely pretty but effeminate looking youth of about seventeen wearing a ragged kilt and with bare legs and feet 
8028_233382_000026_000004	train-clean-360	He had long curling fair hair which reached to his shoulders and on it an old bonnet was perched 
8028_233382_000026_000005	train-clean-360	He also wore an old velveteen shooting jacket 
8028_233382_000026_000006	train-clean-360	All eyes were turned on the pair and they were quickly offered drinks 
none	none	A remark was made by one man that he believed the youth was a lassie 
8028_233382_000026_000008	train-clean-360	The boy said I will show you I am a laddie and pulled up his kilt exposing his genitals and then his posterior Boisterous laughter greeted this indecent exposure and suggestion and more drinks were provided 
none	none	The blind man then played his fiddle and the boy danced with frequent recurrences of the same indecencies 
8028_233382_000026_000010	train-clean-360	He was seized kissed and caressed by quite a number of men some of whom endeavored to masturbate him which he resisted but performed it for them 
none	none	After the closing time came I and about ten or twelve men all occupied the same room the old man continued to play and the youth stark naked continued to dance and suggested we others should do so and an erotic scene took place which was only closed to view by the boss who was present putting out the lamp Two classes of tramps I have met openly declare their preference for homosexuality They are men who have been in the army and sailors and seafaring men in general It is said that Jack has a wife in every port but I believe from my experience that the wife in many cases is of the male sex and this among those of all nationalities as is the case with soldiers Among these also jealousy is more common than amongst ordinary tramps and if you are dandy to a soldier if you make advances or receive them from a senior trouble is likely to occur between them I could give many instances of my own personal experiences to show that tramps are looked upon by men in the country districts as legitimate complacent and purchaseable objects for homosexual lust FOOTNOTES two hundred seventy six This is the home of the fraternity Practically it is any corner where they can lay their heads but as a rule it is either a lodging house a freight car or a nest in the grass near the railway watering tank two hundred seventy seven All hoboes carry razors both for shaving and for defense Strange to say they succeed in smuggling them into gaols as they are never searched thoroughly two hundred seventy eight This word is of Hebrew origin and means girl Maedchen APPENDIX B THE SCHOOL FRIENDSHIPS OF GIRLS I A school friendship is termed by Italian girls a flame flamma This term as explained by Obici and Marchesini indicates in school slang both the beloved person and the friendship in the abstract but it is a friendship which has the note of passion as felt and understood in this environment In every college the flame is regarded as a necessary institution The relationship is usually of a markedly Platonic character and generally exists between a boarder on one side and a day pupil on the other Notwithstanding however its apparently non sexual nature all the sexual manifestations of college youth circle around it and in its varying aspects of differing intensity all the gradations of sexual sentiment may be expressed Obici and Marchesini carried on their investigation chiefly among the pupils of Normal schools the age of the girls being between twelve and nineteen or twenty There are both boarders and day pupils at these colleges the boarders are most inflammable but it is the day pupils who furnish the sparks Obici and Marchesini received much assistance in their studies from former pupils who are now themselves teachers One of these a day pupil who had never herself been either the object or the agent in one of these passions but had had ample opportunity of making personal observations writes as follows The flame proceeds exactly like a love relationship it often happens that one of the girls shows man like characteristics either in physical type or in energy and decision of character the other lets herself be loved acting with all the obstinacy and one might almost say the shyness of a girl with her lover The beginning of these relationships is quite different from the usual beginnings of friendship It is not by being always together talking and studying together that two become flames no generally they do not even know each other one sees the other on the stairs in the garden in the corridors and the emotion that arises is nearly always called forth by beauty and physical grace Then the one who is first struck begins a regular courtship frequent walks in the garden when the other is likely to be at the window of her class room pauses on the stairs to see her pass in short a mute adoration made up of glances and sighs Later come presents of beautiful flowers and little messages conveyed by complacent companions Finally if the flame shows signs of appreciating all these proofs of affection comes the letter of declaration Letters of declaration are long and ardent to such a degree that they equal or surpass real love declarations The courted one nearly always accepts sometimes with enthusiasm oftenest with many objections and doubts as to the affection declared It is only after many entreaties that she yields and the relationship begins Another collaborator who has herself always aroused very numerous flames gives a very similar description together with other particulars Thus she states It may be said that sixty per cent of the girls in a college have flame relationships and that of the remaining forty only half refuse from deliberate repulsion to such affections the other twenty are excluded either because they are not sufficiently pleasing in appearance or because their characters do not inspire sympathy And regarding the method of beginning the relationship she writes Sometimes flames arise before the two future friends have even seen each other merely because one of them is considered as beautiful sympathetic nice or elegant Elegance exerts an immense fascination especially on the boarders who are bound down by monotonous and simple habits As soon as a boarder hears of a day pupil that she is charming and elegant she begins to feel a lively sympathy toward her rapidly reaching anxiety to see her The longed for morning at length arrives The beloved unconscious of the tumult of passions she has aroused goes into school not knowing that her walk her movements her garments are being observed from stairs or dormitory corridor For the boarders these events constitute an important part of college life and often assume for some the aspect of a tragedy which fortunately may be gradually resolved into a comedy or a farce Many letters are written in the course of these relationships Obici and Marchesini have been able to read over three hundred such letters which had been carefully preserved by the receivers and which indeed formed the chief material for their study These letters clearly show that the flame most usually arises from a physical sympathy an admiration of beauty and elegance The letters written in this flame relationship are full of passion they appear to be often written during periods of physical excitement and psychic erethism and may be considered Obici and Marchesini remark a form of intellectual onanism of which the writers afterward feel remorse and shame as of a physically dishonorable act In reference to the underlying connection of these feelings with the sexual impulse one of the lady collaborators writes I can say that a girl who is in love with a man never experiences flame emotions for a companion Obici and Marchesini thus summarize the differential character of flames as distinguished from ordinary friendships one the extraordinary frequency with which even by means of subterfuges the lovers exchange letters two the anxiety to see and talk to each other to press each other s hands to embrace and kiss three the long conversations and the very long reveries four persistent jealousy with its manifold arts and usual results five exaltation of the beloved s qualities six the habit of writing the beloved s name everywhere seven absence of envy for the loved one s qualities eight the lover s abnegation in conquering all obstacles to the manifestations of her love nine the vanity with which some respond to flame declarations ten the consciousness of doing a prohibited thing eleven the pleasure of conquest of which the trophies letters et cetera are preserved The difference between a flame and a friendship is very well marked in the absolute exclusiveness of the former whence arises the possibility of jealousy At the same time friendship and love are here woven together The letters are chaste a few exceptions among so many letters not affecting this general rule and the purity of the flame relationship is also shown by the fact that it is usually between boarders and day pupils girls in different classes and different rooms and seldom between those who are living in close proximity to each other Certainly writes one of the lady collaborators the first sensual manifestations develop in girls with physical excitement pure and simple but at all events I would wish to believe it the majority of college girls find sufficient satisfaction in being as near as possible to the beloved person of whichever sex in mutual admiration and in kissing or very frequently in conversation that is by no means moral though usually very metaphorical The object of such conversation is to discover the most important mysteries of human nature the why and the wherefore it deals with natural necessities which the girl feels and has an intuition of but as yet knows nothing definite about Such conversations are the order of the day in schools and in colleges and specially revolve around procreation the most difficult mystery of all They are a heap of stupidities This lady had only known of one definitely homosexual relationship during the whole of her college life the couple in question were little liked and had no other flames The chief general sexual manifestations this lady concludes which she had noted among her companions was a constant preoccupation with sexual mysteries and the necessity of talking about them perpetually Another lady collaborator who had lived in a Normal school had had somewhat wider experiences She entered at the age of fourteen and experienced the usual loneliness and unhappiness of a new pupil One day as she was standing pensive and alone in a corner of the room a companion one who on her arrival had been charged to show her over the college ran up to her embracing me closing by mouth with a kiss and softly caressing my hair I gazed at her in astonishment but experienced a delicious sensation of supreme comfort Here began the idyll I was subjected to a furious tempest of kisses and caresses which quite stunned me and made me ask myself the reason of such a new and unforeseen affection I ingenuously inquired the reason and the reply was I love you you struck me immediately I saw you because you are so beautiful and so white and because it makes me happy and soothes me when I can pass my hands through your hair and kiss your plump white face I need a soul and a body This seemed to me the language of a superior person for I could not grasp all its importance As on the occasion when she first embraced me I looked at her in astonishment and could not for the moment respond to a new fury of caresses and kisses I felt that they were not like the kisses of my mamma my papa my brother and other companions they gave me unknown sensations the contact of those moist and fleshy lips disturbed me Then came the exchange of letters and the usual rights and duties of flames When we met in the presence of others we were only to greet each other simply for flames were strictly prohibited I obeyed because I liked her but also because I was afraid of her Othello like jealousy She would suffocate me even bite me when I played joyously and thoughtlessly with others and woe to me if I failed to call her when I was combing my hair She liked to see me with my hair down and would rest her head on my shoulder especially if I were partially undressed I let her do as she liked and she would scold me severely because I was never first in longing for her running to meet her and kissing her But at the same time the thought of losing her the thought that perhaps one day she would shower her caresses on others secretly wounded my heart But I never told her this One day however when with the head mistress gazing at a beautiful landscape I was suddenly overwhelmed with sadness and burst out crying The head mistress inquired what was the matter and throwing myself in her arms I sobbed I love her and I shall die if she leaves off loving me She smiled and the smile went through my heart I saw at once how silly I was and what a wrong road my companion was on From that day I could no longer endure my flame The separation was absolute I courageously bore bites and insults even scratches on my face followed by long complaints and complete prostration I thought it would be mean to accuse her but I invented a pretext for having the number of my bed changed This was because she would dress quietly and come to pass hours by my bed resting her head on the pillow She said she wished to smell the perfume of my health and freshness This continual turbulent desire had now nauseated me and I wished to avoid it altogether Later I heard that she had formed a relationship which was not blessed by any sacred rite Notwithstanding the Platonic character of the correspondences Obici and Marchesini remark there is really a substratum of emotional sexuality beneath it and it is this which finds its expression in the indecorous conversations already referred to The flame is a love fiction a play of sexual love This characteristic comes out in the frequently romantic names of men and women invented to sign the letters Even in the letters themselves however the element of sexual impressionability may be traced On Friday we went to a service at San B writes one who was in an institution directed by nuns but unfortunately I saw M L at a window when I thought she was at A and I was in a nervous state the whole time Imagine that that dear woman was at the window with bare arms and as it seemed to me in her chemise No doubt a similar impression might have been made on a girl living in her own family But it is certain that the imaginative coloring tends to be more lively in those living in colleges and shut off from that varied and innocent observation which renders those outside colleges freer and more unprejudiced On a boy who is free to see as many women as he chooses a woman s face cannot make such an impression as on a boy who lives in a college and who is liable to be as it were electrified if he sees any object belonging to a woman especially if he sees it by stealth or during a mood of erotism Such an object calls out a whole series of wanton imaginations which it could not do in one who by his environment was already armed against any tendencies to erotic fetichism The attraction exerted by that which we see but seldom and around which fancy assiduously plays the attraction of forbidden fruit produces tendencies and habits which could scarcely develop in freedom Curiosity is acute and is augmented by the obstacles which stand in the way of its satisfaction Flame attraction is the beginning of such a morbid fetichism A sentiment which under other conditions would never have gone beyond ordinary friendship may thus become a flame and even a flame of markedly sexual character Under these influences boys and girls feel the purest and simplest sentiments in a hyperesthetic manner The girls here studied have lost an exact conception of the simple manifestations of friendship and think they are giving evidence of exquisite sensibility and true friendship by loving a companion to madness friendship in them has become a passion That this intense desire to love a companion passionately is the result of the college environments may be seen by the following extract from a letter You know dear much better than I do how acutely girls living away from their own homes and far from all those who are dearest to them on earth feel the need of loving and being loved You can understand how hard it is to be obliged to live without anyone to surround you with affection and the writer goes on to say how all her love turns to her correspondent While there is an unquestionable sexual element in the flame relationship this cannot be regarded as an absolute expression of real congenital perversion of the sex instinct The frequency of the phenomena as well as the fact that on leaving college to enter social life the girl usually ceases to feel these emotions are sufficient to show the absence of congenital abnormality The estimate of the frequency of flames in Normal schools given to Obici and Marchesini by several lady collaborators was about sixty per cent but there is no reason to suppose that women teachers furnish a larger contingent of perverted individuals than other women The root is organic but the manifestations are ideal and Platonic in contrast with some other manifestations found in college life No inquiry was made as to the details of solitary sexual manifestations in the colleges the fact that they exist to more or less extent being sufficiently recognized The conversations already referred to are a measure of the excitations of sexuality existing in these college inmates and multiplied in energy by communication Such discourse was wrote one collaborator the order of the day and it took place chiefly at the time when letter writing also was easiest It may well be that sensual excitations transformed into ethereal sentiments serve to increase the intensity of the flames Taken altogether Obici and Marchesini conclude the flame may be regarded as a provisional synthesis We find here in solution together the physiological element of incipient sexuality the psychical element of the tenderness natural to this age and sex the element of occasion offered by the environment and the social element with its nascent altruism II That the phenomena described in minute detail by Obici and Marchesini closely resemble the phenomena as they exist in English girls schools is indicated by the following communication for which I am indebted to a lady who is familiar with an English girls college of very modern type From inquiries made in various quarters and through personal observation and experience I have come to the conclusion that the romantic and emotional attachments formed by girls for their female friends and companions attachments which take a great hold of their minds for the time being are far commoner than is generally supposed among English girls more especially at school or college or wherever a number of girls or young women live together in one institution and are much secluded As far as I have been able to find out these attachments which have their own local names e g raves spoons et cetera are comparatively rare in the smaller private schools and totally absent among girls of the poorer class attending Board and National schools perhaps because they mix more freely with the opposite sex I can say from personal experience that in one of the largest and best English colleges where I spent some years raving is especially common in spite of arrangements which one would have thought would have abolished most unhealthy feelings The arrangements there are very similar to a large boys college There are numerous boarding houses which have on an average forty to fifty students Each house is under the management of a well educated house mistress assisted by house governesses quite separate from college teachers Each house has a large garden with tennis courts et cetera and cricket hockey and other games are carried on to a large extent games being not only much encouraged but much enjoyed Each girl has a separate cubicle or bedroom and no junior under seventeen years of age is allowed to enter the cubicle or bedroom of another without asking permission or to go to the bedrooms during the day In fact everything is done to discourage any morbid feelings But all the same as far as my experience goes the friendships there seem more violent and more emotional than in most places and sex subjects form one of the chief topics of conversation In such large schools and colleges these raves are not only numerous but seem to be perennial among the girls of all ages from thirteen years upward Girls under that age may be fond of some other student or teacher but in quite a different way These raves are not mere friendships in the ordinary sense of the word nor are they incompatible with ordinary friendships A girl with a rave often has several intimate friends for whom affection is felt without the emotional feelings and pleasurable excitement which characterize a rave From what I have been told by those who have experienced these raves and have since been in love with men the emotions called forth in both cases were similar although in the case of the rave this fact was not recognized at the time This appears to point to a sexual basis but on the other hand there are many cases where the feeling seems to be more spiritual a sort of uplifting of the whole soul with an intense desire to lead a very good life the feeling being one of reverence more than anything else for the loved one with no desire to become too intimate and no desire for physical contact Raves as a rule begin quite suddenly They may be mutual or all on one side In the case of school girls the mutual rave is generally found between two companions or the girls may have a rave for one of their teachers or some grown up acquaintance who does not necessarily enter into the school life In this case there may or may not be a feeling of affection for the girl by her rave though minus all the emotional feelings Occasionally a senior student will have a rave on a little girl but these cases are rare and not very active in their symptoms girls over eighteen having fewer raves and generally condemning them In the large school already referred to of which I have personal knowledge raving was very general hardly anyone being free from it Any fresh student would soon fall a victim to the fashion which rather points to the fact that it is infectious Sometimes there might be a lull in the general raving only to reappear after an interval in more or less of an epidemic form Sometimes nearly all the raves were felt by students for their teachers at other times it was more apparent between the girls themselves Sometimes one teacher was raved on by several girls In many cases the girls raving on a teacher would have a very great friendship with one of their companions talking with each other constantly of their respective raves describing their feelings and generally letting off steam to one another indulging sometimes in the active demonstrations of affection which they were debarred from showing the teacher herself and in some cases having no desire to do so even if they could As far as I have been able to judge there is not necessarily any attraction for physical characteristics as beauty elegance et cetera the two participants are probably both of strong character or a weak character raves on a stronger but rarely vice versa I have often noticed that the same person may be raved on at different times by several people of different characters and of all ages say up to thirty years of age It is hard to say why some persons more than others should inspire this feeling Often they are reserved without any particular physical attraction and often despising raving and emotional friendships and give no encouragement to them That the majority of raves have a sexual basis may be true but I am sure that in the majority of cases where young girls are concerned this is not in the least recognized and no impurity is indulged in or wished for The majority of the girls are entirely ignorant of all sexual matters and understand nothing whatever about them But they do wonder about them and talk about them constantly more especially when they have a rave which seems to point to some subtle connection between the two That this ignorance exists is largely to be deplored The subject if once thought of is always thought of and talked of and information is at length generally gained in a regrettable manner From personal experience I know the evil results that this ignorance and constant endeavoring to find out everything has on the mind and bodies of school girls If children had the natural and simple laws of creation carefully explained to them by their parents much harm would be prevented and the conversation would not always turn on sexual matters The Bible is often consulted for the discovery of hidden mysteries Raves on teachers are far commoner than between two girls In this case the girl makes no secret of her attachment constantly talking of it and describing her feelings to any who care to listen and writing long letters to her friends about the same In the case of two girls there is more likely to be a sexual element great pleasure being taken in close contact with one another and frequent kissing and hugging When parted long letters are written often daily they are full of affectionate expressions of love et cetera but there is also a frequent reference to the happiness and desire to do well that their love has inspired them with while often very deeply religious feelings appear to be generated and many good resolutions are made Their various emotional feelings are described in every minute detail to each other The duration of raves varies I have known them to last three or four years more often only a few months Occasionally what began as a rave will turn into a sensible firm friendship I imagine that there is seldom any actual inversion and on growing up the raves generally cease That the ravers feel and act like a pair of lovers there is no doubt and the majority put down these romantic friendships for their own sex as due in a great extent in the case of girls at schools to being without the society of the opposite sex This may be true in some cases but personally I think the question open to discussion These friendships are often found among girls who have left school and have every liberty even among girls who have had numerous flirtations with the opposite sex who cannot be accused of inversion and who have all the feminine and domestic characteristics In illustration of these points I may bring forward the following case A and B were two girls at the same college They belonged to different cliques or sets occupied different bedrooms never met in their school work and were practically only known to one another by name One day they chanced to sit next to one another at some meal They both already had raves A on an actor she had lately seen B on a married woman at her home The conversation happened to turn on raves and mutual attraction was suddenly felt From that moment a new interest came into their lives They lived for one another At the time A was fourteen B a year older Both were somewhat precocious for their age were practical with plenty of common sense very keen on games interested in their lessons and very independent but at the same time with marked feminine characteristics and popular with the opposite sex After the first feeling of interest there was a subtle excitement and desire to meet again All their thoughts were occupied with the subject Each day they managed as many private meetings as possible They met in the passages in order to say good night with many embraces As far as possible they hid their feelings from the rest of their world They became inseparable and a very lasting and real but somewhat emotional affection in which the sexual element was certainly marked sprang up between them Although at the time they were both quite ignorant of sexual matters yet they indulged their sexual instincts to some extent They felt surcharged with hitherto unexperienced feelings and emotions instinct urged them to let these have play but instinctively they also had a feeling that to do so would be wrong This feeling they endeavored to argue out and find reasons for When parted for any length of time they felt very miserable and wrote pages to one another every day pouring forth in writing their feelings for one another In this time of active attraction they both became deeply religious for a time The active part of the affection continued for three or four years and now after an interval of ten years they are both exceedingly fond of one another although their paths in life are divided and each has since experienced love for a man Both look back upon the sexual element in their friendship with some interest It may be remarked in passing that A and B are both attractive girls to men and women and B especially appears always to have roused rave feelings in her own sex without the slightest encouragement on her part The duration of this rave was exceptionally long the majority only lasting a few months while some girls have one rave after another or two or three together I may mention one other case where I believe that if it a sexual basis this was not recognized by the parties concerned or their friends Two girls over twenty years of age passed in a corridor A few words were exchanged the beginning of a very warm and fast friendship They said it was not a rave They were absolutely devoted to one another but from what I know of them and what they have since told me their feelings were quite free from any sexual desires though their love for one another was great When parted they exchanged letters daily but were always endeavoring to urge one another on in all the virtues and as far as I can gather they never gave way to any feeling they thought was not for the good of their souls Letters and presents are exchanged vows of eternal love are made quarrels are engaged in for the mere pleasure of reconciliation and jealousy is easily manifested Although raves are chiefly found among school girls they are by no means confined to them but are common among any community of women of any age say under thirty and are not unknown among married women when there is no inversion In these oases there is usually of course no ignorance of sexual matters Whether there is any direct harm in these friendships I have not been able to make up my mind In the case of school girls if there is not too much emotion generated and if the sexual feelings are not indulged in I think they may do more good than harm Later on in life when all one s desires and feelings are at their strongest it is more doubtful III That the phenomena as found in the girls colleges of America are exactly similar to those in Italy and England is shown among other evidence by some communications sent to mister E G Lancaster of Clark University Worcester Mass a few years ago mister E G Lancaster sent out a questionnaire to over eight hundred teachers and older pupils dealing with various points connected with adolescence and received answers from ninety one persons containing information which bore on the present question two hundred seventy nine Of this number twenty eight male and forty one female had been in love before the age of twenty five while eleven of each sex had had no love experiences this indicating since the women were in a majority that the absence of love experience is more common in men than in women These answers were from young people between sixteen and twenty five years of age Two males and seven females have loved imaginary characters while three males and not less than forty six females speak of passionate love for the same sex Love of the same sex Lancaster remarks though not generally known is very common it is not mere friendship the love is strong real and passionate It may be remarked that these forty nine cases were reported without solicitation since there was no reference to homosexual love in the questionnaire Many of the answers to the syllabus are so beautiful Lancaster observes that if they could be printed in full no comment would be necessary He quotes a few of the answers Thus a woman of thirty three writes At fourteen I had my first case of love but it was with a girl It was insane intense love but had the same quality and sensations as my first love with a man at eighteen In neither case was the object idealized I was perfectly aware of their faults nevertheless my whole being was lost immersed in their existence The first lasted two years the second seven years No love has since been so intense but now these persons though living are no more to me than the veriest stranger Another woman of thirty five writes Girls between the ages of fourteen and eighteen at college or girls schools often fall in love with the same sex This is not friendship The loved one is older more advanced more charming or beautiful When I was a freshman in college I knew at least thirty girls who were in love with a senior Some sought her because it was the fashion but I knew that my own homage and that of many others was sincere and passionate I loved her because she was brilliant and utterly indifferent to the love shown her She was not pretty though at the time we thought her beautiful One of her adorers on being slighted was ill for two weeks On her return she was speaking to me when the object of our admiration came into the room The shock was too great and she fainted When I reached the senior year I was the recipient of languishing glances original verses roses and passionate letters written at midnight and three in the morning No similar confessions are recorded from men IV In South America corresponding phenomena have been found in schools and colleges of the same class There they have been especially studied by Mercante in the convent High Schools of Buenos Aires where the students are girls between the ages of ten and twenty two two hundred eighty Mercante found that homosexuality here is not clearly defined or explicit and usually it is combined with a predisposition to romanticism and mysticism It is usually of a passive kind but in this form so widespread as to constitute a kind of epidemic It was most manifest in institutions where the greatest stress was placed on religious instruction The recreations of the school in question were quiet and enervating active or boisterous sports were prohibited to the end that good manners might be cultivated In the play rooms the girls observed the strictest etiquette and discipline was maintained independent of oversight by teachers Mercante could hardly believe however that the decorum was more than external Later when the girls broke up they were found in pairs or small groups in corners on benches beside the pillars arm in arm or holding hands What they were speaking of could be surmised Their conversation and confidences came to me indirectly They were sweethearts talking about their affairs In spite of the spiritual and feminine character of these unions one element was active the other passive thus confirming the authorities on this matter Gamier Regis Lombroso Bonfigli Mercante found the points of view of the two members of each pair to be quite different in moral aspect One takes the initiative she commands she cares for she offers she gives she makes decisions she considers the present she imagines the future she smoothes over difficulties gives encouragement and initiative she commands she cares for she offers she gives she docile gives way in matters of dispute and expresses her affection with sweet words and promises of love and submission The atmosphere silent and quiet was however charged with jealousy squabble desires illusions dreams and lamentations Mercante s informant assured him that practically every girl had her affinity and that there were at least twenty well defined love affairs The active party starts the conquest by making eyes next she becomes more intimate and finally proposes Women being highly adaptable the neophyte unless she is rebellious gets into the spirit of it all If she is not complaisant she must prepare for conflict because the prey becomes more desirable the more the resistance encountered Opportunity was offered to Mercante to observe some of the correspondence between the girls Though of indifferent training and ability in other respects the girls speak and write regarding their affairs with most admirable diction and style No data are given regarding the actual intimate relations between the girls FOOTNOTES two hundred seventy nine E G Lancaster The Psychology and Pedagogy of Adolescence
