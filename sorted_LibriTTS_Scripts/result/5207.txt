his comrades toward a ford of Bull Run The first great battle of the Civil War had been fought and lost Lost after it had been won Young as he was Dick knew that fortune had been with the North until the very closing hour He did not yet know how it had been done He did not know how the Northern charges had broken in vain on the ranks of Stonewall Jackson s men He did not know how the fresh Southern troops from the Valley of Virginia had hurled themselves so fiercely on the Union flank But he did know that his army had been defeated and was retreating on the capital Cannon still thundered to right and left and now and then showers of bursting shell sprayed over the heads of the tired and gloomy soldiers Dick thoughtful and scholarly was in the depths of a bitterness and despair reached by few of those around him The Union the Republic had appealed to him as the most glorious of experiments He could not bear to see it broken up for any cause whatever It had been founded with too much blood and suffering and labor to be dissolved in a day on a Virginia battlefield But the army that had almost grasped victory was retreating and the camp followers the spectators who had come out to see an easy triumph and some of the raw recruits were running A youth near Dick cried that the rebels fifty thousand strong with a hundred guns were hot upon their heels A short powerful man with a voice like the roar of thunder bade him hush or he would feel a rifle barrel across his back Dick had noticed this man a sergeant named Whitley who had shown singular courage and coolness throughout the battle and he crowded closer to him for companionship The man observed the action and looked at him with blue eyes that twinkled out of a face almost black with the sun Don t take it so hard my boy he said This battle s lost but there are others that won t be Most of the men were raw but they did some mighty good fightin while the regulars an the cavalry are coverin the retreat Beauregard s army is not goin to sweep us off the face of the earth His words brought cheer to Dick but it lasted only a moment He was to see many dark days but this perhaps was the darkest of his life His heart beat painfully and his face was a brown mask of mingled dust sweat and burned gunpowder The thunder of the Southern cannon behind them filled him with humiliation Every bone in him ached after such fierce exertion and his eyes were dim with the flare of cannon and rifles and the rolling clouds of dust He was scarcely conscious that the thick and powerful sergeant had moved up by his side and had put a helping hand under his arm Here we are at the ford cried Whitley Into it my lad Ah how good the water feels Dick despite those warning guns behind him would have remained a while in Bull Run luxuriating in the stream but the crowd of his comrades was pressing hard upon him and he only had time to thrust his face into the water and to pour it over his neck arms and shoulders But he was refreshed greatly Some of the heat went out of his body and his eyes and head ached less The retreat continued across the rolling hills Dick saw everywhere arms and supplies thrown away by the fringe of a beaten army the men in the rear who saw and who spread the reports of panic and terror But the regiments were forming again into a cohesive force and behind them the regulars and cavalry in firm array still challenged pursuit Heavy firing was heard again under the horizon and word came that the Southern cavalry had captured guns and wagons but the main division maintained its slow retreat toward Washington Now the cool shadows were coming The sun which had shown as red as blood over the field that day was sinking behind the hills Its fiery rays ceased to burn the faces of the men A soft healing breeze stirred the leaves and grass The river of Bull Run and the field of Manassas were gone from sight and the echo of the last cannon shot died solemnly on the Southern horizon An hour later the brigade stopped in the wood and the exhausted men threw themselves upon the ground They were so tired that their bodies were in pain as if pricked with needles The chagrin and disgrace of defeat were forgotten for the time in the overpowering desire for rest Dick had enlisted as a common soldier There was no burden of maintaining order upon him and he threw himself upon the ground by the side of his new friend Sergeant Whitley His breath came at first in gasps but presently he felt better and sat up It was now full night thrice blessed to them all with the heat and dust gone and no enemy near The young recruits had recovered their courage The terrible scenes of the battle were hid from their eyes and the cannon no longer menaced on the horizon The sweet soothing wind blew gently over the hills among which they lay and the leaves rustled peacefully Fires were lighted wagons with supplies arrived and the men began to cook food while the surgeons moved here and there binding up the wounds of the hurt The pleasant odors of coffee and frying meat arose Sergeant Whitley stood up and by the moonlight and the fires scanned the country about them with discerning eye Dick looked at him with renewed interest He was a man of middle years but with all the strength and elasticity of youth Despite his thick coat of tan he was naturally fair and Dick noticed that his hands were the largest that he had ever seen on any human being They seemed to the boy to have in them the power to strangle a bear But the man was singularly mild and gentle in his manner We re about half way to Washington I judge he said an I expect a lot of our camp followers and grass green men are all the way there by now tellin Abe Lincoln an everybody else that a hundred thousand rebels fell hard upon us on the plain of Manassas He laughed deep down in his throat and Dick again drew courage and cheerfulness from one who had such a great store of both How did it happen Our defeat I mean asked Dick I thought almost to the very last moment that we had the victory won Their reserves came an ours didn t But the boys did well Lots worse than this will happen to us an we ll live to overcome it I ve been through a heap of hardships in my life Dick but I always remember that somebody else has been through worse Let s go down the hill The boys have found a branch an are washin up By branch he meant a brook and Dick went with him gladly They found a fine clear stream several feet broad and a foot deep flowing swiftly between the slopes and probably emptying miles further on into Bull Run Already it was lined by hundreds of soldiers mostly boys who were bathing freely in its cool waters Dick and the sergeant joined them and with the sparkle of the current fresh life and vigor flowed into their veins An officer took command and when they had bathed their faces necks and arms abundantly they were allowed to take off their shoes and socks and put their bruised and aching feet in the stream It seems to me sergeant that this is pretty near to Heaven said Dick as he sat on the bank and let the water swish around his ankles It s mighty good There s no denyin it but we ll move still a step nearer to Heaven when we get our share of that beef an coffee which I now smell most appetizin Hard work gives a fellow a ragin appetite an I reckon fightin is the hardest of all work When I was a lumberman in Wisconsin I thought nothin could beat that but I admit now that a big battle is more exhaustin You ve worked in the timber then From the time I was twelve years old til three or four years ago If I do say it myself there wasn t a man in all Wisconsin or Michigan either who could swing an axe harder or longer than I could I guess you ve noticed these hands of mine He held them up and they impressed Dick more than ever They were great masses of bone and muscle fit for a giant Paws the boys used to call em resumed Whitley with a pleased laugh I inherited big hands Father had em an mother had em too So mine were wonders when I was a boy an when you add to that years an years with the axe an with liftin an rollin big logs I ve got what I reckon is the strongest pair of hands in the United States I can pull a horseshoe apart any time Mighty useful they are too as I m likely to show you often The chance came very soon A frightened horse probably with the memory of the battle still lodged somewhere in his animal brain broke his tether and came charging among the troops Whitley made one leap seized him by the bit in his mighty grasp and hurled him back on his haunches where he held him until fear was gone from him It was partly strength and partly sleight of hand a trick that I learned in the cavalry he said to Dick as they put on their shoes I got tired of lumberin an I wandered out west where I served three years on horseback in the regular army fightin the Indians Good fighters they are too Mighty hard to put your hand on em Now they re there an now they ain t Now you see em before you an then they re behind you aimin a tomahawk at your head They taught us a big lot that I guess we can use in this war Come on Dick I guess them banquet halls are spread an I know we re ready Not much order was preserved in the beaten brigade which had become separated from the rest of the retreating army but the spirits of all were rising and that so Sergeant Whitley told Dick was better just now than technical discipline The Northern army had gone to Bull Run with ample supplies and now they lacked for nothing They ate long and well and drank great quantities of coffee Then they put out the fires and resumed the march toward Washington They stopped again an hour or two after midnight and slept until morning Dick lay on the bare ground under the boughs of a great oak tree It was a quarter of an hour before sleep came because his nervous system had received a tremendous wrench that day He closed his eyes and the battle passed again before them He remembered too a lightning glimpse of a face that of his cousin Harry Kenton seen but an instant and then gone He tried to decide whether it was fancy or reality and while he was trying he fell asleep and slept as one dead Dick was awakened early in the morning by Sergeant Whitley who was now watching over him like an elder brother The sun already rode high and there was a great stir and movement as the brigade was forming for its continued retreat on the capital The boy s body was at first stiff and sore but the elasticity of youth returned fast and after a brief breakfast he was fully restored Another hot day had dawned but Dick reflected grimly that however hot it might be it could not be as hot as the day before had been Scouts in the night had brought back reports that the Southern troops were on the northern side of Bull Run but not in great force and a second battle was no longer feared The flight could be continued without interruption over the hot Virginia fields Much of Dick s depression returned as they advanced under the blazing sun but Whitley who seemed insensible to either fatigue or gloom soon cheered him up again They talk about the Southerners comin on an takin Washington he said but don t you believe it They haven t got the forces an while they won the victory I guess they re about as tired as we are Our boys talk about a hundred thousand rebels jumpin on em an some felt as if they was a million but they weren t any more than we was maybe not as many an when they are all stove up themselves how can they attack Washington in its fortifications Don t be so troubled boy The Union ain t smashed up yet Just recollect whenever it s dark that light s bound to come later on What do you say to that Long Legs He spoke to a very tall and very thin youth who marched about a half dozen feet away from them The boy who seemed to be about eighteen years of age turned to them a face which was pale despite the Virginia sun But it was the pallor of indoor life not of fear as the countenance was good and strong long narrow the chin pointed the nose large and bridged like that of an old Roman the eyes full blue and slightly nearsighted But there was a faint twinkle in those same nearsighted eyes as he replied in precise tones According to all the experience of centuries and all the mathematical formulae that can be deduced therefrom night is bound to be followed by day We have been whipped by the rebels but it follows with arithmetical certainty that if we keep on fighting long enough we will whip them in time Let x equal time and y equal opportunity Then when x and y come together we shall have x plus y which will equal success Does my logic seem cogent to you mister Big Shoulders and Big Hands Whitley stared at him in amazement and admiration I haven t heard so many big words in a long time he said an then too you bring em out so nice an smooth marchin in place as regular as a drilled troop I ve been drilled too said the tall boy smiling My name is George Warner and I come from Vermont I began teaching a district school when I was sixteen years old and I would be teaching now if it were not for the war My specialty is mathematics X equals the war y equals me and x plus y equals me in the war Your name is Warner and you are from Vermont said Dick eagerly Why there was a Warner who struck hard for independence at Bennington in the Revolution That s my family replied the youth proudly Seth Warner delivered a mighty blow that helped to form this Union and although I don t know much except to teach school I m going to put in a little one to help save it X equalled the occasion y equalled my willingness to meet it and x plus y have brought me here Dick told who he and Whitley were and he felt at once that he and this long and mathematical Vermont lad were going to be friends Whitley also continued to look upon Warner with much favor I respect anybody who can talk in mathematics as you do he said Now with me I never know what x equals an I never know what y equals so if I was to get x an y together they might land me about ten thousand miles from where I wanted to be But a fellow can bend too much over books That s what s the matter with them eyes of yours which I notice always have to take two looks where I take only one You are undoubtedly right replied Warner My relatives told me that I needed some fresh air and I am taking it although the process is attended with certain risks from bullets swords bayonets cannon balls and shells Still I have made a very close mathematical calculation At home there is the chance of disease as well as here At home you may fall from a cliff you may be drowned in a creek or river while bathing a tree may fall on you a horse may throw you and break your neck or you may be caught in a winter storm and freeze to death But even if none of these things happens to you you will die some day anyhow Now my figures show me that the chance of death here in the war is only twenty five per cent greater than it was at home but physical activity and an open air continuously increase my life chances thirty five per cent So I make a net life gain of ten per cent Whitley put his hand upon Warner s shoulder Boy he said you re wonderful I can cheer up the lads by talkin of the good things to come but you can prove by arithmetic algebra an every other kind of mathematics that they re bound to come You re goin to be worth a lot wherever you are Thanks for your encomiums In any event we are gaining valuable experience Back there on the field of Bull Run I was able to demonstrate by my own hearing and imagination that a hundred thousand rebels could fire a million bullets a minute that every one of those million bullets filled with a mortal spite against me was seeking my own particular person Whitley gazed at him again with admiration You ve certainly got a wonderful fine big bag of words he said an whenever you need any you just reach in an take out a few a foot long or so But I reckon a lot of others felt the way you did though they won t admit it now Look we re nearly to Washington now See the dome of the Capitol over the trees there an I can catch glimpses of roofs too Dick and George also saw the capital and cheered by the sight they marched at a swifter gait Soon they turned into the main road where the bulk of the army had already passed and saw swarms of stragglers ahead of them Journalists and public men met them and Dick now learned how the truth about Bull Run had come to the capital The news of defeat had been the more bitter because already they had been rejoicing there over success As late as five o clock in the afternoon the telegraph had informed Washington of victory Then after a long wait had come the bitter despatch telling of defeat and flying fugitives arriving in the night had exaggerated it tenfold The division to which Dick Warner and Whitley belonged marched over the Long Bridge and camped near the capital where they would remain until sent on further service Dick now saw that the capital was in no danger Troops were pouring into it by every train from the north and west All they needed was leadership and discipline Bull Run had stung but it did not daunt them and they asked to be led again against the enemy They heard that Lincoln had received the news of the defeat with great calmness and that he had spent most of a night in his office listening to the personal narratives of public men who had gone forth to see the battle and who at its conclusion had left with great speed Lots of people have laughed at Abe Lincoln an have called him only a rail splitter said Whitley but I heard him two or three times when he was campaignin in Illinois an I tell you he s a man He was born in my state said Dick and I mean to be proud of him He ll have support too Look how the country is standing by him More than once in the succeeding days Dick Mason s heart thrilled at the mighty response that came to the defeat of Bull Run The stream of recruits pouring into the capital never ceased He now saw men and many boys too like himself from every state north of the Ohio River and from some south of it Dan Whitley met old logging friends from Wisconsin whom he had not seen in years and George Warner saw two pupils of his as old as himself Dick had inherited a sensitive temperament one that responded quickly and truthfully to the events occurring about him and he foresaw the beginning of a mighty struggle Here in the capital resolution was hardening into a fight to the finish and he knew from his relatives when he left Kentucky that the South was equally determined There was an apparent pause in hostilities but he felt that the two sections were merely gathering their forces for a mightier conflict His comrades and he had little to do and they had frequent leaves of absence On one of them they saw a man of imposing appearance pass down Pennsylvania Avenue He would have caught the attention of anybody owing to his great height and splendid head crowned with snow white hair He was old but he walked as if he were one who had achieved greatly and was conscious of it It s Old Fuss and Feathers his very self said Whitley General Scott It can be no other said Dick who had divined at once the man s identity His eyes followed the retreating figure with the greatest interest This was the young hero of the War of eighteen twelve and the great commander who had carried the brilliant campaign into the capital of Mexico He had been the first commander in chief of the Northern army and foreseeing the great scale of the coming war had prepared a wide and cautious plan But the public had sneered at him and had demanded instant action the defeat at Bull Run being the result Dick felt pity for the man who was forced to bear a blame not his own and who was too old for another chance But he knew that the present cloud would soon pass away and that he would be remembered as the man of Chippewa and Chapultepec McClellan is already here to take his place said Whitley He s the young fellow who has been winning successes in the western part of Virginia an they say he has genius Only a day or two later they saw McClellan walking down the same avenue with the President Dick had never beheld a more striking contrast The President was elderly of great height his head surmounted by a high silk hat which made him look yet taller while his face was long melancholy and wrinkled deeply His collar had wilted with the heat and the tails of his long black coat flapped about his legs The general was clothed in a brilliant uniform He was short and stocky and his head scarcely passed the President s shoulder He was redolent of youth and self confidence It showed in his quick eager gestures and his emphatic manner He attracted the two boys but the sergeant shook his head somewhat solemnly They say Scott was too old he said and now they ve gone to the other end of it McClellan s too young to handle the great armies that are going into the field I m afraid he won t be a match for them old veterans like Johnston and Lee Napoleon became famous all over the world when he was only twenty six said Warner That s so retorted Whitley but I never heard of any other Napoleon The breed began and quit with him But the soldiers crowding the capital had full confidence in Little Mac as they had already begun to call him Those off duty followed and cheered him and the President until they entered the White House and disappeared within its doors Dick and his friends were in the crowd that followed although they did not join in the cheers not because they lacked faith but because all three were thoughtful Dick had soon discovered that Whitley despite his lack of education was an exceedingly observant man with a clear and reasoning mind It was a pair worth seeing said the sergeant as they turned away but I looked a lot more at Old Abe than I did at Little Mac Did you ever think boys what it is to have a big war on your hands with all sorts of men tellin you all sorts of things an tryin to pull you in all sorts of directions I had not thought of it before but I will think of it now said Warner In any event we are quite sure that the President has a great task before him We hear that the South will soon have a quarter of a million troops in the field Her position on the defensive is perhaps worth as many more men to her Hence let x equal her troops let y equal her defensive and we have x plus y which is equal to half a million men the number we must have before we can meet the South on equal terms An to conquer her completely we ll need nigh on to a million said the sergeant Shrewd and penetrating as was Sergeant Whitley he did not dream that before the giant struggle was over the South would have tripled her defensive quarter of a million and the North would almost have tripled her invading million A few days later their regiment marched out of the capital and joined the forces on the hills around Arlington where they lay for many days impatient but inactive There was much movement in the west and they heard of small battles in which victory and defeat were about equal The boys had shown so much zeal and ability in learning soldierly duties that they were made orderlies by their colonel John Newcomb a taciturn Pennsylvanian a rich miner who had raised a regiment partly at his own expense and who showed a great zeal for the Union He too was learning how to be a soldier and he was not above asking advice now and then of a certain Sergeant Whitley who had the judgment to give it in the manner befitting one of his lowly rank The summer days passed slowly on The heat was intense The Virginia hills and plains fairly shimmered under the burning rays of the sun But still they delayed Congress had shown the greatest courage meeting on the very day that the news of Bull Run had come and resolving to fight the war to a successful end no matter what happened But while McClellan was drilling and preparing the public again began to call for action On to Richmond was the cry but despite it the army did not yet move European newspapers came in and almost without exception they sneered at the Northern troops and predicted the early dissolution of the Union Monarchy and privileged classes everywhere rejoiced at the disaster threatening the great republic and now that it was safe to do so did not hesitate to show their delight Sensitive and proud of his country Dick was cut to the quick but Warner was more phlegmatic Let em bark he said They bark because they dislike us and they dislike us because they fear us We threatened Privilege when our Revolution succeeded and the Republic was established The fact of our existence was the threat and the threat has increased with our years and growth Europe is for the South but the reason for it is one of the simplest problems in mathematics Ten per cent of it is admiration for the Southern victory at Bull Run and ninety per cent of it is hatred at least by their ruling classes of republican institutions and a wish to see them fall here I suspect you re right said Dick and we ll have to try all the harder to keep them from being a failure Look there goes our balloon Every day usually late in the afternoon a captive balloon rose from the Northern camp and officers with powerful glasses inspected the Southern position watching for an advance or a new movement of any kind I m going up in it some day said Dick confidently Colonel Newcomb has promised me that he will take me with him when his turn for the ascension comes The chance was a week in coming a tremendously long time it seemed to Dick but it came at last He climbed into the basket with Colonel Newcomb two generals and the aeronauts and sat very quiet in a corner He felt an extraordinary thrill when the ropes were allowed to slide and the balloon was slowly going almost straight upward The sensation was somewhat similar to that which shook him when he went into battle at Bull Run but pride came to his rescue and he soon forgot the physical tremor to watch the world that now rolled beneath them a world that they seemed to have left although the ropes always held Dick s gaze instinctively turned southward where he knew the Confederate army lay A vast and beautiful panorama spread in a semi circle before him The green of summer the green that had been stained so fearfully at Bull Run was gone The grass was now brown from the great heats and the promise of autumn soon to come but from the height at least it was a soft and mellow brown and the dust was gone The hills rolled far away southward and under the horizon s rim Narrow ribbons of silver here and there were the numerous brooks and creeks that cut the country Groves still heavy and dark with foliage hung on the hills or filled some valley like green in a bowl Now and then among clumps of trees colonial houses with their pillared porticoes appeared It was a rare and beautiful scene appealing with great force to Dick There was nothing to tell of war save the Northern forces just beneath them and he would not look down But he did look back and saw the broad band of the Potomac and beyond it the white dome of the Capitol and the roof of Washington But his gaze turned again to the South where his absorbing interest lay and once more he viewed the quiet country rolling away until it touched the horizon rim The afternoon was growing late and great terraces of red and gold were heaping above one another in the sky until they reached the zenith Try the glasses for a moment Dick said Colonel Newcomb as he passed them to the boy Dick swept them across the South in a great semi circle and now new objects rose upon the surface of the earth He saw distinctly the long chain of the Blue Ridge rising on the west then blurring in the distance into a solid black rampart In the south he saw a long curving line of rising blue plumes It did not need Colonel Newcomb to tell him that these were the campfires of the army that they had met on the field of Bull Run and that the Southern troops were now cooking their suppers No doubt his cousin Harry was there and perhaps others whom he knew The fires seemed to Dick a defiance to the Union Well in view of their victory the defiance was justified and those fires might come nearer yet Dick catching the tone of older men who shared his views had not believed at first that the rebellion would last long but his opinion was changing fast and the talk of wise Sergeant Whitley was helping much in that change While he yet looked through the glasses he saw a plume of white smoke coming swiftly towards the Southern fires Then he remembered the two lines of railroad that met on the battlefield giving it its other name Manassas Junction and he knew that the smoke came from an engine pulling cars loaded with supplies for their foes He whispered of the train as he handed the glasses back to Colonel Newcomb and then the colonel and the generals alike made a long examination Beauregard will certainly have an abundance of supplies said one of the generals I hear that arms and provisions are coming by every train from the South and meanwhile we are making no advance We can t advance yet said the other general emphatically McClellan is right in making elaborate preparations and long drills before moving upon the enemy It was inexperience and not want of courage that beat us at Bull Run The Southerners had the same inexperience But they had the defensive I hear that Tom Jackson saved them and that they have given him the name Stonewall because he stood so firm I was at West Point with him An odd awkward fellow but one of the hardest students I have ever known The boys laughed at him when he first came but they soon stopped He had a funny way of studying standing up with his book on a shelf instead of sitting down at a desk Said his brain moved better that way I ve heard that he walked part of the way from Virginia to reach West Point I hear now too that he is very religious and always intends to pray before going into battle That s a bad sign for us said the other general It s easy enough to sneer at praying men but just you remember Cromwell I m a little shaky on my history but I ve an impression that when Cromwell the Ironsides old Praise God Barebones and the rest knelt said a few words to their God sang a little and advanced with their pikes they went wherever they intended to go and that Prince Rupert and all the Cavaliers could not stop them It is so said the other gravely A man who believes thoroughly in his God who is not afraid to die who in fact rather favors dying on the field is an awful foe to meet in battle We may have some of the same on our side said Colonel Newcomb We have at least a great Puritan population from which to draw One of the generals gave the signal and the balloon was slowly pulled down Dick grateful for his experience thanked Colonel Newcomb and rejoined his comrades CHAPTER II THE MOUNTAIN LIGHTS When Dick left the balloon it was nearly night Hundreds of campfires lighted up the hills about him but beyond their circle the darkness enclosed everything He still felt the sensations of one who had been at a great height and who had seen afar That rim of Southern campfires was yet in his mind and he wondered why the Northern commander allowed them to remain week after week so near the capital He was fully aware because it was common talk that the army of the Union had now reached great numbers with a magnificent equipment and with four to one should be able to drive the Southern force away Yet McClellan delayed Dick obtained a short leave of absence and walked to a campfire where he knew he would find his friend George Warner Sergeant Whitley was there too showing some young recruits how to cook without waste and the two gave the boy a welcome that was both inquisitive and hearty You ve been up in the balloon said Warner It was a rare chance Yes replied Dick with a laugh I left the world and it is the only way in which I wish to leave it for the next sixty or seventy years It was a wonderful sight George and not the least wonderful thing in it was the campfires of the Southern army burning down there towards Bull Run Burnin where they ought not to be said Whitley no gulf was yet established between commissioned and non commissioned officers in either army Little Mac may be a great organizer as they say but you can keep on organizin an organizin until it s too late to do what you want to do It s a sound principle that you lay down mister Whitley said Warner in his precise tones In fact it may be reduced to a mathematical formula Delay is always a minus quantity which may be represented by y Achievement is represented by x and consequently when you have achievement hampered by delay you have x minus y which is an extremely doubtful quantity often amounting to failure I travel another road in my reckonin s said Whitley I don t know anything about x and y but I guess you an me George come to the same place It s been a full six weeks since Bull Run an we haven t done a thing Whitley despite their difference in rank could not yet keep from addressing the boys by their first names But they took it as a matter of course in view of the fact that he was so much older than they and vastly their superior in military knowledge Dick continued the sergeant what was it you was sayin about a cousin of yours from the same town in Kentucky bein out there in the Southern army He s certainly there replied Dick if he wasn t killed in the battle which I feel couldn t have happened to a fellow like Harry We re from the same little town in Kentucky Pendleton He s descended straight from one of the greatest Indian fighters borderers and heroes the country down there ever knew Henry Ware who afterwards became one of the early governors of the State And I m descended from Henry Ware s famous friend Paul Cotter who in his time was the greatest scholar in all the West Henry Ware and Paul Cotter were like the old Greek friends Damon and Pythias Harry and I are proud to have their blood in our veins Besides being cousins there are other things to make Harry and me think a lot of each other Oh he s a grand fellow even if he is on the wrong side Dick s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm as he spoke of the cousin and comrade of his childhood The chances of war bring about strange situations or at least I have heard so said Warner Now Dick if you were to meet your cousin face to face on the battlefield with a loaded gun in your hand what would you do I d raise that gun take deliberate aim at a square foot of air about thirty feet over his head and pull the trigger But your duty to your country tells you to do otherwise Before you is a foe trying to destroy the Union You have come out armed to save that Union consequently you must fire straight at him and not at the air in order to reduce the number of our enemies One enemy where there are so many would not count for anything in the total Your arithmetic will show you that Harry s percentage in the Southern army is so small that it reaches the vanishing point If I can borrow from you George x equals Harry s percentage which is nothing y equals the value of my hypothetical opportunity which is nothing then x plus y equals nothing which represents the whole affair which is nothing that is worth nothing to the Union Hence I have no more obligation to shoot Harry if I meet him than he has to shoot me Well spoken Dick said Sergeant Whitley Some people I reckon can take duty too hard If you have one duty an another an bigger one comes along right to the same place you ought to tend to the bigger one I d never shoot anybody that was a heap to me just because he was one of three or four hundred thousand who was on the other side I ve never thought much of that old Roman father I forget his name who had his son executed just because he wasn t doin exactly right There was never a rule that oughtn t to have exceptions under extraordinary circumstances If you can establish the principle of exceptions replied the young Vermonter very gravely I will allow Dick to shoot in the air when he meets his cousin in the height of battle but it is a difficult task to establish it and if it fails Dick according to all rules of logic and duty must shoot straight at his cousin s heart The other two looked at Warner and saw his left eyelid droop slightly A faint twinkle appeared in either eye and then they laughed I reckon that Dick shoots high in the air said the sergeant Dick after a pleasant hour with his friends went back to Colonel Newcomb s quarters where he spent the entire evening writing despatches at dictation He was hopeful that all this writing portended something but more days passed and despite the impatience of both army and public there was no movement Stories of confused and uncertain fighting still came out of the west but between Washington and Bull Run there was perfect peace The summer passed Autumn came and deepened The air was crisp and sparkling The leaves turned into glowing reds and yellows and browns began to fall from the trees The advancing autumn contained the promise of winter soon to come The leaves fell faster and sharp winds blew bringing with them chill rains Little Mac or the Young Napoleon as many of his friends loved to call him continued his preparations and despite all the urgings of President and Congress would not move His fatal defect now showed in all its destructiveness To him the enemy always appeared threefold his natural size Reliable scouts brought back the news that the Southern troops at Manassas a full two months after their victory there numbered only forty thousand The Northern commander issued statements that the enemy was before him with one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers He demanded that his own forces should be raised to nearly a quarter of a million men and nearly five hundred cannon before he could move The veteran Scott full of triumphs and honors but feeling himself out of place in his old age went into retirement McClellan now in sole command still lingered and delayed while the South making good use of precious months gathered all her forces to meet him or whomsoever came against her Youth chafed most against the long waiting It seemed to Dick and his mathematical Vermont friend that time was fairly wasting away under their feet and the wise sergeant agreed with them The weather had grown so cold now that they built fires for warmth as well as cooking and the two youths sat with Sergeant Whitley one cold evening in late October before a big blaze Both were tanned deeply by wind sun and rain and they had grown uncommonly hardy but the wind that night came out of the northwest and it had such a sharp edge to it that they were glad to draw their blankets over their backs and shoulders Dick was re reading a letter from his mother a widow who lived on the outskirts of Pendleton It had come that morning and it was the only one that had reached him since his departure from Kentucky But she had received another that he had written to her directly after the Battle of Bull Run She wrote of her gratitude because Providence had watched over him in that dreadful conflict all the more dreadful because it was friend against friend brother against brother The state she said was all in confusion Everybody suspected everybody else The Southerners were full of victory the Northerners were hopeful of victory yet to come Colonel Kenton was with the Southern force under General Buckner gathered at Bowling Green in that state but his son her nephew Harry was still in the east with Beauregard She had heard that the troops of the west and northwest were coming down the Ohio and Mississippi in great numbers and people expected hard fighting to occur very soon in western and southern Kentucky It was all very dreadful and a madness seemed to have come over the land but she hoped that Providence would continue to watch over her dear son Warner and the sergeant knew that the letter was from Dick s mother but they had too much delicacy to ask him questions The boy folded the sheets carefully and returned them to their place in the inside pocket of his coat Then he looked for a while thoughtfully into the blaze and the great bed of coals that had formed beneath As far as one could see to right and left like fires burned but the night remained dark with promise of rain and the chill wind out of the northwest increased in vigor The words just read for the fifth time had sunk deep in his mind and he was feeling the call of the west My mother writes he said to his comrades that the Confederate general Buckner whom I know is gathering a large force around Bowling Green in the southern part of our state and that fighting is sure to occur soon between that town and the Mississippi An officer named Grant has come down from Illinois and he is said to be pushing the Union troops forward with a lot of vigor Sergeant you are up on army affairs Do you know this man Grant Sergeant Whitley shook his head Never heard of him he replied Like as not he s one of the officers who resigned from the army after the Mexican War There was so little to do then and so little chance of promotion that a lot of them quit to go into business I suppose they ll all be coming back now I want to go out there said Dick It s my country and the westerners at least are acting But look at our army here Bull Run was fought the middle of summer Now it s nearly winter and nothing has been done We don t get out of sight of Washington If I can get myself sent west I m going And I m going with you said Warner Me too said the sergeant I know that Colonel Newcomb s eyes are turning in that direction continued Dick He s a war horse he is and he d like to get into the thick of it You re his favorite aide said the calculating young Vermonter Can t you sow those western seeds in his mind and keep on sowing them The fact that you are from this western battle ground will give more weight to what you say You do this and I ll wager that within a week the Colonel will induce the President to send the whole regiment to the Mississippi Can you reduce your prediction to a mathematical certainty asked Dick a twinkle appearing in his eye No I can t do that replied Warner with an answering twinkle but you re the very fellow to influence Colonel Newcomb s mind I m a mathematician and I work with facts but you have the glowing imagination that conduces to the creation of facts Big words Grand words said the sergeant Never let Colonel Newcomb forget the west continued Warner not noticing the interruption Keep it before him all the time Hint that there can be no success along the Mississippi without him and his regiment I ll do what I can promised Dick faithfully and he did much Colonel Newcomb had already formed a strong attachment for this zealous and valuable young aide and he did not forget the words that Dick said on every convenient occasion about the west He made urgent representations that he and his regiment be sent to the relief of the struggling Northern forces there and he contrived also that these petitions should reach the President One day the order came to go but not to saint Louis where Halleck now in command was Instead they were to enter the mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky and help the mountaineers who were loyal to the Union If they accomplished that task with success they were to proceed to the greater theatre in Western Kentucky and Tennessee It was not all they wished but they thought it far better than remaining at Washington where it seemed that the army would remain indefinitely Colonel Newcomb who was sitting in his tent bending over maps with his staff summoned Dick You are a Kentuckian my lad he said and I thought you might know something about this region into which we are going Not much sir replied Dick My home is much further west in a country very different both in its own character and that of its people But I have been in the mountains two or three times and I may be of some help as a guide I am sure you will do your best said Colonel Newcomb By the way that young Vermont friend of yours Warner is to be on my staff also and it is very likely that you and he will go on many errands together Can t we take Sergeant Whitley with us sometimes asked Dick boldly So you can replied the colonel laughing a little I ve noticed that man and I ve a faint suspicion that he knows more about war than any of us civilian officers It s our task to learn as much as we can from these old regulars said a Major Hertford a man of much intelligence and good humor who previous to the war had been a lawyer in a small town Alan Hertford was about twenty five and of fine manner and appearance Well spoken Major Hertford said the thoughtful miner Colonel Newcomb Now Dick you can go and remember that we are to start for Washington early in the morning and take a train there for the north It will be the duty of Lieutenant Warner and yourself as well as others to see that our men are ready to the last shoe for the journey Dick and Warner were so much elated that they worked all that night and they did not hesitate to go to Sergeant Whitley for advice or instruction At the first spear of dawn the regiment marched away in splendid order from Arlington to Washington where the train that was to bear them to new fields and unknown fortunes was ready It was a long train of many coaches as the regiment numbered seven hundred men and it also carried with it four guns mounted on trucks The coaches were all of primitive pattern The soldiers were to sleep on the seats and their arms and supplies were heaped in the aisles It was a cold drizzling day of closing autumn and the capital looked sodden and gloomy Cameron the Secretary of War came to see them off and to make the customary prediction concerning their valor and victory to come But he was a cold man and he was repellent to Dick used to more warmth of temperament Then with a ringing of bells a heave of the engine a great puffing of smoke and a mighty rattling of wheels the train drew out of Washington and made its noisy way toward Baltimore Dick and Warner were on the same seat It was only forty miles to Baltimore but their slow train would be perhaps three hours in arriving So they had ample opportunity to see the country which they examined with the curious eyes of youth But there was little to see The last leaves were falling from the trees under the early winter rain Bare boughs and brown grass went past their windows and the fields were deserted The landscape looked chill and sullen Warner was less depressed than Dick He had an even temperament based solidly upon mathematical calculations He knew that while it might be raining today the chances were several to one against its raining tomorrow I ve good cause to remember Baltimore he said I was with the New England troops when they had the fight there on the way down to the capital Although we hold it it s really a Southern city Dick Most all the border cities are Southern in sympathy and they re swarming with people who will send to the Southern leaders news of every movement we make I state and moreover I assert it in the face of all the world that the knowledge of our departure from Washington is already in Southern hands By close mathematical calculation the chances are at least ninety five per cent in favor of my statement Very likely said Dick and we ll have that sort of thing to face all the time when we invade the South We ve got to win this war George by hard fighting and then more hard fighting and then more and more of the same Guess you re right Arithmetic shows at least one hundred per cent of probability in favor of your suggestion Dick looked up and down the long coach packed with young troops Besides the commissioned officers and the sergeants there was not one in the coach who was twenty five Most of them were nineteen or twenty and it was the same in the other coaches After the first depression their spirits rose The temper of youth showed strongly They were eager to see Baltimore but the train stopped there only a few minutes and they were not allowed to leave the coaches Then the train turned towards the west The drizzle of rain had now become a pour and it drove so heavily that they could see but little outside Food was served at noon and afterward many slept in the cramped seats Dick despite his stiff position fell asleep too By the middle of the afternoon everybody in their coach was slumbering soundly except Sergeant Whitley who sat by the door leading to the next car All that afternoon and into the night the train rattled and moved into the west The beautiful rolling country was left behind and they were now among the mountains whirling around precipices so sharply that often the sleeping boys were thrown from the seats of the coaches But they were growing used to hardships They merely climbed back again upon the seats and were asleep once more in half a minute The rain still fell and the wind blew fiercely among the somber mountains A second engine had been added to the train and the speed of the train was slackened The engineer in front stared at the slippery rails but he could see only a few yards The pitchy darkness closed in ahead hiding everything even the peaks and ridges The heart of that engineer and he was a brave man as brave as any soldier on the battlefield had sunk very low Railroads were little past their infancy then and this was the first to cross the mountains He was by no means certain of his track and moreover the rocks and forest might shelter an ambush The Alleghanies and their outlying ridges and spurs are not lofty mountains but to this day they are wild and almost inaccessible in many places Nature has made them a formidable barrier and in the great Civil War those who trod there had to look with all their eyes and listen with all their ears The engineer was not alone in his anxiety this night Colonel Newcomb rose from an uneasy doze and he went with Major Hertford into the engineer s cab They were now going at the rate of not more than five or six miles an hour the long train winding like a snake around the edges of precipices and feeling its way gingerly over the trestles that spanned the deep valleys All trains made a great roar and rattle then and the long ravines gave it back in a rumbling and menacing echo Gusts of rain were swept now and then into the faces of the engineer the firemen and the officers Do you see anything ahead Canby said Colonel Newcomb to the engineer Nothing That s the trouble sir If it were a clear night I shouldn t be worried Then we wouldn t be likely to steam into danger with our eyes shut This is a wild country The mountaineers in the main are for us but we are not far north of the Southern line and if they know we are crossing they may undertake to raid in here And they may know it said the colonel Washington is full of Southern sympathizers Stop the train Canby when we come to the first open and level space and we ll do some scouting ahead The engineer felt great relief He was devoutly glad that the colonel was going to take such a precaution At that moment he more than Colonel Newcomb was responsible for the lives of the seven hundred human beings aboard the train and his patriotism and sense of responsibility were both strong The train with much jolting and clanging stopped fifteen minutes later Both Dick and Warner awakened by the shock sat up and rubbed their eyes Then they left the train at once to join Colonel Newcomb who might want them immediately Wary Sergeant Whitley followed them in silence The boys found Colonel Newcomb and the remaining members of his staff standing near and seeking anxiously to discover the nature of the country about them The colonel nodded when they arrived and gave them an approving glance The two stood by awaiting the colonel s orders but they did not neglect to use their eyes Dick saw by the engineer s lantern that they were in a valley and he learned from his words that this valley was about three miles long with a width of perhaps half a mile A little mountain river rushed down its center and the train would cross the stream about a mile further on It was still raining and the cold wind whistled down from the mountains Dick could see the somber ridges showing dimly through the loom of darkness and rain He was instantly aware too of a tense and uneasy feeling among the officers All of them carried glasses but in the darkness they could not use them Lights began to appear in the train and many heads were thrust out at the windows Go through the coaches mister Mason and mister Warner said Colonel Newcomb and have every light put out immediately Tell them too that my orders are for absolute silence Dick and the Vermonter did their work rapidly receiving many curious inquiries as they went from coach to coach all of which they were honestly unable to answer They knew no more than the other boys about the situation But when they left the last coach and returned to the officers near the engine the train was in total darkness and no sound came from it Colonel Newcomb again gave them an approving nod Dick noticed that the fires in the engine were now well covered and that no sparks came from the smoke stack Standing by it he could see the long shape of the train running back in the darkness but it would have been invisible to any one a hundred yards away You think we re thoroughly hidden now Canby said the colonel Yes sir Unless they ve located us precisely on advance information I don t see how they could find us among the mountains in all this darkness and rain But they ve had the advance information Look there exclaimed Major Hertford pointing toward the high ridge that lay on their right A beam of light had appeared on the loftiest spur standing out at first like a red star in the darkness then growing intensely brighter and burning with a steady vivid light The effect was weird and powerful The mountain beneath it was invisible and it seemed to burn there like a real eye wrathful and menacing The older men as well as the boys were held as if by a spell It was something monstrous and eastern like the appearance of a genie out of the Arabian Nights The light after remaining fixed for at least a minute began to move slowly from side to side and then faster A signal exclaimed Colonel Newcomb Beyond a doubt it is the Southerners Whatever they re saying they re saying it to somebody Look toward the south Ah there they are answering exclaimed Major Hertford All had wheeled simultaneously and on another high spur a mile to the south a second red light as vivid and intense as the first was flashing back and forth It too the mountain below invisible seemed to swing in the heavens Dick standing there in the darkness and rain and knowing that imminent and mortal danger was on either side felt a frightful chill creeping slowly down his spine It is a terrible thing to feel through some superior sense that an invisible foe is approaching and not be able to know by any kind of striving whence he came The lights flashed alternately and presently both dropped from the sky seeming to Dick to leave blacker spots on the darkness in their place Then only the heavy night and the rain encompassed them What do you think it is asked Colonel Newcomb of Major Hertford Southern troops beyond a doubt It is equally certain that they were warned in some manner from Washington of our departure I think so too It is probable that they saw the light and have been signalling their knowledge to each other It seems likely to me that they will wait at the far end of the valley to cut us off What force do you think it is Perhaps a cavalry detachment that has ridden hurriedly to intercept us I would say at a guess that it is Turner Ashby and his men A skillful and dangerous foe as you know Already the fame of this daring Confederate horseman was spreading over Virginia and Maryland If we are right in our guess said Major Hertford they will dismount lead their horses along the mountain side and shut down the trap upon us Doubtless they are in superior force and know the country much better than we do If they get ahead of us and have a little time to do it in they will certainly tear up the tracks I think you are right in all respects said Colonel Newcomb But it is obvious that we must not give them time to destroy the road ahead of us As for the rest I wonder He pulled uneasily at his short beard and then he caught sight of Sergeant Whitley standing silently arms folded by the side of the engine Newcomb the miner colonel was a man of big and open mind A successful business man he had the qualities which made him a good general by the time the war was in its third year He knew Whitley and he knew too that he was an old army regular bristling with experience and shrewdness Sergeant Whitley he said in this emergency what would you do if you were in my place The sergeant saluted respectfully If I were in your place sir which I never will be he replied I would have all the troops leave the train Then I would have the engineers take the train forward slowly while the troops marched on either side of it but at a sufficient distance to be hidden in the darkness Then sir our men could not be caught in a wreck but with their feet on solid earth they would be ready if need be for a fight which is our business Well spoken Sergeant Whitley said Colonel Newcomb while the other officers also nodded approval Your plan is excellent and we will adopt it Get the troops out of the train quickly but in silence and do you Canby be ready with the engine Dick and Warner with the older officers turned to the task The young soldiers were out of the train in two minutes and were forming in lines on either side arms ready There were many whisperings among these boys but none loud enough to be heard twenty yards away All felt intense relief when they left the train and stood upon the solid though decidedly damp earth But the cold rain sweeping upon their faces was a tonic both mental and physical after the close heat of the train They did not know why they had disembarked but they surmised with good reason that an attack was threatened and they were eager to meet it Dick and Warner were near the head of the line on the right of the tracks and Sergeant Whitley was with them The train began to puff heavily and in spite of every precaution some sparks flew from the smoke stack Dick knew that it was bound to rumble and rattle when it started but he was surprised at the enormous amount of noise it made when the wheels really began to turn It seemed to him that in the silence of the night it could be heard three or four miles Then he realized that it was merely his own excitement and extreme tension of both mind and body Canby was taking the train forward so gently that its sounds were drowned two hundred yards away in the swirl of wind and rain The men marched each line keeping abreast of the train but fifty yards or more to one side The young troops were forbidden to speak and their footsteps made no noise in the wet grass and low bushes Dick and Warner kept their eyes on the mountains turning them alternately from north to south Nothing appeared on either ridge and no sound came to tell of an enemy near Dick began to believe that they would pass through the valley and out of the trap without a combat But while a train may go two or three miles in a few minutes it takes troops marching in the darkness over uncertain ground a long time to cover the same distance They marched a full half hour and then Dick suppressed a cry The light burning as intensely red as before appeared again on the mountain to the right but further toward the west seeming to have moved parallel to the Northern troops As Dick looked it began to flash swiftly from side to side and that chill and weird feeling again ran down his spine He looked toward the south and there was the second signal red and intense replying to the first Dick heard a deep Ah run along the line of young troops and he knew now that they understood as much as he or any of the officers did He now knew too that they would not pass out of the valley without a combat The Southern forces beyond a doubt would try to shut them in at the western mouth of the valley and a battle in the night and rain was sure to follow The train continued to move slowly forward Had Colonel Newcomb dared he would have ordered Canby to increase his speed in order that he might reach the western mouth of the valley before the Southern force had a chance to tear up the rails but there was no use for the train without the troops and they were already marching as fast as they could The gorge was now not more than a quarter of a mile away Dick was able to discern it because the darkness there was not quite so dark as that which lay against the mountains on either side He was hopeful that they might yet reach it before the Southern force could close down upon them but before they went many yards further he heard the beat of horses feet both to right and left and knew that the enemy was at hand Take the train on through the pass Canby shouted Colonel Newcomb We ll cover its retreat and join you later if we can The train began to rattle and roar and its speed increased Showers of sparks shot from the funnels of the two engines and gleamed for an instant in the darkness The beat of horses feet grew to thunder Colonel Newcomb with great presence of mind drew the two parallel lines of his men close together and ordered them to lie down on either side of the railroad track and face outward with cocked rifles Dick the Vermonter and Sergeant Whitley lay close together and the three faced the north See the torches said Whitley Dick saw eight or ten torches wavering and flickering at a height of seven or eight feet above the ground and he knew that they were carried by horsemen but he could not see either men or horses beneath Then the rapid beat of hoofs ceased abruptly at a distance that Dick thought must be about two hundred yards Lie flat cried Whitley They re about to fire CHAPTER III THE TELEGRAPH STATION The darkness to the north was suddenly split apart by a solid sheet of flame Dick by the light saw many men on horseback and others on foot bridle rein over arm It was well for the seven hundred boys that they had pressed themselves against the solid earth A sheet of bullets swept toward them Most passed over their heads but many struck upon bones and flesh and cries of pain rose from the lines of men lying along the railroad track The seven hundred pulled trigger and fired at the flash They fired so well that Dick could hear Southern horses neighing with pain and struggling in the darkness He felt sure that many men too had been hit At least no charge came The seven hundred shouted with exultation and leaping to their feet prepared to fire a second volley But the swift command of their officers quickly put them down again Don t forget the other Confederate column to the south of us whispered Whitley They did not fire at first for fear their bullets would pass over our heads and strike their own comrades For the same reason they must have dropped back a little in order to avoid the fire of their friends Their volley will come from an angle about midway between our left and rear Just as he spoke the last words the rifles flashed at the surmised angle and again the bullets beat among the young troops or swept over their heads A soldier was killed only a few feet from Dick The boy picked up his rifle and ammunition and began to fire whenever he saw the flash of an opposing weapon But the fire of both Confederate columns ceased in a minute or two and not a shot nor the sound of a single order came out of the darkness But Dick with his ear to the soft earth could hear the crush of hoofs in the mud and with a peculiar ability to discern whence sound came he knew that the force on the left and rear was crossing the railroad track in order to join their comrades on the north He whispered his knowledge to Whitley who whispered back It s the natural thing for them to do They could not afford to fight on in the darkness with two separate forces The two columns would soon be firing into each other Colonel Newcomb now gave an order for the men to rise and follow the railroad track but also to fire at the flash of the rifles whenever a volley was poured upon them He must not only beat off the Southern attack but also continue the journey to those points in the west where they were needed so sorely Some of his men had been killed and he was compelled to leave their bodies where they had fallen Others were wounded but without exception they were helped along by their comrades Warner also had secured a rifle with which he fired occasionally but he and Dick despite the darkness kept near to Colonel Newcomb in order that they might deliver any orders that he should choose to give Sergeant Whitley was close to them Dick presently heard the rush of water What is that he exclaimed It s the little river that runs down the valley replied Warner There s a slope here and it comes like a torrent A bridge or rather trestle is only a little further and we ve got to walk the ties if we reach the other side They ll make their heaviest rush there I suppose as beyond a doubt they are thoroughly acquainted with the ground The Northern troops left the track which here ran along an embankment several feet high and took shelter on its southern side They now had an advantage for a while as they fired from a breastwork upon their foes who were in the open But the darkness lit only by the flashes of the rifles kept the fire of both sides from being very destructive the bullets being sent mainly at random Dick dimly saw the trestle work ahead of them and the roaring of the little river increased He did not know how deep the water was but he was sure that it could not be above his waist as it was a small stream An idea occurred to him and he promptly communicated it to Colonel Newcomb Suppose sir he said that we ford the river just below the trestle It will deceive them and we ll be half way across before they suspect the change A good plan mister Mason said Colonel Newcomb We ll try it Word was quickly passed along the line that they should turn to the left as they approached the trestle march swiftly down the slope and dash into the stream As fast as they reached the other side of the ford the men should form upon the bank there and with their rifles cover the passage of their comrades The skeleton work of the trestle now rose more clearly into view The rain had almost ceased and faint rays of moonlight showed through the rifts where the clouds had broken apart The boys distinctly heard the gurgling rush of waters and they also saw the clear bluish surface of the mountain stream The same quickening of light disclosed the Southern force on their right flank and rear only four or five hundred yards away Dick s hasty glance backward lingered for a moment on a powerful man on a white horse just in advance of the Southern column He saw this man raise his hand and then command the men to fire He and twenty others under the impulse of excitement shouted to the regiment to drop down and the Northern lads did so Most of the volley passed over their heads Rising they sent back a return discharge and then the head of the columns rushed into the stream Dick felt swift water whirling about him and tugging at his body but it rose no higher than his waist although foam and spray were dashed into his face He heard all around him the splashing of his comrades and their murmurs of satisfaction They realized now that they were not only able to retreat before a much superior force but this same stream when crossed would form a barrier behind which they could fight two to one The Confederate leader whoever he might be and Dick had no doubt that he was the redoubtable Turner Ashby also appreciated the full facts and he drove his whole force straight at the regiment It was well for the young troops that part of them were already across and under the skillful leadership of Colonel Newcomb Major Hertford and three or four old regular army sergeants of whom the best was Whitley were already forming in line of battle Kneel shouted the colonel and fire over the heads of your comrades at the enemy The light was still growing brighter The rain came only in slight flurries The clouds were trooping off toward the northeast and the moon was out Dick clearly saw the black mass of the Southern horsemen wheeling down upon them At least three hundred of the regiment were now upon the bank and with fairly steady aim they poured a heavy volley into the massed ranks of their foe Dick saw horses fall while others dashed away riderless But the Southern line wavered only for a moment and then came on again with many shouts There were also dismounted men on either flank who knelt and maintained a heavy fire upon the defenders The lads in blue were suffering many wounds but a line of trees and underbrush on the western shore helped them Lying there partly protected they loaded and pulled trigger as fast as they could while the rest of their comrades emerged dripping from the stream to join them The Confederates brave as they were had no choice but to give ground against such strong defense and the miner colonel despite his reserve and his middle years gave vent to his exultation We can hold this line forever he exclaimed to his aides It s one thing to charge us in the open but it s quite another to get at us across a deep and rushing stream Major Hertford take part of the men to the other side of the railroad track and drive back any attempt at a crossing there Lieutenant Mason you and Lieutenant Warner go ahead and see what has become of the train You can get back here in plenty time for more fighting Dick and Warner hurried forward following the line of the railroad Their blood was up and they did not like to leave the defense of the river but orders must be obeyed As they ran down the railroad track a man came forward swinging a lantern and they saw the tall gaunt figure of Canby the chief engineer Behind him the train stretched away in the darkness I guess that our men have forded the river and are holding the bank said Canby Do they need the train crew back there to help He spoke with husky eagerness Dick knew that he was longing to be in the middle of the fight but that his duty kept him with the train No he replied The river bank and the road along its shore give us a great position for defense and I know we can hold it Colonel Newcomb did not say so but perhaps you d better bring the train back nearer us It s not our object to stay in this valley and fight but to go into the west Is all clear ahead No enemy is there Some of the brakemen have gone on a mile or two and they say the track hasn t been touched You tell Colonel Newcomb that I m bringing the train right down to the battle line Dick and Warner returned quickly to Colonel Newcomb who appreciated Canby s courage and presence of mind As the train approached the four cannon were unloaded from the trucks and swept the further shore with shell and shrapnel After a scattered fire the Southern force withdrew some distance where it halted apparently undecided The clouds rolled up again the feeble moon disappeared and the river sank into the dark May I make a suggestion Colonel Newcomb said Major Hertford Certainly The enemy will probably seek an undefended ford much higher up cross under cover of the new darkness and attack us in heavy force on the flank Suppose we get aboard the train at once cannon and all and leave them far behind Excellent If the darkness covers their movements it also covers ours Load the train as fast as possible and see that no wounded are left behind He gave rapid orders to all his officers and aides and in fifteen minutes the troops were aboard the train again the cannon were lifted upon the trucks Canby and his assistants had all steam up and the train with its usual rattle and roar resumed its flight into the west Dick and Warner were in the first coach near Colonel Newcomb ready for any commands that he might give Both had come through the defense of the ford without injury although a bullet had gone through Dick s coat without touching the skin Sergeant Whitley too was unharmed but the regiment had suffered More than twenty dead were left in the valley for the enemy to bury Despite all the commands and efforts of the officers there was much excited talk in the train Boys were binding up wounds of other boys and were condoling with them But on the whole they were exultant Youth did not realize the loss of those who had been with them so little Scattered exclamations came to Dick We beat em off that time an we can do it again Lucky though we had that little river before us Guess they d have rode us right down with their horses if it hadn t been for the stream an its banks Ouch don t draw that bandage so tight on my arm It ain t nothin but a flesh wound I hate a battle in the dark Give me the good sunshine where you can see what s goin on My God that you Bill I m tremendous glad to see you I thought you was lyin still back there in the grass Dick said nothing He was in a seat next to the window and his face was pressed against the rain marked pane The rifle that he had picked up and used so well was still clutched grimed with smoke in his hands The train had not yet got up speed He caught glimpses of the river behind which they had fought and which had served them so well as a barrier In fact he knew that it had saved them But they had beaten off the enemy The pulses in his temples still throbbed from exertion and excitement but his heart beat exultantly The bitterness of Bull Run was deep and it had lasted long but here they were the victors The speed of the train increased and Dick knew that they were safe from further attack They were still running among mountains clad heavily in forest but a meeting with a second Southern force was beyond probability The first had made a quick raid on information supplied by spies in Washington but it had failed and the way was now clear Ample food was served somewhat late to the whole regiment the last wounds were bound up and Dick having put aside the rifle fell asleep at last His head lay against the window and he slept heavily all through the night Warner in the next seat slept in the same way But the wise old sergeant just across the aisle remained awake much longer He was summing up and he concluded that the seven hundred lads had done well They were raw but they were being whipped into shape He smiled a little grimly as the unspoken words whipped into shape rose to his lips The veteran of many an Indian battle foresaw something vastly greater than anything that had occurred on the plains Whipped into shape Why in the mighty war that was gathering along a front of two thousand miles no soldier could escape being whipped into shape or being whipped out of it But the sergeant s own eyes closed after a while and he too slept the sleep of utter mental and physical exhaustion The train rumbled on the faithful Canby in the first engine aware of his great responsibility and equal to it Not a wink of sleep for him that night The darkness had lightened somewhat more The black of the skies had turned to a dusky blue and the bolder stars were out He could always see the shining rails three or four hundred yards ahead and he sent his train steadily forward at full speed winding among the gorges and rattling over the trestles The silent mountains gave back every sound in dying echoes but Canby paid no heed to them His eyes were always on the track ahead and he too was exultant He had brought the regiment through and while it was on the train his responsibility was not inferior to that of Colonel Newcomb When Dick awoke bright light was pouring in at the car windows but the car was cold and his body was stiff and sore His military overcoat had been thrown over him in the night and Warner had been covered in the same way They did not know that Sergeant Whitley had done that thoughtful act Dick stretched himself and drew deep breaths Warm youth soon sent the blood flowing in a full tide through his veins and the stiffness and soreness departed He saw through the window that they were still running among the mountains but they did not seem to be so high here as they were at the river by which they had fought in the night He knew from his geography and his calculation of time that they must be far into that part of Virginia which is now West Virginia There was no rain now at least where the train was running but the sun had risen on a cold world Far up on the higher peaks he saw a fine white mist which he believed to be falling snow Obviously it was winter here and putting on the big military coat he drew it tightly about him Others in the coach were waking up and some of them grown feverish with their wounds were moving restlessly on their seats where they lay protected by the blankets of their fellows Dick now and then saw a cabin nestling in the lee of a hill with the blue smoke rising from its chimney into the clear wintry air and small and poor as they were they gave him a singular sense of peace and comfort His mind felt for a few moments a strong reaction from war and its terrors but the impulse and the strong purpose that bore him on soon came back The train rushed through a pass and entered a sheltered valley a mile or two wide and eight or ten miles long A large creek ran through it and the train stopped at a village on its banks The whole population of the village and all the farmers of the valley were there to meet them It was a Union valley and by some system of mountain telegraphy although there were no telegraph wires news of the battle at the ford had preceded the train Come lads said Colonel Newcomb to his staff Out with you We re among friends here Dick and Warner were glad enough to leave the train The air cold as it was was like the breath of heaven on their faces and the cheers of the people were like the trump of fame in their ears Pretty girls with their faces in red hoods or red comforters were there with food and smoking coffee Medicines for the wounded as much as the village could supply had been brought to the train and places were already made for those hurt too badly to go on with the expedition The whole cheerful scene with its life and movement the sight of new faces and the sound of many voices had a wonderful effect upon young Dick Mason He had a marvellously sensitive temperament a direct inheritance from his famous border ancestor Paul Cotter Things were always vivid to him Either they glowed with color or they were hueless and dead This morning the long strain of the night and its battle was relaxed completely The grass in the valley was brown with frost and the trees were shorn of their leaves by the winter winds but to Dick it was the finest village that he had ever seen and these were the friendliest people in the world He drank a cup of hot coffee handed to him by the stalwart wife of a farmer and then when she insisted drank another You re young to be fightin she said sympathetically We all are said Dick with a glance at the regiment but however we may fight you ll never find anybody attacking a breakfast with more valor and spirit than we do She looked at the long line of lads drinking coffee and eating ham bacon eggs and hot biscuits and smiled I reckon you tell the truth young feller she said but it s good to see em go at it She passed on to help others and Dick summoned by Colonel Newcomb went into a little railroad and telegraph station The telegraph wires had been cut behind them but ten miles across the mountains the spur of another railroad touched a valley The second railroad looped toward the north and it was absolutely sure that it was beyond the reach of Southern raiders Colonel Newcomb wished to send a message to the Secretary of War and the President telling of the night s events and his triumphant passage through the ordeal These circumstances might make them wish to change his orders and at any rate the commander of the regiment wished to be sure of what he was doing You re a Kentuckian and a good horseman said Colonel Newcomb to Dick The villagers have sent me a trusty man one Bill Petty as a guide Take Sergeant Whitley and you three go to the station I ve already written my dispatches and I put them in your care Have them sent at once and if necessary wait four hours for an answer If it comes ride back as fast as you can The horses are ready and I rely upon you Thank you sir I ll do my best said Dick who deeply appreciated the colonel s confidence He wasted no time in words but went at once to Sergeant Whitley who was ready in five minutes Warner who heard of the mission was disappointed because he was not going too But he was philosophical I ve made a close calculation he said and I have demonstrated to my own satisfaction that our opportunities are sixty per cent energy and ability twenty per cent manners and twenty per cent chance In this case chance which made the Colonel better acquainted with you than with me was in your favor We won t discuss the other eighty per cent because this twenty is enough Besides it looks pretty cold on the mountains and its fine here in the village But luck with you Dick He gave his comrade s hand a strong grasp and walked away toward the little square of the village where the troops were encamped for the present Dick sprang upon a horse which Bill Petty was holding for him Whitley was already up and the three rode swiftly toward a blue line which marked a cleft between two ridges Dick first observed their guide Bill Petty was a short but very stout man clad in a suit of home made blue jeans the trousers of which were thrust into high boots with red tops A heavy shawl of dark red was wrapped around his shoulders and beneath his broad brimmed hat a red woolen comforter covered his ears cheeks and chin His thick hair and a thick beard clothing his entire face were a flaming red The whole effect of the man was somewhat startling but when he saw Dick looking at him in curiosity his mouth opened wide in a grin of extreme good nature I guess you think I m right red he said Well I am an as you see I always dress to suit my complexion Guess I ll warm up the road some on a winter day like this Would you mind my callin you Red Blaze asked Sergeant Whitley gravely Not a tall Not a tall I d like it I guess it s sorter pictorial an maginative like them knights of old who had fancy names cordin to their qualities People round here are pretty plain an they ve never called me nothin but Bill Red Blaze she is An Blaze for short Well then Blaze what kind of a road is that we re goin to ride on Depends on the kind of weather in which you ask the question As it s the fust edge of winter here in the mountains though it ain t quite come in the lowlands an as it s rained a lot in the last week I reckon you ll find it bad Mebbe our hosses will go down in the road to thar knees but I guess they won t sink up to thar bodies They may stumble an throw us but as we ll hit in soft mud it ain t likely to hurt us It may rain hard cause I see clouds heapin up thar in the west An if it rains the cold may then freeze a skim of ice over the road on which we could slip an break our necks hosses an all Then thar are some cliffs close to the road If we was to slip on that thar skim of ice which we ve reckoned might come then mebbe we d go over one of them cliffs and drop down a hundred feet or so right swift If it was soft mud down below we might not get hurt mortal But it ain t soft mud We d hit right in the middle of sharp hard rocks An if a gang of rebel sharpshooters has wandered up here they may see us an chase us way off into the mountains where we d break our necks fallin off the ridges or freeze to death or starve to death Whitley stared at him Blaze he exclaimed what kind of a man are you anyway Me I m the happiest man in the valley When people are low down they come an talk to me to get cheered up I always lay the worst before you first an then shove it out of the way None of them things that I was conjurin up is goin to happen I was just tellin you of the things you was goin to escape and now you ll feel good knowin what dangers you have passed before they happened Dick laughed He liked this intensely red man with his round face and twinkling eyes He saw too that the mountaineer was a fine horseman and as he carried a long slender barreled rifle over his shoulder while a double barreled pistol was thrust in his belt it was likely that he would prove a formidable enemy to any who sought to stop him Perhaps your way is wise said the boy You begin with the bad and end with the good What is the name of this place to which we are going Hubbard There was a pioneer who fit the Injuns in here in early times I never heard that he got much cept a town named after him But Hubbard is a right peart little place with a bank two stores three churches an nigh on to two hundred people Are you wrapped up well mister Mason cause it s goin to be cold on the mountains Dick wore heavy boots and a long heavy military coat which fell below his knees and which also had a high collar protecting his ears He was provided also with heavy buckskin gloves The sergeant was clad similarly I think I m clothed against any amount of cold he replied Well you need to be said Petty cause the pass through which we re goin is at least fifteen hundred feet above Townsville that s our village an I reckon it s just bout as high over Hubbard Them fifteen hundred feet make a pow ful difference in climate as you ll soon find out It s not only colder thar but the winds are always blowin hard through the pass Jest look back at Townsville Ain t she fine an neat down thar in the valley beside that clear creek which higher up in the mountains is full of the juiciest an sweetest trout that man ever stuck a tooth into Dick saw that Petty was talkative but he did not mind In fact both he and Whitley liked the man s joyous and unbroken run of chatter He turned in his saddle and looked back following the stout man s pointing finger Townsville though but a little mountain town built mainly of logs was indeed a jewel softened and with a silver sheen thrown over it by the mountain air which was misty that morning He dimly saw the long black line of the train standing on the track and here and there warm rings of smoke rose from the chimneys and floated up into the heavens where they were lost He thought he could detect little figures moving beside the train and he knew that they must be those of his comrades He felt for a moment a sense of loneliness He had not known these lads long but the battle had bound them firmly together They had been comrades in danger and that made them comrades as long as they lived Greatest town in the world said Petty waving toward it a huge hand encased in a thick yarn glove I ve traveled from it as much as fifty miles in every direction north south east an west an I ain t never seed its match I reckon I m somethin of a traveler but every time I come back to Townsville I think all the more of it seein how much better it is than anything else Dick glanced at the mountaineer and saw that there could be no doubt of his sincerity You re a lucky man mister Petty he said to live in the finest place in the world Yes if I don t get drug off to the war I m not hankerin for fightin an I don t know much what the war s about though I m for the Union fust to last an that s the way most of the people bout here feel Turn your heads ag in friends an take another look at Townsville Dick and Whitley glanced back and saw only the blank gray wall of the mountain Petty laughed He was the finest laugher that Dick had ever heard The laugh did not merely come from the mouth it was also exuded pouring out through every pore It was rolling unctuous and so strong that Petty not only shook with it but his horse seemed to shake also It was mellow too with an organ note that comes of a mighty lung and throat and of pure air breathed all the year around Thought I d git the joke on you he said when he stopped laughing The road s been slantin into the mountains without you knowin it and Townsville is cut off by the cliffs You ll find it gettin wilder now till we start down the slope on the other side Lucky our hosses are strong cause the mud is deeper than I thought it would be It was not really a road that they were following merely a path and the going was painful Under Petty s instructions they stopped their mounts now and then for a rest and a mile further on they began to feel a rising wind It s the wind that I told you of said Petty It s sucked through six or seven miles of pass an it will blow straight in our faces all the way As we ll be goin up for a long distance you ll find it growin colder too But you ve got to remember that after you pass them cold winds an go down the slope you ll strike another warm little valley the one in which Hubbard is layin so neat an so snug Dick had already noticed the increasing coldness and so had the sergeant Whitley from his long experience on the plains had the keenest kind of an eye for climatic changes He noticed with some apprehension that the higher peaks were clothed in thick cold fog but he said nothing to the brave boy whom he had grown to love like a son But both he and Dick drew their heavy coats closer and were thankful for the buckskin gloves without which their hands would have stiffened on the reins Now they rode in silence with their heads bent well forward because the wind was becoming fiercer and fiercer Over the peaks the fogs were growing thicker and darker and after a while the sharp edge of the wind was wet with rain It stung their faces and they drew their hat brims lower and their coat collars higher to protect themselves from such a cutting blast Told you we might have trouble called Petty cheerfully but if you ride right on through trouble you ll leave trouble behind Nor this ain t nothin either to what we kin expect before we git to the top of the pass Cur us what a pow ful lot human bein s kin stand when they make up their minds to it Are the horses well shod asked Whitley Best shod in the world cause I done it myself That s my trade blacksmith an I m a good one if I do say it I heard before we started that you had been a soldier in the west I s pose that you had to look mighty close to your hosses then A man couldn t afford to be ridin a hoss made lame by bad shoein when ten thousand yellin Sioux or Blackfeet was after him No you couldn t replied the sergeant Out there you had to watch every detail That s one of the things that fightin Indians taught You had to be watchin all the time an I reckon the trainin will be of value in this war Are we mighty near to the top of the pass mister Petty Got two or three miles yet The slope is steeper on the other side We rise a lot more before we hit the top The wind grew stronger with every rod they ascended and the horses began to pant with their severe exertions At Petty s suggestion the three riders dismounted and walked for a while leading their horses The rain turned to a fine hail and stung their faces Had it not been for his two good comrades Dick would have found his situation inexpressibly lonely and dreary The heavy fog now enveloped all the peaks and ridges and filled every valley and chasm He could see only fifteen or twenty yards ahead along the muddy path and the fine hail which gave every promise of becoming a storm of sleet stung continually The wind confined in the narrow gorge also uttered a hideous shrieking and moaning Tests your nerve shouted Petty to Dick There are hard things besides battles to stand an this is goin to be one of the hard ones but if you go through it all right you kin go through any number of the same kind all right too Likely the sleet will be so thick that it will make a sheet of slippery ice for us comin back Now hosses that ain t got calks on thar shoes are pretty shore to slip an fall breakin a leg or two an mebbe breakin the necks of thar riders Dick looked at him with some amazement Despite his announcement of dire disaster the man s eyes twinkled merrily and the round red outline of his bushy head in the scarlet comforter made a cheerful blaze It s jest as I told you said Petty meeting the boy s look Without calks on thar shoes our hosses are pretty shore to slip on the ice and break theirselves up or fall down a cliff an break themselves up more Then why in thunder Blaze exclaimed Whitley did we start without calks on the shoes of our horses Red Blaze broke into a deep mellow laugh starting from the bottom of his diaphragm swelling as it passed through his chest swelling again as it passed through throat and mouth and bursting upon the open air in a mighty diapason that rose cheerfully above the shrieking and moaning of the wind We didn t start without em he replied The twelve feet of these three hosses have on em the finest calked shoes in all these mountains I put em on myself beginnin the job this mornin before you was awake your colonel on the advice of the people of Townsville who know me as one of its leadin an trusted citizens havin selected me as the guide of this trip I was jest tellin you what would happen to you if I didn t justify the confidence of the people of Townsville I allow Red Blaze said the sergeant with confidence that you ain t no fool an that you re lookin out for our best interests Lead on Red Blaze s mellow and pleased laugh rose once more above the whistling of the wind You kin ride ag in now boys he said The hosses are pretty well rested They resumed the saddle gladly and now mounted toward the crest of the pass The sleet turned to snow which was a relief to their faces and Dick with the constant beating of wind and snow began to feel a certain physical exhilaration He realized the truth of Red Blaze s assertion that if you stiffen your back and push your way through troubles you leave troubles behind They rode now in silence for quite a while and then Red Blaze suddenly announced We re at the top boys CHAPTER IV THE FIGHT IN THE PASS The three halted their horses and stood for a minute or two on the very crest of the pass The fierce wind out of the northwest blew directly in their faces and both riders and horses alike were covered with snow But Dick felt a wonderful thrill as he gazed upon the vast white wilderness East and west north and south he saw the driving snow and the lofty peaks and ridges showing through it white themselves The towns below and the cabins that snuggled in the coves were completely hidden They could see no sign of human life on slope or in valley Looks as wild as the Rockies said the sergeant tersely But you won t find any Injuns here to ambush you said Red Blaze though I don t make any guarantee against bushwhackers and guerillas who ll change sides as often as two or three times a day if it will suit their convenience They could hide in the woods along the road an pick us off as easy as I d shoot a squirrel out of a tree They d like to have our arms an our big coats I tell you what friends a mighty civil war like ours gives a tremenjeous opportunity to bad men They re all comin to the top Every rascal in the mountains an in the lowlands too I guess is out lookin for plunder an wuss You re right Red Blaze said the sergeant with emphasis an it won t be stopped until the generals on both sides begin to hang an shoot the plunderers an murderers But they can t ketch em all said Red Blaze A Yankee general with a hundred thousand men will be out lookin for what Not for a gang of robbers not by a jugful He ll be lookin for a rebel general with another hundred thousand men an the rebel general with a hundred thousand men will be lookin for that Yankee general with his hundred thousand So there you are an while they re lookin for each other an then fightin each other to a standstill the robbers will be plunderin an murderin But don t you worry about bein ambushed I was jest tellin you what might happen but wouldn t happen We kin go down hill fast now and we ll soon be in Hubbard which is the other side of all that fallin snow The road down the mountain was also better than the one by which they had ascended and as the horses with their calked shoes were swift of foot they made rapid progress As they descended the wind lowered fast and there was much less snow Red Blaze said it was probably not snowing in the valley at all See that shinin in the sun he said That s the tin coverin on the steeple of the new church in Hubbard The sun strikes squar ly on it an now I know I m right bout it not snowin down thar Wait til we turn roun this big rock Yes thar s Hubbard layin out in the valley without a drop of snow on her It looks good don t it friends with the smoke comin out of the chimneys That little red house over thar is the railroad an telegraph station an we ll go straight for it cause we ain t got no time to waste They emerged into the valley and rode rapidly for the station Farmers on the outskirts and villagers looked wonderingly at them but they did not pause to answer questions They galloped their tired mounts straight for the little red building which was the station Dick sprang first from his horse and leaving it to stand at the door ran inside A telegraph instrument was clicking mournfully in the corner A hot stove was in another corner and sitting near it was a lad of about Dick s age clad in mountain jeans and lounging in an old cane bottomed chair But Dick s quick glance saw that the boy was bright of face and keen of eye He promptly drew out his papers and said I m an aide from the Northern regiment of Colonel Newcomb at Townsville Here are duplicate dispatches one set for the President of the United States and the other for the Secretary of War They tell of a successful fight that we had last night with Southern troops presumably the cavalrymen of Turner Ashby I wish you to send them at once He s speakin the exact truth Jim said Red Blaze who had come in behind Dick an I ve brought him an the sergeant here over the mountains to tell about it The boy sprang to his instrument But he stopped a moment to ask one question Did you really beat em off he asked as he looked up with shining eye We certainly did replied Dick I ll send it faster than I ever sent anything before said the boy To think of me Jim Johnson sending a dispatch to Abraham Lincoln telling of a victory I reckon you re right Jim it s your chance said Red Blaze Jim bent over the instrument which now began to click steadily and fast You re to wait for answers said Dick The boy nodded but his shining eyes remained bent over the instrument Dick went to the door brushed off the snow came back and sat down by the stove Sergeant Whitley who had tied the horses to hitching posts came in pulled up an empty box and sat down by him Red Blaze slipped away unnoticed But he came back very soon and men and women came with him bringing food and smoking coffee There was enough for twenty Red Blaze had spread among the villagers every one of whom he knew the news that the Union arms had won a victory Nor had it suffered anything in the telling Colonel Newcomb s regiment by the most desperate feats of gallantry had beaten off at least ten thousand Southerners and the boy and the man in uniform who were resting by the fire in the station had been the greatest two heroes of a battle waged for a whole night Curious eyes gazed at Dick and the sergeant as they sat there by the stove Dick himself warm relaxed and the needs of his body satisfied felt like going to sleep But he watched the boy operator who presently finished his two dispatches and then lifted his head for the first time They ve gone straight into Washington he said We ought to get an answer soon We ll wait here for it said Dick The three messengers were now thoroughly warmed at the stove they had eaten heartily of the best the village could furnish and a great feeling of comfort pervaded them While they were waiting for the reply that they hoped would come from Washington Dick Mason and Sergeant Whitley went outside No snow was falling in the valley but off on the mountain crest they still saw the white veil blown by the wind Red Blaze joined them and was everywhere their guide and herald He ascribed to them such deeds of skill and valor that they were compelled to call him the best romancer they had met in a long time I suppose that if mister Warner were here said the sergeant he would reduce these statements to mathematics ten per cent fact an ninety per cent fancy Just about that said Dick Red Blaze came to them presently bristling with news A farmer from a hollow further to the west he said has just come in an he says that a band of guerillas is ridin through the hills Bout twenty of them he said led by a big dark fellow his face covered with black beard They ve been liftin hosses an takin other things but they re strangers in these parts Tom Sykes who was held up by them an robbed of his hoss says that the rest of em called their leader Skelly Tom seemed to think that mebbe they came from somewhere in the Kentucky mountains They called themselves a scoutin party of the Southern army Dick started violently Why I know this man Skelly he said He lives in the mountains to the eastward of my home in Kentucky He organized a band at the beginning of the war but over there he said he was fightin for the North He ll be fightin for his own hand said the sergeant sternly But he can t play double all the time That sort of thing will bring a man to the end of a rope with clear air under his feet I m glad you ve told me this said Red Blaze Skelly might have come ridin in here claimin that he an his men was Northern troops an then when we wasn t suspectin might have held up the whole town I ll warn em Thar ain t a house here that hasn t got two or three rifles an shotguns in it an with the farmers from the valley joinin in Hubbard could wipe out the whole gang Tell them to be on guard all the time Red Blaze said Whitley with strong emphasis In war you ve got to watch watch watch Always know what the other fellow is doin if you can Let s go back to the station said Dick Maybe we ll have an answer soon They found the young operator hanging over his instrument his eyes still shining He had been in that position ever since they left him and Dick knew that his eagerness to get an answer from Washington kept him there mind and body waiting for the tick of the key Dick the sergeant and Red Blaze sat down by the stove again and rested there quietly for a quarter of an hour Red Blaze was thinking that it would be another cold ride back over the pass The sergeant although he was not sleepy closed his eyes and saw again the vast rolling plains the herds of buffalo spreading to the horizon and the bands of Sioux and Cheyennes galloping down their great war bonnets making splashes of color against the thin blue sky Dick was thinking of Pendleton the peaceful little town in Kentucky that was his home and of his cousin Harry Kenton He did not know now where Harry was and he did not even know whether he was dead or alive Dick sighed a little and just at that moment the telegraph key began to click The answer is coming exclaimed the young operator excitedly and then he bent closer over the key to take it The three chairs straightened up and they too bent toward the key The boy wrote rapidly but the clicking did not go on long When it ceased he straightened up with his finished message in his hand His face was flushed and his eyes still shining He folded the paper and handed it to Dick It s for you mister Mason he said Dick unfolded it and read aloud Colonel John D Newcomb Congratulations on your success and fine management of your troops Victory worth much to us Read dispatch to regiment and continue westward to original destination A LINCOLN Dick s face glowed and the sergeant s teeth came together with a little click of satisfaction When I saw that it was to be read to the regiment I thought it no harm to read it to the rest of you said Dick as he refolded the precious dispatch and put it in his safest pocket Now sergeant I think we ought to be off at full speed Not a minute to waste said Sergeant Whitley Their horses had been fed and were rested well The three bade farewell to the young operator then to almost all of Hubbard and proceeded in a trot for the pass They did not speak until they were on the first slope and then the sergeant looking up at the heights asked Shall we have snow again on our return Red Blaze I hope not It s important for us to get back to Townsville without any waste of time I hate to bring bad news replied Red Blaze but we ll shore have more snow See them clouds sailin up an always sailin up from the southwest an see that white mist roun the highest peaks That s snow an it ll hit the pass just as it did when we was comin over But we ve got this in favor of ourselves an our hosses now The wind is on our backs They rode hard now Dick had received the precious message from the President and it would be a proud moment for him when he put it in the hands of the colonel He did not wish that moment to be delayed Several times he patted the pocket in which the paper lay As they ascended the wind increased in strength but being on their backs now it seemed to help them along They were soon high up on the slopes and then they naturally turned for a parting look at Hubbard in its valley a twin to that of Townsville It looked from afar neat and given up to peace but Dick knew that it had been stirred deeply by the visit of his comrades and himself It seems he said that the war would pass by these little mountain nests But it don t said Red Blaze War I guess is like a mad an kickin mule hoofs lashin out everywhar an you can t tell what they re goin to hit Boys we re makin good time That wind on our backs fairly lifts us up the mountain side Petty had all the easy familiarity of the backwoods He treated the boy and man who rode with him as comrades of at least a year s standing and they felt in return that he was one of them a man to be trusted They retained all the buoyancy which the receipt of the dispatch had given them and Dick his heart beating high scarcely felt the wind and cold In another quarter of an hour we ll be at the top said Petty Then he added after a moment s pause If I m not mistook we ll have company See that path leadin out of the west an runnin along the slope It comes into the main road two or three hundred yards further on an I think I can see the top of a horseman s head ridin in it What do you say sergeant I say that you are right Red Blaze I plainly see the head of a big man wearing a fur cap an there are others behind him ridin in single file What s your opinion mister Mason The same as yours and Red Blaze s I too can see the big man with the fur cap on his head and at least a dozen following behind Do you think it likely Red Blaze that they ll reach the main road before we pass the mouth of the path A sudden thought had leaped up in Dick s mind and it set his pulses to beating hard He remembered some earlier words of Red Blaze s We ll go by before they reach the main road replied Red Blaze unless they make their hosses travel a lot faster than they re travelin now Then suppose we whip up a little said Dick Both Red Blaze and the sergeant gave him searching glances Do you mean began Whitley Yes I mean it I know it The man in front wearing the fur cap is Bill Skelly He and his men made an attack upon the home of my uncle Colonel Kenton who is a Southern leader in Kentucky He and his band were Northerners there but they will be Southerners here if it suits their purpose An it will shorely suit their purpose to be Southerners now said Red Blaze We three are ridin mighty good hoss flesh Me an the sergeant have good rifles an pistols you have good pistols an we all have good big overcoats This is a lonely mountain side with war flyin all about us Easy s the place an easy s the deed That is if we d let em which we ain t goin to do Not by a long shot said Sergeant Whitley resting his rifle across the pommel of his saddle They ve got to follow straight behind The ground is too rough for them to ride around an flank us Dick said nothing but his gauntleted hand moved down to the butt of one of his pistols His heart throbbed but he preserved the appearance of coolness He was fast becoming inured to danger Owing to the slope they could not increase the speed of their horses greatly but they were beyond the mouth of the path before they were seen by Skelly and his band Then the big mountaineer uttered a great shout and began to wave his hand at them The road curves here a little among the rocks said the sergeant who unconsciously took command Suppose we stop sheltered by the curve and ask them what they want The very thing to do said Dick Sass em sergeant Sass em said Red Blaze They drew their horses back partially in the shadow of the rocky curve but the sergeant was a little further forward than the others Dick saw Skelly and a score of men emerge into the road and come rapidly toward them They were a wild looking crew mounted on tough mountain ponies all of them carrying loot and all armed heavily The sergeant threw up his rifle and with a steady hand aimed straight at Skelly s heart Halt he cried sharply and tell me who you are The whole crew seemed to reel back except Skelly who though stopping his horse remained in the center of the road What do you mean he cried We re peaceful travelers What business is it of yours who we are Judgin by your looks you re not peaceful travelers at all Besides these ain t peaceful times an we take the right to demand who you are If you come on another foot I shoot The sergeant s tones were sharp with resolve Your name he continued Ramsdell David Ramsdell replied the leader of the band That s a lie said Sergeant Whitley Your name is Bill Skelly an you re a mountaineer from Eastern Kentucky claimin to belong first to one side and then to the other as suits you Who says so exclaimed Skelly defiantly The sergeant beckoned Dick who rode forward a little I do said the boy in a loud clear voice My name is Dick Mason and I live at Pendleton in Kentucky I saw you more than once before the war and I know that you tried to burn down the house of Colonel Kenton there and kill him and his friends I m on the other side but I m not for such things as that Skelly distinctly saw Dick sitting on his horse in the pass and he knew him well Rage tore at his heart Although on the other side this boy too was a lowlander and in a way a member of that vile Kenton brood He hated him too because he belonged to those who had more of prosperity and education than himself But Skelly was a man of resource and not a coward You re right he cried I m Bill Skelly an we want your horses an arms We need em in our business Now just hop down an deliver We re twenty to three You come forward at your own risk cried the sergeant and Skelly despite the numbers at his back wavered He saw that the man who held the rifle aimed at his heart had nerves of steel and he did not dare advance knowing that he would be shot at once from the saddle A victory won by Skelly s men with Skelly dead was no victory at all to Skelly The guerilla reined back his horse and his men retreated with him But the three knew well that it was no withdrawal The mountaineers rode among some scrub that grew between the road and the cliff and Whitley exclaimed to his two comrades Come boys we must ride for it It s our business to get back with the dispatches to Colonel Newcomb as soon as possible an not let ourselves be delayed by this gang That is certainly true said Dick Lead on mister Petty and we ll cross the mountain as fast as we can Red Blaze started at once in a gallop and Dick and the sergeant followed swiftly after But Sergeant Whitley held his cocked rifle in hand and he cast many backward glances A great shout came from Skelly and his band when they saw the three take to flight and the sergeant s face grew grimmer as the sound reached his ears Keep right in the middle of the road boys he said We can t afford to have our horses slip I ll hang back just a little and send in a bullet if they come too near This rifle of mine carries pretty far farther I expect than any of theirs I m somethin on the shoot myself said Red Blaze I love peace but it hurts my feelin s if anybody shoots at me Them fellers are likely to do it an me havin a rifle in my hands I won t be able to stop the temptation to fire back As he spoke the raiders fired There was a crackling of rifles little curls of blue smoke rose in the pass and bullets struck on the frozen earth while two made the snow fly from bushes by the side of the road The sergeant raised his own rifle longer of barrel than the average army weapon and pulled the trigger He had aimed at Skelly but the leader swerved and a man behind him rolled off his horse The others although slowing their speed a little in order to be out of the range of that deadly rifle continued to come The pursuit at first seemed futile to Dick because they would soon descend into Townsville s valley and the raiders could not follow them into the midst of an entire regiment But presently he saw their plan The pass now widened out with a few hundred yards of level space on either side of the road thickly covered with forest The branches of the trees were bare but the undergrowth was so dense that horsemen could be hidden in it Bands of the raiders darted into the woods both to right and left and he knew that advancing on a straight line one or the other of the parties expected to catch the fugitives who must follow the curves of the road The advantage of the pursuit was soon shown as a shot from the right whistled by them Red Blaze quick as lightning fired at the flash of the rifle I don t know whether I hit him or not he said judicially but the chances are pow ful good that I did Still it looks as if they meant to hang on an likely we kin soon expect shots from the other side too Then if they know the country as well as they pear to do they ll have us clamped in a vise As he spoke his eyes twinkled cheerfully out of his flaming countenance You certainly seem to take it easy said Dick I take it easy cause the jaws of that vise ain t goin to clamp down Bein somewhat interested in a run for your life you haven t noticed how dark it s gettin up here on the heights an how hard it s snowin It s comin down a lot thicker than it was when we crossed the first time It was true Dick noticed now that the snow was pouring down and that all the peaks and ridges were lost in the white whirlwind I told you that I had been a traveler said Red Blaze I ve been as far as fifty miles from Townsville and I know all the country in every direction twenty miles from it inch by inch Inside five minutes the snowstorm will be on us full blast an we won t be able to see more n twenty yards away An that crowd that s follerin won t be able to see either An me knowin the ground inch by inch I ll take you straight back to your regiment while they ll get lost in the storm There was room now in the road for the three to ride abreast and they kept close together They heard once a shout behind them and saw the flash of a firearm in the white hurricane but no bullet struck them and they kept steadily on their course Red Blaze directing with the sure instinct that comes of long use and habit Heavier and heavier grew the snow There was but little wind now and it came straight down It seemed to Dick that the whole earth was blotted out by the white fall He and the sergeant resigned themselves completely to the guidance of Red Blaze who never veered an inch from the right path If I didn t know the way my hoss would he said I d just give him his head an he d take us straight to his warm stable in Townsville an the two bundles of oats that I mean to give him I reckon it was pretty smart of me wasn t it to order a snowstorm an have it come just when it was needed Again the cheerful eyes twinkled in the flaming face You re certainly a winner said Dick and you win for us all The snow was now so deep in the pass that they could not proceed at great speed but they did the best they could and as Red Blaze said their best although it might be somewhat slow was certainly better than that of Skelly and his men Dick believed in fact that the raiders had been compelled to abandon the pursuit When they reached a lower level where the snow was far less dense they stopped and listened The sergeant s ears had been trained to uncommon keenness by his life on the plains and he could hear nothing but the sigh of the falling snow Nor could Petty who had fine ears himself They descended still further and made another stop It was snowing here also but it was merely an ordinary fall and they could get a long view back up the pass They saw nothing there but earth and trees covered with snow Looking in the other direction they saw the sunshine gleaming for a moment on a roof in Townsville We re all safe now said Red Blaze an we ll be with the soldiers in another half hour But just you two remember that mebbe the next time I couldn t call up a snowstorm to cover us an save our lives Once is enough said Dick and mister Petty Sergeant Whitley and I want to thank you Mittened hands met buckskinned ones in the strong grasp of friendship and now as they rode on the whole village emerged into sight There was the long train standing on the track the smoke rising in spires from the neat houses and then the figures of human beings The fall of snow was light in the valley and as soon as they reached the levels the three proceeded at a gallop Dick saw Colonel Newcomb standing by the train and springing from his horse he handed him the dispatch The colonel opened it and as he read Dick saw the glow appear upon his face Fire up he said to Canby the engineer who stood near We start at once The troops who were ready and waiting were hurried into the coaches and the engine whistled for departure CHAPTER V THE SINGER OF THE HILLS As the engine whistled for the last time Dick sprang upon a car step one hand holding to the rail while with the other he returned the powerful grip of Red Blaze who with his own unconfined hand grasped the bridles of the three horses which had served them so well Petty had received a reward thrust upon him by Colonel Newcomb but Dick knew that the mountaineer s chief recompense was the success achieved in the perilous task chosen for him Good bye mister Mason said Red Blaze I m proud to have knowed you an the sergeant an to have been your comrade in a work for the Union Without you we should have failed It jest happened that I knowed the way It seems to me that there s a heap a tremenjeous heap in knowin the way It gives you an awful advantage Now you an your regiment are goin down thar in them Kentucky mountains They re mighty wild winter s here an the marchin will be about as bad as it could be Them s mostly Pennsylvania men with you an they don t know a thing bout that thar region Like as not you ll be walkin right straight into an ambush an that ll be the end of you an them Pennsylvanians You re a cheerful prophet Red Blaze I meant if you didn t take care of yourselves an keep a good lookout which I know of course that you re goin to do I was jest statin the other side of the proposition tellin what would happen to keerless people but Colonel Newcomb an Major Hertford ain t keerless people Good bye mister Mason Mebbe I ll see you ag in before this war is over Good bye Red Blaze I truly hope so The train was moving now and with a last powerful grasp of a friendly hand Dick went into the coach It was the first in the train Colonel Newcomb and Major Hertford sat near the head of it and Warner was just sitting down not far behind them Dick took the other half of the seat with the young Vermonter who said speaking in a whimsical tone You fill me with envy Dick Why wasn t it my luck to go with you Sergeant Whitley and the man they call Red Blaze on that errand and help bring back with you the message of President Lincoln But I heard what our red friend said to you at the car step There s a powerful lot in knowing the way knowing where you re going and what s along every inch of the road My arithmetic tells me that it is often fifty per cent of marching and fighting I think you are right said Dick A little later he was sound asleep in his seat and at the command of Colonel Newcomb he was not disturbed His had been a task taxing to the utmost both body and mind and despite his youth and strength it would take nature some time to replace what had been worn away He slept on while the boys in the train talked and laughed Stern discipline was not yet enforced in either army nor did Colonel Newcomb consider it necessary here These lads so lately from the schools and farms had won a victory and they had received the thanks of the President They had a right to talk about it among themselves and a little vocal enthusiasm now might build up courage and spirit for a greater crisis later The colonel moreover gave glances of approval and sympathy to his gallant young aide who in the seat next to the window with his head against the wall slept so soundly All the afternoon Dick slept on his breathing regular and steady The train rattled and rumbled through the high mountains and on the upper levels the snow was falling fast Darkness came and supper was served to the troops but at the colonel s command Dick was not awakened Nature had not yet finished her task of repairing There was worn tissue still to be replaced and the nerves had not yet recovered their full steadiness So Dick slept on while the night deepened and the snow continued to drive against the window panes Nor did he awake until morning when the train stopped at a tiny station in the hills There was no snow here but the sun just rising threw no heat and icicles were hanging from every cliff Dispatches were waiting for Colonel Newcomb and after breakfast he announced to his staff I have orders from Washington to divide my regiment The Southern forces are operating at three points in Kentucky They are gathering at Columbus on the Mississippi at Bowling Green in the south and here in the mountains there is a strong division under an officer named Zollicoffer Scattered forces of our men the principal one led by a Virginian named Thomas are endeavoring to deal with Zollicoffer The Secretary of War regrets the division of the regiment but he thinks it necessary as all our detached forces must be strengthened I go on with the main body of the regiment to join Grant near the mouth of the Ohio You Major Hertford will take three companies and march south in search of Thomas but be careful that you are not snapped up by the rebels on the way And if you can get volunteers and join Thomas with your force increased threefold so much the better I shall try my best sir said Major Hertford and thank you for this honor Dick and Warner stood by without a word but Dick cast an appealing look at Colonel Newcomb Yes I know said the Colonel who caught the glance This is your state and you wish to go with Major Hertford You are to do so So is your friend Lieutenant Warner and Major Hertford I also lend to you Sergeant Whitley who is a man of much experience and who has already proved himself to be of great value The three saluted and were grateful They longed for action which they believed would come more quickly with Major Hertford s column A little later when military form permitted it the two boys thanked Colonel Newcomb in words Maybe you won t thank me a few days from now said the colonel a little grimly but I am hopeful that our plans here in Eastern Kentucky will prove successful and that before long you will be able to join the great forces in the western part of the state You are both good boys and now good bye The preparations for the mountain column as Dick and Warner soon called it had been completed They were on foot but they were well armed well clothed and they had supplies loaded in several wagons purchased hastily in the village A dozen of the strong mountaineers volunteered to be drivers and guides and the major was glad to have them Later several horses were secured for the officers but meanwhile the train was ready to depart Colonel Newcomb waved them farewell the faithful and valiant Canby opened the throttle and the train steamed away The men in the little column although eager for their new task watched its departure with a certain sadness at parting with their comrades The train became smaller and smaller then it was only a spiral of smoke and that too soon died on the clear western horizon And now to find Thomas said Major Hertford who retained Dick and Warner on his staff practically its only members in fact It looks odd to hunt through the mountains for a general and his army but we ve got it to do and we ll do it The horses for the officers were obtained at the suggestion of Sergeant Whitley and the little column turned southward through the wintry forest Dick and Warner were riding strong mountain ponies but at times and in order to show that they considered themselves no better than the others they dismounted and walked over the frozen ground The greatest tasks were with the wagons containing the ammunition and supplies The mountain roads were little more than trails sometimes half blocked with ice or snow and then again deep in mud The winter was severe Storms of rain hail sleet and snow poured upon them but fortunately they were marching through continuous forests and the skilled mountaineers under any circumstances knew how to build fires by the side of which they could dry themselves and sleep warmly at night They also heard much gossip as they advanced to meet General Thomas who had been sent from Louisville to command the Northern troops in the Kentucky mountains Thomas was a Virginian a member of the old regular army a valiant able and cautious man who chose to abide by the Union Many other Virginians some destined to be as famous as he and a few more so wondered why he had not gone with his seceding state and criticised him much but Thomas chary of speech hung to his belief and proved it by action Dick learned too that the Southern force operating against Thomas while actively led by Zollicoffer was under the nominal command of one of his own Kentucky Crittendens Here he saw again how terribly his beloved state was divided like other border states General Crittenden s father was a member of the Federal Congress at Washington and one of his brothers was a general also but on the other side But he was to see such cases over and over again and he was to see them to a still greater and a wholesale degree when the First Maryland regiment of the North and the First Maryland regiment of the South recruited from the same district should meet face to face upon the terrible field of Antietam But Antietam was far in the future and Dick s mind turned from the cases of brother against brother to the problems of the icy wilderness through which they were moving in a more or less uncertain manner Sometimes they were sent on false trails but their loyal mountaineers brought them back again They also found volunteers and Major Hertford s little force swelled from three hundred to six hundred In the main the mountaineers were sympathetic partly through devotion to the Union and partly through jealousy of the more prosperous lowlanders One day Major Hertford sent Dick Warner and Sergeant Whitley ahead to scout He had recognized the ability of the two lads and also their great friendship for Sergeant Whitley It seemed fitting to him that the three should be nearly always together and he watched them with confidence as they rode ahead on the icy mountain trail and then disappeared from sight Dick and his friends had learned at mountain cabins which they had passed that the country opened out further on into a fine little valley and when they reached the crest of a hill somewhat higher than the others they verified the truth of the statement Before them lay the coziest nook they had yet seen in the mountains and in the center of it rose a warm curl of smoke from the chimney of a house much superior to that of the average mountaineer The meadows and corn lands on either side of a noble creek were enclosed in good fences Everything was trim and neat The three rode down the slope toward the house but halfway to the bottom they reined in their ponies and listened Some one was singing On the thin wintry air a deep mellow voice rose and they distinctly heard the words Soft o er the fountain ling ring falls the southern moon Far o er the mountain breaks the day too soon In thy dark eyes splendor where the warm light loves to dwell Weary looks yet tender speak their fond farewell Nita Juanita Ask thy soul if we should part Nita Juanita Lean thou on my heart It was a wonderful voice that they heard deep full and mellow all the more wonderful because they heard it there in those lone mountains The ridges took up the echo and gave it back in tones softened but exquisitely haunting The three paused and looked at one another They could not see the singer He was hidden from them by the dips and swells of the valley but they felt that here was no common man No common mind or at least no common heart could infuse such feeling into music As they listened the remainder of the pathetic old air rose and swelled through the ridges When in thy dreaming moons like these shall shine again And daylight beaming prove thy dreams are vain Wilt thou not relenting for thy absent lover sigh In thy heart consenting to a prayer gone by Nita Juanita Let me linger by thy side Nita Juanita Be thou my own fair bride I m curious to see that singer said Warner I heard grand opera once in Boston just before I started to the war but I never heard anything that sounds finer than this Maybe time and place help to the extent of fifty per cent but at any rate the effect is just the same Come on said Dick and we ll soon find our singer whoever he is The three rode at a rapid pace until they reached the valley There they drew rein as they saw near them a tall man apparently about forty years of age mending a fence helped by a boy of heavy build and powerful arms The man glanced up saw the blue uniforms worn by the three horsemen and went peacefully on with his fence mending He also continued to sing throwing his soul into the song and both work and song proceeded as if no one was near He lifted the rails into place with mighty arms but never ceased to sing The boy who helped him seemed almost his equal in strength but he neither sang nor spoke Yet he smiled most of the time showing rows of exceedingly strong white teeth They seem to me to be of rather superior type said Dick Maybe we can get useful information from them I judge that the singer will talk about almost everything except what we want to know said the shrewd and experienced sergeant but we can certainly do no harm by speaking to him Of course they have seen us No doubt they saw us before we saw them The three rode forward saluted politely and the fence menders stopping their work saluted in the same polite fashion Then they stood expectant We belong to a detachment which is marching southward to join the Union army under General Thomas said Dick Perhaps you could tell us the best road I might an ag in I mightn t stranger If you don t talk much you never have much to take back If I knew where that army is it would be easy for me to tell you but if I didn t know I couldn t Now the question is do I know or don t I know Do you think you can decide it for me stranger It was impossible for Dick or the sergeant to take offense The man s gaze was perfectly frank and open and his eyes twinkled as he spoke The boy with him smiled widely showing both rows of his powerful white teeth We can t decide it until we know you better said Dick in a light tone I m willin to tell you who I am My name is Sam Jarvis an this lunkhead here is my nephew Ike Simmons the son of my sister who keeps my house Now I want to tell you young stranger that since this war began and the Yankees and the Johnnies have taken a notion to shoot up one another people who would never have thought of doin it before have come wanderin into these mountains But you can get a hint about em sometimes Young man do you want me to tell you your name Tell me my name responded Dick in astonishment Of course you can t do it You never saw or heard of me before Mebbe no replied Jarvis with calm confidence but all the same your name is Dick Mason and you come from a town in Kentucky called Pendleton You ve been serving with the Yanks in the East an you ve a cousin named Harry Kenton who s been servin there also but with the Johnnies Now am I a good guesser or am I just a plum ignorant fool Dick stared at him in deepening amazement You do more than guess he replied You know Everything that you said is true Tell me this said Jarvis Was that cousin of yours Harry Kenton killed in the big battle at Bull Run I ve been tremenjeously anxious about him ever since I heard of that terrible fight He was not I have not seen him since but I have definite news now that he passed safely through the battle Sam Jarvis and his nephew Ike breathed deep sighs of relief I m mighty glad to hear it said Jarvis I shorely liked that boy Harry an I think I ll like you about as well It don t matter to me that you re on different sides bein as I ain t on any side at all myself nor is this lunkhead Ike my nephew How on earth did you know me Light an come into the house an I ll tell you You an your pardners look cold an hungry There ain t danger of anybody taking your hosses cause you can hitch em right at the front door Besides I ve got an old grandmother in the house who d like mighty well to see you mister Mason Dick concluded that it was useless to ask any more questions just yet and he Warner and the sergeant dismounting and leading their horses walked toward the house with Jarvis and Ike Jarvis who seemed singularly cheerful lifted up his voice and sang Thou wilt come no more gentle Annie Like a flower thy spirit did depart Thou art gone alas like the many That have bloomed in the summer of my heart Shall we never more behold thee Never hear thy winning voice again When the spring time comes gentle Annie When the wild flowers are scattered o er the plain It seemed to Dick that the man sang spontaneously and the deep mellow voice always came back in faint and dying echoes that moved him in a singular manner All at once the war with its passions and carnage floated away Here was a little valley fenced in from the battle world in which he had been living He breathed deeply and as the eyes of Jarvis caught his a sympathetic glance passed between them Yes said Jarvis as if he understood completely the war goes around us There is nothing to fight about here But come into the house This is my sister the mother of that lunkhead Ike and here is my grandmother He paused before the bent figure of an old old woman sitting in a rocking chair beside the chimney beside which a fire glowed and blazed Her chin rested on one hand and she was staring into the coals Grandmother said Jarvis very gently the great grandson of the great Henry Ware that you used to know was here last spring and now the great grandson of his friend Paul Cotter has come too The withered form straightened and she stood up Fire came into the old old eyes that regarded Dick so intently Aye she said you speak the truth grandson It is Paul Cotter s own face A gentle man he was but brave and the greatest scholar I should have known that when Henry Ware s great grandson came Paul Cotter s too would come soon I am proud for this house to have sheltered you both She put both her hands on his shoulders and stood up very straight her face close to his She was a tall woman above the average height of man and her eyes were on a level with Dick s It is true she said it is he over again The eyes are his and the mouth and the nose are the same This house is yours while you choose to remain and my grandchildren and my great grandson will do for you whatever you wish Dick noticed that her grammar and intonation were perfect Many of the Virginians and Marylanders who emigrated to Kentucky in that far off border time were people of cultivation and refinement After these words of welcome she turned from him sat down in her chair and gazed steadily into the coals Everything about her seemed to float away Doubtless her thoughts ran on those dim early days when the Indians lurked in the canebrake and only the great borderers stood between the settlers and sure death Dick began to gather from the old woman s words a dim idea of what had occurred Harry Kenton must have passed there and as they went into the next room where food and coffee were placed before them Jarvis explained Your cousin Harry Kenton came through here last spring on his way to Virginia he said He came with me an this lunkhead Ike all the way from Frankfort and mostly up the Kentucky River Grandmother was dreaming and she took him at first for Henry Ware his very self She saluted him and called him the great governor It was a wonderful thing to see and it made me feel just a little bit creepy for a second or two Mebbe you an your cousin Harry Kenton are Henry Ware an Paul Cotter their very selves come back to earth It looks curious that both of you should wander to this little place hid deep in the mountains But it s happened all the same I s pose you ve just been moved round that way by the Supreme Power that s bigger than all of us an that shifts us about to suit plans made long ago But how I m runnin on Fall to friends I can t call you strangers an eat an drink The winter air on the mountains is powerful nippin an your blood needs warmin often The boys and the sergeant obeyed him literally and with energy Jarvis sat by approvingly taking an occasional bite or drink with them Meanwhile they gathered valuable information from him A Northern commander named Garfield had defeated the Southern forces under Humphrey Marshall in a smart little battle at a place called Middle Creek Dick knew this Humphrey Marshall well He lived at Louisville and was a great friend of his uncle Colonel Kenton He had been a brilliant and daring cavalry officer in the Mexican War doing great deeds at Buena Vista but now he was elderly and so enormously stout that he lacked efficiency Jarvis added that after their defeat at Middle Creek the Southerners had gathered their forces on or near the Cumberland River about Mill Spring and that they had ten thousand men Thomas with a strong Northern force coming all the way from the central part of the state was already deep in the mountains preparing to meet him Remember said Jarvis that I ain t takin no sides in this war myself If people come along an ask me to tell what I know I tell it to em be they Yank or Reb Now I wish good luck to you mister Mason an I wish the same to your cousin mister Kenton Dick Warner and the sergeant finished the refreshments and rose for the return journey They thanked Jarvis and when they saw that he would take no pay they did not insist knowing that it would offend him Dick said good bye to the ancient woman and once again she rose put her hands on his shoulders and looked into his eyes Paul Cotter was a good man she said and you who have his blood in your veins are good too I can see it in something that lies back in your eyes She said not another word but sat down in the chair and stared once more into the coals dreaming of the far day when the great borderers saved her and others like her from the savages and thinking little of the mighty war that raged at the base of her hills The boys and the sergeant rode fast on the return trail They knew that Major Hertford would push forward at all speed to join Thomas whom they could now locate without much difficulty Jarvis and Ike had resumed their fence mending but when the trees hid the valley from them a mighty rolling song came to the ears of Dick Warner and the sergeant They bore him away when the day had fled And the storm was rolling high And they laid him down in his lonely bed By the light of an angry sky The lightning flashed and the wild sea lashed The shore with its foaming wave And the thunder passed on the rushing blast As it howled o er the rover s grave That man s no fool said Dick No he ain t said the sergeant with decision nor is that nephew Ike of his that he calls a lunkhead Did you notice mister Mason that the boy never spoke a word while we was there Them that don t say anything never have anything to take back They rode hard now and soon reached Major Hertford with their news On the third day thereafter they entered a strong Union camp commanded by a man named Garfield the young officer who had won the victory at Middle Creek CHAPTER VI MILL SPRING Garfield s camp was on a little group of hills in a very strong position and his men flushed with victory were eager for another encounter with the enemy They had plenty of good tents to fend them from the winter weather which had often been bitter Throughout the camp burned large fires for which they had an almost unbroken wilderness to furnish fuel The whole aspect of the place was pleasing to the men who had marched far and hard Major Hertford and his aides Richard Mason and George Warner were received in Colonel Garfield s tent A slim young man writing dispatches at a rude little pine table rose to receive them He did not seem to Dick to be more than thirty and he had the thin scholarly face of a student His manner was attractive he shook hands warmly with all three of them and said Reinforcements are most welcome indeed My own work here seems to be largely done but you will reach General Thomas in another day and he needs you Take my chair Major Hertford To you two lads I can offer only stumps The tent had been pitched over a spot where three stumps had been smoothed off carefully until they made acceptable seats One end of the tent was entirely open facing a glowing fire of oak logs Dick and Warner sat down on the stumps and spread out their hands to the blaze Beyond the flames they saw the wintry forest and mountains seemingly as wild as they were when the first white man came The usual coffee and food were brought and while they ate and drank Major Hertford answered the numerous and pertinent questions of Colonel Garfield He listened attentively to the account of the fight in the mountains and to all the news that they could tell him of Washington We have been cut off in these mountains he said I know very little of what is going on but what you say only confirms my own opinion The war is rapidly spreading over a much greater area and I believe that its scope will far exceed any of our earlier calculations A grave and rather sad expression occupied for a moment the mobile face He interested Dick greatly He seemed to him scholar and thinker as well as soldier He and Warner long afterward attended the inauguration of this man as President of the United States After a brief rest and good wishes from Garfield Major Hertford and his command soon reached the main camp under Thomas Here they were received by a man very different in appearance and manner from Garfield General George H Thomas who was to receive the famous title The Rock of Chickamauga was then in middle years Heavily built and bearded he was chary of words He merely nodded approval when Major Hertford told of their march I will assign your troops to a brigade he said and I don t think you ll have long to wait We re expecting a battle in a few days with Crittenden and Zollicoffer Not much to say remarked Dick to Warner as they went away That s true said Warner thoughtfully but didn t you get an impression of strength from his very silence I should say that in his make up he is five per cent talk twenty five per cent patience and seventy per cent action total one hundred per cent The region in which they lay was west of the higher mountains which they had now crossed but it was very rough and hilly Not far from them was a little town called Somerset which Dick had visited once and near by too was the deep and swift Cumberland River with much floating ice at its edges When the two lads lay by a campfire that night Sergeant Whitley came to them with the news of the situation which he had picked up in his usual deft and quiet way The Southern army is on the banks of the Cumberland he said It has not been able to get its provisions by land through Cumberland Gap Instead they have been brought by boats on the river As I hear it Crittenden and Zollicoffer are afraid that our general will advance to the river an cut off these supplies So they mean to attack us as soon as they can If I may venture to say so mister Mason I d advise that you and Lieutenant Warner get as good a rest as you can and as soon as you can They ate a hearty supper and being told by Major Hertford that they would not be wanted until the next day they rolled themselves in heavy blankets and pointing their feet toward a good fire slept on the ground The night was very cold because it was now the middle of January but the blankets and fire kept them warm Dick did not fall to sleep for some time because he knew that he was going into battle again in a few days He was on the soil of his native state now He had already seen many Kentuckians in the army of Thomas and he knew that they would be numerous too in that of Crittenden and Zollicoffer To some extent it would be a battle of brother against brother He was glad that Harry Kenton was in the east He did not wish in the height of battle to see his own cousin again on the opposite side But when he did fall asleep his slumber was sound and restful and he was ready and eager the next morning when the sergeant Warner and he were detached for duty in a scouting party The general has asked that you be sent owing to your experience in the mountains said Major Hertford and I have agreed gladly I hope that you re as glad as I am We are sir said the two boys together The sergeant stood quietly by and smiled The detachment numbered a hundred men all young strong and well mounted They were commanded by a young captain John Markham in whom Dick recognized a distant relative In those days nearly all Kentuckians were more or less akin The kinship was sufficient for Markham to keep the two boys on either side of him with Sergeant Whitley just behind Markham lived in Frankfort and he had marched with Thomas from the cantonments at Lebanon to their present camp John said Dick addressing him familiarly and in right of kinship you ve been for months in our own county You ve surely heard something from Pendleton He could not disguise the anxiety in his voice and the young captain regarded him with sympathy I had news from there about a month ago Dick he replied Your mother was well then as I have no doubt she is now The place was not troubled by guerillas who are hanging on the fringe of the armies here in Eastern or in Southern and Western Kentucky The war for the present at least has passed around Pendleton Colonel Kenton was at Bowling Green with Albert Sidney Johnston and his son Harry your cousin is still in the East It was a rapid and condensed statement but it was very satisfying to Dick who now rode on for a long time in silence The road was as bad as a road could be Snow and ice were mixed with the deep mud which pulled hard at the hoofs of their horses The country was rough sterile and inhabited but thinly They rode many miles without meeting a single human being About the third hour they saw a man and a boy on a hillside several hundred yards away but when Captain Markham and a chosen few galloped towards them they disappeared so deftly among the woods that not a trace of them could be found People in this region are certainly bashful said Captain Markham with a vexed laugh We meant them no harm but they wouldn t stay to see us But they don t know that said Dick with the familiarity of kinship even though distant I fancy that the people hereabouts wish both Northerners and Southerners would go away Two miles further on they came to a large double cabin standing back a little distance from the road Smoke was rising from the chimney and Captain Markham felt sure that they could obtain information from its inmates Dick at his direction beat on the door with the butt of a small riding whip There was no response He beat again rapidly and heavily and no answer coming he pushed in the door A fire was burning on the hearth but the house was abandoned Nor had the owners been gone long Besides the fire to prove it clothing was hanging on hooks in the wall and there was food in the cupboard Captain Markham sighed Again they re afraid of us he said I ve no doubt the signal has been passed ahead of us and that we ll not get within speaking distance of a single native Curious too because this region in the main is for the North Perhaps somebody has been robbing and plundering in our name said Dick Skelly and his raiders have been through these parts That s so said Markham thoughtfully I m afraid those guerillas who claim to be our allies are going to do us a great deal of harm Well we ll turn back into the road if you can call this stream of icy mud a road and go on Another mile and they caught the gleam of water among the wintry boughs Dick knew that it was the Cumberland which was now a Southern artery bringing stores and arms for the army of Crittenden and Zollicoffer Even here hundreds of miles from its mouth it was a stream of great depth easily navigable and far down its current they saw faintly the smoke of two steamers They bear supplies for the Southern army said Captain Markham We can cut off the passage of boats on this river and for that reason so General Thomas concludes the Southern army is going to attack us What do you think of his reasoning sergeant Beggin your pardon sir for passin an opinion upon my general replied Sergeant Whitley but I think his reasons are good Here it is the dead of winter with more mud in the roads than I ever saw before anywhere but there s bound to be a battle right away Men will fight sir to keep from losin their grub A man rode forward from the ranks saluted and asked leave to speak He was a native of the next county and knew that region well Two miles east of them and running parallel with the road over which they had come was another and much wider road the one that they called the big road Which means I suppose that it contains more mud than this one said Captain Markham True sir replied the man but if the rebel army is advancing it is likely to be on that road That is certainly sound logic At least we ll go there and see Can you lead us through these woods to it I can take you straight across replied the man whose name was Carpenter But on the way we ll have to ford a creek which is likely to be pretty deep at this time of the year Show the way said Captain Markham briskly They plunged into the deep woods and Carpenter guided them well The creek of which he had told was running bankful of icy water but their horses swam it and they kept straight ahead until Carpenter who was a little in advance held up a warning hand Captain Markham ordered his whole troop to stop and keep as quiet as possible Then he Dick Warner Sergeant Whitley and Carpenter rode slowly forward Before they had gone many yards Dick heard the heavy clank of metal the cracking of whips the swearing of men and the sound of horses feet splashing in the mud He knew by the amount and variety of the noises that a great force was passing They advanced a little further and reined into a clump of bushes which despite their lack of leaves were dense enough to shelter them from observation As the bushes grew on a hillock they had a downward and good look into the road which was fairly packed with men in the gray of the Confederate army some on horseback but mostly afoot their cannon ammunition and supply wagons sinking almost to the hub in the mud As far as Dick could see the gray columns extended There must be six or seven thousand men here he said to Captain Markham Undoubtedly replied Markham this is the main Confederate army advancing to attack ours but the badness of the roads operates against the offense We shall reach General Thomas with the word that they are coming long before they are there They watched the marching army for a half hour longer in order to be sure of everything and then turning they rode as fast as they could toward Thomas elated at their success They swam the creek again but at another point Carpenter told them that the Southern army would cross it on a bridge and Markham lamented that he could not turn and destroy this bridge but such an attempt would have been folly They finally turned into the main road along which the Southern army was coming although they were now miles ahead of it and covered from head to foot with the red mud of the hills they urged on their worn horses toward the camp of Thomas I haven t had much experience in fighting but I should imagine that complete preparation had a great deal to do with success said Captain Markham I d put it at sixty per cent said Warner I should say added Dick that the road makes at least eighty per cent of our difficulty in getting back to Thomas In fact the road was so bad that they were compelled after a while to ride into the woods and let their ponies rest Here they were fired upon by Confederate skirmishers from a hill two or three hundred yards away Their numbers were small however and Captain Markham s force charging them drove them off without loss Then they resumed their weary journey but the rest had not fully restored the horses and they were compelled at times to walk by the side of the road leading their mounts Sergeant Whitley with his age and experience was most useful now in restraining the impatient young men Although of but humble rank he kept them from exhausting either themselves or their horses It will be long after dark before we can reach camp said Captain Markham sighing deeply Confound such roads Why not call them morasses and have done with it No we can t make it much before midnight said Dick but after all that will be early enough If I judge him right even midnight won t catch General Thomas asleep You ve judged him right said Markham I ve been with Pap Thomas some time we call him Pap because he takes such good care of us and I think he is going to be one of the biggest generals in this war Always silent and sometimes slow about making up his mind he strikes like a sledge hammer when he does strike He ll certainly have the opportunity to give blow for blow said Dick as he remembered that marching army behind them How far do you think it is yet to the general s camp Not more than a half dozen miles but it will be dark in a few minutes and at the rate we re going it will take us two full hours more to get there The wintry days were short and the sun slid down the gray cold sky leaving forest and hills in darkness But the little band toiled patiently on while the night deepened and darkened and a chill wind whistled down from the ridges The officers were silent now but they looked eagerly for the first glimpse of the campfires of Thomas At last they saw the little pink dots in the darkness and then they pushed forward with new zeal urging their weary horses into a run When Captain Markham Dick and Warner galloped into camp ahead of the others a thickset strong figure walked forward to meet them They leaped from their horses and saluted Well said General Thomas The enemy is advancing upon us in full force sir replied Captain Markham You scouted thoroughly We saw their whole army upon the road When do you think they could reach us About dawn sir Very good We shall be ready You and your men have done well Now find food and rest You will be awakened in time for the battle Dick walked away with his friends Troopers took their horses and cared for them The boy glanced back at the thickset powerful figure standing by one of the fires and looking gravely into the coals More than ever the man with the strong patient look inspired confidence in him He was sure now that they would win on the morrow Markham and Warner felt the same confidence There s a lot in having a good general said Warner who had also glanced back at the strong figure Do you remember Dick what it was that Napoleon said about generals A general is everything an army nothing or something like that Yes that was it Of course he didn t mean it just exactly as he said it A general can t be one hundred per cent and an army none It was a figure of speech so to say but I imagine that a general is about forty per cent If we had had such leadership at Bull Run we d have won Dick and Warner worn out by their long ride soon slept but there was movement all around them during the late hours of the night Thomas with his cautious measuring mind was rectifying his lines in the wintry darkness He occupied a crossing of the roads and he posted a strong battery of artillery to cover the Southern approach Around him were men from Kentucky the mountains of Tennessee Ohio Indiana and Minnesota The Minnesota troops were sun tanned men who had come more than a thousand miles from an Indian infested border to defend the Union All through the night Thomas worked He directed men with spades to throw up more intrenchments He saw that the guns of the battery were placed exactly right He ordered that food should be ready for all very early in the morning and then when nothing more remained to be done save to wait for the decree of battle he sat before his tent wrapped in a heavy military overcoat silent and watchful Scouts had brought in additional news that the Southern army was still marching steadily along the muddy roads and that Captain Markham s calculation of its arrival about dawn would undoubtedly prove correct Dick awoke while it was yet dark and throwing off the heavy blankets stood up Although the dawn had not come the night was now fairly light and Dick could see a long distance over the camp which stretched to left and right along a great front Near him was the battery with most of the men sleeping beside their guns and not far away was the tent Although he could not see the general he knew instinctively that he was not asleep It was cold and singularly still considering the presence of so many thousands of men He did not hear the sound of human voices and there was no stamp of horses feet They too were weary and resting Then Dick was conscious of a tall thin figure beside him Warner had awakened too Dick he said it can t be more than an hour till dawn Just about that I should say And the scene that is as far as we can see it is most peaceful Dick made no answer but stood a long time listening Then he said My ears are pretty good George and sound will carry very far in this silence just before the dawn I thought I heard a faint sound like the clank of a cannon I think I hear it too said Warner and here is the dawn closer at hand than we thought Look at those cold rays over there behind that hill in the east They are the vanguard of the sun So they are And this is the vanguard of the Southern army He spoke the last words quickly and with excitement In front of them down the road they heard the crackle of a dozen rifle shots The Southern advance undoubtedly had come into contact with the Union sentinels and skirmishers After the first shots there was a moment s breathless silence and then came a scattered and rapid fire as if at least a hundred rifles were at work Dick s pulse began to beat hard and he strained his eyes through the darkness but he could not yet see the enemy He saw instead little jets of fire like red dots appearing on the horizon and then the sound of the rifles came again Warner was with him and both stood by the side of Major Hertford ready to receive and deliver his orders Dick now heard besides the firing in front the confused murmur and moving of the Union army Few of these troops had been in battle before the same could be said of the soldiers on the other side and this attack in the half light troubled them They wished to see the men who were going to shoot at them in order that they might have a fair target in return Fighting in the night was scarcely fair One never knew what to do But Thomas the future Rock of Chickamauga was already showing himself a tower of strength He reassured his nervous troops he borrowed Dick and Warner and sent them along the line with messages from himself that they had nothing to do but stand firm and the victory was theirs Meanwhile the line of red dots in front was lengthening It stretched farther to left and right than Dick could see and was rapidly coming nearer Already the sentinels and skirmishers were waging a sharp conflict and the shouts of the combatants increased in volume Then the cold sun swung clear of the earth and its wintry beams lighted up both forest and open The whole Southern army appeared advancing in masses and Dick who was now with Major Hertford again saw the pale rays falling on rifles and bayonets and the faces of his own countrymen as they marched upon the Union camp There s danger for our army Lots of it said Warner as he watched the steady advance of the Southern brigades Dick remembered Bull Run but his thoughts ran back to the iron general who commanded now Thomas will save us he said The skirmishers on both sides were driven in Their scattered fire ceased but a moment later the whole front of the Southern army burst into flame It seemed to Dick that one vast sheet of light like a sword blade suddenly shot forward and then a storm of lead bearing many messengers of death beat upon the Northern army shattering its front lines and carrying confusion among its young troops But the officers and a few old regulars like Sergeant Whitley steadied them and they returned the fire Major Hertford Dick and Warner were all on foot and their own little band already tried in battle yielded not an inch They formed a core of resistance around which others rallied and Thomas himself was passing along the line giving heart to the lads fresh from the farms But the Southern army fired again and shouting the long fierce rebel yell charged with all its strength Dick saw before him a vast cloud of smoke through which fire flashed and bullets whistled He heard men around him uttering short cries of pain and he saw others fall mostly sinking forward on their faces But those who stood held fast and loaded and fired until the barrels of their rifles burned to the touch Dick felt many tremors at first but soon the passion of battle seized him He carried no rifle but holding his officer s small sword in his hand he ran up and down the line crying to the men to stand firm that they would surely beat back the enemy That film of fire and smoke was yet before his eyes but he saw through it the faces of his countrymen still coming on He heard to his right the thudding of the great guns that Thomas had planted on a low hill but the rifle fire was like the beat of hail a crackling and hissing that never ceased The farm lads their rifles loaded afresh fired anew at the enemy almost in their faces and the Southern line here reeled back against so firm and deadly a front But an alarming report ran down the line that their left was driven back and it was true The valiant Zollicoffer leading his brigade in person had rushed upon this portion of the Northern army which was standing upon another low hill and struck it with great violence It was wavering and would give way soon But Thomas showing the singular calm that always marked him in battle noticed the weak spot The general was then near Major Hertford He quickly wrote a dispatch and beckoned to Dick Here he said jump on the horse that the sergeant is holding for me and bring up our reserve the brigade under General Carter They are to meet the attack there on the hill where our troops are wavering Dick aflame with excitement leaped into the saddle and while the roar of battle was still in his ears reached the brigade of Carter already marching toward the thick of the conflict One entire regiment composed wholly of Kentuckians was detached to help the Indiana troops who were being driven fiercely by Zollicoffer Dick rode at the head of the Kentuckians but a bullet struck his horse in the chest The boy felt the animal shiver beneath him and he leaped clear just in time the horse falling heavily and lying quite still But Dick alighted on his feet and still brandishing his sword and shouting at the top of his voice ran on In an instant they reached the Indiana troops who turned with them and the combined forces hurled themselves upon the enemy The Southerners refusing to yield the ground they had gained received them and there began a confused and terrible combat shoulder to shoulder and hand to hand Elsewhere the battle continued but here it raged the fiercest Both commanders knew that they were to win or lose upon this hill and they poured in fresh troops who swelled the area of conflict and deepened its intensity Dick saw Warner by his side but he did not know how he had come there and just beyond him the thick and powerful figure of Sergeant Whitley showed through the hot haze of smoke The back of Warner s hand had been grazed by a bullet He had not noticed it himself but the slow drip drip of the blood held Dick for a moment with a sort of hideous fascination Then he broke his gaze violently away and turned it upon the enemy who were pouring upon them in all their massed strength Thomas had sent the Kentuckians to the aid of the Indiana men just in time The hill was a vast bank of smoke and fire filled with whistling bullets and shouts of men fighting face to face Some one reeled and fell against Dick and for a moment he was in horror lest it should be Warner but a glance showed him that it was a stranger Then he rushed on again filled with a mad excitement waving his small sword and shouting to the men to charge From right to left the roar of battle came to his ears but on the hill where he stood the struggle was at its height The lines of Federals and Confederates face to face at first now became mixed but neither side gained In the fiery struggle a Union officer Fry saw Zollicoffer only a few feet away Snatching out his pistol he shot him dead The Southerners seeing the fall of the general who was so popular among them hesitated and then gave back Thomas watching everything with keen and steady gaze hurled an Ohio regiment from the right flank upon the Southern center causing it to give way yet further under the shock We win We win shouted Dick in his ardor as he saw the Southern line yielding But the victory was not yet achieved Crittenden who was really Zollicoffer s superior in the command displayed the most heroic courage throughout the battle He brought up fresh troops to help his weakened center He reformed his lines and was about to restore the battle but Thomas silent and ever watchful now rushed in a brigade of Tennessee mountaineers and as they struck with all their weight the new line of the South was compelled to give way Success seen and felt filled the veins of the soldiers with fresh fire Dick and the men about him saw the whole Southern line crumble up before them The triumphant Union army rushed forward shouting and the Confederates were forced to give way at all points Dick and Warner with the watchful sergeant near were in the very front of the advance The two young aides carried away by success and the fire of battle waved their swords continually and rushed at the enemy s lines Dick s face was covered with smoke his lips were burnt and his throat was raw from so much shouting But he was conscious only of great elation This is not another Bull Run he cried to Warner and Warner cried back Not by a long shot Thomas still cool watchful and able to judge of results amid all the thunder and confusion of battle hurried every man into the attack He was showing upon this his first independent field all the great qualities he was destined later to manifest so brilliantly in some of the greatest battles of modern times The Southern lines were smashed completely by those heavy and continuous blows Driven hard on every side they now retreated rapidly and their triumphant enemies seized prisoners and cannon The whole Confederate army continued its swift retreat until it reached its intrenchments where the officers rallied the men and turned to face their enemy But the cautious Thomas stopped He had no intention of losing his victory by an attack upon an intrenched foe and drew off for the present His army encamped out of range and began to attend to the wounded and bury the dead Dick feeling the reaction after so much exertion and excitement sat down on a fallen tree trunk and drew long panting breaths He saw Warner near and remembered the blood that had been dripping from his hand Do you know that you are wounded George he said Look at the back of your hand Warner glanced at it and noticed the red stripe It had ceased to bleed Now that s curious he said I never felt it My blood and brain were both so hot that the flick of a bullet created no sensation I have figured it out Dick and I have concluded that seventy per cent of our bravery in battle is excitement leaving twenty per cent to will and ten per cent to chance I suppose your calculation is close enough It s not close merely It s exact Both sprang to their feet and saluted as Major Hertford approached He had escaped without harm and he saw with pleasure that the lads were alive and well except for Warner s slight wound You can rest now boys he said I won t need you for some time But I can tell you that I don t think General Thomas means to quit He will follow up his victory But Dick and Warner had been sure of that already The army flushed with triumph was eager to be led on even to make a night attack on the intrenchments of the enemy but Thomas held them knowing that another brigade of Northern troops was marching to his aid The brigade came but it was now dark and he would not risk a night attack But some of the guns were brought up and they sent a dozen heavy cannon shot into the intrenchments of the enemy There was no reply and neither of the boys although they strained ears could hear anything in the defeated camp I shouldn t be surprised if we found them gone in the morning said Major Hertford to Dick But I think our general is right in not making any attack upon their works What do you say to that Sergeant Whitley You ve had a lot of experience Sergeant Whitley was standing beside them also trying to pierce the darkness with trained eyes although he could not see the Confederate intrenchments If a sergeant may offer an opinion I agree with you fully sir he said A night attack is always risky an most of all sir when troops are new like ours although they re as brave as anybody More n likely if we was to rush on em our troops would be shootin into one another in the darkness Good logic said Major Hertford and as it is quite certain that they are not in any condition to come out and attack us we ll stand by and wait till morning So the general orders They walked back toward the place where the victorious troops were lighting the fires out of the range of the cannon in the Confederate intrenchments They were exultant but they were not boasting unduly Night cold and dark had shut down upon them and was taking the heat out of their blood Hundreds of men were at work building fires and Dick and Warner with the permission of Major Hertford joined them Both boys felt that the work would be a relief Wood was to be had in abundance The forest stretched on all sides of them in almost unbroken miles and the earth was littered with dead wood fallen a year or years before They merely kept away from the side on which the Confederate intrenchments lay and brought in the wood in great quantities A row of lights a half mile long sprang up giving forth heat and warmth Then arose the cheerful sound of tin and iron dishes and cups rattling against one another A quarter of an hour later they were eating a victorious supper and a little later most of them slept But in the night the Confederate troops abandoned their camp leaving in it ten cannon and fifteen hundred wagons and crossed the river in boats which they destroyed when they reached the other side Then their defeat being so severe and they but volunteers they scattered in the mountains to seek food and shelter for the remainder of the winter This army of the South ceased to exist CHAPTER VII THE MESSENGER Victory overwhelming and complete had been won but General Thomas could not follow into the deep mountains where his army might be cut off So he remained where he was for a little while and on the second day he sent for Dick The general was seated alone in a tent an open end of which faced a fire as it was now extremely cold General Thomas had shown no undue elation over his victory He was as silent as ever and now as always he made upon Dick the impression of strength and indomitable courage Sit down he said waving his hand toward a camp stool Dick after saluting sat down in silence I hear said the general that you behaved very well in the battle and that you are a lad of courage and intelligence Courage is common intelligence real intelligence is rare You were at Bull Run also so I hear I was and the army fought well there too but late in the day it was seized with a sudden panic Something that may happen at any time to raw troops But we ll pass to the question in hand The campaign here in the mountains is ended for this winter but great matters are afoot further west A courier arrived last night stating that General Grant and Commodore Foote were preparing to advance by water from Cairo Illinois and attempt the reduction of the Confederate forts on the Cumberland and Tennessee General Buell one of your own Kentuckians is advancing southward with a strong Union force and in a few days his outposts will be on Green River It will be of great advantage to Buell to know that the Confederate army in the eastern part of the state is destroyed He can advance with freedom and on the other hand the Southern leader Albert Sidney Johnston will be compelled to throw a portion of his force to the eastward to protect his flank which has been uncovered by our victory at Mill Spring Do you understand I do sir Then you are to carry dispatches of the utmost importance from me to General Buell After you reach his camp if you reach it you will of course be subject to his orders I have learned that you know the country well between here and Green River Because of that and because of your intelligence real intelligence I mean you are chosen for this task You are to change to citizen s clothes at once and a horse of great power and endurance has been selected for you But you must use all your faculties all the time I warn you that the journey is full of danger I can carry it out replied Dick with quiet confidence and I thank you for choosing me I believe you will succeed said the general who liked his tone Return here in an hour with all your preparations made and I will give you the dispatches Warner was filled with envy that his comrade was to go on a secret mission of great importance but he generously wished him a full measure of success Remember he said that on an errand like yours presence of mind counts for at least fifty per cent Have a quick tongue Always be ready with a tale that looks true An remember too said Sergeant Whitley that however tight a place you get into you can get into one tighter Think of that and it will encourage you to pull right out of the hole The two wrung his hand and Major Hertford also gave him his warmest wishes The horse chosen for him was a bay of tremendous power and Dick knew that he would serve him well He carried double blankets strapped to the saddle pistols in holsters with another in his belt an abundance of ammunition and food for several days in his saddle bags Then he returned to General Thomas who handed him a thin strip of tissue paper It is written in indelible ink he said and it contains a statement of our forces and their positions here in the eastern part of the state It also tells General Buell what reinforcements he can expect If you are in imminent danger of capture destroy the paper but to provide for such a chance in case you escape afterward I will read the dispatches to you He read them over several times and then questioned Dick But the boy s memory was good In fact every word of the dispatches was burnt into his brain and nothing could make him forget them And now my lad said General Thomas giving him his hand you may help us greatly I would not send a boy upon such an errand but the demands of war are terrible and must be obeyed The strong grasp of the general s hand imparted fresh enthusiasm to Dick and for the present he did not have the slightest doubt that he would get safely through He wore a strong suit of home made brown jeans a black felt cap with ear flaps and high boots The dispatch was pinned into a small inside pocket of his vest He rode quickly out of camp giving the sentinels the pass word and the head of the horse was pointed west slightly by north The ground was now frozen and he did not have the mud to hold him back The horse evidently had been longing for action Such thews and sinews as his needed exercise He stretched out his long neck neighed joyously and broke of his own accord into an easy canter It was a lonely road and Dick was glad that it was so The fewer people he met the better it was in every way for him He shared the vigor and spirit of his horse His breath turned to smoke but the cold whipped his blood into a quicker torrent He hummed snatches of the songs that he had heard Samuel Jarvis sing and went on mile after mile through the high hills toward the low hills of Kentucky Dick did not pass many people The ancient name of his state the Dark and Bloody Ground came back to him He knew that war in one of its worst forms existed in this wild sweep of hills Here the guerillas rode choosing their sides as suited them best and robbing as paid them most Nor did these rough men hesitate at murder So he rode most of the time with his hand on the butt of the pistol at his belt and whenever he went through woods which was most of the time he kept a wary watch to right and to left The first person whom he passed was a boy riding on a sack of grain to mill Dick greeted him cheerfully and the boy with the fearlessness of youth replied in the same manner Any news your way asked Dick Nothin at all replied the boy his eyes enlarging with excitement but from the way you are comin we heard tell there was a great battle hundreds of thousands of men on each side an that the Yankees won Is it so Mister It is true replied Dick A dozen people have told me of it but the armies were not quite so large as you heard It is true also that the Yankees won I ll tell that at the mill It will be big news to them An which way be you goin Mister said the boy with all the frankness of the hills I m on my way to the middle part of the state I ve been looking after some land that my people own in the mountains Looks like a lonesome road this Will I reach any house soon Thar s Ben Trimble s three miles further on but take my advice an don t stop thar Ben says he ain t goin to be troubled in these war times by visitors an he s likely to meet you at the door with his double barreled shotgun I won t knock on Ben s door so he needn t take down his double barreled shotgun What s next beyond Ben s house A half mile further on you come to Hungry Creek It ain t much in the middle of summer but right now it s full of cold water nough of it to come right up to your hoss s body You go through it keerful Thank you for your good advice said Dick I ll follow it too Good bye He waved his gauntleted hand and rode on A hundred yards further and he glanced back The boy had stopped on the crest of a hill and was looking at him But Dick knew that it was only the natural curiosity of the hills and he renewed his journey without apprehension At the appointed time he saw the stout log cabin of Ben Trimble by the roadside with the warm smoke rising from the chimney but true to his word he gave Ben and his shotgun no trouble and continued straight ahead over the frozen road until he came to the banks of Hungry Creek Here too the words of the boy came true The water was both deep and cold and Dick looked at it doubtfully He urged his great horse into the stream at last and it appeared that the creek had risen somewhat since the boy had last seen it In the middle the horse was compelled to swim but it was no task for such a powerful animal and Dick holding his feet high came dry to the shore that he sought The road led on through high hills covered with oak and beech and cedar and pine all the deciduous trees bare of leaves their boughs rustling dryly whenever the wind blew He saw the smoke of three cabins nestling in snug coves but it was a full three hours before he met anybody else in the road Then he saw two men riding toward him but he could not tell much about them as they were wrapped in heavy gray shawls and wore broad brimmed felt hats pulled well down over their foreheads Dick knew that he could not exercise too much caution in this debatable land and his right hand dropped cautiously to the butt of his pistol in such a manner that it was concealed by his heavy overcoat His left hand rested lightly on the reins as he rode forward at an even pace But he did not fail to take careful note of the two men who were now examining him in a manner that he did not like Dick saw that the strangers openly carried pistols in their belts which was not of overwhelming significance in such times in such a region but they did not have the look of mountaineers riding on peaceful business and he reined his horse to the very edge of the road that he might pass them He noted with rising apprehension that they checked the pace of their horses as they approached and that they reined to either side of the road to compel him to go between them But he pulled his own horse out still further and as they could not pass on both sides of him without an overt act of hostility they drew together again in the middle of the road Mornin stranger they said together when they were a few yards away Good morning said Dick riding straight on without checking his speed But one of the men drew his horse across the road and said What s your hurry It ain t friendly to ride by without passin the time o day Now at close range Dick liked their looks less than ever They might be members of that very band of Skelly s which had already made so much trouble for both sides and he summoned all his faculties in order to meet them at any game that they might try to play I ve been on land business in the mountains he said and I m anxious to get back to my home Besides the day is very cold and the two facts deprive me of the pleasure of a long conversation with you gentlemen Good day Wait just a little said the spokesman who still kept his horse reined across the road These be war times an it s important to know what a fellow is Be you for the Union or are you with the Secesh Dick was quite sure that whatever he answered they would immediately claim to be on the opposite side Then would follow robbery and perhaps murder Which is your side he asked But we put the question first the fellow replied Dick no longer had any doubts The second man was drawing his horse up by the side of him as if to seize him while the first continued to bar the way He was alarmed deeply alarmed but he lost neither his courage nor his presence of mind Luckily he had already summoned every faculty for instant action and now he acted He uttered a sudden shout and raked the side of his horse with both spurs His horse was not only large and powerful but of a most high spirit When he heard that shout and felt the burning slash of the spurs he made a blind but mighty leap forward The horse of the first stranger smitten by so great a weight fell in the road and his rider went down with him The enraged horse then leaped clear of both and darted forward at headlong speed As his horse sprang Dick threw himself flat upon his neck and the bullet that the second man fired whistled over his head By impulse he drew his own pistol and fired back He saw the man s pistol arm fall as if broken and he heard a loud cry That was a lucky shot indeed and rising a little in his saddle he shouted again and again to the great horse that served him so well The gallant animal responded in full He stretched out his long neck and the road flew fast behind him Sparks flashed from the stones where the shod hoofs struck and Dick exulting felt the cold air rush past Another shot was fired at long range but the bullet did not strike anywhere near Dick took only a single backward glance He saw the two men on their horses but drooping as if weak from hurts and he knew that for the present at least he was safe from any hurt from them But he allowed his horse his head for a long time and then he gradually slowed him down No human being was in sight now and he spoke to the noble animal soothingly Good old boy he said the strongest the swiftest the bravest and the truest I was sorry to make those red stripes on your sides but it had to be done Only quickness saved us The horse neighed He was still quivering from excitement and exertion So was Dick for that matter The men might have been robbers merely they were at least that bad but they might have deprived him also of his precious dispatch He was proud of the confidence put in him by General Thomas and he meant to deserve it It was this sense of responsibility and pride that had attuned his faculties to so high a pitch and that had made his action so swift sudden and decisive But he steadied himself presently The victory for victory it certainly was increased his strength and confidence He stopped soon at a brook they seemed to occur every mile and bathed with cold water the red streaks his spurs had made on either side of his horse Again he spoke soothing words and regretted the necessity that had caused him to make such wounds slight though they were He also bathed his own face and hands and as it was now about noon ate of the cold ham and bread that he carried in his knapsack meanwhile keeping constant watch on the road over which he had come But he did not believe that the men would pursue and he saw no sign of them Mounting again he rode forward The remainder of the afternoon went by without interruption He passed three or four people but they were obviously natives of that region and they asked him only innocent questions The wintry day was short and the twilight was soon at hand He was riding over one of the bare ridges when first he noticed how late the day had grown All the sky was gray and chill and the cold sun was setting behind the western mountains A breeze sprang up rustling among the leafless branches and Dick shivered in the saddle A new necessity was pressed suddenly upon him He must find shelter for the night Even with his warm double blankets he could not sleep in the forest on such a night Besides the horse would need food 
6538_81843_000000_000000	train-clean-360	He rode on briskly for a full hour anxiously watching both sides of the road for a cabin or cabin smoke 
6538_81843_000000_000001	train-clean-360	By that time night had come fully though fortunately it was clear but very cold 
none	none	He saw then on the right a faint coil of smoke rising against the dusky sky and he rode straight for it 
6538_81843_000001_000000	train-clean-360	The smoke came from a strong double cabin standing about four hundred yards from the road and the sight of the heavy log walls made Dick all the more anxious to get inside them

6538_81843_000002_000000	train-clean-360	As he approached two yellow curs rushed forth and began to bark furiously snapping at the horse s heels the usual mountain welcome But when a kick from the horse grazed the ear of one of them they kept at a respectful distance 
6538_81843_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Hello 
6538_81843_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Hello called Dick loudly 
none	none	This also was the usual mountain notification that a guest had come and the heavy board door of the house opened inward 
6538_81843_000004_000001	train-clean-360	A man elderly but dark and strong with the high cheek bones of an Indian stood in the door the light of a fire blazing in the fireplace on the opposite side of the wall throwing him in relief 
6538_81843_000004_000002	train-clean-360	His hair was coal black long and coarse increasing his resemblance to an Indian 
6538_81843_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Dick rode close to the door and without hesitation asked for a night s shelter and food 
none	none	This was his inalienable right in the hills or mountains of his state and he would be a strange man indeed who would refuse it 
6538_81843_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The man sharply bade the dogs be silent and they retreated behind the house their tails drooping 
none	none	Then he said to Dick in a tone that was not without hospitality
6538_81843_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Light stranger an we ll put up your horse 
6538_81843_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Mandy will have supper ready by the time we finish the job 
6538_81843_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Dick sprang down gladly but staggered a little at first from the stiffness of his legs 
6538_81843_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve rid far stranger said the man who Dick knew at once had a keen eye and a keen brain an you re young too 
6538_81843_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 But not younger than many who have gone to the war replied Dick 
none	none	In fact you see many who are not older than fifteen or sixteen 
6538_81843_000011_000000	train-clean-360	He had spoken hastily and incautiously and he realized it at once 
6538_81843_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The man s keen gaze was turned upon him again 
6538_81843_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve seen the armies then he said 
6538_81843_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 Mebbe you re a sojer yourself 
none	none	I ve been in the mountains looking after some land that belongs to my family said Dick My name is Mason Richard Mason and I live near Pendleton which is something like a hundred miles from here He deemed it best to give his right name as it would have no significance there You must have seen armies persisted the man or you wouldn t hev knowed bout so many boys of fifteen or sixteen bein in them I saw both the Federal and Confederate armies in Eastern Kentucky My business took me near them but I was always glad to get away from them too I heard tell today that there was a big battle You heard right 
6538_81843_000018_000001	train-clean-360	It was fought near a little place called Mill Spring and resulted in a complete victory for the Northern forces under General Thomas 
6538_81843_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 That was what I heard 
6538_81843_000019_000001	train-clean-360	It will be good news to some an bad news to others 
none	none	Pears to me mister Mason that you can t fight a battle that will suit everybody
6538_81843_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I never heard of one that did

6538_81843_000021_000004	train-clean-360	All we ask of people is to let us be 
6538_81843_000021_000005	train-clean-360	Lots of us in the mountain feel that way 
none	none	Let them lowlanders shoot one another up ez long ez they please but up here there ain t no slaves an there ain t nothin else to fight about 
6538_81843_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The stable was a good one better than usual in that country 
6538_81843_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Dick saw stalls for four horses but no horses 
none	none	They put his own horse in one of the stalls and gave him corn and hay Then they walked back to the house and entered a large room where a stalwart woman of middle age had just finished cooking supper Whew but the night s goin to be cold said Leffingwell as he shut the door behind them and cut off an icy blast
6538_81843_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 It ll make the fire an supper all the better 
6538_81843_000023_000002	train-clean-360	We re just plain mountain people but you re welcome to the best we have 
none	none	Ma this is mister Mason who has been on lan business in the mountains an is back on his way to his home at Pendleton 
6538_81843_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Leffingwell s wife a powerful woman as large as her husband and with a pleasant face gave Dick a large hand and a friendly grasp 
6538_81843_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a good night to be indoors she said 
6538_81843_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Supper s ready Seth 
none	none	Will you an the stranger set 
6538_81843_000026_000000	train-clean-360	She had placed the pine table in the middle of the room and Dick noticed that it was large enough for five or six persons 
none	none	He put his saddle bags and blankets in a corner and he and the man drew up chairs 
6538_81843_000027_000000	train-clean-360	He had seldom beheld a more cheerful scene 
6538_81843_000027_000001	train-clean-360	In a great fireplace ten feet wide big logs roared and crackled 
6538_81843_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Corn cakes vegetables and two kinds of meat were cooking over the coals and a great pot of coffee boiled and bubbled 
6538_81843_000027_000003	train-clean-360	No candles had been lighted but they were not needed 
6538_81843_000027_000004	train-clean-360	The flames gave sufficient illumination 
none	none	Set young man said Leffingwell heartily an see who s teeth are sharper yourn or mine 
6538_81843_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Dick sat down gladly and they fell to 
none	none	The woman alternately waited on them and ate with them 
6538_81843_000029_000002	train-clean-360	For a time the two masculine human beings ate and drank with so much vigor that there was no time for talk Leffingwell was the first to break silence 
none	none	I kin see you growin he said Growing Yes growin you re eatin so much you re enjoyin it so much an you re digestin it so fast You are already taller than you was when you set an you re broader cross the chest No tain t wuth while to pologize 
6538_81843_000032_000003	train-clean-360	You ve got a right to be hungry an you mustn t forget Ma s cookin either 
none	none	She s never had her beat in all these mountains
6538_81843_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Shut up Seth said missus Leffingwell genially you ll make the young stranger think you re plum foolish which won t be wide of the mark either 
6538_81843_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I m grateful said Dick falling into the spirit of it but what pains me missus Leffingwell is the fact that mister Leffingwell will only nibble at your food 
6538_81843_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I don t understand it as he looks like a healthy man 
none	none	Twouldn t do for me to be too hearty said Leffingwell or I d keep Mandy here cookin all the time They seemed pleasant people to Dick good honest mountain types and he was glad that he had found their house 
6538_81843_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The room in which they sat was large apparently used for all purposes kitchen dining room sitting room and bedroom 
6538_81843_000036_000002	train-clean-360	An old fashioned squirrel rifle lay on hooks projecting from the wall but there was no other sign of a weapon 
none	none	There was a bed at one end of the room and another at the other which could be hidden by a rough woolen curtain running on a cord 
6538_81843_000036_000004	train-clean-360	Dick surmised that this bed would be assigned to him 
none	none	Their appetites grew lax and finally ceased Then Leffingwell yawned and stretched his arms Stranger he said we rise early an go to bed early in these parts Thar ain t nothin to keep us up in the evenin s an as you ve had a hard long ride I guess you re just achin fur sleep 
6538_81843_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Dick although he had been unwilling to say so was in fact very sleepy The heavy supper and the heat of the room pulled so hard on his eyelids that he could scarcely keep them up 
6538_81843_000039_000001	train-clean-360	He murmured his excuses and said he believed he would like to retire 
6538_81843_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t you be bashful about sayin so exclaimed Leffingwell heartily cause I don t think I could keep up more n a half hour longer 
none	none	missus Leffingwell drew the curtain shutting off one bed and a small space around it 
6538_81843_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Dick used to primitive customs said good night and retired within his alcove taking his saddle bags 
none	none	There was a small window near the foot of the room and when he noticed it he resolved to let in a little air later on 
6538_81843_000041_000003	train-clean-360	The mountaineers liked hot rooms all the time but he did not 
6538_81843_000041_000004	train-clean-360	This window contained no glass but was closed with a broad shutter 
6538_81843_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The boy undressed and got into bed placing his saddle bags on the foot of it and the pistol that he carried in his belt under his head 
none	none	He fell asleep almost immediately and had he been asked beforehand he would have said that nothing could awake him before morning 
6538_81843_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Nevertheless he awoke before midnight and it was a very slight thing that caused him to come out of sleep 
6538_81843_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Despite the languor produced by food and heat a certain nervous apprehension had been at work in the boy s mind and it followed him into the unknown regions of sleep 
6538_81843_000042_000004	train-clean-360	His body was dead for a time and his mind too but this nervous power worked on almost independently of him 
6538_81843_000042_000005	train-clean-360	It had noted the sound of voices nearby and awakened him as if he had been shaken by a rough hand 
6538_81843_000043_000000	train-clean-360	He sat up in his bed and became conscious of a hot and aching head 
none	none	Then he remembered the window and softly drawing two pegs that fastened it in order that he might not awaken his good hosts he opened it inward a few inches The cold air poured in at the crevice and felt like heaven on his face His temples quit throbbing and his head ceased to ache He had not noticed at first the cause that really awakened him but as he settled back into bed grateful for the fresh air the same mysterious power gave him a second warning signal 
6538_81843_000045_000000	train-clean-360	He heard the hum of voices and sat up again 
none	none	It was merely the Leffingwells in the bed at the far end of the room talking Perhaps he had not been asleep more than an hour and it was natural that they should lie awake a while talking about the coming of this young stranger or any other event of the day that interested them Then he caught a tone or an inflection that he did not remember to have been used by either of the Leffingwells 
6538_81843_000045_000004	train-clean-360	A third signal of alarm was promptly registered on his brain 
none	none	He leaned from the bed and pulling aside the curtain a half an inch or so looked into the room 
6538_81843_000046_000001	train-clean-360	The fire had died down except a few coals which cast but a faint light 
none	none	Yet it was sufficient to show Dick that the two Leffingwells had not gone to bed 
6538_81843_000046_000003	train-clean-360	They were sitting fully clothed before the fireplace and three other persons were with them 
6538_81843_000047_000000	train-clean-360	As Dick stared his eyes grew more used to the half dusk and he saw clearly 
none	none	The three strangers were young men all armed heavily and the resemblance of two of them to the Leffingwells was so striking that he had no doubt they were their sons 
6538_81843_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Now he understood about those empty stalls 
6538_81843_000047_000003	train-clean-360	The third man who had been sitting with his shoulder toward Dick turned his face presently and the boy with difficulty repressed an exclamation 
none	none	It was the one who had reined his horse across the road to stop him 
6538_81843_000047_000005	train-clean-360	A fourth and conclusive signal of alarm was registered upon his brain 
none	none	He began to dress rapidly and without noise Meanwhile he listened intently and could hear the words they spoke 
6538_81843_000048_000002	train-clean-360	The woman was pleading with them to let him go 
6538_81843_000048_000003	train-clean-360	He was only a harmless lad and while these were dark days a crime committed now might yet be punished 
none	none	A harmless boy said the strange man He s quick an strong enough I tell you You should have seen how he rode me down and then shot Garmon in the arm
6538_81843_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 I d like to have that hoss of his said the elder Leffingwell 
none	none	He s the finest brute I ever laid eyes on Sech power an sech action 
6538_81843_000050_000003	train-clean-360	I noticed him at once when Mason come ridin up 
none	none	S pose we jest take the hoss and send the boy on
6538_81843_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 A hoss like that would be knowed protested the woman 
none	none	What if sojers come lookin fur him We could run him off in the hills an keep him there a while said Leffingwell
6538_81843_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 I know places where sojers wouldn t find that hoss in a thousand years 
6538_81843_000052_000002	train-clean-360	What do you say to that Kerins 
none	none	Good as fur as it goes replied Kerins but it don t go fur enough by a long shot 
6538_81843_000053_000001	train-clean-360	The Yanks whipped the Johnnies in a big battle at Mill Spring 
6538_81843_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Me an my pardners have been hangin roun in the woods seein what would happen 
none	none	Now we know that this boy rode straight from the tent of General Thomas hisself He s a Union sojer an young as he is he s an officer He wouldn t be sent out by General Thomas hisself less it was on big business 
6538_81843_000053_000006	train-clean-360	He s got messages dispatches of some kind that are worth a heap to somebody 
6538_81843_000053_000007	train-clean-360	With all the armies gatherin in the south an west of the state it stands to reason that them dispatches mean a lot 
none	none	Now we ve got to get em an get the full worth of em from them to whom they re worth the most He s got a pistol said the elder Leffingwell I seed it in his belt If he wakes before we grab him he ll shoot The man Kerins laughed He ll never get a chance to shoot he said Why after all he went through today he ll sleep like a log till mornin That s so said one of the young Leffingwells an Kerins is right We ought to grab them dispatches Likely in one way or another we kin git a heap fur em Shut up Jim you fool said his mother sharply Do you want murder on your hands 
6538_81843_000058_000002	train-clean-360	Stealin hosses is bad enough but if that boy has got the big dispatches you say he has an he s missin don t you think that sojers will come after him 
none	none	An they ll trace him to this house an I tell you that in war trials don t last long 
6538_81843_000058_000004	train-clean-360	Besides he s a nice boy an he spoke nice all the time to pap an me 
6538_81843_000059_000000	train-clean-360	But her words did not seem to make any impression upon the others except her husband who protested again that it would be enough to take the horse 
6538_81843_000059_000001	train-clean-360	As for the dispatches it wasn t wise for them to fool with such things 
none	none	But Kerins insisted on going the whole route and the young Leffingwells were with him 
6538_81843_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile Dick had dressed with more rapidity than ever before in his life fully alive to the great dangers that threatened 
6538_81843_000060_000001	train-clean-360	But his fear was greatest lest he might lose the precious dispatches that he bore 
6538_81843_000060_000002	train-clean-360	For a few moments he did not know what to do 
6538_81843_000060_000003	train-clean-360	He might take his pistols and fight but he could not fight them all with success 
6538_81843_000060_000004	train-clean-360	Then that pleasant flood of cold air gave him the key 
6538_81843_000061_000000	train-clean-360	While they were still talking he put his saddle bags over his arm opened the shutter its full width and dropped quietly to the ground outside remembering to take the precaution of closing the shutter behind him lest the sudden inrush of cold startle the Leffingwells and their friends 
6538_81843_000062_000000	train-clean-360	It was an icy night but Dick did not stop to notice it 
none	none	He ran to the stable saddled and bridled his horse in two minutes and in another minute was flying westward over the flinty road careless whether or not they heard the beat of his horse s hoofs CHAPTER VIII A MEETING AT NIGHT Dick heard above the thundering hoofbeats only a single shout and then as he glanced backward the house was lost in the moonlight When he secured his own horse he had noticed that all the empty stalls were now filled no doubt by the horses of the young Leffingwells and Kerins but he was secure in his confidence that none could overtake the one he rode He felt of that inside pocket of his vest The precious dispatch was there tightly pinned into its hidden refuge and as for himself refreshed warm and strong after food rest and sleep he felt equal to any emergency He had everything with him The stout saddle bags were lying across the saddle He had thrust the holster of pistols into them but he took it out now and hung it in its own place also across the saddle Although he was quite sure there would be no pursuit the elder Leffingwells would certainly keep their sons from joining it he sent his great horse straight ahead at a good pace for a long time the road being fairly good His excitement and rapid motion kept him from noticing at first the great bitterness of the cold When he had gone five or six miles he drew his horse down to a walk Then feeling the intensity of the cold as the mercury was far below zero he dismounted looped the reins over his arms and walked a while For further precaution he took his blanket roll and wrapped the two blankets about his body especially protecting his neck and ears He found that the walking besides keeping him warmer took all the stiffness out of his muscles and he continued on foot several miles He passed two brooks and a creek all frozen over so solidly that the horse passed on them without breaking the ice It was an extremely difficult task to make the animal try the ice but after much delicate coaxing and urging he always succeeded He saw two more cabins at the roadside but he did not think of asking hospitality at either The night was now far advanced and he wished to put many more miles between him and the Leffingwell home before he sought rest again He mounted his horse once more and increased his speed Now the reaction came after so much exertion and excitement He began to feel depressed He was very young and he had no comrade The loneliness of the winter night in a country full of dangers was appalling It seemed to him as his heart sank that all things had conspired against him But the moment of despair was brief He summoned his courage anew and rode on bravely although the sense of loneliness in its full power remained The moonlight was quite bright The sky was a deep silky blue in which myriads of cold stars shone and danced By and by he skirted for a while the banks of a small river which he knew flowed southward into the Cumberland and which would not cross his path The rays of the moonlight on its frozen surface looked like darts of cold steel He left the river presently and the road bent a little toward the north Then the skies darkened somewhat but lightened again as the dawn began to come The red but cold edge of the sun appeared above the mountains that he had left behind and then the morning came pale and cold Dick stopped at a little brook broke the ice and drank letting his horse drink after him Then he ate heartily of the cold bread and meat in his knapsack Pitying his horse he searched until he found a little grass not yet killed by winter in the lee of the hill and waited until he cropped it all He mounted and resumed his journey through a country in which the hills were steadily becoming lower with larger stretches of level land appearing between them By night he should be beyond the last low swell of the mountains and into the hill region proper As he calculated distances his heart gave a great thump He was to locate Buell some distance north of Green River and his journey would take him close to Pendleton The boy was torn by great and conflicting emotions He would carry out with his life the task that Thomas had assigned to him and yet he wished to stop near Pendleton if only for an hour Yes an hour would do And it could not interfere with his duty But Pendleton was a Southern stronghold Everybody there knew him and they all knew too that he was in the service of the North How could he pass by without being seen and what might happen then The terrible conflict went on in his mind and it was stilled only when he decided to leave it to time and chance He rode that day almost without interruption securing an ample dinner where no one chose to ask questions accepting him at his own statement of himself and probably believing it He heard that a small Southern force was to the southward probably marching toward Bowling Green where a great Confederate army under Albert Sidney Johnston was said to be concentrated But the news gave him no alarm His own road was still leading west slightly by north When night came he was in the pleasant and fertile hill country dotted with double brick houses and others of wood all with wide porticos supported by white pillars It looked smiling and prosperous even in winter The war had done no ravages here and he saw men at work about the great barns He slept in the house of a big farmer who liked the frank voice and eyes of the lad and who cared nothing for any errand upon which he might be riding He slept too without dreams and without awakening until the morning when he shared a solid breakfast with the family Dick obtained at the farmhouse a fresh supply of cold food for his saddle bags to be held against an emergency although it was likely now that he could obtain all he needed at houses as he passed Receiving the good wishes of his hosts he rode on through the hills The intense cold which kept troops from marching much really served him as the detachments about the little towns stayed in their camps The day was quite clear with the mercury still well below zero but his heavy clothing kept him warm and comfortable His great horse showed no signs of weariness Apparently his sinews were made of steel Noon came but Dick did not seek any farmhouse for what was called dinner in that region Instead he ate from his saddle bags as he rode on He did not wish to waste time and moreover he had taken his resolution He would go near Pendleton It was on his most direct route but he would pass in the night As the cold twilight descended he came into familiar regions Like all other young Kentuckians he was a great horseman and with Harry Kenton and other lads of his age he had ridden nearly everywhere in a circuit of thirty miles around Pendleton It was with many a throb of the heart that he now recognized familiar scenes He knew the fields the forests and the houses But he was glad that the night had come Others would know him and he did not wish to be seen when he rode on such an errand He had been saving his horse in the afternoon but now he pushed him forward at a much faster gait The great horse responded willingly and Dick felt the powerful body working beneath him smooth and tireless like a perfect machine He passed nobody on the road People hugged their fires on such a cold night and he rode hour after hour without interruption It was nearly midnight when he stopped on a high hill free of forest and looked down upon Pendleton The wonderful clearness of the winter night helped him All the stars known to man were out and helped to illuminate the world with a clear but cold radiance Although a long distance away Dick could see Pendleton clearly There was no foliage on the trees now and nearly every house was visible The great pulse in his throat throbbed hard as he looked He saw the steeples of the churches the white pillars of the court house and off to one side the academy in which he and Harry Kenton had gone to school together He saw further away Colonel Kenton s own house on another hill It too had porticos supported by white pillars which gleamed in the moonlight Then his eyes traveled again around the half circle before him The place for which he was looking could not be seen But he knew that it would be so It was a low house and the evergreens about it the pines and cedars would hide it at any time But he knew the exact spot and he wanted his eyes to linger there a little before he rode straight for it Now the great pulse in his throat leaped and something like a sob came from him But it was not a sob of unhappiness He clucked to his horse and turned from the main road into a narrower one that led by the low house among the evergreens Yet he was a boy of powerful will and despite his eagerness he restrained his horse and advanced very slowly Sometimes he turned the animal upon the dead turf by the side of the road in order that his footsteps might make no sound He drew slowly nearer and when he saw the roof and eaves of the low house among the evergreens the great pulse in his throat leaped so hard that it was almost unbearable He reached the edge of the lawn that came down to the road and hidden by the clipped cone of a pine he saw a faint light shining He dismounted opened the gate softly and led his horse upon the lawn hitching him between two pines that grew close together concealing him perfectly Be quiet old fellow he whispered stroking the great intelligent head Nobody will find you here and I ll come back for you The horse rubbed his nose against his arm but made no other movement Then Dick walked softly toward the house pulses beating hard and paused just at the edge of a portico where he stood in the shadow of a pillar He saw the light clearly now It shone from a window of the low second story It came from her window and her room Doubtless she was thinking at that very moment of him His throat ached and tears came into his eyes The light clear and red shone steadily from the window and made a band across the lawn He picked a handful of sand from the walk that led to the front door and threw it against the window He knew that she was brave and would respond but waiting only a moment or two he threw a second handful fully and fairly against the glass The lower half of the window was thrown open and a head appeared where the moonlight fell clearly upon it It was the head of a beautiful woman framed in thick silken yellow hair the eyes deep blue and the skin of the wonderful fairness so often found in that state The face was that of a woman about thirty seven or eight years of age and without a wrinkle or flaw Mother called Dick in a low voice as he stepped from the shadow of the pillar There was a cry and the face disappeared like a flash from the window But he had only a few moments to wait Her swift feet brought her from the room down the stairway and along the hall to the door which she threw open The next instant missus Mason had her son in her arms Oh Dick Dicky boy how did you come she exclaimed You were here under my window and I did not even know that you were alive Her tears of joy fell upon his face and he was moved profoundly Dick loved his beautiful young mother devoutly and her widowhood had bound them all the more closely together I ve come a long distance and I ve come in many ways mother he replied by train by horseback and I have even walked You have come here on foot No mother I rode directly over your own smooth lawn on one of the biggest horses you ever saw and he s tied now between two of the pine trees Come we must go in the house It s too cold for you out here Do you know that the mercury is about ten degrees below zero What a man you have grown Why you must be two inches taller than you were when you went away and how sunburned and weather beaten you are too Oh Dicky this terrible terrible war Not a word from you in months has got through to me Nor a word from you to me mother but I have not suffered so much so far I was at Bull Run where we lost and I was at Mill Spring where we won but I was unhurt Perhaps you have come back to stay she said hopefully No mother not to stay I took a chance in coming by here to see you but I couldn t go on without a few minutes Inside now mother your hands are growing cold They went in at the door and closed it behind them But there was another faithful soul on guard that night In the dusky hail loomed a gigantic black figure in a blue checked dress blue turban on head Marse Dick she said Juliana he exclaimed How did you know that I was here Ain t I done heard Miss Em ly cry out me always sleepin so light an I hears her run down the hail An then I dresses an comes an sees you two through the crack o the do an then I waits till you come in Dick gave her a most affectionate greeting knowing that she was as true as steel She rejoiced in her flowery name as many other colored women rejoiced in theirs but her heart inhabited exactly the right spot in her huge anatomy She drew mother and son into the sitting room where low coals still burned on the hearth Then she went up to missus Mason s bedroom and put out the light after which she came back to the sitting room and standing by a window in silence watched over the two over whom she had watched so long Why is it that you can stay such a little while asked missus Mason Mother replied Dick in a low tone General Thomas who won the battle at Mill Spring has trusted me I bear a dispatch of great importance It is to go to General Buell and it has to do with the gathering of the Union troops in the western and southern parts of our state and in Tennessee I must get through with it and in war mother time counts almost as much as battles I can stop only a few minutes even for you I suppose it is so But oh Dicky won t this terrible war be over soon I don t think so mother It s scarcely begun yet missus Mason said nothing but stared into the coals The great negress Juliana standing at the window did not move I suppose you are right Dick she said at last with a sigh but it is awful that our people should be arrayed so against one another There is your cousin Harry Kenton a good boy too on the other side Yes mother I caught a glimpse of him at Bull Run We came almost face to face in the smoke But it was only for an instant Then the smoke rushed in between I don t think anything serious has happened to him missus Mason shuddered I should mourn him next to you she said and my brother in law Colonel Kenton has been very good He left orders with his people to watch over us here Pendleton is strongly Southern as you know but nobody would do us any harm unless it was the rough people from the hills Colonel Kenton s wife had been missus Mason s elder sister and Dick as he also sat staring into the coals wondered why people who were united so closely should yet be divided so much Mother he said when I came through the mountains with my friends we stopped at a house in which lived an old old woman She must have been nearly a hundred She knew your ancestor and mine the famous and learned Paul Cotter from whom you and I are descended and she also knew his friend and comrade the mighty scout and hunter Henry Ware who became the great governor of Kentucky How strange But the strangest is yet to be told Harry Kenton when he went east to join Beauregard before Bull Run stopped at the same house and when she first saw him she only looked into the far past She thought it was Henry Ware himself and she saluted him as the governor What do you think of that mother It s a startling coincidence But may it not be an omen I m not superstitious mother but when things come together in such a queer fashion it s bound to make you think When Harry s paths and mine cross in such a manner maybe it means that we shall all come together again and be united as we were Maybe At any rate said Dick with a little laugh we ll hope that it does While the boy was not noticing his mother had made a sign to Juliana who had crept out of the room Now she returned bearing food upon a tray and Dick although he was not hungry ate to please his mother You will stay until morning she said No mother I can t afford to be seen here I must leave in the dark Then until it is nearly morning Nor that either mother My time is about up already I could never betray the trust that General Thomas has put in me My dispatches not only tell of the gathering of our own troops but they contain invaluable information concerning the Confederate concentration which General Thomas learned from his scouts and spies Mother I think a great battle is coming here in the west She shuddered but she did not seek again to delay him in his duty I am proud she said that you have won the confidence of your general and that you ride upon such an important errand I should have been glad if you had stayed at home Dick but since you have chosen to be a soldier I am rejoiced that you have risen in the esteem of your officers Write to me as often as you can Maybe none of your letters will reach me but at least start them I shall start mine too Of course mother said Dick and now it s time for me to ride hard Why you have been here only a half hour Nearer an hour mother and on this journey of mine time means a lot I must say good bye now to you and Juliana The two women followed him down the lawn to the point where his horse was hitched between the two big pines missus Mason patted the horse s great head and murmured to him to carry her son well Did you ever see a finer horse mother said Dick proudly He s the very pick of the army He threw his arms around her neck kissed her more than once sprang into the saddle and rode away in the darkness The two women the black and the white sisters in grief and yet happy that he had come went slowly back into the house to wait while the boy a man s soul in him strode on to war Dick was far from Pendleton when the dawn broke and now he had full need of caution His horse was bearing him fast into debatable ground where every man suspected his neighbor and it remained for force alone to tell to which side the region belonged But the extreme delicacy of the tension came to Dick s aid People hesitated to ask questions lest questions equally difficult be asked of them in return It was a great time to mind one s own business He rode on fortune with him for the present and his course was still west slightly by north He slept under roofs and he learned that in the country into which he had now come the Union sympathizers were more numerous than the Confederate The majority of the Kentuckians whatever their personal feelings were not willing to shatter the republic He heard definitely that here in the west the North was gathering armies greater than any that he had supposed Besides the troops from the three states just across the Ohio River the hardy lumbermen and pioneers were pouring down from Michigan Wisconsin and Minnesota Hunters in deerskin suits and buffalo moccasins had already come from the far Nebraska Territory The power of the west and the northwest was converging upon his state which gave eighty thousand of its men to the Northern cause while half as many more went away to the Southern armies particularly to the one under the brilliant and daring Albert Sidney Johnston which hung a sinister menace before the Northern front One hundred and twenty thousand troops sent to the two armies by a state that contained but little more than a million people It was said at the time that as Kentucky went so would go the fortunes of the Union and in the end it was so But these facts and reckonings were not much in Dick s mind just then He was thinking of Buell s camp and of the message that he bore Again and again he felt of that little inside pocket of his vest to see that it was there although he knew that by no chance could he have lost it When he was within fifteen miles of Buell s camp a heavy snow began to fall But he did not mind it The powerful horse that had borne him so well carried him safely on to his destination and before the sundown of that day the young messenger was standing before General Don Carlos Buell one of the most puzzling characters whom he was to meet in the whole course of the war He had found Thomas a silent man but he found Buell even more so He received Dick in an ordinary tent thanked him as he saluted and handed him the dispatch and then read General Thomas message Dick saw before him a shortish thickset man grim of feature who did not ask him a word until he had finished the dispatch You know what this contains he said when he came to the end Yes General Thomas made me memorize it that I might destroy it if I were too hard pressed He tells us that Johnston is preparing for some great blow and he gives the numbers and present location of the hostile forces Valuable information for us if it is used You have done well mister Mason To what force were you attached A small division of Pennsylvania troops under Major Hertford They were to be sent by General Thomas to General Grant at Cairo Illinois And you would like to join them If you please sir In view of your services your wish is granted It is likely that General Grant will need all the men whom he can get A detachment leaves here early in the morning for Elizabethtown where it takes the train for Louisville proceeding thence by water to Cairo You shall go with these men They are commanded by Colonel Winchester You may go now mister Mason He turned back to his papers and Dick thinking his manner somewhat curt left his tent But he was pleased to hear that the detail was commanded by Colonel Winchester Arthur Winchester was a man of forty one or two who lived about thirty miles north of Pendleton He was a great landowner of high character and pleasant manners Dick had met him frequently in his childhood and the Colonel received him with much warmth I m glad to know Dick he said familiarly that you re going with us I m fond of Pendleton and I like to have one of the Pendleton boys in my command If all that we hear of this man Grant is true we ll see action action hot and continuous They rode to Elizabethtown where Dick was compelled to leave his great horse for Buell s men and went by train to Louisville going thence by steamer down the Ohio River to Cairo at its junction with the Mississippi where they stood at last in the presence of that general whose name was beginning to be known in the west CHAPTER IX TAKING A FORT Dick was with Colonel Winchester when he was admitted to the presence of the general who had already done much to strengthen the Union cause in the west and he found him the plainest and simplest of men under forty short in stature and careless in attire He thanked Colonel Winchester for the reinforcement that he had brought him and then turned with some curiosity to Dick So you were at the battle of Mill Spring he said It was hot was it not Hot enough for me replied Dick frankly Grant laughed They caught a Tartar in George Thomas he said and I fancy that others who try to catch him will be glad enough to let him go He is a great man sir said Dick with conviction Then Grant asked him more questions about the troops and the situation in Eastern Kentucky and Dick noticed that all were sharp and penetrating Your former immediate commander Major Hertford and some of his men are due here today said Grant General Thomas knowing that his own campaign was over sent them north to Cincinnati and they have come down the river to Cairo When they reach here they will be attached to the regiment of Colonel Winchester Dick was overjoyed He had formed a strong liking for Major Hertford and he was quite sure that Warner and Sergeant Whitley would be with him Once more they would be reunited reunited for battle He could not doubt that they would go to speedy action as the little town at the junction of the mighty rivers resounded with preparation When Colonel Winchester and the boy had saluted and retired from General Grant s tent they saw the smoke pouring from the funnels of numerous steamers in the Mississippi and they saw thousands of troops encamped in tents along the shores of both the Ohio and Mississippi Heavy cannon were drawn up on the wharves and ammunition and supplies were being transferred from hundreds of wagons to the steamers It was evident to any one that this expedition whatever it might be was to proceed by water It was a land of mighty rivers close together and a steamer might go anywhere As Dick and Colonel Winchester on whose staff he would now be were watching this active scene a small steamer coming down the Ohio drew in to a wharf and a number of soldiers in faded blue disembarked The boy uttered a shout of joy What is it Dick asked Colonel Winchester Why sir there s my former commander Colonel Newcomb and just behind him is my comrade Lieutenant George Warner of Vermont and not far away is Sergeant Whitley late of the regular army one of the best soldiers in the world Can I greet them colonel Of course Dick rushed forward and saluted Colonel Newcomb who grasped him warmly by the hand So you got safely through my lad he said Major Hertford who came down the Kentucky with his detachment and joined us at Carrollton at the mouth of that river told us of your mission The major is bringing up the rear of our column but here are other friends of yours Dick the next moment was wringing the hand of the Vermont boy and was receiving an equally powerful grip in return I believed that we would meet you here said Warner I calculated that with your courage skill and knowledge of the country the chances were at least eighty per cent in favor of your getting through to Buell And if you did get through to Buell I knew that at least ninety per cent of the circumstances would represent your desire and effort to come here That was a net percentage of seventy two in favor of meeting you here in Cairo and the seventy two per cent has prevailed as it usually does Nothing is so bad that it can t be worse said Sergeant Whitley as he too gave Dick s hand an iron grasp and I knew that when we lost you we d be pretty glad to see you again Here you are safe an sound an here we are safe an sound a most satisfactory condition in war But not likely to remain so long judging from what we see here said Warner We hear that this man Grant is a restless sort of a person who thinks that the way to beat the enemy is just to go in and beat him Major Hertford came up at that moment and he too gave Dick a welcome that warmed his heart But the boy did not get to remain long with his old comrades The Pennsylvania regiment had been much cut down through the necessity of leaving detachments as guards at various places along the river but it was yet enough to make a skeleton and its entity was preserved forming a little eastern band among so many westerners Dick at General Grant s order was transferred permanently to the staff of Colonel Winchester and he and the other officers slept that night in a small building in the outskirts of Cairo He knew that a great movement was at hand but he was becoming so thoroughly inured to danger and hardship that he slept soundly all through the night They heard early the next morning the sound of many trumpets and Colonel Winchester s regiment formed for embarkation All the puffing steamers were now in the Ohio and Dick saw with them many other vessels which were not used for carrying soldiers He saw broad low boats with flat bottoms their sides sheathed in iron plates They were floating batteries moved by powerful engines beneath Then there were eight huge mortars a foot across the muzzle every one mounted separately upon a strong barge and towed Some of the steamers were sheathed in iron also Dick s heart throbbed hard when he saw the great equipment The fighting ships were under the command of Commodore Foote an able man but General Grant and his lieutenants General McClernand and General Smith commanded the army aboard the transports On the transport next to them Dick saw the Pennsylvanians and he waved his hand to his friends who stood on the deck They waved back and Dick felt powerfully the sense of comradeship It warmed his heart for them all to be together again and it was a source of strength too The steamer that bore his regiment was named the River Queen and many of her cabins had been torn away to make more room for the troops who would sleep in rows on her decks as thick as buffaloes in a herd The soldiers like all the others whom he saw were mostly boys The average could not be over twenty and some were not over sixteen But they had the adaptability of youth They had scattered themselves about in easy positions One was playing an accordion and another a fiddle The officers did not interrupt them As Dick looked over the side at the yellow torrent some one said beside him This is a whopping big river You don t see them as deep as this where I come from Dick glanced at the speaker and saw a lad of about his own age of medium height but powerfully built with shoulders uncommonly thick His face was tanned brown but his eyes were blue and his natural complexion was fair He was clad completely in deerskin mocassins on his feet and a raccoon skin cap on his head Dick had noticed the Nebraska hunters in such garb but he was surprised to see this boy dressed in similar fashion among the Kentuckians The youth smiled when he saw Dick s glance of surprise I know I look odd among you he said and you take me for one of the Nebraska hunters So I am but I m a Kentuckian too and I ve a right to a place with you fellows My name is Frank Pennington I was born about forty miles north of Pendleton but when I was six months old my parents went out on the plains where I ve hunted buffalo and where I ve fought Indians too But I m a Kentuckian by right of birth just as you are and I asked to be assigned to the regiment raised in the region from which we came And mighty welcome you are too said Dick offering his hand You belong with us and we ll stick together on this campaign The two youths one officer and one private became fast friends in a moment Events move swiftly in war Both now felt the great engines throbbing faster beneath them and the flotilla well into the mouth of the Ohio was leaving the Mississippi behind them But the Ohio here for a distance is apparently the mightier stream and they gazed with interest and a certain awe at the vast yellow sheet enclosed by shores somber in the gray garb of winter It was the beginning of February and cold winds swept down from the Illinois prairies Cairo had been left behind and there was no sign of human habitation Some wild fowl careless of winter flew over the stream dipped toward the water and then flew away again As far as the eye was concerned the wilderness circled about them and enclosed them The air was cold and flakes of snow dropped upon the decks and the river but were gone in an instant The skies were an unbroken sheet of gray The scene so lonely and desolate contained a majesty that impressed them all heightened for these youths by the knowledge that many of them were going on a campaign from which they would never return Looks as wild as the great plains on which I ve hunted with my father said Pennington But we hunt bigger game than buffalo said Dick Game that is likely to turn and hunt us Yes Do you know where we re going Not exactly but I can make a good guess I know that we ve taken on Tennessee River pilots and I m sure that we ll turn into the mouth of that river at Paducah I infer that we re to attack Fort Henry which the Confederates have erected some distance up the Tennessee to guard that river Looks likely Do you know much about the fort I ve heard of it only since I came to Cairo I know that it stands on low marshy ground facing the Tennessee and that it contains seventeen big guns I haven t heard anything about the size of its garrison But we ll have a fight that s sure said young Pennington I ve been in battle only once at Columbus but the Johnny Rebs don t give up forts in a hurry There s another fort a much bigger one named Donelson on the Cumberland said Dick Both the forts are in Tennessee but as the two rivers run parallel here in the western parts of the two states Fort Donelson and Fort Henry are not far apart I risk a guess that we attack both You don t risk much I tell you Dick that man Grant is a holy terror He isn t much to look at but he s a marcher and a fighter We fellows in the ranks soon learn what kind of a man is over us I suppose it s like the horse feeling through the bit the temper of his rider President Lincoln has stationed General Halleck at saint Louis with general command here in the West General Halleck thinks that General Grant is a meek subordinate without ambition and will always be sending back to him for instructions which is just what General Halleck likes but we in the ranks have learned to know our Grant better Dick s eyes glistened So you think then he said that General Grant will push this campaign home and that he ll soon be where he can t get instructions from General Halleck Looks that way to a man up a tree said Pennington slowly and solemnly winking his left eye They were officer and private but they were only lads together and they talked freely with each other Dick after a while returned to his commanding officer Colonel Winchester but there was little to do and he sat on the deck with him looking out over the fleet the transports the floating batteries the mortar boats and the iron clads He saw that the North besides being vastly superior in numbers and resources was the supreme master on the water through her equipment and the mechanical skill of her people The South had no advantage save the defensive and the mighty generals of genius who appeared chiefly on her Virginia line Dick had inherited a thoughtful temperament from his famous ancestor Paul Cotter whose learning had appeared almost superhuman to the people of his time and he was extremely sensitive to impressions His mind would register them with instant truth As he looked now upon this floating army he felt that the Union cause must win On land the Confederates might be invincible or almost so but the waters of the rivers and the sea upheld the Union cause The fleet steamed on at an even pace Foote the commodore who had daringly reconnoitered Fort Henry from a single gunboat in the Tennessee managed everything with alertness and skill The transports were in the center of the stream The armed and armored vessels kept on the flanks The river a vast yellow sheet sometimes turning gray under the gray wintry skies seemed alone save for themselves Not a single canoe or skiff disturbed its surface Toward evening the flakes of snow came again and the bitter wind blew once more from the Illinois prairies All the troops who were not under shelter were wrapped in blankets or overcoats Dick and the colonel with the heavy coats over their uniforms did not suffer Instead they enjoyed the cold crisp air which filled their lungs and seemed to increase their power When shall we reach the Tennessee asked Dick You will probably wake up in the morning to find yourself some distance up that stream I ve never seen the Tennessee Though not the equal of the Ohio it would be called a giant river in many countries The whole fleet if it wanted to do it could go up it hundreds of miles Why Dick these boats can go clear down into Alabama into the very heart of the Confederacy into the very state at the capital of which Jefferson Davis was inaugurated President of the seceding states I was thinking of that some time ago said Dick The water is with us Yes the water is with us and will stay with us They were silent a little while longer and watched the coming of the early winter twilight over the waters and the lonely land The sky was so heavy with clouds that the gray seemed to melt into the brown The low banks slipped back into the dark They saw only the near surface of the river the dark hulls of the fleet occasional showers of sparks from smoke stacks and an immense black cloud made by the smoke of the fleet trailing behind them far down the river Dick said Colonel Winchester suddenly as you came across Kentucky from Mill Spring and passed so near Pendleton it must have been a great temptation to you to stop and see your mother It was It was so great that I yielded to it I was at our home about midnight for nearly an hour I hope I did nothing wrong colonel No Dick my boy Some martinets might find fault with you but I should blame you had you not stopped for those few moments A noble woman your mother Dick I hope that she is watched over well Dick glanced at the colonel but he could not see his face in the deepening twilight My uncle Colonel Kenton has directed his people to give her help in case of need he replied but that means physical help against raiders and guerillas Otherwise she has sufficient for her support That is well War is terrible on women And now Dick my lad we ll get our supper This nipping air makes me hungry and the Northern troops do not suffer for lack of food The officers ate in one of the cabins and when the supper was finished deep night had come over the river but Dick standing on the deck heard the heavy throb of many engines and he knew that a great army was still around him driven on by the will of one man deep into the country of the foe The decks every foot of plank it seemed were already covered with the sleeping boys wrapped in their blankets and overcoats He saw his friend the young hunter from Nebraska lying with his head on his arm sound asleep a smile on his face Dick watched until the first darkness thinned somewhat and the stars came out Then he retired to one of the cabins which he shared with three or four others and slept soundly until he was aroused for breakfast He had not undressed and bathing his face he went out at once on the deck Many of the soldiers were up there was a hum of talk and all were looking curiously at the river up which they were steaming They were in the Tennessee having passed in the night the little town of Paducah now an important city at its mouth It was not so broad as the Ohio but it was broad nevertheless and it had the aspect of great depth But here as on the Ohio they seemed to be steaming through the wilderness The banks were densely wooded and the few houses that may have been near were hidden by the trees No human beings appeared upon the banks Dick knew why the men did not come forth to see the ships The southwestern part of the state the old Jackson s Purchase and the region immediately adjacent was almost solidly for the South They would not find here that division of sentiment with the majority inclined to the North that prevailed in the higher regions of Kentucky The country itself was different It was low and the waters that came into the Tennessee flowed more sluggishly But Dick was sure that keen eyes were watching the fleet from the undergrowth and he had no doubt that every vessel had long since been counted and that every detail of the fleet had been carried to the Southern garrisons in the fort The cold was as sharp as on the day before and Dick like the others rejoiced in the hot and abundant breakfast The boats an hour or two later stopped at a little landing and many of the lads would gladly have gone ashore for a few moments risking possible sharpshooters in the woods but not one was allowed to leave the vessels But Dick s steamer lay so close to the one carrying the Pennsylvanians that he could talk across the few intervening feet of water with Warner and Whitley He also took the opportunity to introduce his new friend Pennington of Nebraska Are you the son of John Pennington who lived for a little while at Fort Omaha asked the sergeant Right you are replied the young hunter I m his third son Then you re the third son of a brave man I was in the regular army and often we helped the pioneers against the Indians I remember being in one fight with him against the Sioux on the Platte and in another against the Northern Cheyennes in the Jumping Sand Hills Hurrah cried Pennington I m sorry I can t jump over a section of the Tennessee River and shake hands with you We ll have our chance later said the sergeant At that moment the fleet started again and the boats swung apart Through Dick s earnest solicitation young Pennington was taken out of the ranks and attached to the staff of Colonel Winchester as an orderly He was well educated already a fine campaigner and beyond a doubt he would prove extremely useful They steamed the entire day without interruption Now and then the river narrowed and they ran between high banks The scenery became romantic and beautiful but always wild The river deep at any time was now swollen fifteen feet more by floods on its upper courses and the water always lapped at the base of the forest Dick and Pennington standing side by side saw the second sun set over their voyage and it was as wild and lonely as the first There was a yellow river again and hills covered with a bare forest Heavy gray clouds trooped across the sky and the sun was lost among them before it sank behind the hills in the west Dick and Pennington wrapped in their blankets and overcoats slept upon the deck that night with scores of others strewed about them They were awakened after eleven o clock by a sputter of rifle shots Dick sat up in a daze and heard a bullet hum by his ear Then he heard a powerful voice shouting Down Down all of you It s only some skirmishers in the woods Then a cannon on one of the armor clads thundered and a shell ripped its way through the underbrush on the west bank Many exclamations were uttered by the half awakened lads What is it Has an army attacked us Are we before the fort and under fire Take your foot off me you big buffalo It was Colonel Winchester who had commanded them to keep down but Dick a staff officer knew that it did not apply to him Instead he sprang erect and assisted the senior officers in compelling the others to lie flat upon the decks He saw several flashes of fire in the undergrowth but he had logic enough to know that it could only be a small Southern band Three or four more shells raked the woods and then there was no reply The boats steamed steadily on Only one or two of the young soldiers had been hurt and they but lightly All rolled themselves again in their blankets and coats and went back to sleep The second awakening was about half way between midnight and dawn Something cold was continually dropping on Dick s face and he awoke to find hundreds of sheeted and silent white forms lying motionless upon the deck Snow was falling swiftly out of a dark sky and the fleet was moving slowly In the darkness and stillness the engines throbbed powerfully and the night was lighted fitfully by the showers of sparks that gushed now and then from the smoke stacks Dick thought of rising and brushing the snow from his blankets but he was so warm inside them that he yawned once or twice and went to sleep again When he awoke it was morning again the snow had ceased and the men were brushing it from themselves and the decks The young soldiers as they ate breakfast spoke of the rifle shots that had been fired at them the night before and since little damage had been done they appreciated the small spice of danger The wildness and mystery of their situation appealed to them too They were like explorers penetrating new regions To most of us it s something like the great plains said Pennington to Dick There you seldom know what you re coming to maybe a blizzard maybe a buffalo herd and maybe a band of Indians and you take a pleasure in the uncertainty But I suppose it s not the same to you this being your state I don t know much about Western Kentucky said Dick my part lies to the center and east but anyway our work is to be done in Tennessee Those two forts which I m sure we re after lie in that state And when do you think we ll reach em Tomorrow I suppose The day passed without any interruption to the advance of the fleet although there was occasional firing but not of a serious nature Now and then small bands of Confederate skirmishers sent rifle shots from high points along the bank toward the fleet but they did no damage and the ships steamed steadily on The third night out came and again the young soldiers slept soundly but the next morning soon after breakfast the whole fleet stopped in the middle of the river A thrill of excitement ran through the army when the news filtered from ship to ship that they were now in Tennessee and that Fort Henry which they were to attack was just ahead Nevertheless they seemed to be yet in the wilderness The Tennessee in flood spread its yellow waters through forest and undergrowth and the chill gray sky still gave a uniform somber gray tint to everything Bugles blew in the boats and every soldier began to put himself and his weapons in order The command to make a landing had been given and Commodore Foote was feeling about for a place Dick now realized the enormous advantage of supremacy upon the water Had the Confederates possessed armored ships to meet them the landing of a great army under fire would be impossible but now they chose their own time and went about it unvexed A place was found at last a rude wharf was constructed hastily and the fleet disgorged the army boat by boat Vast quantities of stores and heavy cannon were also brought ashore Despite the cold Dick and his comrades perspired all the morning over their labors and were covered with mud when the camp was finally constructed at some distance back of the Tennessee on the high ground beyond the overflow The transports remained at anchor but the fighting boats were to drop down the stream and attack the fort at noon the next day from the front while the army assailed it at the same time from the rear The detachment of Pennsylvanians was by the side of Colonel Winchester s Kentucky regiment and Colonel Newcomb and his staff messed with Colonel Winchester and his officers There was water everywhere and before they ate they washed the mud off themselves as best they could I suppose said Warner that seventy per cent of our work henceforth will be marching through the mud and thirty per cent of it will be fighting the rebels in Fort Henry I hear that we re not to attack until tomorrow so I mean to sleep on top of a cannon tonight lest I sink out of sight in the mud while I m asleep There s some pleasure said Pennington in knowing that we won t die of thirst You could hardly call this a parched and burning desert But as they worked all the remainder of the day on the construction of the camp they did not care where they slept When their work was over they simply dropped where they stood and slumbered soundly until morning The day opened with a mixture of rain snow and fiercely cold winds Grant s army moved out of its camp to make the attack but it was hampered by the terrible weather and the vast swamp through which its course must lead Colonel Winchester who knew the country better than any other high officer was sent ahead on horseback with a small detachment to examine the way He naturally took Dick and Pennington who were on his staff and by request Colonel Newcomb Major Hertford Warner and Sergeant Whitley went also The whole party numbered about a hundred men Dick and the other lads rejoiced over their mission It was better to ride ahead than to remain with an army that was pulling itself along slowly through the mud The fort itself was only about three miles away and as it stood upon low marshy ground the backwater from the flooded Tennessee had almost surrounded it Despite their horses Winchester s men found their own advance slow They had to make many a twist and turn to avoid marshes and deep water before they came within the sight of the fort and then Dick s watch told him that it was nearly noon the time for the concerted attacks of army and fleet But it was certain now that the army could not get up until several hours later and he wondered what would happen They saw the fort very clearly from their position on a low hill and they saw that the main Confederate force was gathered on a height outside connected with the fort and as well as he could judge the mass seemed to number three or four thousand men What does that mean he asked Colonel Winchester I surmise replied the colonel that Tilghman the Confederate commander is afraid his men may be caught in a trap We know his troops are merely raw militia and he has put them where they can retreat in case of defeat He himself with his trained cannoneers is inside the fort There can be no attack until tomorrow said Colonel Newcomb It will be impossible for General Grant s army to get here in time You are certainly right about the army but I m not so sure that you re right about the attack Look what s coming up the river The fleet exclaimed Newcomb in excitement As sure as I m here it s the fleet advancing to make the attack alone Foote is a daring and energetic man and the failure of the army to company operate will not keep him back Daring and energy seventy per cent at least Dick heard Warner murmur but he paid no more attention to his comrades because all his interest was absorbed in the thrilling spectacle that was about to be unfolded before them The fleet the armor clads the floating batteries and the mortar boats were coming straight toward the fort Colonel Winchester lent Dick his glasses for a moment and the boy plainly saw the great yawning mouths of the mortars Then he passed the glasses back to the colonel but he was able to see well what followed with the naked eye The fleet came on steady but yet silent There was a sudden roar a flash of fire and a shell was discharged from one of the seventeen great guns in the fort But it passed over the boat at which it was aimed and a fountain of water spurted up where it struck The other guns replied rapidly and the fleet with a terrific roar replied It seemed to Dick that the whole earth shook with the confusion Through the smoke and flame he saw the water gushing up in fountains and he also saw earth and masonry flying from the fort It s a fine fight said Colonel Winchester suppressed excitement showing in his tone By George the fleet is coming closer Not a boat has been sunk What a tremendous roar those mortars make Look One of their shells has burst directly on the fort The fleet single handed was certainly making a determined and powerful attack upon the fort which standing upon low marshy ground was not much above the level of the boats and offered a fair target to their great guns Both fort and fleet were now enveloped in a great cloud of smoke but it was repeatedly rent asunder by the flashing of the great guns and rapt by the spectacle from which he could not take his eyes Dick saw that all the vessels of the fleet were still afloat and were crowding closer and closer The artillery kept up a steady crash now punctuated by the hollow boom of the great mortars which threw huge curving shells The smoke floated far up and down the river and the Southern troops on the height adjoining the fort moved back and forth uneasily uncertain what to do Finally they broke and retreated into the forest But General Tilghman the Confederate commander and the heroic gunners inside the fort only sixty in number made the most heroic resistance The armor clad boats were only six hundred yards away now and were pouring upon them a perfect storm of fire Their intrenchments placed too low gave them no advantage over the vessels Shells and solid shot rained upon them Some of the guns were exploded and others dismounted by this terrible shower but they did not yet give up As fast as they could load and fire the little band sent back their own fire at the black hulks that showed through the smoke The fleet will win Dick heard Colonel Winchester murmur Look how magnificently it is handled and it converges closer and closer A fortification located as this one is cannot stand forever a fire like that But the fleet was not escaping unharmed A shell burst the boiler of the Essex killing and wounding twenty nine men Nevertheless the fire of the boats increased rather than diminished and Dick saw that Colonel Winchester s words were bound to come true Inside the fort there was only depression It had been raked through by shells and solid shot Most of the devoted band were wounded and scarcely a gun could be worked Tilghman standing amid his dead and wounded saw that hope was no longer left and gave the signal Dick and his comrades uttered a great shout as they saw the white flag go up over Fort Henry and then the cannonade ceased like a mighty crash of thunder that had rolled suddenly across the sky CHAPTER X BEFORE DONELSON Dick was the first in Colonel Winchester s troop to see the white flag floating over Fort Henry and he uttered a shout of joy Look look he cried the fleet has taken the fort So it has said Colonel Winchester and the army is not here Now I wonder what General Grant will say when he learns that Foote has done the work before he could come But Dick believed that General Grant would find no fault that he would approve instead The feeling was already spreading among the soldiers that this man whose name was recently so new among them cared only for results He was not one to fight over precedence and to feel petty jealousies The smoke of battle was beginning to clear away Officers were landing from the boats to receive the surrender of the fort and Colonel Winchester and his troops galloped rapidly back toward the army which they soon met toiling through swamps and even through shallow overflow toward the Tennessee The men had been hearing for more than an hour the steady booming of the cannon and every face was eager Colonel Winchester rode straight toward a short thickset figure on a stout bay horse near the head of one of the columns This man like all the others was plastered with mud but Colonel Winchester gave him a salute of deep respect What does the cessation of firing mean Colonel asked General Grant It means that Fort Henry has surrendered to the fleet The Southern force which was drawn up outside retreated southward but the fort its guns and immediate defenders are ours Dick saw the faintest smile of satisfaction pass over the face of the General who said Commodore Foote has done well Ride back and tell him that the army is coming up as fast as the nature of the ground will allow In a short time the army was in the fort which had been taken so gallantly by the navy and Grant his generals and Commodore Foote were in anxious consultation Most of the troops were soon camped on the height where the Southern force had stood and there was great exultation but Dick who had now seen so much knew that the high officers considered this only a beginning Across the narrow stretch of land on the parallel river the Cumberland stood the great fort of Donelson Henry was a small affair compared with it It was likely that men who had been stationed at Henry had retreated there and other formidable forces were marching to the same place The Confederate commander Johnston after the destruction of his eastern wing at Mill Spring by Thomas was drawing in his forces and concentrating The news of the loss of Fort Henry would cause him to hasten his operations He was rapidly falling back from his position at Bowling Green in Kentucky Buckner with his division was about to march from that place to join the garrison in Donelson and Floyd with another division would soon be on the way to the same point Floyd had been the United States Secretary of War before secession and the Union men hated him It was said that the great partisan leader Forrest with his cavalry was also at the fort Much of this news was brought in by farmers Union sympathizers and Dick and his comrades as they sat before the fires at the close of the short winter day understood the situation almost as well as the generals Donelson is ninety per cent and Henry only ten per cent said Warner So long as the Johnnies hold Donelson on the Cumberland they can build another fort anywhere they please along the Tennessee and stop our fleet This general of ours has a good notion of the value of time and a swift blow and although I m neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet I predict that he will attack Donelson at once by both land and water How can he attack it by water asked Pennington The distance between them is not great but our ships can t steam overland from the Tennessee to the Cumberland No but they can steam back up the Tennessee into the Ohio thence to the mouth of the Cumberland and down the Cumberland to Donelson It would require only four or five days and it will take that long for the army to invade from the land side Dick had his doubts about the ability of the army and the fleet to company operate Accustomed to the energy of the Southern commanders in the east he did not believe that Grant would be allowed to arrange things as he chose But several days passed and they heard nothing from the Confederates although Donelson was only about twenty miles away Johnston himself brilliant and sagacious was not there nor was his lieutenant Beauregard who had won such a great reputation by his victory at the first Bull Run Dick was just beginning to suspect a truth that later on was to be confirmed fully in his mind Fortune had placed the great generals of the Confederacy with the exception of Albert Sidney Johnston in the east but it had been the good luck of the North to open in the west with its best men Now he saw the energy of Grant the short man of rather insignificant appearance Boats were sent down the Tennessee to meet any reinforcements that might be coming take them back to the Ohio and thence into the Cumberland Fresh supplies of ammunition and food were brought up and it became obvious to Dick that the daring commander meant to attack Donelson even should its garrison outnumber his own besieging force Along a long line from Western Tennessee to Eastern Kentucky there was a mighty stir Johnston had perceived the energy and courage of his opponent He had shared the deep disappointment of all the Southern leaders when Kentucky failed to secede but instead furnished so many thousands of fine troops to the Union army Johnston too had noticed with alarm the tremendous outpouring of rugged men from the states beyond the Ohio and from the far northwest The lumbermen who came down in scores of thousands from Michigan Wisconsin and Minnesota were a stalwart crowd War save for the bullets and shell offered to them no hardships to which they were not used They had often worked for days at a time up to their waists in icy water They had endured thirty degrees below zero without a murmur they had breasted blizzard and cyclone they could live on anything and they could sleep either in forest or on prairie under the open sky It was such men as these including men of his own state and men of the Tennessee mountains whom Johnston who had all the qualities of a great commander had to face The forces against him were greatly superior in number The eastern end of his line had been crushed already at Mill Spring the extreme western end had suffered a severe blow at Fort Henry but Jefferson Davis and the Government at Richmond expected everything of him And he manfully strove to do everything There was a mighty marching of men some news of which came through to Dick and his comrades with Grant Johnston with his main army the very flower of the western South fell back from Bowling Green in Kentucky toward Nashville the capital of Tennessee But Buckner with his division was sent from Bowling Green to help defend Donelson against the threatened attack by Grant and he arrived there six days after the fall of Henry On the way were the troops of Floyd defeated in West Virginia but afterwards sent westward Floyd was at the head of them Forrest the great cavalry leader was also there with his horsemen The fort was crowded with defenders but the slack Pillow did not yet send forward anybody to see what Grant was doing although he was only twenty miles away All eyes were now turned upon the west The center of action had suddenly shifted from Kentucky to Tennessee The telegraph was young yet but it was busy It carried many varying reports to the cities North and South The name of this new man Grant spelled trouble People were beginning to talk much about him and already some suspected that there was more in the back of his head than in those of far better known and far more pretentious northern generals in the east None at least could dispute the fact that he was now the one whom everybody was watching But the Southern people few of whom knew the disparity of numbers had the fullest confidence in the brilliant Johnston He was more than twenty years older than his antagonist but his years had brought only experience and many triumphs not weakness of either mind or body At his right hand was the swarthy and confident Beauregard great with the prestige of Bull Run and Hardee Bragg Breckinridge and Polk And there were many brilliant colonels too foremost among whom was George Kenton A tremor passed through the North when it was learned that Grant intended to plunge into the winter forest cross the Cumberland and lay siege to Donelson He was going beyond the plans of his superior Halleck at saint Louis He was too daring he would lose his army away down there in the Confederacy But others remembered his successes particularly at Belmont and Fort Henry They said that nothing could be won in war without risk and they spoke of his daring and decision They recalled too that he was master upon the waters that there was no Southern fleet to face his as it sailed up the Southern rivers The telegraph was already announcing that the gunboats which had been handled with such skill and courage would be in the Cumberland ready to company operate with Grant when he should move on Donelson Buell was moving also to form another link in the steel chain that was intended to bind the Confederacy in the west Here again the mastery of the rivers was of supreme value to the North Buell embarked his army on boats on Green River in the very heart of Kentucky descended that river to the Ohio passing down the latter to Smithland where the Cumberland coming up from the south entered it and met another convoy destined for the huge invasion But the first convoy had come also by boat from another direction and from points far distant There were fresh regiments of farmers and pioneers from Iowa Nebraska and Minnesota They were all eager full of enthusiasm anxious to be led against the enemy and confident of triumph Grant and his army meanwhile lying in the bleak forest beside the Tennessee knew little of what was being said of them in the great world without All their thoughts were of Donelson across there on the other river and the men asked to be led against it Inured to the hardships of border life there was little sickness among them despite the winter and the overflow of the flooded streams They gathered the dead wood that littered the forest built numerous fires and waited as patiently as they could for the word to march The Pennsylvanians were still camped with the Kentucky regiment to which Dick now belonged and the fifth evening after the capture of Henry he and his friends sat by one of the big fires We ll advance either tomorrow or the next day said Warner The chances are at least ninety per cent in favor of my statement What do you say sergeant I d raise the ninety per cent to one hundred replied Whitley We are all ready an as you ve observed gentlemen General Grant is a man who acts The Johnnies evidently expect us said Pennington Our scouts have seen their cavalry in the woods watching us but only in the last day or two It s strange that they didn t begin it earlier They say that General Pillow who commands them isn t of much force said Dick Well it looks like it said Warner but from what we hear he ll have quite an army at Donelson General Grant will have his work cut out for him The Johnnies besides having their fort can go into battle with just about as many men as we have unless he waits for reinforcements which I am quite certain he isn t going to do That evening several bags of mail were brought to the camp on a small steamer which had come on three rivers the Green the Ohio and the Tennessee and Dick to his great surprise and delight received a letter from his mother He had written several letters himself but he had no way of knowing until now that any of them had reached her Only one had succeeded in getting through and that had been written from Cairo My dearest son she wrote I am full of joy to know that you have reached Cairo in safety and in health though I dread the great expedition upon which you say you are going I hear in Pendleton many reports about General Grant They say that he does not spare his men The Southern sympathizers here say that he is pitiless and cares not how many thousands of his own soldiers he may sacrifice if he only gains his aim But of that I know not I know it is a characteristic of our poor human nature to absolve one s own side and to accuse those on the other side I was in Pendleton this morning and the reports are thick thick from both Northerners and Southerners that the armies are moving forward to a great battle They have all marched south of us and I do not know either whether these reports are true or false though I fear that they are true Your uncle Colonel Kenton is with General Johnston and I hear is one of his most trusted officers Colonel Kenton is a good man and it would be one of the terrible tragedies of war if you and he were to meet on the field in this great battle which so many hear is coming I am very glad that you are now in the regiment of Colonel Winchester and that you are an aide on his staff It is best to be with one s own people I have known Colonel Winchester a long time and he has all the qualities that make a man brave and gentle I hope that you and he will become the best of friends There was much more in the letter but it was only the little details that concern mother and son Dick was sitting by the fire when he read it Then he read it a second time and a third time folded it very carefully and put it in the pocket in which he had carried the dispatch from General Thomas Colonel Winchester was sitting near him and Dick noticed again what a fine trim man he was Although a little over forty his figure was still slender and he had an abundant head of thick vital hair His whole effect was that of youth His glance met Dick s and he smiled A letter from home he said Yes sir from mother She writes to me that she is glad I am in your command She speaks very highly of you sir and my mother is a woman of uncommon penetration A faint red tinted the tanned cheeks of the colonel Dick thought it was merely the reflection of the fire Would you care for me to read what she says about you asked Dick If you don t mind Dick drew out the letter again and read the paragraph Your mother is a very fine woman said Colonel Winchester You re right sir said Dick with enthusiasm Colonel Winchester said no more but rose presently and went to the tent of General Grant where a conference of officers was to be held Dick remained by the fire where Warner and Pennington soon joined him Our scouts have exchanged some shots with the enemy said Pennington and they have taken one or two prisoners bold fellows who say they re going to lick the spots off us They say they have a big army at Donelson and they re afraid of nothing except that Grant won t come on Between ourselves the Johnny Rebs are getting ready for us It was Dick s opinion too that the Southern troops were making great preparations to meet them but like the others he was feeling the strong hand on the reins He did not notice here the doubt and uncertainty that had reigned at Washington before the advance on Bull Run in Grant s army were order and precision and with perfect confidence in his commander he rolled himself in his blankets that night and went to sleep The order to advance did not come the next morning and Dick for a few moments thought it might not come at all The reports from Donelson were of a formidable nature and Grant s own army was not provided for a winter campaign It had few wagons for food and ammunition and some of the regiments from the northwest cherishing the delusion that winter in Tennessee was not cold were not provided with warm clothing and sufficient blankets But Warner abated his confidence not one jot The chance of our moving against Donelson is one hundred per cent he said I passed the General today and his lips were shut tight together which means a resolve to do at all costs what one has intended to do I still admit that the prophets and the sons of prophets live no more but I predict with absolute certainty that we will move in the morning The Vermonter s faith was justified The army being put in thorough trim started at dawn upon its momentous march Wintry fogs were rising from the great river and the submerged lowlands and the air was full of raw penetrating chill An abundant breakfast was served to everybody and then with warmth and courage the lads of the west and northwest marched forward with eagerness to an undertaking which they knew would be far greater than the capture of Fort Henry Dick and Pennington as staff officers were mounted although the horses that had been furnished to them were not much more than ponies Warner rode with Colonel Newcomb and Major Hertford who led the slender Pennsylvania detachment beside the Kentucky regiment Thus the army emerged from its camp and began the march toward the Cumberland It was now about fifteen thousand strong but it expected reinforcements and its fleet held the command of the rivers As they entered the leafless forest Dick saw ahead of them perhaps a quarter of a mile away a numerous band of horsemen wearing faded Confederate gray They were the cavalry of Forrest but they were too few to stay the Union advances There was a scattered firing of rifles but the heavy brigades of Grant moved steadily on and pushed them out of the way Forrest could do no more than gallop back to the fort with his men and report that the enemy was coming at last Those fellows ride well said Pennington as the last of Forrest s cavalrymen passed out of sight and if we were not in such strong force I fancy they would sting us pretty hard We ll see more of em said Dick This is the enemy s country and we needn t think that we re going to march as easy as you please from one victory to another Maybe not said Pennington but I ll be glad when we get Donelson I ve been hearing so much about that place that I m growing real curious Their march across the woods suffered no further interruption Sometimes they saw Confederate cavalrymen at a distance in front but they did not try to impede Grant s advance When the sun was well down in the west the vanguard of the army came within sight of the fortress that stood by the Cumberland At that very moment the troops under Floyd just arrived were crossing the river to join the garrison in the fortress Dick looked upon extensive fortifications a large fort a redoubt upon slightly higher ground other batteries at the water s edge powerful batteries upon a semi circular hill which could command the river for a long distance and around all of these extensive works several miles in length including a deep creek on the north Inside the works was the little town of Dover and they were defended by fifteen thousand men as many as Grant had without When Dick beheld this formidable position bristling with cannon rifles and bayonets his heart sank within him How could one army defeat another as numerous as itself inside powerful intrenchments and in its own country Nor could they prevent Southern reinforcements from reaching the other side of the river and crossing to the fort under the shelter of its numerous great guns He was yet to learn the truth or at least the partial truth of Napoleon s famous saying that in war an army is nothing a man is everything The army to which he belonged was led by a man of clear vision and undaunted resolution The chief commander inside the fort had neither and his men were shaken already by the news of Fort Henry exaggerated in the telling But after the first sinking of the heart Dick felt an extraordinary thrill Sensitive and imaginative he was conscious even at the moment that he looked in the face of mighty events The things of the minute did not always appeal to him with the greatest force He had instead the foreseeing mind and the meaning of that vast panorama of fortress hills river and forest did not escape him Well Dick what do you think of it asked Pennington We ve got our work cut out for us and if I didn t know General Grant I d say that we re engaged in a mighty rash undertaking Just what I d say also And we need that fleet bad too Dick I d like to see the smoke of its funnels as the boats come steaming up the Cumberland Dick knew that the fleet was needed not alone for encouragement and fighting help but to supply an even greater want Grant s army was short of both food and ammunition The afternoon had turned warm and many of the northwestern lads still clinging to their illusions about the climate of the lower Mississippi Valley had dropped their blankets Now with the setting sun the raw penetrating chill was coming back and they shivered in every bone But the Union army in spite of everything gradually spread out and enfolded the whole fortress save on the northern side where Hickman Creek flowed deep and impassable The general s own headquarters were due west of Fort Donelson and Colonel Winchester s Kentucky regiment was stationed close by Low campfires burned along the long line of the Northern army and Dick and others who sat beside him saw many lights inside the great enclosure held by the South An occasional report was heard but it was only the pickets exchanging shots at long range and without hurt Dick and Pennington wrapped their blankets about them and sat with their backs against a log ready for any command from Colonel Winchester Now and then they were sent with orders because there was much moving to and fro the placing of men in position and the bringing up of cannon Thus the night moved slowly on raw cold and dark Mists and fogs rose from the Cumberland as they had risen from the Tennessee This too was a great river Dick was glad when the last of his errands was done and he could come back to the fire and rest his back once more against the log The fire was only a bed of coals now but they gave out much grateful heat Dick could see General Grant s tent from where he sat Officers of high rank were still entering it or leaving it and he was quite sure that they were planning an attack on the morrow But the idea of an assault did not greatly move him now He was too tired and sleepy to have more than a vague impression of anything He saw the coals glowing before him and then he did not see them He had gone sound asleep in an instant The next morning was gray and troubled with heavy clouds rolling across the sky The rising sun was blurred by them and as the men ate their breakfasts some of the great guns from the fort began to fire at the presumptuous besieger The heavy reports rolled sullenly over the desolate forests but the Northern cannon did not yet reply The Southern fire was doing no damage It was merely a threat a menace to those who should dare the assault Colonel Winchester signalled to Dick and Pennington and mounting their horses they rode with him to the crest of the highest adjacent hill Presently General Grant came and with him were the generals McClernand and Smith Colonel Newcomb also arrived attended by Warner The high officers examined the fort a long time through their glasses but Dick noticed that at times they watched the river He knew they were looking there for the black plumes of smoke which should mark the coming of the steamers out of the Ohio But nothing showed on the surface of the Cumberland The river dark gray under lowering clouds flowed placidly on washing the base of Fort Donelson At intervals of a minute or two there was a flash of fire from the fort and the menacing boom of the cannon rolled through the desolate forest Now and then a gun from one of the Northern batteries replied But it was as yet a desultory battle with much noise and little danger merely a threat of what was to come After a while Colonel Winchester wrote something on a slip of paper Take this to our lieutenant colonel he said It is an order for the regiment to hold itself in complete readiness although no action may come for some time Then return here at once Dick rode back swiftly but on his way he suddenly bent over his saddle bow A shell from the fort screamed over his head in such a menacing fashion that it seemed to be only a few inches from him But it passed on leaving him unharmed and burst three hundred yards away Dick instantly straightened up in the saddle looked around breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that no one had noticed his sudden bow and galloped on with the order The lieutenant colonel read it and nodded Then Dick rode back to the hill where the generals were yet watching in vain for those black plumes of smoke on the Cumberland They left the hill at last and the generals went to their brigades General Grant was smoking a cigar and his face was impassive We re to open soon with the artillery said Colonel Winchester to Dick General Grant means to push things The desultory firing those warning guns ceased entirely and for a while both armies stood in almost complete silence Then a Northern battery on the right opened with a tremendous crash and the battle for Donelson had begun A Southern battery replied at once and the firing spread along the whole vast curve Shells and solid shot whistled through the air but the troops back of the guns crouched in hasty entrenchments and waited The great artillery combat went on for some time To many of the lads on either side it seemed for hours Then the guns on the Northern side ceased suddenly bugles sounded and the regiments drawn up in line rushed at the outer fortifications Colonel Winchester and his staff had dismounted but Dick and Pennington keeping by the colonel s side drew their swords and rushed on shouting The Southerners inside the fort fired their cannon as fast as they could now and at closer range opened with the rifles Dick heard once again that terrible shrieking of metal so close to his ears and then he heard too cries of pain Many of the young soldiers behind him were falling The fire now grew so hot and deadly that the Union regiments were forced to give ground It was evident that they could not carry the formidable earthworks but on the right where Dick s regiment charged and just above the little town of Dover they pressed in far enough to secure some hills that protected them from the fire of the enemy and from which Southern cannon and rifles could not drive them Then at the order of Grant his troops withdrew elsewhere and the battle of the day ceased But on the low hills above Dover which they had taken the Union regiments held their ground and from their position the Northern cannon could threaten the interior of the Southern lines Dick s regiment stood here and beside them were the few companies of Pennsylvanians so far from their native state Neither Dick nor Pennington was wounded Warner had a bandaged arm but the wound was so slight that it would not incapacitate him The officers were unhurt They ve driven our army back said Pennington and it was not so hard for them to do it either How can we ever defeat an army as large as our own inside powerful works But Dick was learning fast and he had a keen eye We have not failed utterly he said Don t you see that we have here a projection into the enemy s lines and if those reinforcements come it will be thrust further and further I tell you that general of ours is a bull dog He will never let go Yet there was little but gloom in the Union camp The short winter day somber and heavy with clouds was drawing to a close The field upon which the assault had taken place was within the sweep of the Southern guns Some of the Northern wounded had crawled away or had been carried to their own camp but others and the numerous dead still lay upon the ground The cold increased The Southern winter is subject to violent changes The clouds which had floated up without ceasing were massing heavily Now the young troops regretted bitterly the blankets that they had dropped on the way or left at Fort Henry Detachments were sent back to regain as many as possible but long before they could return a sharp wind with an edge of ice sprang up the clouds opened and great flakes poured down driven into the eyes of the soldiers by the wind The situation was enough to cause the stoutest heart to weaken but the unflinching Grant held on The Confederate army within the works was sheltered at least in part but his own outside and with the desolate forest rimming it around lay exposed fully to the storm Dick at intervals saw the short thickset figure of the commander passing among the men and giving them orders or encouragement Once he saw his face clearly The lips were pressed tightly together and the whole countenance expressed the grimmest determination Dick was confirmed anew in his belief that the chief would never turn back The spectacle nevertheless was appalling The snow drove harder and harder It was not merely a passing shower of flakes It was a storm The snow soon lay upon the ground an inch deep then three inches then four and still it gained Through the darkness and the storm the Southern cannon crashed at intervals sending shells at random into the Union camp or over it There was full need then for the indomitable spirit of Grant and those around him to encourage anew the thousands of boys who had so lately left the farms or the lumber yards Dick and his comrades careless of the risk searched over the battlefield for the wounded who were yet there They carried lanterns but the darkness was so great and the snow drove so hard and lay so deep that they knew many would never be found Back beyond the range of the fort s cannon men were building fires with what wood they could secure from the forest All the tents they had were set up and the men tried to cook food and make coffee in order that some degree of warmth and cheer might be provided for the army beset so sorely The snow after a while slackening somewhat was succeeded by cold much greater than ever The shivering men bent over the fires and lamented anew the discarded blankets Dick did not sleep an instant that terrible night He could not He Pennington and Warner relieved from staff service worked all through the cold and darkness helping the wounded and seeking wood for the fires And with them always was the wise Sergeant Whitley to whom although inferior in rank they turned often and willingly for guidance and advice It s an awful situation said Pennington I knew that war would furnish horrors but I didn t expect anything like this But General Grant will never retreat said Dick I feel it in every bone of me I ve seen his face tonight No he won t said the experienced sergeant because he s making every preparation to stay An remember mister Pennington that while this is pretty bad worse can happen Remember too that while we can stand this we can also stand whatever worse may come It s goin to be a fight to a finish Far in the night the occasional guns from the Southern fortress ceased The snow was falling no longer but it lay very deep on the ground and the cold was at its height Along a line of miles the fires burned and the men crowded about them But Dick who had been working on the snowy plain that was the battlefield and who had heard many moans there now heard none All who lay in that space were sleeping the common sleep of death their bodies frozen stiff and hard under the snow Dick sitting by one of the fires saw the cold dawn come and in those chill hours of nervous exhaustion he lost hope for a moment or two How could anybody no matter how resolute maintain a siege without ammunition and without food But he spoke cheerfully to Pennington and Warner who had slept a little and who were just awakening The pale and wintry sun showed the defiant Stars and Bars floating over Donelson and Dick from his hill could see men moving inside the earthworks Certainly the Southern flags had a right to wave defiance at the besieging army which was now slowly and painfully rising from the snow and lighting the fires anew Well what s the program today Dick asked Pennington I don t know but it s quite certain that we won t attempt another assault It s hopeless That s true said Warner who was standing by but we hark what was that The boom of a cannon echoed over the fort and forest and then another and another To the northward they saw thin black spires of smoke under the horizon It s the fleet It s the fleet cried Warner joyously coming up the Cumberland to our help Oh you men of Donelson we re around you now and you ll never shake us off Again came the crash of great guns from the fleet and the crash of the Southern water batteries replying CHAPTER XI THE SOUTHERN ATTACK The excitement in the Union army was intense and joyous The cheers rolled like volleys among these farmer lads of the West Dick Warner and Pennington stood up and shouted with the rest I should judge that our chances of success have increased at least fifty yes sixty per cent said Warner As we have remarked before this control of the water is a mighty thing We fight the Johnnie Rebs for the land but we have the water already Look at those gunboats will you Aren t they the sauciest little things you ever saw Once more the navy was showing as it has always shown throughout its career its daring and brilliant qualities Foote the commodore although he had had no time to repair his four small fighting boats after the encounter with Fort Henry steamed straight up the river and engaged the concentric fire from the great guns of the Southern batteries which opened upon him with a tremendous crash The boys watched the duel with amazement They did not believe that small vessels could live under such fire but live they did Great columns of smoke floated over them and hid them at times from the watchers but when the smoke lifted a little or was split apart by the shattering fire of the guns the black hulls of the gunboats always reappeared and now they were not more than three or four hundred yards from Donelson I take it that this is a coverin fire said Sergeant Whitley who stood by Four little vessels could not expect to reduce such a powerful fortress as Donelson It s not Fort Henry that they re fightin now The chances are at least ninety five per cent in favor of your supposition said Warner The sergeant s theory in fact was absolutely correct Further down the river the transports were unloading regiment after regiment of fresh troops and vast supplies of ammunition and provisions Soon five thousand men were formed in line and marched to Grant s relief while long lines of wagons brought up the stores so badly needed Now the stern and silent general was able to make the investment complete but the fiery little fleet did not cease to push the attack There was a time when it seemed that the gunboats would be able to pass the fortress and rake it from a point up the river Many of the guns in the water batteries had been silenced but the final achievement was too great for so small a force The rudder of one of Foote s gunboats was shot away the wheel of another soon went the same way and both drifted helplessly down the stream The other two then retreated and the fire of both fort and fleet ceased But there was joy in the Union camp The soldiers had an abundance of food now and soon the long ring of fires showed that they were preparing it Their forces had been increased a third and there was a fresh outburst of courage and vigor But Grant ordered no more attacks at present After the men had eaten and rested a little picks and spades were swung along a line miles in length He was fortifying his own position and it was evident to his men that he meant to stay there until he won or was destroyed Dick was conscious once more of a sanguine thrill Like the others he felt the strong hand over him and the certainty that they were led with judgment and decision made him believe that all things were possible Yet the work of fortifying continued but a little while The men were exhausted by cold and fatigue and were compelled to lay down their tools The fires were built anew and they hovered about them for shelter and rest The wan twilight showed the close of the wintry day and with the increasing chill a part of Dick s sanguine feeling departed The gallant little fleet although it had brought fresh men and supplies and had protected their landing had been driven back The investment of the fort was complete only on one side of the river and steamers coming up the Cumberland from Nashville might yet take off the garrison in safety Then the work of the silent general all their hardship and fighting would be at least in part a failure The Vermont youth who seemed to be always of the same temper neither very high nor very low noticed his change of expression Don t let your hopes decrease Dick he said Remember that at least twenty per cent of the decline is due to the darkness and inaction In the morning when the light comes once more and we re up and doing again you ll get back all the twenty per cent you re losing now It s not to be all inaction with you boys tonight even said Colonel Winchester who overheard his closing words I want you three to go with me on a tour of inspection or rather scouting duty It may please you to know that it is the special wish of General Grant Aware that I had some knowledge of the country he has detailed me for the duty and I choose you as my assistants I m sure that the skill and danger such a task requires will make you all the more eager for it The three youths responded quickly and with zeal and Sergeant Whitley when he was chosen too nodded in silent gratitude The night was dark overcast with clouds and in an hour Colonel Winchester with his four departed upon his perilous mission He was to secure information in regard to the Southern army and to do that they were to go very near the Southern lines if not actually inside them Such an attempt would be hazardous in the extreme in the face of a vigilant watch but on the other hand they would be aided by the fact that both North and South were of like blood and language Even more many of those in the opposing camps came from the same localities and often were of kin Dick s regiment had been stationed at the southern end of the line near the little town of Dover but they now advanced northward and westward marching for a long time along their inner line It was Colonel Winchester s intention to reach Hickman Creek which formed their northern barrier creep in the fringe of bushes on its banks and then approach the fort When they reached the desired point the night was well advanced and yet dark with the somber clouds hanging over river and fort and field of battle The wind blew out of the northwest sharp and intensely cold The snow crunched under their feet But the four had wrapped themselves in heavy overcoats and they were so engrossed in their mission that neither wind nor snow was anything to them They passed along the bank of the creek keeping well within the shadow of the bushes leaving behind them the last outpost of the Union army and then slowly drew near to the fort They saw before them many lights burning in the darkness and at last they discerned dim figures walking back and forth Dick knew that these were the Southern sentinels The four went a little nearer and then crouched down in the snow among some low bushes Now they saw the Southern sentinels more distinctly Some in fact were silhouetted sharply as they passed before the Southern fires Northern sharpshooters could have crept up and picked off many of them as the Southern sharpshooters in turn might have served many of the Northern watchers but in this mighty war there was little of such useless and merciless enterprise The men soon ceased to have personal animosity and in the nights between the great battles when the armies yet lay face to face the hostile pickets would often exchange gossip and tobacco Even in a conflict waged so long and with such desperation the essential kindliness of human nature would assert itself The four as they skirted the Southern line noticed no signs of further preparations by the Confederates No men were throwing up earthworks or digging trenches As well as they could surmise the garrison like the besieging army was seeking shelter and rest and from this fact the keen mind of Colonel Arthur Winchester divined that the defense was confused and headless Colonel Winchester knew most of the leaders within Donelson He knew that Pillow was not of a strong and decided nature Nor was Floyd who would rank first of great military capacity Buckner had talent and he had served gallantly in the Mexican War but he could not prevail over the others The fame of Forrest the Tennessee mountaineer was already spreading but a cavalryman could do little for the defense of a fort besieged by twenty thousand well equipped men led by a general of unexcelled resolution All that Colonel Winchester surmised was true Inside the fort confusion and doubt reigned The fleeing garrison from Fort Henry had brought exaggerated reports of Grant s army Very few of the thousands of young troops had ever been in battle before They too suffered though in a less degree from cold and fatigue but many were wounded Pillow and Floyd who had just arrived with his troops talked of one thing and then another Floyd who might have sent word to his valiant and able chief Johnston did not take the trouble or forgot to inform him of his position Buckner wanted to attack Grant the next morning with the full Southern strength and a comrade of his on old battlefields Colonel George Kenton seconded him ably The black bearded Forrest strode back and forth striking the tops of his riding boots with a small riding whip and saying ungrammatically but tersely and emphatically We mustn t stay here like hogs in a pen We must git at em with all our men afore they can git at us The illiterate mountaineer and stock driver had evolved exactly the same principle of war that Napoleon used But Colonel Winchester and his comrades could only guess at what was going on in Donelson and a guess always remains to be proved So they must continue their perilous quest Once they were hailed by a Southern sentinel but Colonel Winchester replied promptly that they belonged to Buckner s Kentuckians and had been sent out to examine the Union camp He passed it off with such boldness and decision that they were gone before the picket had time to express a doubt But as they came toward the center of the line and drew nearer to the fort itself they met another picket who was either more watchful or more acute He hailed them at a range of forty or fifty yards and when Colonel Winchester made the same reply he ordered them to halt and give the countersign When no answer came he fired instantly at the tall figure of Colonel Winchester and uttered a loud cry of Yankees Luckily the dim light was tricky and his bullet merely clipped the colonel s hair But there was nothing for the four to do now save to run with all their undignified might for their own camp Come on lads shouted Colonel Winchester Our scouting is over for the time The region behind them contained patches of scrub oaks and bushes and with their aid and that of the darkness it was not difficult to escape but Dick while running just behind the others stepped in a hole and fell The snow and the dead leaves hid the sound of his fall and the others did not notice it As he looked up he saw their dim forms disappearing among the bushes He rose to his own feet but uttered a little cry as a ligament in his ankle sent a warning throb of pain through his body It was not a wrench only a bruise and as he stretched his ankle a few times the soreness went away But the last sound made by the retreating footsteps of his comrades had died and their place had been taken by those of his pursuers who were now drawing very near Dick had no intention of being captured and turning off at a right angle he dropped into a gully which he encountered among some bushes The gully was about four feet deep and half full of snow Dick threw himself full length on his side and sank down in the snow until he was nearly covered There he lay panting hard for a few moments but quite sure that he was safe from discovery Only a long and most minute search would be likely to reveal the dark line in the snow beneath the overhanging bushes Dick s heart presently resumed its normal beat and then he heard the sound of voices and footsteps Some one said They went this way sir but they were running pretty fast They d good cause to run said a brusque voice You d a done it too if you d expected to have the bullets of a whole army barkin at your heels The footsteps came nearer crunching on the snow which lay deep there among the bushes They could not be more than a dozen feet away but Dick quivered only a little Buried as he was and with the hanging bushes over him he was still confident that no one could see him He raised himself the least bit and looking through the boughs saw a tanned and dark face under the broad brim of a Confederate hat Just then some one said We might have trailed em general but the snow an the earth have already been tramped all up by the army They re not wuth huntin long anyway said the same brusque voice A few Yankees prowlin about in the night can t do us much harm It s hard fightin that ll settle our quarrel General Forrest came a little closer and Dick from his concealment in the snow surmising his identity saw him clearly although himself unseen He was fascinated by the stern dark countenance The face of the unlettered mountaineer was cut sharp and clear and he had the look of one who knew and commanded In war he was a natural leader of men and he had already assumed the position Don t you agree with me colonel he said over his shoulder to some one I think you re right as usual General Forrest replied a voice with a cultivated intonation and Dick started violently in his bed of snow because he instantly recognized the voice as that of his uncle Colonel George Kenton Harry s father A moment later Colonel Kenton himself stood where the moonlight fell upon his face Dick saw that he was worn and thin but his face had the strong and resolute look characteristic of those descended from Henry Ware the great borderer You know general that I endorse all your views continued Colonel Kenton We are unfortunate here in having a division of counsels while the Yankees have a single and strong head We have underrated this man Grant Look how he surprised us and took Henry Look how he hangs on here We ve beaten him on land and we ve driven back his fleet but he hangs on To my mind he has no notion of retreating He ll keep on pounding us as long as we are here That s his way an it ought to be the way of every general growled Forrest You cut down a tree by keepin on cuttin out chips with an axe an you smash up an army by hittin an hittin an keepin on hittin We ought to charge right out of our works an jump on the Yankees with all our stren th The two walked on followed by the soldiers who had come with them and Dick heard no more But he was too cautious to stir for a long while He lay there until the cold began to make its way through his boots and heavy overcoat Then he rose carefully brushed off the snow and began his retreat toward the Union lines Four or five hundred yards further on and he met Colonel Winchester and his own comrades come back to search for him They welcomed him joyfully We did not miss you until we were nearly to our own pickets said the colonel Then we concluded that you had fallen and had been taken by the enemy but we intended to see if we could find you We ve been hovering about here for some time Dick told what he had seen and heard and the colonel considered it of much importance I judge from what you heard that they will attack us he said Buckner and Forrest will be strongly for it and they re likely to have their way We must report at once to General Grant The Southern attack had been planned for the next morning but it did not come then Pillow for reasons unknown decided to delay another day and his fiery subordinates could do nothing but chafe and wait Dick spent most of the day carrying orders for his chief and the continuous action steadied his nerves As he passed from point to point he saw that the Union army itself was far from ready It was a difficult task to get twenty thousand raw farmer youths in proper position They moved about often without cohesion and sometimes without understanding their orders Great gaps remained in the line and a daring and skilful foe might cut the besieging force asunder But Grant had put his heavy guns in place and throughout the day he maintained a slow but steady fire upon the fort Great shells and solid shot curved and fell upon Donelson Grant did not know what damage they were doing but he shrewdly calculated that they would unsteady the nerves of the raw troops within These farmer boys as they heard the unceasing menace of the big guns would double the numbers of their foe and attribute to him an unrelaxing energy Thus another gray day of winter wore away and the two forces drew a little nearer to each other Far away the rival Presidents at Washington and Richmond were wondering what was happening to their armies in the dark wilderness of Western Tennessee The night was more quiet than the one that had just gone before The booming of the cannon as regular as the tolling of funeral bells had ceased with the darkness but in its place the fierce winter wind had begun to blow again Dick relaxed and weary after his day s work hovered over one of the fires and was grateful for the warmth He had trodden miles through slush and snow and frozen earth and he was plastered to the waist with frozen mud which now began to soften and fall off before the coals Warner who had been on active duty too also sank to rest with a sigh of relief It s battle tomorrow Dick he said and I don t care As it didn t come off today the chances are at least eighty per cent that it will happen the next day You say that when you were lying in the snow last night Dick you saw your uncle and that he s a colonel in the rebel army It s queer You re wrong George it isn t queer We re on opposite sides serving at the same place and it s natural that we should meet some time or other Oh I tell you you fellows from the New England and the other Northern States don t appreciate the sacrifices that we of the border states make for the Union Up there you are safe from invasion Your houses are not on the battlefields You are all on one side You don t have to fight against your own kind the people you hold most dear And when the war is over whether we win or lose you ll go back to unravaged regions You wrong me there Dick I have thought of it It s the people of the border whether North or South who pay the biggest price We risk our lives but you risk your lives also and everything else too Dick wrapped himself in a heavy blanket pillowed his head on a log before one of the fires and dozed a while His nerves had been tried too hard to permit of easy sleep He awoke now and then and over a wide area saw the sinking fires and the moving forms of men He felt that a sense of uneasiness pervaded the officers He knew that many of them considered their forces inadequate for the siege of a fortress defended by a large army but he felt with the sincerity of conviction also that Grant would never withdraw He heard from Colonel Winchester about midnight in one of his wakeful intervals that General Grant was going down the river to see Commodore Foote The brave leader of the fleet had been wounded severely in the last fight with the fort and the general wished to confer with him about the plan of operations But Dick heard only vaguely The statement made no impression upon him at that time Yet he was conscious that the feeling of uneasiness still pervaded the officers He noticed it in Colonel Winchester s tone and he noticed it too in the voices of Colonel Newcomb and Major Hertford who came presently to confer with Winchester But the boy fell into his doze again while they were talking Warner and Pennington who had done less arduous duties were sound asleep near him the low flames now and then throwing a red light on their tanned faces It seemed to him that it was about half way between midnight and morning and the hum and murmur had sunk to a mere minor note But his sleepy eyes still saw the dim forms of men passing about and then he fell into his uneasy doze again When he awoke once more it was misty and dark but he felt that the dawn was near In the east a faint tint of silver showed through the clouds and vapors Heavy banks of fog were rising from the Cumberland and the flooded marshes The earth began to soften as if unlocking from the hard frost of the night Colonel Winchester stood near him and his position showed that he was intensely awake He was bent slightly forward and every nerve and muscle was strained as if he were eager to see and hear something which he knew was there but which he could not yet either see or hear Dick threw off his blanket and sprang to his feet At the same moment Colonel Winchester motioned him to awaken Warner and Pennington which he did at once in speed and silence That tint of silver the lining of the fogs and vapors shone more clearly through and spread across the East Dick knew now that the dawn was at hand The loud but mellow notes of a trumpet came from a distant point toward Donelson and then others to right and left joined and sang the same mellow song But it lasted only for a minute Then it was lost in the rapid crackle of rifles which spread like a running fire along a front of miles The sun in the east swung clear of the earth its beams shooting a way through fogs and vapors The dawn had come and the attack had come with it The Southerners ready at last were rushing from their fort and works and with all the valor and fire that distinguished them upon countless occasions they were hurling themselves upon their enemy The fortress poured out regiment after regiment Chafing so long upon the defense Southern youth was now at its best Attacking not attacked the farmer lads felt the spirit of battle blaze high in their breasts The long terrible rebel yell destined to be heard upon so many a desperate field fierce upon its lower note fierce upon its higher note as fierce as ever upon its dying note and coming back in echoes still as fierce swelled over forest and fort marsh and river The crackling fire of the pickets ceased They had been driven back in a few moments upon the army but the whole regiment of Colonel Winchester was now up rifle in hand and on either side of it other regiments steadied themselves also to receive the living torrent The little band of Pennsylvanians were on the left of the Kentuckians and were practically a part of them Colonel Newcomb and Major Hertford stood amid their men encouraging them to receive the shock But Dick had time for only a glance at these old comrades of his The Southern wave crested with fire and steel was rolling swiftly upon them and as the Southern troops rushed on they began to fire as fast as they could pull the trigger fire and pull again Bullets in sheets struck in the Union ranks Hundreds of men went down Dick heard the thud of lead and steel on flesh and the sudden cries of those who were struck It needs no small courage to hold fast against more than ten thousand men rushing forward at full speed and bent upon victory or death Dick felt all the pulses in his temples beating hard and he had a horrible impulse to break and run but pride kept him firm As an officer he had a small sword and snatching it out he waved it while at the same time he shouted to the men to meet the charge The Union troops returned the fire Thousands of bullets were sent against the ranks of the rushing enemy The gunners sprang to their guns and the deep roar of the cannon rose above the crash of the small arms But the Southern troops the rebel yell still rolling through the woods came on at full speed and struck the Union front It seemed to Dick that he was conscious of an actual physical shock Tanned faces and gleaming eyes were almost against his own He looked into the muzzles of rifles and he saw the morning sun flashing along the edges of bayonets But the regiment although torn by bullets did not give ground The charge shivered against them and the Southern troops fell back Yet it was only for a moment They came again to be driven back as before and then once more they charged while their resolute foe swung forward to meet them rank to rank Dick was not conscious of much except that he shouted continuously to the men to stand firm and wondered now and then why he had not been hit The Union men and their enemy were reeling back and forth neither winning neither losing while the thunder of battle along a long and curving front beat heavily on the drums of every ear The smoke low down was scattered by the cannon and rifles but above it gathered in a great cloud that seemed to be shot with fire The two colonels Winchester and Newcomb were able and valiant men Despite their swelling losses they always filled up the ranks and held fast to the ground upon which they had stood when they were attacked But for the present they had no knowledge how the battle was going elsewhere The enemy just before them allowed no idle moments Yet Grant as happened later on at Shiloh was taken by surprise When the first roar of the battle broke with the dawn he was away conferring with the wounded naval commander Foote His right under McClernand had been caught napping and eight thousand Southern troops striking it with a tremendous impact just as the men snatched up their arms drove it back in heavy loss and confusion Its disaster was increased when a Southern general Baldwin led a strong column down a deep ravine near the river and suddenly hurled it upon the wavering Union flank Whole regiments retreated now and guns were lost The Southern officers their faces glowing shouted to each other that the battle was won And still the combat raged without the Union commander Grant although he was coming now as fast as he could with the increasing roar of conflict to draw him on The battle was lost to the North But it might be won back again by a general who would not quit Only the bulldog in Grant the tenacious death grip could save him now Dick and his friends suddenly became conscious that both on their right and left the thunder of battle was moving back upon the Union camp They realized now that they were only the segment of a circle extending forward practically within the Union lines and that the combat was going against them The word was given to retreat lest they be surrounded and they fell back slowly disputing with desperation every foot of ground that they gave up Yet they left many fallen behind A fourth of the regiment had been killed or wounded already and there were tears in the eyes of Colonel Winchester as he looked over the torn ranks of his gallant men Now the Southerners meaning to drive victory home were bringing up their reserves and pouring fresh troops upon the shattered Union front They would have swept everything away but in the nick of time a fresh Union brigade arrived also supported the yielding forces and threw itself upon the enemy But Grant had not yet come It seemed that in the beginning fortune played against this man of destiny throwing all her tricks in favor of his opponents The single time that he was away the attack bad been made and if he would win back a lost battle there was great need to hurry The Southern troops exultant and full of fire and spirit continually rolled back their adversaries They wheeled more guns from the fort into position and opened heavily on the yielding foe If they were beaten back at any time they always came on again a restless wave crested with fire and steel Dick s regiment continued to give ground slowly It had no choice but to do so or be destroyed It seemed to him now that he beheld the wreck of all things Was this to be Bull Run over again His throat and eyes burned from the smoke and powder and his face was black with grime His lips were like fire to the touch of each other He staggered in the smoke against some one and saw that it was Warner Have we lost he cried Have we lost after doing so much The lips of the Vermonter parted in a kind of savage grin I won t say we ve lost he shouted in reply but I can t see anything we ve won Then he lost Warner in the smoke and the regiment retreated yet further It was impossible to preserve cohesion or keep a line formed The Southerners never ceased to press upon them with overwhelming weight Pillow now decisive in action continually accumulated new forces upon the Northern right Every position that McClernand had held at the opening of the battle was now taken and the Confederate general was planning to surround and destroy the whole Union army Already he was sending messengers to the telegraph with news for Johnston of his complete victory But the last straw had not yet been laid upon the camel s back McClernand was beaten but the hardy men of Kentucky East Tennessee and the northwest still offered desperate resistance Conspicuous among the defenders was the regiment of young pioneers from Nebraska hunters Indian fighters boys of twenty or less who had suffered already every form of hardship They stood undaunted amid the showers of bullets and shells and cried to the others to stand with them Yet the condition of the Union army steadily grew worse Dick himself in all the smoke and shouting and confusion could see it The regiments that formed the core of resistance were being pared down continually There was a steady dribble of fugitives to the rear and those who fought felt themselves going back always like one who slips on ice The sun far up the heavens now poured down beams upon the vast cloud of smoke and vapor in which the two armies fought The few people left in Dover red hot for the South cheered madly as they saw their enemy driven further and further away Grant the man of destiny ill clad and insignificant in appearance now came upon the field and saw his beaten army But the bulldog in him shut down its teeth and resolved to replace defeat with victory His greatest qualities strength and courage in the face of disaster were now about to shine forth His countenance showed no alarm He rode among the men cheering them to renewed efforts He strengthened the weak places in the line that his keen eyes saw He infused a new spirit into the army His own iron temper took possession of the troops and that core of resistance desperate when he came suddenly hardened and enlarged Dick felt the change It was of the mind but it was like a cool breath upon the face It was as if the winds had begun to blow courage A great shout rolled along the Northern line Grant has come exclaimed Pennington who was bleeding from a slight wound in the shoulder but who was unconscious of it And we ve quit retreating The Nebraska youth had divined the truth Just when a complete Southern victory seemed to be certain the reversal of fortune came The coolness the courage and the comprehensive eye of Grant restored the battle for the North The Southern reserves had not charged with the fire and spirit expected and met with a shattering fire by the Indiana troops they fell back Grant saw the opportunity and massing every available regiment he hurled it upon Pillow and the Southern center Dick felt the wild thrill of exultation as they went forward instead of going back as they had done for so many hours Just in front of him was Colonel Winchester waving aloft a sword the blade of which had been broken in two by a bullet and calling to his men to come on Warner and Pennington grimed with smoke and mud and stained here and there with blood were near also shouting wildly The smoke split asunder for a moment and Dick saw the long line of charging troops It seemed to be a new army now infused with fresh spirit and courage and every pulse in the boy s body began to beat heavily with the hope of victory The smoke closed in again and then came the shock Exhausted by their long efforts which had brought victory so near the Southern troops gave way Their whole center was driven in and they lost foot by foot the ground that they had gained with so much courage and blood Grant saw his success and he pressed more troops upon his weakening enemy The batteries were pushed forward and raked the shattered Southern lines Pillow who had led the attack instead of Floyd seeing his fortunes pass so suddenly from the zenith to the nadir gathered his retreating army upon a hill in front of their intrenchments but he was not permitted to rest there A fresh Northern brigade a reserve had just arrived upon the field Joining it to the forces of Lew Wallace afterwards famous as a novelist Grant hurled the entire division upon Pillow s weakened and discouraged army Winchester s regiment joined in the attack Dick felt himself swept along as if by a torrent His courage and the courage of those around him was all the greater now because hope sanguine hope had suddenly shot up from the very depths of despair Their ranks had been thinned terribly but they forgot it for the time and rushed upon their enemy The battle had rolled back and forth for hours Noon had come and passed The troops of Pillow had been fighting without ceasing for six hours and they could not withstand the new attack made with such tremendous spirit and energy They fought with desperation but they were compelled at last to yield the field and retreat within their works Their right and left suffered the same fate The whole Confederate attack was repulsed Bull Run was indeed reversed There the South snatched victory from defeat and here the North came back with a like triumph CHAPTER XII GRANT S GREAT VICTORY The night early and wintry put an end to the conflict the fiercest and greatest yet seen in the West Thousands of dead and wounded lay upon the field and the hearts of the Southern leaders were full of bitterness They had seen the victory won by courage and daring taken from them at the very last moment The farmer lads whom they led had fought with splendid courage and tenacity Defeat was no fault of theirs It belonged rather to the generals among whom had been a want of understanding and concert fatal on the field of action They saw too that they had lost more than the battle The Union army had not only regained all its lost positions but on the right it had carried the Southern intrenchments and from that point Grant s great guns could dominate Donelson They foresaw with dismay the effect of these facts upon their young troops When the night fell and the battle ceased save for the fitful boom of cannon along the lines Dick sank against an earthwork exhausted He panted for breath and was without the power to move He regarded vaguely the moving lights that had begun to show in the darkness and he heard without comprehension the voices of men and the fitful fire of the cannon Steady Dick Steady said a cheerful voice Now is the time to rejoice We ve won a victory and nothing can break General Grant s death grip on Donelson Colonel Winchester was speaking and he put a firm and friendly hand on the boy s shoulder Dick came back to life and looking into his colonel s face he grinned Colonel Winchester could have been recognized only at close range His face was black with burned gunpowder His colonel s hat was gone and his brown hair flew in every direction He still clenched in his hand the hilt of his sword of which a broken blade not more than a foot long was left His clothing had been torn by at least a dozen bullets and one had made a red streak across the back of his left hand from which the blood fell slowly drop by drop You don t mind my telling you colonel that you re no beauty said Dick who felt a sort of hysterical wish to laugh You look as if the whole Southern army had tried to shoot you up but had merely clipped you all around the borders Laugh if it does you good replied Colonel Winchester a little gravely but young sir you must give me the same privilege This battle while it has not wounded you has covered you with its grime Come the fighting is over for this day at least and the regiment is going to take a rest what there is left of it He spoke the last words sadly He knew the terrible cost at which they had driven the Southern army back into the fort and he feared that the full price was yet far from being paid But he preserved a cheerful manner before the brave lads of his who had fought so well Dick found that Warner and Pennington both had wounds although they were too slight to incapacitate them Sergeant Whitley grave and unhurt rejoined them also The winter night and their heavy losses could not discourage the Northern troops They shared the courage and tenacity of their commander They began to believe now that Donelson despite its strength and its formidable garrison would be taken They built the fires high and ate heartily They talked in sanguine tones of what they would do in the morrow Excited comment ran among them They had passed from the pit of despair in the morning to the apex of hope at night Exhausted all save the pickets fell asleep after a while dreaming of fresh triumphs on the morrow Had Dick s eyes been able to penetrate Donelson he would have beheld a very different scene Gloom even more despair reigned there Their great effort had failed Bravery had availed nothing Their frightful losses had been suffered in vain The generals blamed one another Floyd favored the surrender of the army but fancying that the Union troops hated him with special vindictiveness and that he would not be safe as a prisoner decided to escape Pillow declared that Grant could yet be beaten but after a while changed to the view of Floyd They yet had two small steamers in the Cumberland which could carry them up the river They left the command to Buckner the third in rank and told him he could make the surrender The black bearded Forrest said grimly I ain t goin to surrender my cavalry not to nobody and by devious paths he led them away through the darkness and to liberty Colonel George Kenton rode with him The rumor that a surrender was impending spread to the soldiers Not yet firm in the bonds of discipline confusion ensued and the high officers were too busy escaping by the river to restore it All through the night the two little steamers worked but a vast majority of the troops were left behind But Dick could know nothing of this at the time He was sleeping too heavily He had merely taken a moment to snatch a bit of food and then at the suggestion of his commanding officer he had rolled himself in his blankets Sleep came instantly and it was not interrupted until Warner s hand fell upon his shoulder at dawn and Warner s voice said in his ear Wake up Dick and look at the white flag fluttering over Donelson Dick sprang to his feet sleep gone in an instant and gazed toward Donelson Warner had spoken the truth White flags waved from the walls and earthworks So they re going to surrender said Dick What a triumph They haven t surrendered yet said Colonel Winchester who stood near Those white flags merely indicate a desire to talk it over with us but such a desire is nearly always a sure indication of yielding and our lads take it so Hark to their cheering The whole Union army was on its feet now joyously welcoming the sight of the white flags They threw fresh fuel on their fires which blazed along a circling rim of miles and ate a breakfast sweetened with the savor of triumph Take this big tin cup of coffee Dick said Warner It ll warm you through and through and we re entitled to a long brown drink for our victory I say victory because the chances are ninety nine per cent out of a hundred that it is so Let x equal our army let y equal victory and consequently x plus y equals our position at the present time And I never thought that we could do it said young Pennington who sat with them I suppose it all comes of having a general who won t give up I reckon the old saying is true an that Hold Fast is the best dog of them all Now came a period of waiting Colonel Winchester disappeared in the direction of General Grant s headquarters but returned after a while and called his favorite aide young Richard Mason Dick he said we have summoned the Southerners to surrender and I want you to go with me to a conference of their generals You may be needed to carry dispatches Dick went gladly with the group of Union officers who approached Fort Donelson under the white flag and who met a group of Confederate officers under a like white flag He noticed in the very center of the Southern group the figure of General Buckner a tall well built man in his early prime his face usually ruddy now pale with fatigue and anxiety Dick with his uncle Colonel Kenton and his young cousin Harry Kenton had once dined at his house Nearly all the officers Northern and Southern knew one another well Many of them had been together at West Point Colonel Winchester and General Buckner were well acquainted and they saluted each smiling a little grimly I bring General Grant s demand for the surrender of Fort Donelson and all its garrison arms ammunition and other supplies said Colonel Winchester Can I see your chief General Floyd The lips of Buckner pressed close together in a smile touched with irony No you cannot see General Floyd he said because he is now far up the Cumberland Since he has abdicated the command I wish then to communicate with General Pillow I regret that you cannot speak to him either He is as far up the Cumberland as General Floyd Both departed in the night and I am left in command of the Southern army at Fort Donelson You can state your demands to me Colonel Winchester Dick saw that the brave Kentuckian was struggling to hide his chagrin and he had much sympathy for him It was in truth a hard task that Floyd and Pillow had left for Buckner They had allowed themselves to be trapped and they had thrown upon him the burden of surrendering But Buckner proceeded with the negotiations Presently he noticed Dick Good morning Richard he said It seems that in this case at least you have chosen the side of the victors Fortune has happened to be on our side general said Dick respectfully Could you tell me sir if my uncle Colonel Kenton is unhurt He was when he was last with us replied General Buckner kindly Colonel Kenton went out last night with Forrest s cavalry He will not be a prisoner I am glad of that said the boy And he was truly glad He knew that it would hurt Colonel Kenton s pride terribly to become a prisoner and although they were now on opposite sides he loved and respected his uncle The negotiations were completed and before night the garrison of Donelson all except three thousand who had escaped in the night with Floyd and Pillow and Forrest laid down their arms The answer to Bull Run was complete Fifteen thousand men sixty five cannon and seventeen thousand rifles and muskets were surrendered to General Grant The bulldog in the silent westerner had triumphed With only a last chance left to him he had turned defeat into complete victory and had dealt a stunning blow to the Southern Confederacy which was never able like the North to fill up its depleted ranks with fresh men Time alone could reveal to many the deadly nature of this blow but Dick who had foresight and imagination understood it now at least in part As he saw the hungry Southern boys sharing the food of their late enemies his mind traveled over the long Southern line Thomas had beaten it in Eastern Kentucky Grant had dealt it a far more crushing blow here in Western Kentucky but Albert Sidney Johnston the most formidable foe of all yet remained in the center He was a veteran general with a great reputation Nay more it was said by the officers who knew him that he was a man of genius Dick surmised that Johnston after the stunning blow of Donelson would be compelled to fall back from Tennessee but he did not doubt that he would return again Dick soon saw that all his surmises were correct The news of Donelson produced for a little while a sort of paralysis at Richmond and when it reached Nashville where the army of Johnston was gathering it was at first unbelievable It produced so much excitement and confusion that a small brigade sent to the relief of Donelson was not called back and marched blindly into the little town of Dover where it found itself surrounded by the whole triumphant Union army and was compelled to surrender without a fight Panic swept through Nashville Everybody knew that Johnston would be compelled to fall back from the Cumberland River upon the banks of which the capital of Tennessee stood Foote and his gunboats would come steaming up the stream into the very heart of the city Rumor magnified the number and size of his boats Again the Southern leaders felt that the rivers were always a hostile coil girdling them about and lamented their own lack of a naval arm Floyd had drawn off in the night from Donelson his own special command of Virginians and when he arrived at Nashville with full news of the defeat at the fortress and the agreement to surrender the panic increased Many had striven to believe that the reports were untrue but now there could be no doubt And the panic gained a second impetus when the generals set fire to the suspension bridge over the river and the docks along its banks The inhabitants saw the signal of doom in the sheets of flame that rolled up and all those who had taken a leading part in the Southern cause prepared in haste to leave with Johnston s army The roads were choked with vehicles and fleeing people The State Legislature which was then in session departed bodily with all the records and archives But Dick after the first hours of triumph felt relaxed and depressed After all the victory was over their own people and five thousand of the farmer lads North and South had been killed or wounded But this feeling did not last long as on the very evening of victory he was summoned to action Action with him always made the blood leap and hope rise It was his own regimental chief Arthur Winchester who called him and who told him to make ready for an instant departure from Donelson You are to be a cavalryman for a while Dick said Colonel Winchester So much has happened recently that we scarcely know how we stand Above all we do not know how the remaining Southern forces are disposed and I have been chosen to lead a troop toward Nashville and see You Warner Pennington that very capable sergeant Whitley and others whom you know are to go with me My force will number about three hundred and the horses are already waiting on the other side They were carried over the river on one of the boats and the little company mounting prepared to ride into the dark woods But before they disappeared Dick looked back and saw many lights gleaming in captured Donelson Once more the magnitude of Grant s victory impressed him Certainly he had struck a paralyzing blow at the Southern army in the west But the ride in the dark over a wild and thinly settled country soon occupied Dick s whole attention He was on one side of Colonel Winchester and Warner was on the other Then the others came four abreast At first there was some disposition to talk but it was checked sharply by the leader and after a while the disposition itself was lacking Colonel Winchester was a daring horseman and Dick soon realized that it would be no light task to follow where he led Evidently he knew the country as he rode with certainty over the worst roads that Dick had ever seen They were deep in mud which froze at night but not solidly enough to keep the feet of the horses from crushing through making a crackle as they went down and a loud sticky sigh as they came out All were spattered with mud which froze upon them but they were so much inured to hardship now that they paid no attention to it But this rough riding soon showed so much effect upon the horses that Colonel Winchester led aside into the woods and fields keeping parallel with the road Now and then they stopped to pull down fences but they still made good speed Twice they saw at some distance cabins with the smoke yet rising from the chimneys but the colonel did not stop to ask any questions Those he thought could be asked better further on Twice they crossed creeks One the horses could wade but the other was so deep that they were compelled to swim On the further bank of the second they stopped a while to rest the horses and to count the men to see that no straggler had dropped away in the darkness Then they sprang into the saddle again and rode on as before through a country that seemed to be abandoned There was a certain thrill and exhilaration in their daring ride The smoke and odors of the battle about Donelson were blown away The dead and the wounded the grewsome price even of victory no longer lay before their eyes and the cold air rushing past freshened their blood and gave it a new sparkle Every one in the little column knew that danger was plentiful about them but there was pleasure in action in the open Their general direction was Nashville and now they came into a country richer better cultivated and peopled more thickly Toward night they saw on a gentle hill in a great lawn and surrounded by fine trees a large red brick house with green shutters and portico supported by white pillars Smoke rose from two chimneys Colonel Winchester halted his troop and examined the house from a distance for a little while This is the home of wealthy people he said at last to Dick and we may obtain some information here At least we should try it Dick had his doubts but he said nothing You mister Pennington mister Warner and Sergeant Whitley dismount with me continued the colonel and we ll try the house He bade his troop remain in the road under the command of the officer next in rank and he with those whom he had chosen opened the lawn gate A brick walk led to the portico and they strolled along it their spurs jingling Although the smoke still rose from the chimneys no door opened to them as they stepped into the portico All the green shutters were closed tightly I think they saw us in the road said Dick and this is a house of staunch Southern sympathizers That is why they don t open to us Beat on the door with the hilt of your sword sergeant said the colonel to Whitley They re bound to answer in time The sergeant beat steadily and insistently Yet he was forced to continue it five or six minutes before it was thrown open Then a tall old woman with a dignified stern face and white hair drawn back from high brows stood before them But Dick s quick eyes saw in the dusk of the room behind her a girl of seventeen or eighteen What do you want asked the woman in a tone of ice I see that you are Yankee soldiers and if you intend to rob the house there is no one here to oppose you Its sole occupants are myself my granddaughter and two colored women our servants But I tell you before you begin that all our silver has been shipped to Nashville Colonel Winchester flushed a deep crimson and bit his lips savagely Madame he said we are not robbers and plunderers These are regular soldiers belonging to General Grant s army Does it make any difference Your armies come to ravage and destroy the South Colonel Winchester flushed again but remembering his self control he said politely Madame I hope that our actions will prove to you that we have been maligned We have not come here to rob you or disturb you in any manner We merely wished to inquire of you if you had seen any other Southern armed forces in this vicinity And do you think sir she replied in the same uncompromising tones if I had seen them that I would tell you anything about it No Madame replied the Colonel bowing whatever I may have thought before I entered your portico I do not think so now Then it gives me pleasure to bid you good evening sir she said and shut the door in his face Colonel Winchester laughed rather sorely She had rather the better of me he said but we can t make war on women Come on lads we ll ride ahead and camp under the trees It s easy to obtain plenty of fuel for fires The darkness is coming fast said Dick and it is going to be very cold as usual In a half hour the day was fully gone and as he had foretold the night was sharp with chill setting every man to shivering They turned aside into an oak grove and pitched their camp It was never hard to obtain fuel as the whole area of the great civil war was largely in forest and the soldiers dragged up fallen brushwood in abundance Then the fires sprang up and created a wide circle of light and cheerfulness Dick joined zealously in the task of finding firewood and his search took him somewhat further than the others He passed all the way through the belt of forest and noticed fields beyond He was about to turn back when he heard a faint but regular sound Experience told him that it was the beat of a horse s hoofs and he knew that some distance away a road must lead between the fields He walked a hundred yards further and climbing upon a fence waited From his perch he could see the road about two hundred yards beyond him and the hoof beats were rapidly growing louder Some one was riding hard and fast In a minute the horseman or rather horsewoman came into view There was enough light for Dick to see the slender figure of a young girl mounted on a great bay horse She was wrapped in a heavy cloak but her head was bare and her long dark hair streamed almost straight out behind her so great was the speed at which she rode She struck the horse occasionally with a small riding whip but he was already going like a racer Dick remembered the slim figure of a girl and it occurred to him suddenly that this was she whom he had seen in the dusk of the room behind her grandmother He wondered why she was riding so fast alone and in the winter night and then he admitted with a thrill of admiration that he had never seen any one ride better The hoof beats rose died away and then horse and girl were gone in the darkness Dick climbed down from the fence and shook himself Was it real or merely fancy the product of a brain excited by so much siege and battle He picked up a big dead bough in the wood dragged it back to the camp and threw it on one of the fires What are you looking so grave about Dick asked Warner When I went across that stretch of woods I saw something that I didn t expect to see What was it A girl on a big horse They came and they went so fast that I just got a glimpse of them A girl alone galloping on a horse on a wintry night like this through a region infested by hostile armies Why Dick you re seeing shadows Better sit down and have a cup of this good hot coffee But Dick shook his head He knew now that he had seen reality and he reported it to Colonel Winchester Are you sure it was the girl you saw at the big house asked Colonel Winchester It might have been some farmer s wife galloping home from an errand late in the evening It was the girl I am sure of it said Dick confidently Just at that moment Sergeant Whitley came up and saluted What is it sergeant asked the Colonel I have been up the road some distance sir and I came to another road that crossed it The second road has been cut by hoofs of eight or nine hundred horses and I am sure sir that the tracks are not a day old Colonel Winchester looked grave He knew that he was deep in the country of the enemy and he began to put together what Dick had seen and what the sergeant had seen But the thought of withdrawing did not occur to his brave soul He had been sent on an errand by General Grant and he meant to do it But he changed his plans for the night He had intended to keep only one man in ten on watch Instead he kept half and Sergeant Whitley veteran of Indian wars murmured words of approval under his breath Whitley and Pennington were in the early watch Dick and Warner were to come on later The colonel spoke as if he would keep watch all night All the horses were tethered carefully inside the ring of pickets It doesn t need any mathematical calculation said Warner to tell that the colonel expects trouble of some kind tonight What its nature is I don t know but I mean to go to sleep nevertheless I have already seen so much of hardship and war that the mere thought of danger does not trouble me I took a fort on the Tennessee I took a much larger one on the Cumberland first defeating the enemy s army in a big battle and now I am preparing to march on Nashville Hence I will not have my slumbers disturbed by a mere belief that danger may come It s a good resolution George said Dick but unlike you I am subject to impulses emotions thrills and anxieties Better cure yourself said the Vermonter as he rolled himself in the blankets and put his head on his arm In two minutes he was asleep but Dick despite his weariness had disturbed nerves which refused to let him sleep for a long time He closed his eyes repeatedly and then opened them again merely to see the tethered horses and beyond them the circle of sentinels a clear moonlight falling on their rifle barrels But it was very warm and cosy in the blankets and he would soon fall asleep again He was awakened about an hour after midnight to take his turn at the watch and he noticed that Colonel Winchester was still standing beside one of the fires but looking very anxious Dick felt himself on good enough terms despite his youth to urge him to take rest I should like to do so replied Colonel Winchester but Dick I tell you although you must keep it to yourself that I think we are in some danger Your glimpse of the flying horsewoman and the undoubted fact that hundreds of horsemen have crossed the road ahead of us have made me put two and two together Ah what is it sergeant I think I hear noises to the east of us sir replied the veteran What kind of noises sergeant I should say sir that they re made by the hoofs of horses There I hear them again sir I m quite sure of it and they re growing louder And so do I exclaimed Colonel Winchester now all life and activity The sounds are made by a large body of men advancing upon us Seize that bugle Dick and blow the alarm with all your might Dick snatched up the bugle and blew upon it a long shrill blast that pierced far into the forest He blew and blew again and every man in the little force sprang to his feet in alarm Nor were they a moment too soon From the woods to the east came the answering notes of a bugle and then a great voice cried Forward men an wipe em off the face of the earth It seemed to Dick that he had heard that voice before but he had no time to think about it as the next instant came the rush of the wild horsemen a thousand strong leaning low over their saddles their faces dark with the passion of anger and revenge pistols rifles and carbines flashing as they pulled the trigger giving way when empty to sabres which gleamed in the moonlight as they were swung by powerful hands Colonel Winchester s whole force would have been ridden down in the twinkling of an eye if it had not been for the minute s warning His men leaping to their feet snatched up their own rifles and fired a volley at short range It did more execution among the horses than among the horsemen and the Southern rough riders were compelled to waver for a moment Many of their horses went down others uttered the terrible shrieking neigh of the wounded and despite the efforts of those who rode them strove to turn and flee from those flaming muzzles It was only a moment but it gave the Union troop save those who were already slain time to spring upon their horses and draw back at the colonel s shouted command to the cover of the wood But they were driven hard The Confederate cavalry came on again impetuous and fierce as ever and urged continually by the great partisan leader Forrest now in the very dawn of his fame It was no phantom you saw that girl on the horse shouted Warner in Dick s ear and Dick nodded in return They had no time for other words as Forrest s horsemen far outnumbering them now pressed them harder than ever A continuous fire came from their ranks and at close range they rode in with the sabre Dick experienced the full terror and surprise of a night battle The opposing forces were so close together that it was often difficult to tell friend from enemy But Forrest s men had every advantage of surprise superior numbers and perfect knowledge of the country Dick groaned aloud as he saw that the best they could do was to save as many as possible Why had he not taken a shot at the horse of that flying girl We must keep together Dick shouted Warner Here are Pennington and Sergeant Whitley and there s Colonel Winchester I fancy that if we can get off with a part of our men we ll be doing well Pennington s horse shot through the head dropped like a stone to the ground but the deft youth used to riding the wild mustangs of the prairie leaped clear seized another which was galloping about riderless and at one bound sprang into the saddle Good boy shouted Dick with admiration but the next moment the horsemen of Forrest were rushing upon them anew More men were killed many were taken and Colonel Winchester seeing the futility of further resistance gathered together those who were left and took flight through the forest Tears of mortification came to Dick s eyes but Sergeant Whitley who rode on his right hand said It s the only thing to do Remember that however bad your position may be it can always be worse It s better for some of us to escape than for all of us to be down or be taken Dick knew that his logic was good but the mortification nevertheless remained a long time There was some consolation however in the fact that his own particular friends had neither fallen nor been taken They still heard the shouts of pursuing horsemen and shots rattled about them but now the covering darkness was their friend They drew slowly away from all pursuit The shouts and the sounds of trampling hoofs died behind them and after two hours of hard riding Colonel Winchester drew rein and ordered a halt It was a disordered and downcast company of about fifty who were left A few of these were wounded but not badly enough to be disabled Colonel Winchester s own head had been grazed but he had bound a handkerchief about it and sat very quiet in his saddle My lads he said and his tone was sharp with the note of defiance We have been surprised by a force greatly superior to our own and scarcely a sixth of us are left But it was my fault I take the blame For the present at least we are safe from the enemy and I intend to continue with our errand We were to scout the country all the way to Nashville It is also possible that we will meet the division of General Buell advancing to that city Now lads I hope that you all will be willing to go on with me Are you We are roared fifty together and a smile passed over the wan face of the colonel But he said no more then Instead he turned his head toward the capital city of the state and rode until dawn his men following close behind him The boys were weary In truth all of them were but no one spoke of halting or complained in any manner At sunrise they stopped in dense forest at the banks of a creek and watered their horses They cooked what food they had left and after eating rested for several hours on the ground most of them going to sleep while a few men kept a vigilant watch When Dick awoke it was nearly noon and he still felt sore from his exertions An hour later they all mounted and rode again toward Nashville Near night they boldly entered a small village and bought food The inhabitants were all strongly Southern but villagers love to talk and they learned there in a manner admitting of no doubt that the Confederate army was retreating southward from the line of the Cumberland that the state capital had been abandoned and that to the eastward of them the Union army under Buell was advancing swiftly on Nashville At least we accomplished our mission said Colonel Winchester with some return of cheerfulness We have discovered the retreat of General Johnston s whole army and the abandonment of Nashville invaluable information to General Grant But we ll press on toward Nashville nevertheless They camped the next night in a forest and kept a most vigilant watch If those terrible raiders led by Forrest should strike them again they could make but little defense They came the next morning upon a good road and followed it without interruption until nearly noon when they saw the glint of arms across a wide field Colonel Winchester drew his little troop back into the edge of the woods and put his field glasses to his eyes There are many men riding along a road parallel to ours he said They look like an entire regiment and by all that s lucky they re in the uniforms of our own troops Yes they re our own men There can be no mistake It is probably the advance guard of Buell s army They still had a trumpet and at the colonel s order it was blown long and loud An answering call came from the men on the parallel road and they halted Then Colonel Winchester s little troop galloped forward and they were soon shaking hands with the men of a mounted regiment from Ohio They had been sent ahead by Buell to watch Johnston s army but hearing of the abandonment of Nashville they were now riding straight for the city Colonel Winchester and his troop joined them gladly and the colonel rode by the side of the Ohio colonel Mitchel Dick and his young comrades felt great relief He realized the terrible activity of Forrest but that cavalry leader even if he had not now gone south would hesitate about attacking the powerful regiment with which Dick now rode Warner and Pennington shared his feelings The chances are ninety per cent in our favor said the Vermonter that we ll ride into Nashville without a fight I ve never been in Tennessee before and I m a long way from home but I m curious to see this city I d like to sleep in a house once more They rode into Nashville the next morning amid frowning looks but the half deserted city offered no resistance CHAPTER XIII IN THE FOREST Dick spent a week or more in Nashville and he saw the arrival of one of General Grant s divisions on the fleet under Commodore Foote Once more he appreciated the immense value of the rivers and the fleet to the North He and the two lads who were now knitted to him by sympathy and hardships and dangers shared enjoyed their stay in Nashville It was pleasant to sleep once more in houses and to be sheltered from rain and frost and snow It was pleasant too for these youths who were devoted to the Union to think that their armies had made such progress in the west The silent and inflexible Grant had struck the first great blow for the North The immense Confederate line in the west was driven far southward and the capital of one of the most vigorous of the secessionist states was now held by the Union But a little later news not so pleasant came to them The energy and success of Grant had aroused jealousy Halleck his superior the general of books and maps at saint Louis said that he had transcended the limits of his command He was infringing upon territory of other Northern generals Halleck had not found him to be the yielding subordinate who would win successes and let others have the credit Grant was practically relieved of his command and when Dick heard it he felt a throb of rage Boy as he was he knew that what had been won must be held Johnston had stopped at Murfreesborough thirty or forty miles away His troops had recovered from their panic caused by the fall of Donelson Fresh regiments and brigades were joining him His army was rising to forty thousand men and officers like Colonel Winchester began to feel apprehensive Now came a period of waiting The Northern leaders as happened so often in this war were uncertain of their authority and were at cross purposes They seldom had the power of initiative that was permitted to the Southern generals and of which they made such good use Dick saw that the impression made by Donelson was fading The North was reaping no harvest and the South was lifting up its head again While he was in Nashville he received a letter from his mother in reply to one of his that he had written to her just after Donelson She was very thankful that her son had gone safely through the battle and since he must fight in war which was terrible in any aspect she was glad that he had borne himself bravely She was glad that Colonel Kenton had escaped capture Her brother in law was always good to her and was a good man She had also received a letter from his son her nephew written from Richmond She loved Harry Kenton too and sympathized with him but she could not see how both sides could prevail Dick read the letter over and over again and there was a warm glow about his heart What a brave woman his mother was She said nothing about his coming back home or leaving the war He wrote a long reply and he told her only of the lighter and more cheerful events that they had encountered He described Warner Pennington and the sergeant and said that he had the best comrades in the world He told too of his gallant and high minded commander Colonel Arthur Winchester He was sure that the letter would reach her promptly as it passed all the way through territory now controlled by the North The next day after sending it he heard with joy that Grant was restored to his command and two days later Colonel Winchester and his men were ordered to join him at Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River They heard also that Buell with his whole division was soon to march to the same place and they saw in it an omen of speedy and concentrated action I imagine said Warner that we ll soon go down in Mississippi hunting Johnston We must outnumber the Johnny Rebs at least two to one I m not a general though any one can see that I ought to be and if we were to follow Johnston s army and crush it the war would soon be ended in the west You ve got a mighty big if said Dick If we march into Mississippi we get pretty far from our base We ll have to send a long distance through hostile country for fresh supplies and fresh troops while the Southerners will be nearer to their own Besides it s not so certain that we can destroy Johnston when we find him Your talk sounds logical and that being the case I ll leave our future movements to General Grant Anyway it s a good thing not to have so much responsibility on your shoulders They came in a few days to the great camp on the Tennessee Spring was now breaking through the crust of winter Touches of green were appearing on the forests and in the fields Now and then the wonderful pungent odor of the wilderness came to them and life seemed to have taken on new zest They were but boys in years and the terrible scenes of Donelson could not linger with them long They found Colonel Newcomb and the little detachment of Pennsylvanians with Grant and Colonel Winchester resuming command of his regiment camped by their side delighted to be with old friends again Colonel Winchester had lost a portion of his regiment but there were excuses It had happened in a country well known to the enemy and but little known to him and he had been attacked in overwhelming force by the rough riding Forrest who was long to be a terror to the Union divisions But he had achieved the task on which he had been sent and he was thanked by his commander Dick as he went on many errands or walked about in the course of his leisure hours with his friends watched with interest the growth of a great army There were more men here upon the banks of the Tennessee than he had seen at Bull Run They were gathered full forty thousand strong and General Buell s army also he learned had been put under command of General Grant and was advancing from Nashville to join him Dick also observed with extreme interest the ground upon which they were encamped and the country surrounding it There was the deep Tennessee still swollen by spring rains upon the left bank of which they lay with the stream protecting one flank In the river were some of the gunboats which had been of such value to Grant All about them was rough hilly country almost wholly covered with brushwood and tall forest There were three deep creeks given significant names by the pioneers Lick Creek flowed to the south of them into the Tennessee and Owl Creek to the north sought the same destination A third Snake Creek was lined with deep and impassable swamps to its very junction with the river Some roads of the usual frontier type ran through this region and at a point within the Northern lines stood a little primitive log church that they called Shiloh It was of the kind that the pioneers built everywhere as they moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific Shiloh belonged to a little body of Methodists Dick went into it more than once There was no pastor and no congregation now but the little church was not molested He sat more than once on an uncompromising wooden bench and looked out through a window from which the shutter was gone at the forest and the army Sitting here in this primitive house of worship he would feel a certain sadness It seemed strange that a great army whose purpose was to destroy other armies should be encamped around a building erected in the cause of the Prince of Peace The mighty and terrible nature of the war was borne in upon him more fully than ever But optimism was supreme among the soldiers They had achieved the great victory of Donelson in the face of odds that had seemed impossible They could defeat all the Southern forces that lay between them and the Gulf The generals shared their confidence They did not fortify their camp They had not come that far South to fight defensive battles It was their place to attack and that of the men in gray to defend They had advanced in triumph almost to the Mississippi line and they would soon be pursuing their disorganized foe into that Gulf State Several new generals came to serve under Grant Among them was one named Sherman to whom Dick bore messages several times and who impressed him with his dry manner and curt remarks which were yet so full of sense It was Sherman s division in fact that was encamped around the little church and Dick soon learned his opinions He did not believe that they would so easily conquer the South He did not look for any triumphal parade to the Gulf In the beginning of the war he had brought great enmity and criticism upon himself by saying that two hundred thousand men at least would be needed at once to crush the Confederacy in the west alone And yet it was to take more than ten times that number four bitter years to achieve the task in both west and east But optimism continued to reign in the Union army Buell would arrive soon with his division and then seventy thousand strong they would resume their march southward crushing everything Meanwhile it was pleasant while they waited They had an abundance of food They were well sheltered from the rains The cold days were passing nature was bursting into its spring bloom and the crisp fresh winds that blew from the west and south were full of life and strength It was a joy merely to breathe One rainy day the three boys who had met by chance went into the little church for shelter from a sudden spring rain From the shutterless window Dick saw Sergeant Whitley scurrying in search of a refuge and they called to him He came gladly and took a seat in one of the rough wooden pews of the little church of Shiloh The three boys had the greatest respect for the character and judgment of the sergeant and Dick asked him when he thought the army would march They don t tell these things to sergeants said Whitley But you see and you know a lot about war Well you ve noticed that the army ain t gettin ready to march When General Buell gets here we ll have nigh onto seventy thousand men and seventy thousand men can t lift themselves up by their bootstraps an leave all in a mornin But we don t have to hurry said Pennington There s no Southern army west of the Alleghanies that could stand before our seventy thousand men for an hour General Buell ain t here yet But he s coming But he ain t here yet persisted the sergeant an he can t be here for several days cause the roads are mighty deep in the spring mud Don t say any man is here until he is here An I tell you that General Johnston with whom we ve got to deal is a great man I wasn t with him when he made that great march through the blizzards an across the plains to Salt Lake City to make the Mormons behave but I ve served with them that was An I ve never yet found one of them who didn t say General Johnston was a mighty big man Soldiers know when the right kind of a man is holdin the reins an drivin em Didn t we all feel that we was bein driv right when General Grant took hold We all felt it said the three in chorus Of course you did said the sergeant an now I ve got a kind of uneasy feelin over General Johnston Why don t we hear somethin from him Why don t we know what he s doin We haven t sent out any scoutin parties On the plains no matter how strong we was we was always on the lookout for hostile Indians while here we know there is a big Confederate army somewhere within fifty miles of us but don t take the trouble to look it up That s so said Warner Caution represents less than five per cent of our effectiveness But I suppose we can whip the Johnnies anyway Of course we can said Pennington who was always of a most buoyant temperament Sergeant Whitley went to the shutterless window and looked out at the forest and the long array of tents The rain is about over he said It was just a passin shower But it looks as if it had already added a fresh shade of green to the leaves and grass Cur us how quick a rain can do it in spring when everything is just waitin a chance to grow and bust into bloom I ve rid on the plains when everything was brown an looked dead Long come a big rain an the next day everything was green as far as the eye could reach an you d see little flowers bloomin down under the shelter of the grass I didn t know you had a poetical streak in you sergeant said Dick who marked his abrupt change from the discussion of the war to a far different topic I think some of it is in every man replied Sergeant Whitley gravely I remember once that when we had finished a long chase after some Northern Cheyennes through mighty rough and dry country we came to a little valley a kind of a pocket in the hills fed by a fine creek runnin out of the mountains on one side into the mountains on the other The pocket was mebbe two miles long an mebbe a mile across an it was chock full of green trees an green grass an wild flowers We enjoyed its comforts but do you think that was all Every man among us an there was at least a dozen who couldn t read admired its beauties an begun to talk softer an more gentle than they did when they was out on the dry plains An you feel them things more in war than you do at any other time I suppose you do said Dick The spring is coming out now in Kentucky where I live and I d like to see the new grass rippling before the wind and the young leaves on the trees rustling softly together Stop sentimentalizing said Warner If you don t it won t be a minute before Pennington will begin to talk about his Nebraska plains and how he d like to see the buffalo herds ten million strong rocking the earth as they go galloping by Pennington smiled I won t see the buffalo herds he said but look at the wild fowl going north They left the window as the rain had ceased and went outside All this region was still primitive and thinly settled and now they saw flocks of wild ducks and wild geese winging northward The next day the heavens themselves were darkened by an immense flight of wild pigeons The country cut up by so many rivers creeks and brooks swarmed with wild fowl and more than once the soldiers roused up deer from the thickets The second day after the talk of the four in the little church Dick who was now regarded as a most efficient and trusty young staff officer was sent with a dispatch to General Buell requesting him to press forward with as much speed as he could to the junction with General Grant Several other aides were sent by different routes in order to make sure that at least one would arrive but Dick through his former ride with Colonel Winchester to Nashville had the most knowledge of the country and hence was likely to reach Buell first As the boy rode from the camp and crossed the river into the forest he looked back and he could not fail to notice to what an extent it was yet a citizen army and not one of trained soldiers The veteran sergeant had already called his attention to what he deemed grave omissions In the three weeks that they had been lying there they had thrown up no earthworks Not a spade had touched the earth Nor was there any other defense of any kind The high forest circled close about them dense now with foliage and underbrush hiding even at a distance of a few hundred yards anything that might lie within The cavalry in these three weeks had made one scouting expedition but it was slight and superficial resulting in nothing The generals of divisions posted their own pickets separately leaving numerous wide breaks in the line and the farmer lads at the change of guard invariably fired their rifles in the air to signify the joy of living and because it was good to hear the sound Now that he was riding away from them these things impressed Dick more than when he was among them Sergeant Whitley s warning and pessimistic words came back to him with new force but as he rode into the depths of the forest he shook off all depression Those words Seventy thousand strong continually recurred to him Yes they would be seventy thousand strong when Buell came up and the boys were right Certainly there was no Confederate force in the west that could resist seventy thousand troops splendidly armed flushed with victory and led by a man like Grant Seventy thousand strong Dick s heart beat high at the unuttered words Why should Grant fortify It was for the enemy not for him to do such a thing Nor was it possible that Johnston even behind defenses could resist the impact of the seventy thousand who had been passing from one victory to another and who were now in the very heart of the enemy s country His heart continued to beat high and fast as he rode through the green forest Its strong sweet odors gave a fillip to his blood and he pressed his horse to new speed He rode without interruption night and day save a few hours now and then for sleep and reached the army of Buell which deep in mud was toiling slowly forward Buell was not as near to Shiloh as Dick had supposed but his march had suffered great hindrances Halleck in an office far away in saint Louis had undertaken to manage the campaign His orders to Buell and his command to Grant had been delayed Buell who had moved to the town of Columbia therefore had started late through no fault of his Duck River which Buell was compelled to cross was swollen like all the other streams of the region by the great rains and was forty feet deep The railway bridge across it had been wrecked by the retreating Confederates and he was compelled to wait there two weeks until his engineers could reconstruct it War plays singular chances Halleck in saint Louis secure in his plan of campaign had sent an order after Dick left Shiloh for Buell to turn to the north leaving Grant to himself and occupy a town that he named Through some chance the order never reached Buell Had it done so the whole course of American history might have been changed Grant himself after the departure of the earlier messengers changed his mind and sent messengers to Nelson who led Buell s vanguard telling him not to hurry This army was to come to Pittsburg Landing or Shiloh partly by the Tennessee and Grant stated that the vessels for him would not be ready until some days later It was the early stage of the war when generals behaved with great independence and Nelson a rough stubborn man after reading the order marched on faster than ever It seemed afterward that the very stars were for Grant when one order was lost and another disobeyed But Dick was not to know of these things until later He delivered in person his dispatch to General Buell who remembered him and gave him a friendly nod but who was as chary of speech as ever He wrote a brief reply to the dispatch and gave it sealed to Dick The letter I hand you he said merely notifies General Grant that I have received his orders and will hurry forward as much as possible If on your return journey you should deem yourself in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy destroy it at once Dick promised to do so saluted and retired He spent only two hours in General Buell s camp securing some fresh provisions to carry in his saddle bags and allowing his horse a little rest Then he mounted and took as straight a course as he could for General Grant s camp at Pittsburg Landing The boy felt satisfied with himself He had done his mission quickly and exactly and he would have a pleasant ride back On his strong swift horse and with a good knowledge of the road he could go several times faster than Buell s army He anticipated a pleasant ride The forest seemed to him to be fairly drenched in spring Little birds flaming in color darted among the boughs and others more modest in garb poured forth a full volume of song Dick sensitive to sights and sounds hummed a tune himself It was the thundering song of the sea that he had heard Samuel Jarvis sing in the Kentucky Mountains They bore him away when the day had fled And the storm was rolling high And they laid him down in his lonely bed By the light of an angry sky The lightning flashed and the wild sea lashed The shore with its foaming wave And the thunder passed on the rushing blast As it howled o er the rover s grave He pressed on hour after hour through the deep woods meeting no one but content At noon his horse suddenly showed signs of great weariness and Dick remembering how much he had ridden him over muddy roads gave him a long rest Besides there was no need to hurry The Southern army was at Corinth in Mississippi three or four days journey away and there had been no scouts or skirmishers in the woods between After a stop of an hour he remounted and rode on again but the horse was still feeling his great strain and he did not push him beyond a walk He calculated that nevertheless he would reach headquarters not long after nightfall and he went along gaily still singing to himself He crossed the river at a point above the army where the Union troops had made a ferry and then turned toward the camp About sunset he reached a hill from which he could look over the forest and see under the horizon faint lights that were made by Grant s campfires at Pittsburg Landing It was a welcome sight He would soon be with his friends again and he urged his horse forward a little faster Halt cried a sharp voice from the thicket Dick faced about in amazement and saw four horsemen in gray riding from the bushes The shock was as great as if he had been struck by a bullet but he leaned forward on his horse s neck kicked him violently with his heels and shouted to him The horse plunged forward at a gallop The boy remembering General Buell s instructions slipped the letter from his pocket and in the shelter of the horse s body dropped it to the ground where he knew it would be lost among the bushes and in the twilight Halt was repeated more loudly and sharply than ever Then a bullet whizzed by Dick s ear and a second pierced the heart of his good horse He tried to leap clear of the falling animal and succeeded but he fell so hard among the bushes that he was stunned for a few moments When he revived and stood up he saw the four horsemen in gray looking curiously at him Twould have been cheaper for you to have stopped when we told you to do it said one in a whimsical tone Dick noticed that the tone was not unkind it was not the custom to treat prisoners ill in this great war He rubbed his left shoulder on which he had fallen and which still pained him a little I didn t stop he said because I didn t know that you would be able to hit either me or my horse in the dusk I s pose from your way of lookin at it you was right to take the chance but you ve learned now that we Southern men are tol able good sharpshooters I knew it long ago but what are you doing here right in the jaws of our army They might close on you any minute with a snap You ought to be with your own army at Corinth Dick noticed that the men looked at one another and there was silence for a moment or two Young fellow resumed the spokesman you was comin from the direction of Columbia an your hoss which I am sorry we had to kill looked as if he was cleaned tuckered out I judge that you was bearin a message from Buell s army to Grant s You mustn t hold me responsible for your judgment good or bad No I reckon not but say young fellow do you happen to have a chaw of terbacker in your clothes If I had any I d offer it to you but I never chew The man sighed Well mebbe it s a bad habit he said but it s powerful grippin I d give a heap for a good twist of old Kentucky Now we re goin to search you an it ain t wuth while to resist cause we ve got you where we want you as the dog said to the coon when he took him by the throat We re lookin for letters an dispatches cause we re shore you come from Buell but if we should run across any terbacker we ll have to he p ourselves to it We ain t no robbers cause in times like these it ain t no robbery to take terbacker Dick noticed that while they talked one of the men never ceased to cover him with a rifle They were good humored and kindly but he knew they would not relax an inch from their duty All right he said go ahead I ll give you a good legal title to everything you may find He knew that the letter was lying in the bushes within ten feet of them and he had a strong temptation to look in that direction and see if it were as securely hidden as he had thought but he resisted the impulse Two of the men searched him rapidly and dexterously and much to their disappointment found no dispatch You ain t got any writin on you that s shore said the spokesman I d expected to find a paper an I had a lingerin hope too that we might find a little terbacker on you spite of what you said You don t think I d lie about the tobacco would you Sonny it ain t no lyin in a big war to say you ain t got no terbacker when them that s achin for it are standin by ready to grab it If you had a big diamond hid about you an a robber was to ask you if you had it you d tell him no of course I think said Dick that you must be from Kentucky You ve got our accent I shorely am an I m a longer way from it than I like I noticed from the first that you talked like me which is powerful flatterin to you Ain t you one of my brethren that the evil witches have made take up with the Yankees I m from the same state replied Dick who saw no reason to conceal his identity My name is Richard Mason and I m an aide on the staff of Colonel Arthur Winchester who commands a Kentucky regiment in General Grant s army I ve heard of Colonel Winchester The same that got a part of his regiment cut up so bad by Forrest Yes we did get cut up I was there confessed Dick a little reluctantly Don t feel bad about it It s likely to happen to any of you when Forrest is around Now since you ve introduced yourself so nice I ll introduce myself I m Sergeant Robertson in the Orphan Brigade It s a Kentucky brigade an it gets its nickname cause it s made up of boys so young that they call me gran pa though I m only forty four These other three are Bridge Perkins and Connor just plain privates The three just plain privates grinned What are you going to do with me asked Dick We re goin to give you a pleasant little ride We killed your hoss for which I pologize again but I ve got a good one of my own and you ll jump up behind me A sudden spatter of rifle fire came from the direction of the Northern pickets Them sentinels of yours have funny habits said Robertson grinning Just bound to hear their guns go off They re changin the guard now How do you know that asked Dick Oh I know a heap I m a terrible wise man but bein so wise I don t tell all I know or how I happen to know it Hop up sonny Don t you think I ll be a lot of trouble to you said Dick riding behind you thirty or forty miles to your camp The four men exchanged glances and no one answered The boy felt a sudden chill and his hair prickled at the roots He did not know what had caused it but surely it was a sign of some danger The night deepened steadily as they were talking The twilight had gone long since The last afterglow had faded The darkness was heavy with warmth The thick foliage of spring rustled gently Dick s sensation that something unusual was happening did not depart The four men after looking at one another looked fixedly at Dick Sonny said Robertson you ain t got no call to worry bout our troubles As I said this is a good strong hoss of mine an it will carry us just as far as we go an no further It was an enigmatical reply and Dick saw that it was useless to ask them questions Robertson mounted and Dick without another word sprang up behind him Two of the privates rode up close one on either side and the other kept immediately behind He happened to glance back and he saw that the man held a drawn pistol on his thigh He wondered at such extreme precautions and the ominous feeling increased Now lads said Robertson to his men don t make no more noise than you can help There ain t much chance that any Yankee scoutin party will be out but if there should be one we don t want to run into it An as for you mister Mason you re a nice boy We all can see that but just as shore as you let go with a yell or anything like it at any time or under any circumstances you ll be dead the next second A sudden fierce note rang in his voice and Dick despite all his courage shuddered He felt as if a nameless terror all at once threatened not only him but others His lips and mouth were dry Robertson spoke softly to his horse and then rode slowly forward through the deep forest The others rode with him never breaking their compact formation and preserving the utmost silence Dick did not ask another question Talk and fellowship were over Everything before him now was grim and menacing The dense woods and the darkness hid them so securely that they could not have been seen twenty yards away but the men rode on at a sure pace as if they knew the ground well The silence was deep and intense save for the footsteps of the horses and now and then a night bird in the tall trees calling Before they had gone far a man stepped from a thicket and held up a rifle Four men from the Orphan Brigade with a prisoner said Robertson Advance with the prisoner said the picket and the four men rode forward Dick saw to both left and right other pickets all in the gray uniform of the South and his heart grew cold within him The hair on his head prickled again at its roots and it was a dreadful sensation What did it mean Why these Southern pickets within cannon shot of the Northern lines The men rode slowly on They were in the deep forest but the young prisoner began to see many things under the leafy canopy On his right the dim shadowy forms of hundreds of men lay sleeping on the grass On his left was a massed battery of great guns eight in number Further and further they went and there were soldiers and cannon everywhere but not a fire There was no bed of coals not a single torch gleamed anywhere Not all the soldiers were sleeping but those who were awake never spoke Silence and darkness brooded over a great army in gray It was as if they marched among forty thousand phantoms row on row The whole appalling truth burst in an instant upon the boy The Southern army which they had supposed was at Corinth lay in the deep woods within cannon shot of its foe and not a soul in all Grant s thousands knew of its presence there And Buell was still far away It seemed to Dick that for a little space his heart stopped beating He foresaw it all the terrible hammer stroke at dawn the rush of the fiery South upon her unsuspecting foe and the cutting down of brigades before sleep was gone from their eyes Not in vain had the South boasted that Johnston was a great general He had not been daunted by Donelson While his foe rested on his victory and took his ease he was here with a new army ready to strike the unwary Dick shivered suddenly and with a violent impulse clutched the waist of the man in front of him It may have been some sort of physical telepathy but Robertson understood He turned his head and said in a whisper You re right The whole Southern army is here in the woods an we d rather lose a brigade tonight than let you escape Dick felt a thrill of the most acute agony If he could only escape There must be some way If he could but find one His single word would save the lives of thousands and prevent irreparable defeat Again he clutched the waist of the man in front of him and again the man divined It ain t no use he said although his tone was gentle and in a way sympathetic After all it s your own fault You blundered right in our way an we had to take you for fear you d see us an give the alarm It was your unlucky chance You d give a million dollars if you had it to slip out of our hands and tell Ulysses Grant that Albert Sidney Johnston with his whole army is layin in the woods right alongside of him ready to jump on his back at dawn an he not knowin it I would said Dick fervently An so would I if I was in your place Just think mister Mason that of all the hundreds of thousands of men in the Northern armies of all the twenty or twenty five million people on the Northern side there s just one that one a boy and that boy you who knows that Albert Sidney Johnston is here Held fast as I am I m sorry now that I do know it I can t say that I blame you I said you d give a million dollars to be able to tell but if you re to measure such things with money it would be worth a hundred million an more yes it would be cheap at three or four hundred millions for the North to know it But after all you can t measure such things with money Maybe you think I talk a heap but I m stirred some too They rode on a little farther over the hilly ground covered with thick forest or dense tall scrub But there were troops troops everywhere and now and then the batteries They were mostly boys like their antagonists of the North and the sleep of most of them was the sleep of exhaustion after a forced and rapid march over heavy ground from Corinth But Dick knew that they would be fresh in the morning when they rose from the forest and rushed upon their unwarned foe CHAPTER XIV THE DARK EVE OF SHILOH Dick noticed as they went further into the forest how complete was the concealment of a great army possible only in a country wooded so heavily and in the presence of a careless enemy The center was like the front of the Southern force Not a fire burned not a torch gleamed The horses were withdrawn so far that stamp or neigh could not be heard by the Union pickets We ll stop here said Robertson at length As you re a Kentuckian I thought it would be pleasanter for you to be handed over to Kentuckians The Orphan Brigade to which I belong is layin on the ground right in front of us an the first regiment is that of Colonel Kenton I ll hand you over to him an not cause I ve got anything ag inst you I ll be mighty glad to do it too cause my back is already nigh breakin with the responsibility Dick started violently What s hit you asked Robertson Oh nothing You see I m nervous You ain t tellin the truth But I don t blame you an it don t matter anyway Here we are Jump down Dick sprang to the ground and the others followed While they held the reins they stood in a close circle about him He had about as much chance of escape as he had of flying Robertson walked forward saluted some one who stood up in the dark and said a few words in a low tone Bring him forward said a clear voice which Dick recognized at once The little group of men opened out and Dick stepping forth met his uncle face to face It was now the time of Colonel George Kenton to start violently My God You Dick he exclaimed How did you come here I didn t come replied the boy who was now feeling more at ease I was brought here by four scouts of yours who I must say saw their duty and did it Colonel Kenton grasped his hand and shook it He was very fond of this young nephew of his The mere fact that he was on the other side did not alter his affection Tell me about it Dick he said And you Sergeant Robertson you and your men are to be thanked for your vigilance and activity You can go off duty You are entitled to your rest As they withdrew the sergeant who passed by Dick and who had not missed a word of the conversation between him and his uncle said to him At least young sir I ve returned you to your relatives an you re a minor as I can see It s so said Dick as the sergeant passed on They have not ill treated you said Colonel Kenton No they ve been as kind as one enemy could be to another It is strange most strange that you and I should meet here at such a time Nay Dick I see in it the hand of Providence You re to be saved from what will happen to your army tomorrow I d rather not be saved in this manner I know it but it is perhaps the only way As sure as the stars are in Heaven your army will be destroyed in the morning an you d be destroyed with it I m fond of you Dick and so I d rather you d be in our rear a prisoner while this is happening General Grant is a hard man to crush Dick Dick lad you don t know what you re talking about Look at the thing as it stands We know everything that you re doing Our spies look into the very heart of your camp You think that we are fifty miles away but a cannon shot from the center of our camp would reach the center of yours Why while we are here ready to spring this Grant of whom you think so much is on his way tonight to the little village of Savannah to confer with Buell In the dawn when we strike and roll his brigades back he will not be here And that s your great general Dick knew that his uncle was excited But he had full cause to be There was everything in the situation to inflame an officer s pride and anticipation It was not too dark for Dick to see a spark leap from his eyes and a sudden flush of red appear in either tanned cheek But for Dick the chill came again and once more his hair prickled at the roots The ambush was even more complete than he had supposed and General Grant would not be there when it was sprung Dick said Colonel Kenton I have talked to you as I would not have talked to anyone else but even so I would not have talked to you as I have were not your escape an impossibility You are unharmed but to leave this camp you would have to fly I admit it sir Come with me There are men higher in rank than I who would wish to see a prisoner taken as you were Dick followed him willingly and without a word Aware that he was not in the slightest physical danger he was full of curiosity concerning what he was about to see The words men higher in rank than I whipped his blood Colonel Kenton led through the darkness to a deep and broad ravine into which they descended The sides and bottom of this ravine were clothed in bushes and they grew thick on the edges above It was much darker here but Dick presently caught ahead of him the flicker of the first light that he had seen in the Southern army The boy s heart began to beat fast and hard All the omens foretold that he was about to witness something that he could never by any possibility forget They came nearer to the flickering light and he made out seated figures around it They were men wrapped in cavalry cloaks because the night air had now grown somewhat chill and Dick knew instinctively that these were the Southern generals preparing for the hammer stroke at dawn A sentinel rifle in hand met them Colonel Kenton whispered with him a moment and he went to the group He returned in a moment and escorted Dick and his uncle forward Colonel Kenton saluted and Dick involuntarily did the same It was a small fire casting only a faint and flickering light but Dick his eyes now used to the dusk saw well the faces of the generals He knew at once which was Johnston the chief He seemed older than the rest sixty at least but his skin was clear and ruddy and the firm face and massive jaw showed thought and power Yet the countenance appeared gloomy as if overcast with care Perhaps it was another omen By the side of Johnston sat a small but muscular man swarthy and in early middle years His face and gestures when he talked showed clearly that he was of Latin blood It was Beauregard the victor of Bull Run now second in command here and he made a striking contrast to the stern and motionless Kentuckian who sat beside him and who was his chief There was no uneasy play of Johnston s hands no shrugging of the shoulders no jerking of the head He sat silent his features a mask while he listened to his generals On the other side was Braxton Bragg brother in law of Jefferson Davis who could never forget Bragg s kinship and the service that he had done fifteen years before at Buena Vista when he had broken with his guns the last of Santa Anna s squares deciding the victory By the side of him was Hardee the famous tactician taught in the best schools of both America and Europe Then there was Polk who when a youth had left the army to enter the church and become a bishop and who was now a soldier again and a general Next to the bishop general sat the man who had been Vice President of the United States and who if the Democracy had held together would now have been in the chair of Lincoln John C Breckinridge called by his people the Magnificent commonly accounted the most splendid looking man in America Bring the prisoner forward Colonel Kenton said General Johnston a general upon whom the South with justice rested great hopes Dick stepped forward at once and he held himself firmly as he felt the eyes of the six generals bent upon him He was conscious even at the moment that chance had given him a great opportunity He was there to see while the military genius of the South planned in the shadow of a dark ravine a blow which the six intended to be crushing Where was the prisoner taken said Johnston to Colonel Kenton Sergeant Robertson and three other men of my command seized him as he was about to enter the Northern lines He was coming from the direction of Buell where it is likely that he had gone to take a dispatch Did you find any answer upon him My men searched him carefully sir but found nothing He is in the uniform of a staff officer Have you found to what regiment in the Union army he belongs He is on the staff of Colonel Arthur Winchester who commands one of the Kentucky regiments I have also to tell you sir that his name is Richard Mason and that he is my nephew Ah said General Johnston it is one of the misfortunes of civil war that so many of us fight against our own relatives For those who live in the border states yours is the common lot But Dick was conscious that the six generals were gazing at him with renewed interest Your surmise about his having been to Buell is no doubt correct said Beauregard quickly and nervously You left General Buell this morning did you not mister Mason Dick remained silent It is also true that Buell s army is worn down by his heavy march over muddy roads continued Beauregard as if he had not noticed Dick s failure to reply Dick s teeth were shut firmly and he compressed his lips He stood rigidly erect gazing now at the flickering flames of the little fire I suggest that you try him on some other subject than Buell General Beauregard said the bishop general a faint twinkle appearing in his eyes Johnston sat silent but his blue eyes missed nothing It is true also is it not continued Beauregard that General Grant has gone or is going tonight to Savannah to meet General Buell and confer with him about a speedy advance upon our army at Corinth Dick clenched his teeth harder than ever and a spasm passed over his face He was conscious that six pairs of eyes keen and intent ready to note the slightest change of countenance and to read a meaning into it were bent upon him It was only by a supreme effort that he remained master of himself but after the single spasm his countenance remained unmoved You do not choose to answer said Bragg always a stern and ruthless man but we can drag what you know from you I am a prisoner of war replied Dick steadily I was taken in full uniform I am no spy and you cannot ill treat me I do not mean that we would inflict any physical suffering upon you said Bragg The Confederacy does not and will never resort to such methods But you are only a boy We can question you here until through very weakness of spirit you will be glad to tell us all you know about Buell s or any other Northern force Try me and see said Dick proudly The blue eye of the silent Johnston flickered for an instant But it is true said Beauregard resuming his role of cross examiner that your army considering itself secure has not fortified against us It has dug no trenches built no earthworks thrown up no abatis The boy stood silent with folded arms and Colonel George Kenton standing on one side threw his nephew a glance of sympathy tinged with admiration Still you do not answer continued Beauregard and now a strong note of irony appeared in his tone but perhaps it is just as well You do your duty to your own army and we miss nothing You cannot tell us anything that we do not know already Whatever you may know we know more We know tonight the condition of General Grant s army better than General Grant himself does We know how General Buell and his army stand better than General Buell himself does We know the position of your brigades and the missing links between them better than your own brigade commanders do The eyes of the Louisianian flashed his swarthy face swelled and his shoulders twitched The French blood was strong within him Just so might some general of Napoleon some general from the Midi have shown his emotion on the eve of battle an emotion which did not detract from courage and resolution But the Puritan general Johnston raised a deprecatory hand It is enough General Beauregard he said The young prisoner will tell us nothing That is evident As he sees his duty he does it and I wish that our young men when they are taken may behave as well mister Mason you are excused You remain in the custody of your uncle but I warn you that there is none who will guard better against the remotest possibility of your escape It was involuntary but Dick gave his deepest military salute and said in a tone of mingled admiration and respect General Johnston I thank you The commander in chief of the Southern army bowed courteously in return and Dick following his uncle left the ravine The six generals returned to their council and the boy who would not answer was quickly forgotten Long they debated the morrow Several have left accounts of what occurred Johnston although he had laid the remarkable ambush and was expecting victory was grave even gloomy But Beauregard volatile and sanguine rejoiced For him the triumph was won already After their great achievement in placing their army unseen and unknown within cannon shot of the Union force failure was to him impossible Breckinridge like his chief Johnston was also grave and did not say much Hardee as became one of his severe military training discussed the details the placing of the brigades and the time of attack by each Polk the bishop general and Bragg also had their part As they talked in low tones they moved the men over their chessboard Now and then an aide was summoned and soon departed swiftly and in silence to move a battery or a regiment a little closer to the Union lines but always he carried the injunction that no noise be made Not a sound that could be heard three hundred yards away came from all that great army lying there in the deep woods and poised for its spring Meanwhile security reigned in the Union camp The farm lads of the west and northwest had talked much over their fires They had eaten good suppers and by and by they fell asleep But many of the officers still sat by the coals and discussed the march against the Southern army at Corinth when the men of Buell should join those of Grant The pickets although the gaps yet remained between those of the different brigades walked back and forth and wondered at the gloom and intensity of the woods in front of them but did not dream of that which lay in the heart of the darkness The Southern generals in the ravine lingered yet a little longer A diagram had been drawn upon a piece of paper It showed the position of every Southern brigade regiment and battery and of every Northern division too It showed every curve of the Tennessee the winding lines of the three creeks Owl Lick and Snake and the hills and marshes The last detail of the plan was agreed upon finally and they made it very simple lest their brigades and regiments should lose touch and become confused in the great forest They were to attack continually by the right press the Union army toward the right always in order to rush in and separate it from Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee and from the fleet and its stores Then they meant to drive it into the marshes enclosed by the river and Snake Creek and destroy it The six generals rose leaving the little fire to sputter out General Johnston was very grave and so were all the others as they started toward their divisions except Beauregard who said in sanguine tones Gentlemen we shall sleep tomorrow night in the enemy s camp Word in the mysterious ways of war had slid through the camp that the generals were in council and many soldiers driven by overwhelming curiosity had crept through the underbrush to watch the figures by the fire in the ravine They could not hear they did not seek to hear but they were held by a sort of spell When they saw them separate every one moving toward his own headquarters they knew that there was nothing to await now but the dawn and they stole back toward their own headquarters Dick had gone with Colonel Kenton to his own regiment in the very heart of the Orphan Brigade and on his way his uncle said Dick you will sleep among my own lads and I ask you for your own sake to make no attempt to escape tonight You would certainly be shot I recognize that fact sir and I shall await a better opportunity What to do with you in the morning I don t know but we shall probably be able to take care of you Meanwhile Dick go to sleep if you can See our boys are spread here through the woods If it were day you d probably find at least a dozen among them whom you know and certainly a hundred are of blood kin to you more or less Dick saw the dim forms stretched in hundreds on the ground and thanking his uncle for his kindness he stretched himself upon an unoccupied bit of turf and closed his eyes But it was impossible for young Richard Mason to sleep He felt again that terrible thrill of agony because he alone of all the score and more of Northern millions knew that the Southern trap was about to fall and he could not tell Never was he further from sleep His nerves quivered with actual physical pain He opened his eyes again and saw the dim forms lying in row on row as far in the forest as his eye could reach Then he listened He might hear the rifle of some picket more wary or more enterprising than the others sounding the alarm But no such sound came to his ears It had turned warmer again and he heard only the Southern wind heavy with the odors of grass and flower sighing through the tall forest An anger against his own surged up in his breast Why wouldn t they look How could they escape seeing Was it possible for one great army to remain unknown within cannon shot of another a whole night It was incredible but he had seen it and he knew it Fierce and bitter words rose to his lips but he did not utter them Dick lay a long time with his eyes open and the night was passing as peacefully as if there would be no red dawn Occasionally he heard a faint stir near him as some restless soldier turned on his side in his sleep and now and then a muttered word from an officer who passed near in the darkness Hours never passed more slowly Colonel Kenton had gone back toward the Northern lines and the boy surmised that he would be one of the first in the attack at dawn He began to wonder if dawn would ever really come Stars and a fair moon were out and as nearly as he could judge from them it must be about three o clock in the morning Yet it seemed to him that he had been lying there at least twelve hours He shut his eyes again but sleep was as far from him as ever After another long and almost unendurable period he opened them once more and it seemed to him that there was a faint tint of gray in the east He sat up and looking a long time he was sure of it The gray was deepening and broadening and at its center it showed a tint of silver The dawn was at hand and every nerve in the boy s body thrilled with excitement and apprehension A murmur and a shuffling sound arose all around him The sleepers were awake and they stood up thousands of them Cold food was given to them and they ate it hastily But they fondled their rifles and muskets and turned their faces toward the point where the Northern army lay and from which no sound came Dick shivered all over His head burned and his nerves throbbed Too late now He had hoped all through the long night that something would happen to carry a warning to that unsuspecting army Nothing had happened and in five minutes the attack would begin He stood up at his full height and sought to pierce with his eyes the foliage in front of him but the massed ranks of the Southerners now stood between and the batteries were wheeling into line A great throb and murmur ran through the forest Dick looked upon faces brown with the sun and eyes gleaming with the fierce passion of victory and revenge They were going to avenge Henry and Donelson and all the long and mortifying retreat from Kentucky Dick saw them straining and looking eagerly at their officers for the word to advance As if by a concerted signal the long and mellow peal of many trumpets came from the front the officers uttered the shout to charge the wild and terrible rebel yell swelled from forty thousand throats and the Southern army rushed upon its foe The red dawn of Shiloh had come CHAPTER XV THE RED DAWN OF SHILOH Dick stood appalled when he heard that terrible shout in the dawn and the crash of cannon and rifles rolling down upon the Union lines It was already a shout of triumph and as he gazed he saw through the woods the red line of flame sweeping on without a halt The surprise had been complete Hardee leading the Southern advance struck Peabody s Northern brigade and smashed it up instantly The men did not have time to seize their rifles They had no chance to form into ranks and the officers themselves as they shouted commands were struck down Men killed or wounded were falling everywhere Almost before they had time to draw a free breath the remnants of the brigade were driven upon those behind it Hardee also rushed upon Sherman but there he found a foe of tough mettle The man who had foreseen the enormous extent of the war although taken by surprise too did not lose his courage or presence of mind His men had time to seize their arms and he formed a hasty line of battle He also had the forethought to send word to the general in his rear to close up the gap between him and the next general in the line Then he shifted one of his own brigades until there was a ravine in front of it to protect his men and he hurried a battery to his flank Never was Napoleon s maxim that men are nothing a man is everything more justified and never did the genius of Sherman shine more brilliantly than on that morning It was he alone cool of mind and steady in the face of overwhelming peril who first faced the Southern rush He inspired his troops with his own courage and though pale of face they bent forward to meet the red whirlwind that was rushing down upon them Like a blaze running through dry grass the battle extended in almost an instant along the whole front and the deep woods were filled with the roar of eighty thousand men in conflict And Grant as at Donelson was far away The thunder and blaze of the battle increased swiftly and to a frightful extent The Southern generals eager alert and full of success pushed in all their troops The surprised Northern army was giving away at all points except where Sherman stood Hardee continuing his rush broke the Northern line asunder and his brigades wrapping themselves around Sherman strove to destroy him Although he saw his lines crumbling away before him Sherman never flinched The ravine in front of him and rough ground on one side defended him to a certain extent The men fired their rifles as fast as they could load and reload and the cannon on their flanks never ceased to pour shot and shell into the ranks of their opponents The gunners were shot down but new ones rose at once in their place The fiercest conflict yet seen on American soil was raging here North would not yield South ever rushed anew to the attack and a vast cloud of mingled flame and smoke enclosed them both Dick had stood as if petrified staring at the billows of flame while the thunder of great armies in battle stunned his ears He realized suddenly that he was alone Colonel Kenton had said the night before that he did not know what to do with him but that he would find a way in the morning But he had been forgotten and he knew it was natural that he should be His fate was but a trifle in the mighty event that was passing There was no time for any one in the Southern army to bother about him Then he understood too that he was free The whole Orphan Brigade had passed on into the red heart of the battle and had left him there alone Now his mind leaped out of its paralysis All his senses became alert In that vast whirlwind of fire and smoke no one would notice that a single youth was stealing through the forest in an effort to rejoin his own people Action followed swift upon thought He curved about in the woods and then ran rapidly toward the point where the fire seemed thinnest He did not check his pace until he had gone at least a mile Then he paused to see if he could tell how the battle was going Its roar seemed louder than ever in his ears and in front of him was a vast red line which extended an unseen distance through the forest Now and then the wild and thrilling rebel yell rose above the roar of cannon and the crash of rifles Dick saw with a sinking of the heart and yet he had known that it would be so that the red line of flame had moved deeper into the heart of the Northern camp It had passed the Northern outposts and at many points it had swept over the Northern center He feared that there was but a huddled and confused mass beyond it He saw something lying at his feet It was a Confederate military cloak which some officer had cast off as he rushed to the charge He picked it up threw it about his own shoulders and then tossed away his cap If he fell in with Confederate troops they would not know him from one of their own and it was no time now to hold cross examinations He took a wide curve and after another mile came to a hillock upon which he stood a little while panting Again he was appalled at the sight he beheld Bull Run and Donelson were small beside this Here eighty thousand men were locked fast in furious conflict Raw and undisciplined many of these farmer lads of the west and south were but in battle they showed a courage and tenacity not surpassed by the best trained troops that ever lived The floating smoke reached Dick where he stood and stung his eyes and a powerful odor of burned gunpowder assailed his nostrils But neither sight nor odors held him back Instead they drew him on with overwhelming force He must rejoin his own and do his best however little it counted in the whole It was now well on into the morning of a brilliant and hot Sunday He did not know it but the combat was raging fiercest then around the little church which should have been sacred Drawing a deep breath of an air which was shot with fire and smoke and which was hot to his lungs Dick began to run again Almost before he noticed it he was running by the side of a Southern regiment which had been ordered to veer about and attack some new point in the Northern line Keeping his presence of mind he shouted with them as they rushed on and presently dropped away from them in the smoke He was conscious now of a new danger Twigs and bits of bark began to rain down upon him and he heard the unpleasant whistle of bullets over his head They were the bullets of his own people seeking to repel the Southern charge A minute later a huge shell burst near him covering him with flying earth At first he thought he had been hit by fragments of the shell but when he shook himself he found that he was all right He took yet a wider curve and before he was aware of the treacherous ground plunged into a swamp bordering one of the creeks He stood for a few moments in mud and water to his waist but he knew that he had passed from the range of the Union fire Twigs and bark no longer fell around him and that most unpleasant whizz of bullets was gone He pulled himself out of the mire and ran along the edge of the creek toward the roar of the battle He knew now that he had passed around the flank of the Southern army and could approach the flank of his own He ran fast and then began to hear bullets again But now they were coming from the Southern army He threw away the cloak and presently he emerged into a mass of men who under the continual urging of their officers were making a desperate defense firing drawing back reloading and firing again In front the woods swarmed with the Southern troops who drove incessantly upon them Dick snatched up a rifle plenty were lying upon the ground where the owners had fallen with them and fired into the attacking ranks Then he reloaded swiftly and pressed on toward the Union center What troops are these he asked of an officer who was knotting a handkerchief about a bleeding wrist From Illinois Who are you I m Lieutenant Richard Mason of Colonel Arthur Winchester s Kentucky regiment I was taken prisoner by the enemy last night but I escaped this morning Do you know where my regiment is Keep straight on and you ll strike it or what s left of it if anything at all is left It s a black day Dick scarcely caught his last words as he dashed on through bullets shell and solid shot over slain men and horses over dismantled guns and gun carriages and into the very heart of the flame and smoke The thunder of the battle was at its height now because he was in the center of it The roar of the great guns was continuous but the unbroken crash of rifles by the scores of thousands was fiercer and more deadly The officer had pointed toward the Kentucky regiment with his sword and following the line Dick ran directly into it The very first face he saw was that of Colonel Winchester Dick my lad shouted the Colonel where have you come from From the Southern army I was taken prisoner last night almost within sight of our own but when they charged this morning they forgot me and here I am Colonel Winchester suddenly seized him by the shoulders and pushed him down The regiment was behind a small ridge which afforded some protection and all were lying down except the senior officers Welcome Dick to our hot little camp The chances are about a hundred per cent out of a hundred per cent that this is the hottest place on the earth today The long thin figure of Warner lay pressed against the ground A handkerchief stained red was bound about his head and his face was pale but indomitable courage gleamed from his eyes Just beyond him was Pennington unhurt Thank God you haven t fallen and that I ve found you exclaimed Dick I don t know whether you re so lucky after all said Warner The Johnnies have been mowing us down They dropped on us so suddenly this morning that they must have been sleeping in the same bed with us last night and we didn t know it I hear that we re routed nearly everywhere except here and where Sherman stands 
6538_81858_000014_000007	train-clean-360	Look out 
none	none	Here they come again They saw tanned faces and fierce eyes through the smoke and the bullets swept down on them in showers Lucky for them that the little ridge was there and that they had made up their minds to stand to the last They replied with their own deadly fire yet many fell despite the shelter and to both left and right the battle swelled afresh Dick felt again that rain of bark and twigs and leaves Sometimes a tree cut through at its base by cannon balls fell with a crash Along the whole curving line the Southern generals ever urged forward their valiant troops Now the courage and skill of Sherman shone supreme Dick saw him often striding up and down the lines ordering and begging his men to stand fast although they were looking almost into the eyes of their enemies The conflict became hand to hand and assailant and assailed reeled to and fro But Sherman would not give up The fiercest attacks broke in vain on his iron front McClernand with whom he had quarreled the day before as to who should command the army while Grant was away came up with reinforcements and seeing what the fearless and resolute general had done yielded him the place The last of the charges broke for the time upon Sherman and his exhausted regiment uttered a shout of triumph but on both sides of him the Southern troops drove their enemy back and yet further back Breckinridge along Lick Creek was pushing everything before him The bishop general was doing well Many of the Northern troops had not yet recovered from their surprise A general and three whole regiments struck on every side were captured It seemed that nothing could deprive the Southern army of victory absolute and complete General Johnston had marshalled his troops with superb skill and intending to reap the full advantage of the surprise he continually pushed them forward upon the shattered Northern lines He led in person and on horseback the attack upon the Federal center Around and behind him rode his staff and the wild rebel yell swept again through the forest when the soldiers saw the stern and lofty features of the chief whom they trusted leading them on But fate in the very moment of triumph that seemed overwhelming and sure was preparing a terrible blow for the South A bullet struck Johnston in the ankle His boot filled with blood and the wound continued to bleed fast But despite the urging of his surgeon who rode with him he refused to dismount and have the wound bound up How could he dismount at such a time when the battle was at its height and the Union army was being driven into the creeks and swamps He was wounded again by a piece of shell and he sank dying from his horse His officers crowded around him seeking to hide their irreparable loss from the soldiers the most costly death with the exception of Stonewall Jackson s sustained by the Confederacy in the whole war But the troops borne on by the impetus that success and the spirit of Johnston had given them drove harder than ever against the Northern line They crashed through it in many places seizing prisoners and cannon Almost the whole Northern camp was now in their possession and many of the Southern lads hungry from scanty rations stopped to seize the plenty that they found there but enough persisted to give the Northern army no rest and press it back nearer and nearer to the marshes The combat redoubled around Sherman Johnston was gone but his generals still shared his resolution They turned an immense fire upon the point where stood Sherman and McClernand now united by imminent peril Their ranks were searched by shot and shell and the bullets whizzed among them like a continuous swarm of hornets Dick was still unwounded but so much smoke and vapor had drifted about his face that he was compelled at times to rub his eyes that he might see He felt a certain dizziness too and he did not know whether the incessant roaring in his ears came wholly from the cannon and rifle fire or partly from the pounding of his blood I feel that we are shaking he shouted in the ears of Warner who lay next to him I m afraid we re going to give ground I feel it too Warner shouted back We ve been here for hours but we re shot to pieces Half of our men must be killed or wounded but how old Sherman fights The Southern leaders brought up fresh troops and hurled them upon Sherman Again the combat was hand to hand and to the right and left the supports of the indomitable Northern general were being cut away Those brigades who had proved their mettle at Donelson and who had long stood fast were attacked so violently that they gave way and the victors hurled themselves upon Sherman s flank Dick and his two young comrades perceived through the flame and smoke the new attack It seemed to Dick that they were being enclosed now by the whole Southern army and he felt a sense of suffocation He was dizzy from such a long and terrible strain and so much danger and he was not really more than half conscious He was loading and firing his rifle mechanically but he always aimed at something in the red storm before them although he never knew whether he hit or missed and was glad of it The division of Sherman had been standing there seven hours sustaining with undaunted courage the resolute attacks of the Southern army but the sixth sense warning Dick that it had begun to shake at last was true The sun had now passed the zenith and was pouring intense and fiery rays upon the field sometimes piercing the clouds of smoke and revealing the faces of the men black with sweat and burned gunpowder A cry arose for Grant Why did not their chief show himself upon the field Was so great a battle to be fought with him away And where was Buell He had a second great army He was to join them that day What good would it be for him to come tomorrow Many of them laughed in bitter derision And there was Lew Wallace too They had heard that he was near the field with a strong division Then why did he not come upon it and face the enemy Again they laughed that fierce and bitter laugh deep down in their throats The attack upon Sherman never ceased for an instant Now he was assailed not only from the front but from both flanks and some even gaining the rear struck blows upon his division there One brigade upon his left was compelled to give way scattered and lost its guns The right wing was also driven in and the center yielded slowly although retaining its cohesion The three lads were on their feet now and it seemed to them that everything was lost They could see the battle in front of them only but rumors came to them that the army was routed elsewhere But neither Sherman nor McClernand would yield save for the slow retreat yielding ground foot by foot only And there were many unknown heroes around them Sergeant Whitley blazed with courage and spirit We could be worse off than we are he shouted to Dick General Buell s army may yet come Maybe we could be worse off than we are but I don t see how it s possible shouted Dick in return a certain grim humor possessing him for the moment Look What I said has come true already shouted the sergeant Here is shelter that will help us to make a new stand In their slow retreat they reached two low hills between which a small ravine ran It was not a strong position but Sherman used it to the utmost His men fired from the protecting crests of the hills and he filled the ravine with riflemen who poured a deadly fire upon their assailants Now Sherman ordered them to stand fast to the last man because it was by this road that the division of Lew Wallace must come if it came at all But Southern brigades followed them and the battle raged anew as fierce and deadly as ever Although their army was routed at many points the Northern officers showed indomitable courage Driven back in the forest they always strove to form the lines anew and now their efforts began to show some success Their resistance on the right hardened and on the left they held fast to the last chain of hills that covered the wharves and their stores at the river landing As they took position here two gunboats in the river began to send huge shells over their heads at the attacking Southern columns maintaining a rapid and heavy fire which shook assailants and strengthened defenders Again the water had come to the help of the North and at the most critical moment The whole Northern line was now showing a firmer front and Grant himself was directing the battle Fortune which had played a game with Grant at Donelson played a far greater one with him on the far greater field of Shiloh The red dawn of Shiloh when Johnston was sweeping his army before him had found him at Savannah far from the field of battle The hardy and vigorous Nelson had arrived there in the night with Buell s vanguard and Grant had ordered it to march at speed the next day to join his own army But he himself did not reach the field of Shiloh until ten o clock when the fiercest battle yet known on the American continent had been raging for several hours Grant and his staff as they rode away from his headquarters heard the booming of cannon in the direction of Shiloh Some of them thought it was a mere skirmish but it came continuously like rolling thunder and their trained ears told them that it rose from a line miles in length One seeks to penetrate the mind of a commanding general at such a time and see what his feelings were Again the battle had been joined and was at its height and he away Those trained ears told him also that the rolling thunder of the cannon was steadily moving toward them It could mean only that the Northern army had been driven from its camp and that the Southern army was pushing its victory to the utmost In those moments his agony must have been intense His great army not only attacked but beaten and he not there He and his staff urged their horses forward seeking to gain from them new ounces of speed but the country was difficult The hills were rough and there were swamps and mire And as they listened the roar of battle steadily came nearer and nearer There was no break in the Northern retreat The sweat not of heat but of mental agony stood upon their faces Grant was not the only one who suffered Now they met some of those stragglers who flee from every battlefield no matter what the nation Their faces were white with fear and they cried out that the Northern army was destroyed Officers cursed them and struck at them with the flats of their swords but they dodged the blows and escaped into the bushes There was no time to pursue them Grant and his staff never ceased to ride toward the storm of battle which raged far and wide around the little church of Shiloh The stream of fugitives increased and now they saw swarms of men who stood here and there not running but huddled and irresolute Never did Fortune who brought this her favorite from the depths bring him again in her play so near to the verge of destruction When he came upon the field the battle seemed wholly lost and the whole world would have cried that he was to blame But the bulldog in Grant was never of stauncher breed than on that day His face turned white and he grew sick at the sight of the awful slaughter A bullet broke the small sword at his side but he did not flinch Preserving the stern calm that always marked him on the field he began to form his lines anew and strengthen the weaker points Yet the condition of his army would have appalled a weaker will It had been driven back three miles His whole camp had been taken His second line also had been driven in Many thousands of men had fallen and other thousands had been taken Thirty of his cannon were in the hands of the enemy and although noon had now come and gone there was no sound to betoken the coming of the troops led by Wallace or Nelson Well might Grant s own stout heart have shrunk appalled from the task before him Wallace was held back by confused orders pardonable at such a time The eager Nelson was detained at Savannah by Buell who thought that the sounds of the engagement they heard in the Shiloh woods was a minor affair and who wanted Nelson to wait for boats to take him there It seemed sometimes to Dick long afterward when the whole of the great Shiloh battle became clear that Fortune was merely playing a game of chess with the earth as a board and the armies as pawns Grant s army was ambushed with its general absent The other armies which were almost at hand were delayed for one reason or another While as for the South the genius that had planned the attack and that had carried it forward was quenched in death when victory was at its height But for the present the lad had little time for such thoughts as these The success of Sherman in holding the new position infused new courage into him and those around him The men in gray wearied with their immense exertions and having suffered frightful losses themselves abated somewhat the energy and fierceness of their attack The dissolved Northern regiments had time to reform Grant seized a new position along a line of hills in front of which ran a deep ravine filled with brushwood He and his officers appreciated the advantage and they massed the troops there as fast as they could Now Fortune after having brought Grant to the verge of the pit was disposed to throw chances in his way The hills and the ravine were one Another and most important it was was the presence of guns of the heaviest calibre landed some days ago from the fleet and left there until their disposition could be determined A quick witted colonel Webster by name gathered up all the gunners who had lost their own guns and who had been driven back in the retreat and manned this great battery of siege guns just as the Southern generals were preparing to break down the last stand of the North Meanwhile a terrible rumor had been spreading in the ranks of the Southern troops The word was passed from soldier to soldier that their commander Johnston whom they had believed invincible had been killed and they did not trust so much Beauregard who was left in command nor those who helped Their fiery spirit abated somewhat There was no decrease of courage but continuous victory did not seem so easy now Confusion invaded the triumphant army also Beauregard had divided the leadership on the field among three of his lieutenants Hardee now urged on the center Bragg commanded the right and Polk the bishop general led the left It was Bragg s division that was about to charge the great battery of siege guns that the alert Webster had manned so quickly Five minutes more and Webster would have been too late Here again were the fortunes of Grant brought to the very verge of the pit The Northern gunboats at the mouth of Lick Creek moved forward a little and their guns were ready to support the battery The Kentucky regiment was wedged in between the battery and a brigade and it was gasping for breath Colonel Winchester slightly wounded in three places commanded his men to lie down and they gladly threw themselves upon the earth There was a momentary lull in the battle Wandering winds caught up the banks of smoke and carried most of them away Dick as he rose a little saw the Southern troops massing in the forest for an attack upon their new position They seemed to be only a few yards away and he clearly observed the officers walking along the front of the lines It flashed upon him that they must hold these hills or Grant s army would perish Where was Buell Why did he not come If the Southerners destroyed one Northern army today they would destroy another tomorrow They would break the two halves of the Union force in the west into pieces first one and then the other What do you see Dick asked Warner who was lying almost flat upon his face The Confederate army is getting ready to wipe us off the face of the earth Up with your rifle George They ll be upon us in two minutes They heard a sudden shout behind them It was a glad shout and well it might be Nelson held back by Buell s orders had listened long to the booming of the cannon off in the direction of Shiloh Nothing could convince him that a great battle was not going on and all through the morning he chafed and raged And as the sound of the cannon grew louder he believed that Grant s army was losing Nelson obtained Buell s leave at last to march for Shiloh but it was a long road across hills and creeks and through swamps The cannon sank deep in the mire and then the ardent Nelson left them behind Now he knew there was great need for haste The flashing and thundering in front of them showed to the youngest soldier in his command that a great battle was in progress and that it was going against the North His division at last reached Pittsburg Landing and was carried across the river in the steamers One brigade led by Ammen outstripped the rest and rushed in behind the great battery and to its support just as the Southern bugles once more sounded the charge Dick shouted with joy too when he saw the new troops The next moment the enemy was upon them charging directly through a frightful discharge from the great guns The riddled regiments which had fought so long gave way before the bayonets but the fresh troops took their places and poured a terrible fire into the assaulting columns And the great guns of the battery hurled a new storm of shell and solid shot The ranks of the Southern troops worn by a full day of desperate fighting were broken They had crossed the ravine into the very mouths of the Northern guns but now they were driven back into the ravine and across it Cannon and rifles rained missiles upon them there and they withdrew into the woods while for the first time in all that long day a shout of triumph rose from the Union lines Another lull came in the battle What are they doing now Dick asked the Vermonter I can t see very well but they seem to be gathering in the forest for a fresh attack Do you know George that the sun is almost down It s certainly time It s been at least a month since the Johnnies ran out of the forest in the dawn and jumped on us It was true that the day was almost over although but few had noticed the fact The east was already darkening and a rosy glow from the west fell across the torn forest Here and there a dead tree set on fire by the shells burned slowly little flames creeping along trunk and boughs Bragg was preparing to hurl his entire force upon Sherman and the battery At that moment Beauregard now his chief arrived But a few minutes of daylight were left and the swarthy Louisianian looked at the great losses in his own ranks He believed that the army of Buell was so far away that it could not arrive that night and he withheld the charge The Southern army withdrew a little into the woods the night rushed down and Shiloh s terrible first day was over 
6538_81858_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XVI 
none	none	THE FIERCE FINISH OF SHILOH Dick who had been lying under cover just behind the crest of one of the low ridges suddenly heard the loud beating of his heart He did not know for a moment or two that the sound came so distinctly because the mighty tumult which had been raging around him all day had ceased as if by a concerted signal 
6538_81858_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Those blinding flashes of flame no longer came from the forest before him the shot and shell quit their horrible screaming and the air was free from the unpleasant hiss of countless bullets 
6538_81858_000004_000000	train-clean-360	He stretched himself a little and stood up 
none	none	The lads all around him were standing up and were beginning to talk to each other in the high pitched shouting voices that they had been compelled to use all day long not yet realizing to the full that the tumult of the battle had ceased 
6538_81858_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The boy felt stiff and sore in every bone and muscle and although the cannon and rifles were silent there was still a hollow roaring in his ears 
none	none	His eyes were yet dim from the smoke and his head felt heavy and dull He gazed vacantly at the forest in front of him and wondered dimly why the Southern army was not still there attacking as it had attacked for so many hours 
6538_81858_000005_000000	train-clean-360	But the deep woods were silent and empty 
6538_81858_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Coils and streamers of smoke floated about among the trees and suddenly a gray squirrel hopped out on a bough and began to chatter wildly 
6538_81858_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Dick despite himself laughed but the laugh was hysterical 
6538_81858_000005_000003	train-clean-360	He could appreciate the feelings of the squirrel which probably had been imprisoned in a hollow of the tree all day long listening to this tremendous battle and squirrels were not used to such battles 
6538_81858_000005_000004	train-clean-360	It was a trifle that made him laugh but everything was out of proportion now 
none	none	Life did not go on in the usual way at all 
6538_81858_000005_000006	train-clean-360	The ordinary occupations were gone and people spent most of their time trying to kill one another 
6538_81858_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He rubbed his hands across his eyes and cleared them of the smoke 
none	none	The battle was certainly over for the day at least and neither he nor his comrades had sufficient vitality yet to think of the morrow The twilight was fast deepening into night 
6538_81858_000006_000003	train-clean-360	The last rosy glow of the sun faded and thick darkness enveloped the vast forest in which twenty thousand men had fallen and in which most of them yet lay the wounded with the dead 
none	none	There was presently a deep boom from the river and a shell fired by one of the gunboats curved far over their heads and dropped into the forest where the Southern army was encamped All through the night and at short but regular intervals the gunboats maintained this warning fire heartening the Union soldiers and telling them at every discharge that however they might have to fight for the land the water was always theirs 
6538_81858_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Dick saw Colonel Winchester going among his men and pulling himself together he saluted his chief 
none	none	Any orders sir he said No Dick my boy none for the present replied the colonel a little sadly Half of my poor regiment is killed or wounded and the rest are so exhausted that they are barely able to move 
6538_81858_000010_000002	train-clean-360	But they fought magnificently Dick 
6538_81858_000010_000003	train-clean-360	They had to or be crushed 
6538_81858_000010_000004	train-clean-360	It is only here that we have withstood the rush of the Southern army and it is probable that we too would have gone had not night come to our help 
none	none	Then we have been beaten
6538_81858_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Dick we have been beaten and beaten badly 
6538_81858_000012_000001	train-clean-360	It was the surprise that did it 
none	none	How on earth we could have let the Southern army creep upon us and strike unaware I don t understand But Dick my boy there will be another battle tomorrow and it may tell a different tale Some prisoners whom we have taken say that Johnston has been killed and Beauregard is no such leader as he Will the army of General Buell reach us tonight Buell himself is here He has been with Grant for some time and all his brigades are marching at the double quick Lew Wallace arrived less than half an hour ago with seven thousand men fresh and eager for battle Dick 
6538_81858_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Dick my boy we ll have forty thousand new troops on the field at the next dawn and before God we ll wipe out the disgrace of today 
6538_81858_000014_000005	train-clean-360	Listen to the big guns from the boats as they speak at intervals Why I can understand the very words they speak 
6538_81858_000014_000006	train-clean-360	They are saying to the Southern army Look out 
none	none	Look out We re coming in the morning and it s we who ll attack now Dick saw that Colonel Winchester himself was excited The pupils of his eyes were dilated and a red spot glowed in either cheek Like all the other officers he was stung by the surprise and defeat and he could barely wait for the morning and revenge 
6538_81858_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Colonel Winchester walked away to a council that had been called and Dick turned to Pennington and Warner who were not hurt save for slight wounds 
none	none	Warner had recovered his poise and was soon as calm and dry as ever
6538_81858_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Dick he said we re some distance from where we started this morning 
6538_81858_000017_000001	train-clean-360	There s nothing like being shoved along when you don t want to go 
none	none	The next time they tell me there s nothing in a thicket I expect to search it and find a rebel army at least a hundred thousand strong right in the middle of it
6538_81858_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 How large do you suppose the Southern army was asked Pennington 
none	none	I had a number of looks at it replied Warner and I should say from the way it acted that it numbered at least three million men I know that at times not less than ten thousand were aiming their rifles at my own poor and unworthy person What a waste of energy for so many men to shoot at me all at once I wish the Johnnies would go away and let us alone 
6538_81858_000020_000000	train-clean-360	The last words were high pitched and excited 
none	none	His habitual self control broke down for a moment and the tremendous excitement and nervous tension of the day found vent in his voice 
6538_81858_000020_000002	train-clean-360	But in a few seconds he recovered himself and looked rather ashamed 
6538_81858_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Boys he said I apologize 
none	none	You needn t said Pennington
6538_81858_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 There have been times today when I felt brave as a lion and lots of other times I was scared most to death It would have helped me a lot then if I could have opened my mouth and yelled at the top of my voice 
none	none	Sergeant Daniel Whitley was leaning against a stump and while he was calmly lighting a pipe he regarded the three boys with a benevolent gaze None of you need be ashamed of bein scared he said I ve been in a lot of fights myself though all of them were mere skirmishes when put alongside of this an I ve been scared a heap today 
6538_81858_000024_000002	train-clean-360	I ve been scared for myself an I ve been scared for the regiment an I ve been scared for the whole army an I ve been scared on general principles but here we are alive an kickin an we ought to feel powerful thankful for that 
none	none	We are said Dick Then he rubbed his head as if some sudden thought had occurred to him
6538_81858_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it Dick asked Warner 
none	none	I ve realized all at once that I m tremendously hungry 
6538_81858_000027_000001	train-clean-360	The Confederates broke up our breakfast 
6538_81858_000027_000002	train-clean-360	We never had time to think of dinner and now its nothing to eat 
6538_81858_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Me too said Pennington 
6538_81858_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 If you were to hit me in the stomach I d give back a hollow sound like a drum 
6538_81858_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Why don t somebody ring the supper bell 
none	none	But fires were soon lighted along their whole front and provisions were brought up from the rear and from the steamers The soldiers feeling their strength returning ate ravenously 
6538_81858_000029_000002	train-clean-360	They also talked much of the battle 
none	none	Many of them were yet under the influence of hysterical excitement They told extraordinary stories of the things they had seen and done and they believed all they told were true They ate fiercely at first almost like wolves but after a while they resolved into their true state as amiable young human beings and were ashamed of themselves All the while Buell s army of the Ohio was passing over the river and joining Grant s army of the Tennessee 
6538_81858_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Regiment after regiment and brigade after brigade crossed 
none	none	The guns that Nelson had been forced to leave behind were also brought up and were taken over with the other batteries While the shattered remnants of the army of the Tennessee were resting the fresh army of the Ohio was marching by it in the late hours of the night in order to face the Southern foe in the morning The Southern army itself lay deep in the woods from which it had driven its enemy Always the assailant through the day its losses had been immense 
6538_81858_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Many thousands had fallen and no new troops were coming to take their place 
6538_81858_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Continual reinforcements came to the North throughout the night not a soldier came to the South 
6538_81858_000031_000004	train-clean-360	Beauregard at dawn would have to face twice his numbers at least half of whom were fresh troops 
none	none	Another conference was held by the Southern generals in the forest but now the central figure the great Johnston was gone 
6538_81858_000032_000001	train-clean-360	The others however summoned their courage anew and passed the whole night arranging their forces cheering the men and preparing for the morn Their scouts and skirmishers kept watch on the Northern camp and the Southerners believed that while they had whipped only one army the day before they could whip two on the morrow 
none	none	Dick and his friends meanwhile were lying on the earth resting but not able to sleep 
6538_81858_000033_000001	train-clean-360	The nerves drawn so tightly by the day s work were not yet relaxed wholly 
none	none	A deep apathy seized them all Dick from a high point on which he lay saw the dark surface of the Tennessee and the lights on the puffing steamers as they crossed bearing the Army of the Ohio His mind did not work actively now but he felt that they were saved 
6538_81858_000033_000005	train-clean-360	The deep river although it was on their flank seemed to flow as a barrier against the foe and it was in fact a barrier more and more as without its command the second Union army could never have come to the relief of the first 
6538_81858_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Dick after a while saw Colonel Winchester and other officers near him 
6538_81858_000034_000001	train-clean-360	They were talking of their losses 
none	none	They gave the names of many generals and colonels who had been killed Presently they moved away and he fell into an uneasy sleep or rather doze from which he was awakened after a while by a heavy rumbling sound of a distant cannonade The boy sprang up wondering why any one should wish to renew the battle in the middle of the night and then he saw that it was no battle The sound was thunder rolling heavily on the southern horizon and the night had become very dark Vivid flashes of lightning cut the sky and a strong wind rushed among the trees Heavy drops of water struck him in the face and then the rain swept down Dick did not seek protection from the storm nor did any of those near him The cool drops were grateful to their faces after the heat and strife of the day 
6538_81858_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Their pulses became stronger and the blood flowed in a quickened torrent through their veins 
none	none	They let it pour upon them merely seeking to keep their ammunition dry Ten thousand wounded were yet lying untouched in the forest but the rain was grateful to them too When they could they turned their fevered faces up to it that it might beat upon them and bring grateful coolness Deep in the night a council like that of the Southern generals was held in the Northern camp also 
6538_81858_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Grant his face an expressionless mask presided and said but little 
none	none	Buell Sherman McClernand Nelson Wallace and others were there and Buell and Sherman like their chief spoke little 
6538_81858_000038_000003	train-clean-360	The three men upon whom most rested were very taciturn that night but it is likely that extraordinary thoughts were passing in the minds of every one of the three 
6538_81858_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Grant after a day in which any one of a dozen chances would have wrecked him must have concluded that in very deed and truth he was the favorite child of Fortune 
none	none	When one is saved again and again from the very verge he begins to believe that failure is impossible and in that very belief lies the greatest guard against failure It is said of Grant that in the night after his great defeat around the church of Shiloh he was still confident that he told his generals they would certainly win on the morrow and he reminded them that if the Union army had suffered terribly the Southern army must have suffered almost equally so and would face them at dawn with numbers far less than their own He had not displayed the greatest skill but he had shown the greatest moral courage and now on the night between battles it was that quality that was needed most 
6538_81858_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Dick not having slept any the night before and having passed through a day of fierce battle was overcome after midnight and sank into a sleep that was mere lethargy 
6538_81858_000041_000001	train-clean-360	He awoke once before dawn and remembered but vaguely all that had happened 
6538_81858_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Yet he was conscious that there was much movement in the forest 
none	none	He heard the tread of many feet the sound of commands the neigh of horses and the rumbling of cannon wheels The Army of the Ohio was passing to the exposed flank of the Army of the Tennessee and at dawn it would all be in line He also caught flitting glimpses of the Tennessee and of the steamers loaded with troops still crossing and he heard the boom of the heavy cannon on the gunboats which still at regular and short intervals sent huge shells curving into the forest toward the camp of the Southern army He also saw near him Warner and Pennington sound asleep on the ground and then he sank back into his own lethargic slumber 
6538_81858_000042_000000	train-clean-360	He was awakened by the call of a trumpet and as he rose he saw the whole regiment or rather what was left of it rising with him 
none	none	It was not yet dawn and a light rain was falling but smoldering fires disclosed the ground for some distance and also the river on which the gunboats and transports were now gathered in a fleet 
6538_81858_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Colonel Winchester beckoned to him 
6538_81858_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 All right this morning Dick he said 
none	none	Yes sir I m ready for my duty
6538_81858_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 And you too Warner and Pennington 
none	none	We are sir they replied together
6538_81858_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Then keep close beside me 
none	none	I don t know when I may want you for a message Daybreak will be here in a half hour The entire Army of the Ohio led by General Buell in person will be in position then or very shortly afterward and a new and we hope a very different battle will begin Food and coffee were served to the men and while the rain was still falling they formed in line and awaited the dawn The desire to retrieve their fortunes was as strong among the farmer lads as it was among the officers who took care to spread among them the statement that Buell s army alone was as numerous as the Southern force and probably more numerous since their enemy must have sustained terrible losses Thus they stood patiently while the rain thinned and the sun at last showed a red edge through floating clouds They waited yet a little while longer and then the boom of a heavy gun in the forest told them that the enemy was advancing to begin the battle afresh Again it was the Southern army that attacked although it was no surprise now 
6538_81859_000000_000002	train-clean-360	Yet Beauregard and his generals were still sanguine of completing the victory 
6538_81859_000000_000003	train-clean-360	Their scouts and skirmishers had failed to discover that the entire army of Buell also was now in front of them 
none	none	Bragg was gathering his division on the left to hurl it like a thunderbolt upon Grant s shattered brigades Hardee and the bishop general were in the center and Breckinridge led the right 
6538_81859_000001_000002	train-clean-360	But as they moved forward to attack the Union troops came out to meet them Nelson had occupied the high ground between Lick and Owl Creeks and his and the Southern troops met in a fierce clash shortly after dawn 
6538_81859_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Beauregard drawn by the firing at that point and noticing the courage and tenacity with which the Northern troops held their ground sending in volley after volley divined at once that these were not the beaten troops of the day before but new men 
6538_81859_000002_000001	train-clean-360	This swarthy general volatile and dramatic nevertheless had great penetration 
6538_81859_000002_000002	train-clean-360	He understood on the instant a fact that his soldiers did not comprehend until later 
6538_81859_000002_000003	train-clean-360	He knew that the whole army of Buell was now before him 
none	none	For the moment it was Beauregard and Buell who were the protagonists instead of Grant and Johnston as on the day before The Southern leader gathered all his forces and hurled them upon Nelson Weary though the Southern soldiers were their attack was made with utmost fire and vigor 
6538_81859_000003_000003	train-clean-360	A long and furious combat ensued 
none	none	A Southern division under Cheatham rushed to the help of their fellows Buell s forces were driven in again and again and only his heavy batteries enabled him to regain his lost ground 
6538_81859_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Buell led splendid troops that he had trained long and rigidly and they had not been in the conflict the day before 
none	none	Fresh and with unbroken ranks not a man wounded or missing they had entered the battle and both Grant and Buell as well as their division commanders expected an easy victory where the Army of the Ohio stood Buell to his amazement saw himself reduced to the defensive 
6538_81859_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He and Grant had reckoned that the decimated brigades of the South could not stand at all before him but just as on the first day they came on with the fierce rebel yell hurling themselves upon superior numbers taking the cannon of their enemy losing them and retaking them and losing them again but never yielding 
6538_81859_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The great conflict increased in violence 
6538_81859_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Buell a man of iron courage saw that his soldiers must fight to the uttermost not for victory only but even to ward off defeat 
none	none	The dawn was now far advanced The rain had ceased and the sun again shot down sheaves of fiery rays upon a vast low cloud of fire and smoke in which thousands of men met in desperate combat 
6538_81859_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Nine o clock came 
none	none	It had been expected by Grant that Buell long before that time would have swept everything before him But for three hours Buell had been fighting to keep himself from being swept away The Southern troops seemed animated by that extraordinary battle fever and absolute contempt of death which distinguished them so often during this war Buell s army was driven in on both flanks and only the center held fast It began to seem possible that the South despite her reduced ranks might yet defeat both Northern armies 
6538_81859_000007_000006	train-clean-360	Another battery dashed up to the relief of the men in blue 
6538_81859_000007_000007	train-clean-360	It was charged at once by the men in gray so fiercely that the gunners were glad to escape with their guns and once more the wild rebel yell of triumph swelled through the southern forest 
6538_81859_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Dick standing with his comrades on one of the ridges that they had defended so well listened to the roar of conflict on the wing ever increasing in volume and watched the vast clouds of smoke gathering over the forest 
6538_81859_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He could see from where he stood the flash of rifle fire and the blaze of cannon and both eye and ear told him that the battle was not moving back upon the South 
none	none	It seems that we do not make headway sir he said to Colonel Winchester who also stood by him looking and listening
6538_81859_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Not that I can perceive replied the colonel and yet with the rush of forty thousand fresh troops of ours upon the field I deemed victory quick and easy 
6538_81859_000010_000001	train-clean-360	How the battle grows 
6538_81859_000010_000002	train-clean-360	How the South fights 
none	none	Colonel Winchester walked away presently and joined Sherman who was eagerly watching the mighty conflict into which he knew that his own worn and shattered troops must sooner or later be drawn 
6538_81859_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He walked up and down in front of his lines saying little but seeing everything 
none	none	His tall form was seen by all his men 
6538_81859_000011_000003	train-clean-360	He too must have felt a singular thrill at that moment 
6538_81859_000011_000004	train-clean-360	He must have known that his star was rising 
none	none	He more than any other with his valor penetrating mind and decision had saved the Northern army from complete destruction the first day at Shiloh 
6538_81859_000011_000006	train-clean-360	He had not been able to avert defeat but he had prevented utter ruin 
6538_81859_000011_000007	train-clean-360	His division alone had held together in the face of the Southern attack until night came 
6538_81859_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Sherman must have recalled too how his statement that the North would need two hundred thousand troops in the west alone had been sneered at and he had been called mad 
6538_81859_000012_000001	train-clean-360	But he neither boasted nor predicted continuing to watch intently the swelling battle 
none	none	I had enough fighting yesterday to last me a hundred years said Warner to Dick but it seems that I m to have more today If the Johnnies had any regard for the rules of war they d have retreated long ago
6538_81859_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll win yet said Dick hopefully but I don t think we can achieve any big victory 
6538_81859_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Look there s General Grant himself 
6538_81859_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Grant was passing along his whole line 
none	none	While leaving the main battle to Buell he retained general command and watched everything He too observed the failure of Buell s army to drive the enemy before them and he must have felt a sinking of the heart but he did not show it Instead he spoke only of victory when he made any comment at all and sent the members of his staff to make new arrangements He must bring into action every gun and man he had or he would yet lose It was now ten o clock and the new battle had lasted with the utmost fury and desperation for four hours Dick after General Grant rode on felt as if a sudden thrill had run through the whole army He saw men rising from the earth and tightening their belts He saw gunners gathering around their guns and making ready with the ammunition 
6538_81859_000016_000004	train-clean-360	He knew the remains of Grant s army were about to march upon the enemy helping the Army of the Ohio to achieve the task that had proved so great 
6538_81859_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Sherman McClernand and other generals now passed among their troops cheering them telling them that the time had come to win back what they had lost the day before and that victory was sure 
none	none	They called upon them for another great effort and a shout rolled along the line of willing soldiers 
6538_81859_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Sherman s whole division now raised itself up and rushed at the enemy Dick and his comrades in the front of their own regiment 
none	none	The whole Northern line was now engaged Grant true to his resolution had hurled every man and every gun upon his foe The Southern generals felt the immense weight of the numbers that were now driving down upon them 
6538_81859_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Their decimated ranks could not withstand the charge of two armies 
none	none	In the center where Buell s men having stood fast from the first were now advancing they were compelled to give way and lost several guns On the wings the heavy Northern brigades were advancing also and the whole Southern line was pushed back So much inferior was the South in numbers that her enemy began to overlap her on the flanks also A tremendous shout of exultation swept through the Northern ranks as they felt themselves advancing 
6538_81859_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The promises of their generals were coming true and there is nothing sweeter than victory after defeat Fortune after frowning upon her so long was now smiling upon the North 
6538_81859_000020_000002	train-clean-360	The exultant cheer swept through the ranks again and back came the defiant rebel yell 
none	none	A young soldier often feels what is happening with as true instinct as a general 
6538_81859_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Dick now knew that the North would recover the field and that the South cut down fearfully though having performed prodigies of valor must fight to save herself 
none	none	He felt that the resistance in front of them was no longer invincible He saw in the flash of the firing that the Southern ranks were thin very thin and he knew that there was no break in their own advance Now the sanguine Northern generals planned the entire destruction of the Southern army 
6538_81859_000022_000001	train-clean-360	There was only one road by which Beauregard could retreat to Corinth 
none	none	A whole Northern division rushed in to block the way Sherman in his advance came again to the ground around the little Methodist chapel of Shiloh which he had defended so well the day before and crowded his whole force upon the Southern line at that point Once more the primitive church in the woods looked down upon one of the most sanguinary conflicts of the whole war If Sherman could break through the Southern line here Beauregard s whole army would be lost But the Southern soldiers were capable of another and a mighty effort Their generals saw the danger and acted with their usual promptness and decision They gathered together their shattered brigades and hurled them like a thunderbolt upon the Union left and center 
6538_81859_000023_000002	train-clean-360	The shock was terrific 
none	none	Sherman with all his staunchness and the valor of his men was compelled to give way 
6538_81859_000023_000004	train-clean-360	McClernand too reeled back others were driven in also 
6538_81859_000023_000005	train-clean-360	Whole brigades and regiments were cut to pieces or thrown in confusion 
6538_81859_000023_000006	train-clean-360	The Southerners cut a wide gap in the Northern army through which they rushed in triumph holding the Corinth road against every attack and making their rear secure 
6538_81859_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Sherman s division after its momentary repulse gathered itself anew and although knowing now that the Southern army could not be entrapped drove again with all its might upon the positions around the church They passed over the dead of the day before and gathered increasing vigor as they saw that the enemy was slowly drawing back 
6538_81859_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Grant reformed his line which had been shattered by the last fiery and successful attack of the South 
none	none	Along the whole long line the trumpets sang the charge and brigades and batteries advanced But the end of Shiloh was at hand 
6538_81859_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Despite the prodigies of valor performed by their men the Southern generals saw that they could not longer hold the field 
6538_81859_000026_000002	train-clean-360	The junction of Grant and Buell after all had proved too much for them 
6538_81859_000026_000003	train-clean-360	The bugles sounded the retreat and reluctantly they gave up the ground which they had won with so much courage and daring 
6538_81859_000026_000004	train-clean-360	They retreated rather as victors than defeated men presenting a bristling front to the enemy until their regiments were lost in the forest and beating off every attempt of skirmishers or cavalry to molest them 
6538_81859_000027_000000	train-clean-360	It was the middle of the afternoon when the last shot was fired and the Southern army at its leisure resumed its march toward Corinth protected on the flanks by its cavalry and carrying with it the assurance that although not victorious over two armies it had been victorious over one and had struck the most stunning blow yet known in American history 
6538_81859_000028_000000	train-clean-360	When the last of the Southern regiments disappeared in the deep woods Dick and many of those around him sank exhausted upon the ground 
6538_81859_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Even had they been ordered to follow they would have been incapable of it Complete nervous collapse followed such days and nights as those through which they had passed 
6538_81859_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Nor did Grant and Buell wish to pursue 
6538_81859_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Their armies had been too terribly shaken to make another attack 
none	none	Nearly fifteen thousand of their men had fallen and the dead and wounded still lay scattered widely through the woods 
6538_81859_000029_000003	train-clean-360	The South had lost almost as many 
6538_81859_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Nearly a third of her army had been killed or wounded in the battle and yet they retired in good order showing the desperate valor of these sons of hers 
6538_81859_000030_000000	train-clean-360	The double army which had saved itself but which had yet been unable to destroy its enemy slept that night in the recovered camp 
6538_81859_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The generals discussed in subdued tones their narrow escape and the soldiers who now understood very well what had happened talked of it in the same way 
6538_81859_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 We knew that it was going to be a big war said Dick but it s going to be far bigger than we thought 
6538_81859_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 And we won t make that easy parade down to the Gulf said Warner 
6538_81859_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 I m thinking that a lot of lions are in the path 
6538_81859_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 But we ll win said Dick 
none	none	In the end we ll surely win 
6538_81859_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Then after dreaming a little with his eyes open he fell asleep gathering new strength for mighty campaigns yet to come
