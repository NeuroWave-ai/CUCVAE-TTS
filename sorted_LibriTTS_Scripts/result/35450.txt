MORE PARTICULARLY THE CAT Iddesleigh Sevenoaks PREFACE What is aught but as tis valued Troilus and Cressida Act II The following notes and illustrations of and respecting the Cat are the outcome of over fifty years careful thoughtful heedful observation much research and not unprofitable attention to the facts and fancies of others From a tiny child to the present the love of Nature has been my chief delight animals and birds have not only been objects of study but of deep and absorbing interest I have noted their habits watched their ways and found lasting pleasure in their companionship This love of animal life and Nature with all its moods and phases has grown with me from childhood to manhood and is not the least enjoyable part of my old age Among animals possibly the most perfect and certainly the most domestic is the Cat I did not think so always having had a bias against it and was some time coming to this belief nevertheless such is the fact It is a veritable part of our household and is both useful quiet affectionate and ornamental The small or large dog may be regarded and petted but is generally useless the Cat a pet or not is of service Were it not for our Cats rats and mice would overrun our house buildings cultivated and other lands If there were not millions of Cats there would be billions of vermin Long ages of neglect ill treatment and absolute cruelty with little or no gentleness kindness or training have made the Cat self reliant and from this emanates the marvellous powers of observation the concentration of which has produced a state analogous to reasoning not unmixed with timidity caution wildness and a retaliative nature But should a new order of things arise and it is nurtured petted cosseted talked to noticed and trained with mellowed firmness and tender gentleness then in but a few generations much evil that bygone cruelty has stamped into its often wretched existence will disappear and it will be more than ever not only a useful serviceable helpmate but an object of increasing interest admiration and cultured beauty and thus being of value profitable Having said this much I turn to the pleasurable duty of recording my deep sense of the kindness of those warm hearted friends who have assisted me in my labour of love not the least among these being those publishers who with a generous and prompt alacrity gave me

Some time has passed since I published my book Our Cats and all about them in eighteen eighty nine and much has taken place regarding these household pets All know as well as myself that each and everything about us changes nothing stands still that which is of to day is past and that which was hidden often revealed sometimes by mere accident at others by scientific research but one was scarcely prepared in any way for so wonderful a find as that of the large number of mummy Cats at Beni Hassan Central Egypt They were discovered by an Egyptian fellah employed in husbandry who tumbled into a pit which on further examination proved to be a large subterranean cave completely filled with mummy Cats every one of which had been separately embalmed and wrapped in cloth after the manner of the Egyptian human mummies all being laid out carefully in rows and here they had lain probably about three or four thousand years The totem of a section of the ancients as is well known was the Cat hence when a Cat died it was buried with due honours being embalmed and often decorated in various ways and in short had as much attention paid to it as a human being It had long been believed that a Cat cemetery existed on the east bank of the Nile and in the autumn of eighteen eighty nine the lucky Egyptian about one hundred miles from Cairo came unexpectedly upon it Immediately on the find becoming known specimen mummy Cats were written for to agents in Egypt one friend of mine sending for four and it appeared for a while that much money would be realised by the owner of the cave or land in this way but the number was too great and the prices and the interest gave way and sad to relate these former Deities were dug out of their resting place by hundreds of thousands and quickly sold to local farmers being used for enriching the land Other lots found their way to an Alexandrian merchant and were by him sent to Liverpool on board the steamer Pharos and Thebes The consignment consisted of nineteen one two tons and were sold by auction mostly being bought by a local fertiliser merchant The auction was only known to the trade and the lots were knocked down at the giving away sums of Lthree thirteen s nine d Lthree seventeen s to Lfour five s per ton the big and the perfect ones being picked out for the museum and private collections The broker who sold used a head of one of these Cats in lieu of an auctioneer s hammer And now these tons of deified Cats are used for manure and in our English soil plants grow into them and on them and of them and if it be true as chemists assert these plants take into their system that on which they feed and so if so possibly in our very bread that we have eaten we have swallowed a little at a time part of if not the whole of a deified cat I made several endeavours to find out from those on the spot at Liverpool whether there was any hair of colours in existence among the mass of bodies but in no case could I succeed in getting any as I had hoped by this means to possibly come to some conclusion as to the kind or breed Of course it is well known from mummies long in this country what form size and general appearance the Egyptian possessed but as yet as far as I can learn no one has found so much if any of the fur as to be able to determine the colour Apropos with the above as applying the bodies of the mummy Cats for manure comes the modern idea of keeping Cats for their fur It is stated that a company has been formed in America for that purpose in Washington and an island of some size has been bought or leased for the purpose The intention is to raise entirely black Cats and as their place of abode will be surrounded by water it is conjectured that after the first importation they will go on propagating and producing only Cats of that beautiful though sombre dark hue The Cats with which the island is to be stocked are to be procured from Holland where already the industry is at work So much so that a friend of mine an elderly gentleman sending to a furrier in Holland to know what kind of fur he would recommend as the best for warmth received the reply that Cats skins were the most useful and warmest A few days ago he called on me wrapped in a cloth coat with fur collar and cuffs and lining throughout of black Cats skins and I am bound to say that the general appearance was much in its favour he also stated that he was in every way perfectly satisfied By the bye the Cat Company intend to feed their Cats on fish which abound about the shores of their island and so they affirm the food will cost nothing and their profits consequently be very large But in this I hope they have been well informed as to the adaptability of the Cat to feed entirely on fish for of this I have my doubts certainly those I have had did not appear to thrive if they had fish too often Again as the Cats are to roam the island at their own sweet will I take it there will be at times some damaging of fur by the playful way in which they so often engage when jealousy incites them to mortal combat But possibly this has been considered and duly entered in the profit and loss account While writing that portion of my book in which I referred to the superstitions connected with the domestic Cat and the amazing stories told of the witches Cats I felt convinced that in those darkened and foolish times that the very fact of the wonderful faculty the Cat possesses of applying what it observes to its own purposes was in some way the cause of the ignorant and superstitious considering that it was possessed of an evil spirit I therefore searched for proofs among the evidence given at the trial of witches and was as I expected rewarded for my trouble What a Cat would do now would not unreasonably be thought clever and showing much sagacity if not attributes of a deeper kind Yet I find that at a trial for witchcraft the following questions were put to a man Well and what did you see Well I saw her Cat walk up and try to open the door by the latch What did you do I immediately killed it This which is now regarded as an everyday example of the intelligence of the Cat bore hardly in the evidence against the witch Sir Walter Scott in his letter on Demonology and Witchcraft tells of a poor old woman condemned as usual on her own confession and on the testimony of a neighbour who deposed that he saw a Cat jump in the accused person s cottage through the window at twilight one evening and that he verily believed the Cat to be the devil on which precious testimony the poor wretch was hanged One more note and I leave the subject A certain carpenter named William Montgomery was so infested with Cats which as his servant maid reported spoke among themselves that he fell in a rage upon a party of these animals which had assembled in his house at irregular hours and betwixt his Highland arms of knife dirk and broadsword and his professional weapon of an axe he made such a dispersion that they were quiet for the night In consequence of his blows two witches are said to have died Since writing of the English wild Cat I had the pleasure of meeting mister Francis Darwin brother of mister Charles Darwin on board the steamboat going to saint Servan when in the course of conversation he informed me that a wild Cat was killed at Bramhope Moor Plantation in eighteen forty one a keeper having caught it in two traps In February of this year eighteen ninety one my kind friend mister Dresser of Orpington the well known naturalist wrote to me to know whether I would like to have a kitten half bred between the British Wild Cat and a domestic she Cat which I was unfortunately obliged to decline fearing it would make matters unpleasant with what I had He very kindly supplied me with the following particulars forwarded to him by O H Mactheyer esquire mister Harrison Weir can see the papa of the kitten at the Zoo He is a young Cat under a year old we thought by the teeth He was seen one moonlight night in company with my stalker s small lean black Cat right away in my deer forest We caught the papa in a trap after he had killed a number of grouse and not being badly hurt I sent him to Bartlett at the Zoo We are thoroughly up to real wild Cats here I have caught them forty three inches from nose to tail end tails as thick at the point as at the root the ears are also differently set on Martin Cats Polecats and Badgers are all extinct here and it is ten years since we got the last wild Cat but three have been killed in this district this winter I insert the foregoing as being of much interest it having been frequently stated that the wild Cat will not mate with the domestic Cat The kitten offered to me is now at Fawley Court Bucks Among the numerous letters I have received from America is one from missus Mary A C Livermore of Cambridge Mass U S A who writes I have just come possessed of a black long haired Cat from Maine It is neither Persian Angora nor Indian They are called here Coon Cats and it is vulgarly supposed to be a cross between a common Cat and a Coon Mine is a rusty bear brown colour but his relatives have been black and white blue and white and fawn and white the latter the gentlest prettiest Cat I know His tail is very bushy and a fine ruff adorns his neck A friend of mine has a pair of these Cats all black and the female consorts with no one but her mate Yet often she has in her litter a common short haired kitten Since the above reached me I have received from another correspondent in the United States a very beautiful photograph of what is termed a Coon Cat It certainly differs much from the ordinary long haired Cat in appearance but as to its being a cross with the Racoon such a supposition is totally out of the question and the idea cannot be entertained The photographs sent to me show that the ears are unusually large the head long the length being in excess from the eyes to the tip of the nose the legs and feet are large and evenly covered with long somewhat coarse hair the latter being devoid of tufts between and at the extremity of the toes there are no long hairs of any consequence either within the ears or at their apex The frill or mane is considerable as is the length of the hair covering the body the tail is rather short and somewhat thick well covered with hair of equal length and in shape like a fox s brush The eyes are large round and full with a wild staring expression Certainly the breed however it may be obtained is most interesting to the Cat naturalist and the colour as before stated being peculiar must of course attract his attention independently of its general appearance Since the above was written I have received the following from mister Henry Brooker The Elms West Midford Massachusetts United States of America After asking for information respecting Cats of certain breeds he says I have had for a number of years a peculiar strain of long haired Cats they come from the islands off the coast of Maine and are known in this country as Coon Cats The belief is that they have been crossed with the Coon This of course is untrue The inhabitants of these islands are seafaring people and many years ago some one on his vessel had a pair of long haired Cats from which the strain has sprung There are few short haired cats on the island as there is no communication with the mainland except by boat I want to improve my strain and get finer hair than the Cats now have Yellow Cats are the most popular kind here and I have succeeded in producing Cats of a rich mahogany colour with brushes like a fox They hunt in the fields with me and my Scotch terriers and they are on the most friendly terms This as a corroboration of the foregoing letters and the photographs is I take it eminently satisfactory I have been shown a Siberian Cat by mister Castang of Leadenhall Market the breed is entirely new to me It is a small female Cat of a slaty blue colour rather short in body and legs the head is small and much rounded while the ears are of medium size The iris of the eyes is a deep golden colour which in contrast to the bluish colour of the fur makes them to appear still more brilliant the tail is short and thick very much so at the base and suddenly pointed at the tip It is particularly timid and wild in its nature and is difficult to approach but as mister Castang observed this timidity may be because it does not understand our language and does not know when it is called or spoken to I think it would make a valuable Cat to cross with some English varieties A correspondent writes In your book on Cats you do not mention Norwegian Cats I was in Norway last year and was struck by the Cats being different to any I had ever seen being much stouter built with thick close fur mostly sandy with stripes of dark yellow I suppose I am to infer that both the sexes are of sandy yellow colour If so I should say it is more a matter of selection than a new colour I find generally in the colder countries the fur is short dense and somewhat woolly and as a rule judging from the information that I am continually receiving whole or entire colours predominate Large Cats are by some sought after This I take it is a great mistake the fairly medium sized Cat being much the handsomer of the two and they are generally also devoid of that coarseness that is found apparent in the former while small Cats are extremely pretty and I understand are not only likely to be in vogue but are actually now being bred for their extreme prettiness I have heard of some of these Bantam Cats being produced by that true and most excellent fancier mister Herbert Young who not only has produced a Tortoiseshell Tom Cat on lines laid down by myself but is also engaged in breeding more and I have not the least doubt he will be most successful he having so been in producing new colours and some of the finest silver tabby short haired Cats as yet seen these short haired Cats in my opinion far surpassing for beauty any long hair ever exhibited and are certainly of a sweeter disposition In my former edition of Our Cats I wrote hopefully and expectantly of much good to be derived from the institution of the so called National Cat Club and of which I was then President but I am sorry to say that none of those hopes or expectations have been realised and I now feel the deepest regret that I was ever induced to be in any way associated with it I do not care to go into particulars further than to say I found the principal idea of many of its members consisted not so much in promoting the welfare of the Cat as of winning prizes and more particularly their own Cat Club medals for which though offered at public shows the public were not allowed to compete and when won by the members in many cases the public were thoughtlessly misled by believing it was an open competition I therefore felt it my duty to leave the club for that and other reasons I have also left off judging of the Cats even at my old much loved show at the Crystal Palace because I no longer cared to come into contact with such Lovers of Cats I am very much in favour of the Cats Homes The one at Dublin in which Miss Swift takes so much interest the one in London with Miss Mayhew working for it with the zeal of a true Cat lover and that where mister Colam is the manager all deserve and have my sincerest and warmest approbation sympathy and support standing out as they do in such bright contrast to those self styled Cat lovers the National Cat Club HARRISON WEIR F R H S SEVENOAKS March twelve th eighteen ninety two ILLUSTRATIONS PAGE Reduction of Cat s Head drawn for Posting Bill Crystal Palace Cat Show eighteen

ABOUT THEM INTRODUCTORY After a Cat Show at the Crystal Palace I usually receive a number of letters requesting information One asks What is a true tortoiseshell like Another What is a tabby and yet another What is a blue tabby One writes of the splendid disposition of his cat another asks how to cure a cat scratching the furniture and so on After much consideration and also at the request of many I have thought it best to publish my notes on cats their ways habits instincts peculiarities usefulness colours markings forms and other qualities that are required as fitting subjects to exhibit at what is now one of the instituted exhibitions of The land we live in and also the Folk and other lore both ancient and modern respecting them It is many years ago that when thinking of the large number of cats kept in London alone I conceived the idea that it would be well to hold Cat Shows so that the different breeds colours markings et cetera might be more carefully attended to and the domestic cat sitting in front of the fire would then possess a beauty and an attractiveness to its owner unobserved and unknown because uncultivated heretofore Prepossessed with this view of the subject I called on my friend mister Wilkinson the then manager of the Crystal Palace With his usual businesslike clear headedness he saw it was a thing to be done In a few days I presented my scheme in full working order the schedule of prizes the price of entry the number of classes and the points by which they would be judged the number of prizes in each class their amount the different varieties of colour form size and sex for which they were to be given I also made a drawing of the head of a cat to be printed in black on yellow paper for a posting bill mister F Wilson the Company s naturalist and show manager then took the matter in charge worked hard got a goodly number of cats together among which was my blue tabby The Old Lady then about fourteen years old yet the best in the show of its colour and never surpassed though lately possibly equalled To my watch chain I have attached the silver bell she wore at her debut My brother John Jenner Weir the reverend J Macdona and myself acted as judges and the result was a success far beyond our most sanguine expectations so much so that I having made it a labour of love of the feline race and acting without fee gratuity or reward the Crystal Palace Company generously presented me with a large silver tankard in token of their high approval of my exertions on behalf of the Company and Cats Now that a Cat Club is formed shows are more numerous and the entries increasing there is every reason to expect a permanent benefit in every way to one of the most intelligent of though often much abused animals Illustration THE FIRST CAT SHOW On the day for judging at Ludgate Hill I took a ticket and the train for the Crystal Palace Sitting alone in the comfortable cushioned compartment of a first class I confess I felt somewhat more than anxious as to the issue of the experiment Yes what would it be like Would there be many cats How many How would the animals comport themselves in their cages Would they sulk or cry for liberty refuse all food or settle down and take the situation quietly and resignedly or give way to terror I could in no way picture to myself the scene it was all so new Presently and while I was musing on the subject the door was opened and a friend got in Ah said he how are you Tolerably well said I I am on my way to the Cat Show What said my friend that surpasses everything A show of cats Why I hate the things I drive them off my premises when I see them You ll have a fine bother with them in their cages Or are they to be tied up Anyhow what a noise there will be and how they will clutch at the bars and try and get out or they will strangle themselves with their chains I am sorry very sorry said I that you do not like cats For my part I think them extremely beautiful also very graceful in all their actions and they are quite as domestic in their habits as the dog if not more so They are very useful in catching rats and mice they are not deficient in sense they will jump up at doors to push up latches with their paws I have known them knock at a door by the knocker when wanting admittance They know Sunday from the week day and do not go out to wait for the meat barrow on that day they Stop said my friend I see you do like cats and I do not so let the matter drop No said I not so That is why I instituted this Cat Show I wish every one to see how beautiful a well cared for cat is and how docile gentle and may I use the term cossetty Why should not the cat that sits purring in front of us before the fire be an object of interest and be selected for its colour markings and form Now come with me my dear old friend and see the first Cat Show Inside the Crystal Palace stood my friend and I Instead of the noise and struggles to escape there lay the cats in their different pens reclining on crimson cushions making no sound save now and then a homely purring as from time to time they lapped the nice new milk provided for them Yes there they were big cats very big cats middling sized cats and small cats cats of all colours and markings and beautiful pure white Persian cats and as we passed down the front of the cages I saw that my friend became interested presently he said What a beauty this is and here s another And no doubt said I many of the cats you have seen before would be quite as beautiful if they were as well cared for or at least cared for at all generally they are driven about and ill fed and often ill used simply for the reason that they are cats and for no other Yet I feel a great pleasure in telling you the show would have been much larger were it not for the difficulty of inducing the owners to send their pets from home though you see the great care that is taken of them Well I had no idea there was such a variety of form size and colour said my friend and departed A few months after I called on him he was at luncheon with two cats on a chair beside him pets I should say from their appearance Illustration This is not a solitary instance of the good of the first Cat Show in leading up to the observation of and kindly feeling for the domestic cat Since then throughout the length and breadth of the land there have been Cat Shows and much interest is taken in them by all classes of the community so much so that large prices have been paid for handsome specimens It is to be hoped that by these shows the too often despised cat will meet with the attention and kind treatment that every dumb animal should have and ought to receive at the hands of humanity Even the few instances of the shows generating a love for cats that have come before my own notice are a sufficient pleasure to me not to regret having thought out and planned the first Cat Show at the Crystal Palace Illustration HABITS Before attempting to describe the different varieties I should like to make a few remarks as to the habits and ways of the domestic cat When judging I have frequently found some of the exhibits of anything but a mild and placid disposition Some have displayed a downright ferocity others on the contrary have been excessively gentle and very few but seemed to recognise their position and submitted quietly to their confinement This is easily accounted for when persons are accustomed to cats they know what wonderful powers of observation the cat possesses and how quickly they recognise the why and the wherefore of many things Take for instance how very many cats will open a latched door by springing up and holding on with one fore leg while with the other they press down the latch catch and so open the door and yet even more observant are they than that as I have shown by a case in my Animal Stories Old and New in which a cat opened a door by pulling it towards him when he found pushing it of no avail The cat is more critical in noticing than the dog I never knew but one dog that would open a door by moving the fastening without being shown or taught how to do it Cats that have done so are numberless I noticed one at the last Crystal Palace Show a white cat it looked up it looked down then to the right and then a little to the left paused seemed lost in thought when not seeing any one about it crept up to the door and with its paw tried to pull back the bolt or catch On getting sight of me it retired to a corner of the cage shut its eyes and pretended to sleep I stood further away and soon saw the paw coming through the bars again This cat had noticed how the cage door was fastened and so knew how to open it Many cats that are said to be spiteful are made so by ill treatment for as a rule I have found them to be most affectionate and gentle and that to the last degree attaching themselves to individuals although such is stated not to be the case yet of this I am certain Having had several in my house at one time I found that no two were the followers of the same member of my family But it may be argued and I think with some degree of justice Why was this Was it only that each cat had a separate liking If so why Why should not three or four cats take a liking to the same individual But they seldom or never do and for that matter there seems somewhat the same feeling with dogs This required some consideration but that not of long duration For I am sorry to say I rapidly came to the conclusion that it was jealousy Yes jealousy There was no doubt of it Zeno would be very cossetty loving lovable and gentle but when Lulu came in and was nursed he retired to a corner and seized the first opportunity of vanishing through the door As soon as Zillah jumped on my knee and put her paws about my neck Lulu looked at me then at her then at me walked to the fire sat down looked round got up went to the door cried to go out the door was opened and she fled I thought that Zillah seemed then more than ever happy Though jealousy is one of if not the ruling attributes of the cat there are exceptions to such a rule Sometimes it may be that two or more will take to the same person As an instance of this I had two cats one a red tabby a great beauty Lillah a short haired red and white cat the latter and a white long haired one named The Colonel were great friends and these associated with a tortoiseshell and white Lizzie None of these were absolutely house cats but attended more to the poultry yards and runs looking after the chicken seeing that no rats were about or other vermin near the coops Useful cats very Mine was then a very large garden and generally of an evening when at home I used to walk about the numerous paths to admire the beauties of the different herbaceous plants of which I had an interesting collection Five was my time of starting on my ambulation when on going out of the door I was sure to find the two first named cats and often the third waiting for me ready to go wherever I went following like faithful dogs These apparently never had any jealous feeling Of all the cats Lillah was the most loving If I stood still she would look up and watch the expression of my face If she thought it was favourable to her she would jump and clinging to my chest put her fore paws around my neck and rub her head softly against my face purring melodiously all the time then move on to my shoulder while The Colonel and his tortoiseshell friend Lizzie would press about my legs uttering the same musical self complacent sound Here there and everywhere even out into the road or into the wood the pretty things would accompany me seeming intensely happy When I returned to the house they would scamper off bounding in the air and playing with and tumbling over each other in the fullest and most frolicsome manner imaginable No I do not think that Lillah The Colonel or Lizzie ever knew the feeling of jealousy But these as I said before were exceptions They all had a sad ending coming to an untimely death through being caught in wires set by poachers for rabbits I have ever regretted the loss of the gentle Lillah She was as beautiful as she was good gentle and loving without a fault It may have been noted in the foregoing I have said that my cats were always awaiting my coming Just so The cat seems to take note of time as well as place At my town house I had a cat named Guadalquiver which was fed on horseflesh brought to the door Every day during the week he would go and sit ready for the coming of the cat s meat man but he never did so on the Sunday How it was he knew on that day that the man did not come I never could discover still the fact remains How he or whether he counted the days until the sixth and then rested the seventh from his watching is a mystery A similar case is related of an animal belonging to mister Truebner the London publisher The cat a gigantic one and a pet of his used to go every evening to the end of the terrace on which was the house where he resided to escort mister Truebner back to dinner on his arrival from the City but was never once known to make the mistake of going to meet him on Sundays And again how well a cat knows when it is luncheon time He or she may be apparently asleep on the tiles or snugly lying under a bush basking in the sun s warm rays when it will look up yawn stretch itself get up and move leisurely towards the house and as the luncheon bell rings in walks the cat as ready for food as any there Most cats are of a gentle disposition but resent ill treatment in a most determined way generally making use of their claws at the same time giving vent to their feelings by a low growl and spitting furiously Under such conditions it is best to leave off that which has appeared to irritate them Dogs generally bite when they lose their temper but a cat seldom Should a cat dig her claws into your hand never draw it backward but push forward you thus close the foot and render the claws harmless If otherwise you generally lose three to four pieces of skin from your hand the cat knows he has done it and feels revenged Some cats do not like their ears touched others their backs others their tails I have one now Fritz he has such a great dislike to having his tail touched that if we only point to it and say Tail he growls and if repeated he will get up and go out of the room even though he was enjoying the comfort of his basket before a good fire By avoiding anything that is known to tease an animal no matter what it will be found that is the true way combined with gentle treatment and oft caressing to tame and to make them love you even those whose temper is none of the best This is equally applicable to horses cows and dogs as to cats Gentleness and kindness will work wonders with animals and I take it is not lost on human beings The distance cats will travel to find and regain the home they have been taken from is surprising One my groom begged of me as he said he had no cat at home and he was fond of the dear thing but he really wanted to be rid of it as I found afterwards He took the poor animal away in a hamper and after carrying it some three miles through London streets threw it into the Surrey Canal That cat was sitting wet and dirty outside the stable when he came in the morning and went in joyfully on his opening the door ran up to and climbed on to the back of its favourite the horse who neighed a welcome home The man left that week Another instance and I could give many more but this will suffice It is said that if you wish an old cat to stay you should have the mother with the kitten or kittens but this sometimes fails to keep her Having a fancy for a beautiful brown tabby I purchased her and kitten from a cottager living two miles and a half away The next day I let her out keeping the kitten in a basket before the fire In half an hour mother and child were gone and though she had to carry her little one through woods hedgerows across grass and arable fields she arrived home with her young charge quite safely the following day though evidently very tired wet and hungry After two days she was brought back and being well fed and carefully tended she roamed no more The cat like many other animals will often form singular attachments One would sit in my horse s manger and purr and rub against his nose which undoubtedly the horse enjoyed for he would frequently turn his head purposely to be so treated One went as consort with a Dorking cock another took a great liking to my collie Rover another loved Lina the cow while another would cosset up close to a sitting hen and allowed the fresh hatched chickens to seek warmth by creeping under her Again they will rear other animals such as rats rabbits squirrels puppies hedgehogs and when motherly inclined will take to almost anything even to a young pigeon At the Brighton Show of eighteen eighty six there were two cats both reared by dogs the foster mother and her bantling showing evident signs of sincere affection There are both men and women who have a decided antipathy to cats Won t have one in the house on any account They are called deceitful and some go as far as to say treacherous but how and in what way I cannot discover Others on the contrary love cats beyond all other things domestic Of course cats like other animals or even human beings are very dissimilar no two being precisely alike in disposition any more than are to be found two forms so closely resembling as not to be distinguished one from the other To some a cat is a cat and if all were black all would be alike But this would not be so in reality as those well know who are close observers of animal and bird life Of course the gamekeeper has a dislike to cats more especially when they take to the woods but so long as they are fed and keep within bounds they are useful in scaring away rats from the young broods of pheasants What are termed poaching cats are clearly outlaws and must be treated as such TRAINED CATS That cats may be trained to respect the lives of other animals and also birds on which they habitually feed is a well known fact In proof of this I well recollect a story that my father used to tell of a happy family that was shown many years ago on the Surrey side of Waterloo Bridge Their abode consisted of a large wire cage placed on wheels In windy weather the breezy side was protected by green baize so draughts were prevented and a degree of comfort obtained As there was no charge for the show a box was placed in front with an opening for the purpose of admitting any donations from those who felt inclined to give On it was written The Happy Family their money box The family varied somewhat as casualties occurred occasionally by death from natural causes or sales Usually there was a Monkey an Owl some Guinea pigs Squirrels small birds Starlings a Magpie Rats Mice and a Cat or two But the story Well the story is this One day when my father was looking at the happy family a burly looking man came up and after a while said to the man who owned the show Ah I don t see much in that It is true the cat does not touch the small birds one of which was sitting on the head of the cat at the time nor the other things but you could not manage to keep rats and mice in there as well Think not said the showman I think I could very easily Not you said the burly one I will give you a month to do it in if you like and a shilling in the bargain if you succeed I shall be this way again soon Thank you sir said the man Don t go yet then putting a stick through the bars of the cage he lifted up the cat when from beneath her out ran a white rat and three white mice Won der ful slowly ejaculated he of the burly form Wonder ful The money was paid Cats properly trained will not touch anything alive or dead on the premises to which they are attached I have known them to sport with tame rabbits to romp and jump in frolicsome mood this way then that which both seemed greatly to enjoy yet they would bring home wild rabbits they had killed and not touch my little chickens or ducklings Illustration THE OLD LADY When I built a house in the country fond as I am of cats I determined not to keep any there because they would destroy the birds nests and drive my feathered friends away and I liked to watch and feed these from the windows Things went pleasantly for awhile The birds were fed and paid for their keep with many and many a song There were the old ones and there the young and oft by the hour I watched them from the window and they became so tame as scarcely caring to get out of my way when I went outside with more food But there is always a but but one day or rather evening as I was looking on a rat came out from the rocks and then another Soon they began their repast on the remains of the birds food Then in the twilight came mice the short tailed and the long scampering hither and thither This too was amusing In the autumn I bought some filberts and put them into a closet upstairs went to London returned and thought I would sleep in the room adjoining the closet No such thing As soon as the light was out there was a sound of gnawing curb curb sweek squeak a rushing of tiny feet here there and everywhere thump bump scriggle scraggle squeak overhead above the ceiling behind the skirting boards under the floor and in the closet I lighted a candle opened the door and looked into the repository for my filberts What a hustling what a scuffling what a scrambling There they were mice in numbers they made for some holes in the corners of the cupboard got jammed squeaked struggled squabbled pushed their tails making circles push push squeak more jostling another effort or two squeak squeak gurgle squeak more struggling and they were gone Gone Yes but not for long As soon as the light was out back they came No oh dear no sleep no more sleep Outside I liked to watch the mice but when they climbed the ivy and got inside the pleasure entirely ceased Nor was this all they got into the vineries and spoilt the grapes and the rats killed the young ducks and chickens and undermined the building also besides storing quantities of grain and other things under the floor The result number one was three cats coming on a visit Farmyard cats cats that knew the difference between chickens ducklings mice and rats Result number two that after being away a couple of weeks I went again to my cottage and I slept undisturbed in the room late the play ground of the mice My chickens and ducklings were safe and soon the cats allowed the birds to be fed in front of the window though I could not break them of destroying many of the nests I never NOTICED more fully the very great use the domestic cat is to man than on that occasion All day my cats were indoors dozy sociable and contented At night they were on guard outside and doubtless saved me the lives of dozens of my young things One afternoon I saw one of my cats coming towards me with apparent difficulty in walking On its near approach I found it was carrying a large rat which appeared dead Coming nearer the cat put down the rat Presently I saw it move then it suddenly got up and ran off The cat caught it again Again it feigned death again got up and ran off and was once more caught It laid quite still when perceiving the cat had turned away it got up apparently quite uninjured and ran in another direction and I and the cat lost it I was not sorry This rat deserved his liberty Whether it was permanent I know not as Little john the cat remained and I left The cat is not only a very useful animal about the house and premises but is also ornamental It is lithe and beautiful in form and graceful in action Of course there are cats that are ugly by comparison with others both in form colour and markings and as there are now cat shows at which prizes are offered for varieties I will endeavour to give in succeeding chapters the points of excellence as regards form colour and markings required and most esteemed for the different classes I am the more induced to define these as clearly as possible owing to the number of mistakes that often occur in the entries Illustration LONG HAIRED CATS These are very diversified both in form colour and the quality of the hair which in some is more woolly than in others and they vary also in the shape and length of the tail the ears and size of eyes There are several varieties the Russian the Angora the Persian and Indian Forty or fifty years ago they used all to be called French cats as they were mostly imported from Paris more particularly the white which were then the fashion and if I remember rightly they as a rule were larger than those of the present day Coloured long haired cats were then rare and but little cared for or appreciated The pure white with long silky hair bedecked with blue or rose colour ribbon or a silver collar with its name inscribed thereon or one of scarlet leather studded with brass might often be seen stretching its full lazy length on luxurious woollen rugs the valued pampered pets of West End life Illustration A curious fact relating to the white cat of not only the long but also the short haired breed is their deafness Should they have blue eyes which is the fancy colour these are nearly always deaf although I have seen specimens whose hearing was as perfect as that of any other colour Still deafness in white cats is not always confined to those with blue eyes as I too well know from purchasing a very fine male at the Crystal Palace Show some few years since The price was low and the cat a beauty both in form coat and tail his eyes were yellow and he had a nice meek mild expressive face I stopped and looked at him as he much took my fancy He stared at me wistfully with something like melancholy in the gaze of his amber coloured eyes I put my hand through the bars of the cage He purred licked my hand rubbed against the wires put his tail up as much as to say See here is a beautiful tail am I not a lovely cat Yes thought I a very nice cat When I looked at my catalogue and saw the low price something is wrong here said I musingly Yes there must be something wrong The price is misstated or there is something not right about this cat No it was a beauty so comely so loving so gentle so very gentle Well said I to myself if there is no misstatement of price I will buy this cat and with a parting survey of its excellences I went to the office of the show manager He looked at the letter of entry No the price was quite right two guineas I will buy it said I And so I did but at two guineas I bought it dearly Yes very dearly for when I got it home I found it was stone deaf What an unhappy cat it was If shut out of the dining room you could hear its cry for admission all over the house being so deaf the poor wretched creature never knew the noise it made I often wish that it had so known very very often I am satisfied that a tithe would have frightened it out of its life And so loving so affectionate But oh horror when it called out as it sat on my lap its voice seemed to acquire at least ten cat power And when if it lost sight of me in the garden its voice rose to the occasion I feel confident it might have been heard miles off Alas he never knew what that agonised sound was like but I did and I have never forgotten it and I never shall I named him The Colonel on account of his commanding voice One morning a friend came blessed be that day and after dinner he saw the beauty What a lovely cat said he Yes said I he is very beautiful quite a picture After a while he said looking at Pussy warming himself before the fire I think I never saw one I liked more Indeed said I if you really think so I will give it to you but he has a fault he is stone deaf Oh I don t mind that said he He took him away miles and miles away I was glad it was so many miles away for two reasons One was I feared he might come back and the other that his voice might come resounding on the still night air But he never came back nor a sound A few days after he left to better himself a letter came saying would I wish to have him back They liked it very much all but its voice No I wrote no you are very kind no thank you give him to any one you please do what you will with the beauty but it must not return never When next I saw my friend I asked him how the beauty was You dreadful man said he why that cat nearly drove us all mad I never heard anything like it Nor I said I sententiously Well said my friend all is well that ends well I have given it to a very deaf old lady and so both are happy Very I trust said I The foregoing is by way of advice in buying a white cat or in fact any other ascertain for a certainty that it is not deaf Illustration A short time since I saw a white Persian cat with deep blue eyes sitting at the door of a tobacconist s at the corner of the Haymarket London On inquiry I found that the cat could hear perfectly and was in no way deficient of health and strength and this is by no means a solitary instance Illustration MISS SAUNDERS TIGER Illustration THE ANGORA The Angora cat as its name indicates comes from Angora in Western Asia a province that is also celebrated for its goats with long hair which is of extremely fine quality It is said that this deteriorates when the animal leaves that locality This may be so but that I have no means of proving yet if so do the Angora cats also deteriorate in the silky qualities of their fur Or does it get shorter Certain it is that many of the imported cats have finer and longer hair than those bred in this country but when are the latter true bred Even some a little cross bred will often have long hair but not of the texture as regards length and silkiness which is to be noted in the pure breed The Angora cats I am told are great favourites with the Turks and Armenians and the best are of high value a pure white with blue eyes being thought the perfection of cats all other points being good and its hearing by no means defective The points are a small head with not too long a nose large full eyes of a colour in harmony with that of its fur ears rather large than small and pointed with a tuft of hair at the apex the size not showing as they are deeply set in the long hair on the forehead with a very full flowing mane about the head and neck this latter should not be short neither the body which should be long graceful and elegant and covered with long silky hair with a slight admixture of woolliness in this it differs from the Persian and the longer the better In texture it should be as fine as possible and also not so woolly as that of the Russian still it is more inclined to be so than the Persian The legs to be of moderate length and in proportion to the body the tail long and slightly curving upward towards the end The hair should be very long at the base less so toward the tip When perfect it is an extremely beautiful and elegant object and no wonder that it has become a pet among the Orientals The colours are varied but the black which should have orange eyes as should also the slate colours and blues and the white are the most esteemed though the soft slates blues and the light fawns deep reds and mottled grays are shades of colour that blend well with the Eastern furniture and other surroundings There are also light grays and what is termed smoke colour a beauty was shown at Brighton which was white with black tips to the hair the white being scarcely visible unless the hair was parted this tinting had a marvellous effect I have never seen imported strong coloured tabbies of this breed nor do I believe such are true Angoras Fine specimens are even now rare in this country and are extremely valuable In manners and temper they are quiet sociable and docile though given to roaming especially in the country where I have seen them far from their homes hunting the hedgerows more like dogs than cats nor do they appear to possess the keen intelligence of the short haired European cat They are not new to us being mentioned by writers nearly a hundred years ago if not more I well remember white specimens of uncommon size on sale in Leadenhall Market more than forty years since the price usually was five guineas though some of rare excellence would realise double that sum Illustration MISS MOORE S DINAH Illustration MISS SAUNDERS SYLVIE THE PERSIAN CAT This differs somewhat from the Angora the tail being generally longer more like a table brush in point of form and is generally slightly turned upwards the hair being more full and coarser at the end while at the base it is somewhat longer The head is rather larger with less pointed ears although these should not be devoid of the tuft at the apex and also well furnished with long hair within and of moderate size The eyes should be large full and round with a soft expression the hair on the forehead is generally rather short in comparison to the other parts of the body which ought to be clothed with long silky hair very long about the neck giving the appearance of the mane of the lion The legs feet and toes should be well clothed with long hair and have well developed fringes on the toes assuming the character of tufts between them It is larger in body and generally broader in the loins and apparently stronger made than the foregoing variety though yet slender and elegant with small bone and exceedingly graceful in all its movements there being a kind of languor observable in its walk until roused when it immediately assumes the quick motion of the ordinary short haired cat though not so alert The colours vary very much and comprise almost every tint obtainable in cats though the tortoiseshell is not nor is the dark marked tabby in my opinion a Persian cat colour but has been got by crossing with the short haired tortoiseshell and also English tabby and as generally shows pretty clearly unmistakable signs of such being the case For a long time if not now the black was the most sought after and the most difficult to obtain A good rich deep black with orange coloured eyes and long flowing hair grand in mane large and with graceful carriage with a mild expression is truly a very beautiful object and one very rare The best I have hitherto seen was one that belonged to mister Edward Lloyd the great authority on all matters relating to aquariums It was called Mimie and was a very fine specimen usually carrying off the first prize wherever shown It generally wore a handsome collar on which was inscribed its name and victories The collar as mister Lloyd used jocosely to observe really belonged to it as it was bought out of its winnings and according to the accounts kept was proved also to have paid for its food for some considerable period It was as its owner laughingly said his friend and not his dependent and generally used to sit on the table by his side while he was writing either his letters articles or planning those improvements regarding aquariums for which he was so justly celebrated Illustration Next in value is the light slate or blue colour This beautiful tint is very different in its shades In some it verges towards a light purplish or lilac hue and is very lovely in others it tends to a much bluer tone having a colder and harder appearance still beautiful by way of contrast in all the colour should be pure even and bright not in any way mottled which is a defect and I may here remark that in these colours the hair is generally of a softer texture as far as I have observed than that of any other colour not excepting the white which is also in much request Then follow the various shades of light tabbies so light in the marking having scarcely a right to be called tabbies in fact tabby is not a Persian colour nor have I ever seen an imported cat of that colour I mean firmly strongly marked with black on a brown blue or gray ground until they culminate in those of intense richness and density in the way of deep harmonious browns and reds yet still preserving throughout an extreme delicacy of line and tracery never becoming harsh or hard in any of its arrangements or colour not as the ordinary short haired tabby The eyes should be orange yellow in the browns reds blues grays and blacks Illustration mister A A CLARKE S TIM As far as my experience extends and I have had numerous opportunities of noticing I find this variety less reliable as regards temper than the short haired cats less also in the keen sense of observing as in the Angora and also of turning such observations to account either as regards their comfort their endeavour to help themselves or in their efforts to escape from confinement In some few cases I have found them to be of almost a savage disposition biting and snapping more like a dog than a cat and using their claws less for protective purposes Nor have I found them so cossetty in their ways as those of the short coats though I have known exceptions in both They are much given to roam as indeed are the Russian and Angora especially in the country going considerable distances either for their own pleasure or in search of food or when on the hunt After mature consideration I have come to the conclusion that this breed and slightly so the preceding are decidedly different in their habits to the short haired English domestic cat as it is now generally called It may be however only a very close observer would notice the several peculiarities which I consider certainly exist These cats attach themselves to places more than persons and are indifferent to those who feed and have the care of them They are beautiful and useful objects about the house and generally very pleasant companions and when kept with the short haired varieties form an exceedingly pretty and interesting contrast but as I have stated they certainly require more attention to their training and more caution in their handling than the latter I may here remark that during the time I have acted as judge at cat shows which is now over eighteen years it has been seldom there has been any display of temper in the short haired breeds in comparison with the long though some of the former in some instances have not comported themselves with that sweetness and amiability of disposition that is their usual characteristic My attendant has been frequently wounded in our endeavour to examine the fur dentition et cetera of the Angora Persian or Russian and once severely by a short hair Hitherto I have been so fortunate as to escape all injury but this I attribute to my close observation of the countenance and expression of the cat about to be handled so as to be perfectly on my guard and to the knowledge of how to put my hands out of harm s way If a vicious cat is to be taken from one pen to another it must be carried by the loose skin at the back of the neck and that of the back with both hands and held well away from the person who is carrying it Illustration Illustration THE RUSSIAN LONG HAIRED CAT The above is a portrait of a cat given me many years ago whose parents came from Russia but from what part I could never ascertain It differed from the Angora and the Persian in many respects It was larger in the body with shorter legs The mane or frill was very large long and dense and more of a woolly texture with coarse hairs among it the colour was of dark tabby though the markings were not a decided black nor clear and distinct the ground colour was wanting in that depth and richness possessed by the Persian having a somewhat dull appearance The eyes were large and prominent of a bright orange slightly tinted with green the ears large by comparison with small tufts full of long woolly hair the limbs stout and short the tail being very dissimilar as it was short very woolly and thickly covered with hair the same length from the base to the tip and much resembled in form that of the English wild cat Its motion was not so agile as other cats nor did it apparently care for warmth as it liked being outdoors in the coldest weather Another peculiarity being that it seemed to care little in the way of watching birds for the purpose of food neither were its habits like those of the short haired cats that were its companions It attached itself to no person as was the case with some of the others but curiously took a particular fancy to one of my short haired silver gray tabbies the two appeared always together In front of the fire they sat side by side If one left the room the other followed Adown the garden paths there they were still companions and at night slept in the same box they drank milk from the same saucer and fed from the same plate and in fact only seemed to exist for each other In all my experience I never knew a more devoted couple I bred but one kitten from the Russian and this was the offspring of the short haired silver tabby It was black and white and resembled the Russian in a large degree having a woolly coat somewhat of a mane and a short very bushy tail This like his father seemed also to be fonder of animals for food than birds and although very small would without any hesitation attack and kill a full grown rat I have seen several Russian cats yet never but on this occasion had the opportunity of comparing their habits and mode of life with those of the other varieties neither have I seen any but those of a tabby colour and they mostly of a dark brown I am fully aware that many cross bred cats are sold as Russian Angora and Persian either between these or the short haired and some of these of course retain in large degree the distinctive peculiarities of each breed Yet to the practised eye there is generally I do not say always a difference of some sort by which the particular breed may be clearly defined When the prizes are given as is the case even at our largest cat shows for the best long haired cat there of course exists in the eye of the judge no distinction as regards breed He selects as he is bound to do that which is the best long haired cat in all points the length of hair colour texture and condition of the exhibit being that which commands his first attention But if it were so put that the prize should be for the best Angora Persian Russian et cetera it would make the task rather more than difficult for I have seen some first cross cats that have possessed all or nearly all the points requisite for that of the Angora Persian or Russian while others so bred have been very deficient perhaps showing the Angora cross only by the tail and a slight and small frill At the same time it must be noted that although from time to time some excellent specimens may be so bred it is by no means desirable to buy and use such for stock purposes for they will in all probability throw back that is after several generations although allied with thoroughbred they will possibly have a little family of quite short hairs I have known this with rabbits who after breeding short haired varieties for some time suddenly reverted to a litter of long hairs but have not carried out the experiment with cats At the same time I may state that I have little or no doubt that such would be the case therefore I would urge on all those who are fond of cats or in fact other animals of any particular breed to use when possible none but those of the purest pedigree as this will tend to prevent much disappointment that might otherwise ensue But I am digressing and so back to my subject the Russian long haired cat I advisedly say long haired cat for I shall hereafter have to treat of other cats coming from Russia that are short haired none which I have hitherto seen being tabbies but whole colour This is the more singular as all those of the long hair have been brown tabbies with only one or two exceptions which were black It is just possible these were the offspring of tabby or gray parents as the wild rabbit has been known to have had black progeny I have seen a black rabbit shot from amongst the gray on the South Downs Illustration MISS MARY GRESHAM S PERSIAN KITTEN LAMBKIN I do not remember having seen a white Russian long hair and I should feel particularly obliged to any of my readers who could supply me with further information on this subject or on any other relating to the various breeds of cats cat life and habits I am fully aware that no two cats are exactly alike either in their form colour movements or habits but what I have given much study and attention to and what I wish to arrive at is the broad existing natural distinctions of the different varieties In this way I shall feel grateful for any information Illustration The above engraving and description of a very peculiar animal is from Daniel s Rural Sports eighteen thirteen This Cat was the Property of missus Finch of Maldon Essex In the Account of this Lusus Naturae for such it may be deemed the Mother had no other Likeness to her Production than her Colour which is a tawny Sandy in some parts lightly streaked with black She had this and another Kitten like it about two Years since The fellow Kitten was killed in consequence of being troublesome to the Mistress of the House where it was presented This is a Male above the usual Size with a shaggy Appearance round its Face resembling that of the Lion s in Miniature The Hair protruding from the Ears formerly grew like what are termed Cork screw Curls and which are frequently seen among the smart young Watermen on the Thames the Tail is perfectly distinct from that of the Cat Species and resembles the Brush of a Fox The Mother has at this time eighteen thirteen three Young ones but without the least Difference to common Kittens neither indeed has she ever had any before or since similar to That here described The Proprietor has been offered and refused One Hundred Pounds for this Animal Illustration This was either a cross with the English wild cat which sometimes has a mane or it was an accidental variation of nature I once bred a long haired rabbit in a similar way but at first I failed entirely to perpetuate the peculiarity I think the above simply a sport Illustration MISS MARY GRESHAM S PERSIAN KITTEN LAMBKIN NO two Illustration MISS MOORE S BOGEY I have now concluded my remarks on the long haired varieties of cats that I am at present acquainted with They are an exceedingly interesting section their habits manners forms and colours form a by no means unprofitable study for those fond of animal life as they in my opinion differ in many ways from those of their short haired brethren I shall not cease however in my endeavours to find out if any other long haired breeds exist and I am therefore making inquiries in every direction in which I deem it likely I shall get an increase of information on the subject but hitherto without any success Therefore I am led to suppose that the three I have enumerated are the only domesticated long haired varieties The nearest approach I believe to these in the wild state is that of the British wild cat which has in some instances a mane and a bushy tail slightly resembling that of the Russian long hair with much of the same facial expression and rather pointed tufts at the apex of the ears It is also large like some of the long haired cats that I have seen in fact it far more resembles these breeds than those of the short hair I was much struck with the many points of similitude on seeing the British wild cat exhibited by the Duke of Sutherland at the first cat show at the Crystal Palace in July eighteen seventy one I merely offer this as an idea for further consideration At the same time allow me to say that I have had no opportunity of studying the anatomy of the British wild cat in contradistinction to that of the Russian or others with long hair I only wish to point out what I term a general resemblance far in excess of those with short hair I am fully aware how difficult it is to trace any origin of the domestic cat or from what breeds it is also said that the British wild cat is not one of them still I urge there exists the similarity I mention whether it is so apparent to others I know not Illustration Illustration mister SMITH S PRIZE HE CAT THE TORTOISESHELL CAT I now come to the section of the short haired domestic cat a variety possessing sub varieties Whether these all came from the same origin is doubtful although in breeding many of the different colours will breed back to the striped or tabby colour and per contra white whole coloured cats are often got from striped or spotted parents and vice versa Those that have had any experience of breeding domesticated animals or birds know perfectly well how difficult it is to keep certain peculiarities gained by years of perseverance of breeding for such points of variation or what is termed excellence Place a few fancy pigeons for instance in the country and let them match how they like and one would be quite surprised unless he were a naturalist to note the great changes that occur in a few years and the unmistakable signs of reversion towards their ancestral stock that of the Rock pigeon But with the cat this is somewhat different as little or no attempts have been made as far as I know of until cat shows were instituted to improve any particular breed either in form or colour Nor has it even yet with the exception of the long haired cats Why this is so I am at a loss to understand but the fact remains Good well developed cats of certain colours fetch large prices and are if I may use the term perpetual prize winners I will take as an instance the tortoiseshell tom he or male cat as one of the most scarce and the red or yellow tabby she cat as the next and yet the possessor of either with proper care and attention I have little or no doubt has it in his power to produce either variety ad libitum It is now many years since I remember the first tortoiseshell tom cat nor can I now at this distance of time quite call to mind whether or not it was not a tortoiseshell and white and not a tortoiseshell pure and simple It was exhibited in Piccadilly If I remember rightly I made a drawing of it but as it is about forty years ago of this I am not certain although I have lately been told that I did and that the price asked for the cat was one hundred guineas Illustration EXAMPLE OF TORTOISESHELL CAT VERY DARK VARIETY This supposed scarcity was rudely put aside by the appearance at the Crystal Palace Show of eighteen seventy one of no less than one tortoiseshell he cat exhibited by mister Smith and three tortoiseshell and white he cats but it will be observed there was really but only one tortoiseshell he cat the others having white On referring to the catalogues of the succeeding shows no other pure tortoiseshell has been exhibited and he ceased to appear after eighteen seventy three but tortoiseshell and white have been shown from eighteen seventy one varying in number from five to three until eighteen eighty five One of these a tortoiseshell and white belonging to mister Hurry gained no fewer than nine first prizes at the Crystal Palace besides several firsts at other shows this maintains my statement that a really good scarce variety of cats is a valuable investment mister Hurry s cat Totty keeping up his price of Lone hundred till the end As may have been gathered from the foregoing remarks the points of the tortoiseshell he cat are black red and yellow in patches but no white The colouring should be in broad well defined blotches and solid in colour not mealy or tabby like in the marking but clear sharp and distinct and the richer and deeper the colours the better When this is so the animal presents a very handsome appearance The eyes should be orange the tail long and thick towards the base the form slim graceful and elegant and not too short on the leg to which this breed has a tendency Coming then to the actual tortoiseshell he or male cat without white I have never seen but one at the Shows and that was exhibited by mister Smith It does not appear that mister Smith bred any from it nor do I know whether he took any precautions to do so but if not I am still of the opinion that more might have been produced In Cassell s Natural History it is stated that the tortoiseshell cat is quite common in Egypt and in the south of Europe This I can readily believe as I think that it comes from a different stock than the usual short haired cat the texture of the hair being different the form of tail also I should much like to know whether in that country where the variety is so common there exists any number of tortoiseshell he cats In England the he kittens are almost invariably red tabby or red tabby and white the red tabby she cats are almost as scarce as tortoiseshell and white he cats Yet if red tabby she cats can be produced I am of opinion that tortoiseshell he cats could also I had one of the former a great beauty and hoped to perpetuate the breed but it unfortunately fell a victim to wires set by poachers for game Again returning to the tortoiseshell I have noted that in drawings made by the Japanese the cats are always of this colour that being so it leads one to suppose that in that country tortoiseshell he cats must be plentiful Though the drawings are strong evidence they are not absolute proof I have asked several travelling friends questions as regards the Japanese cats but in no case have I found them to have taken sufficient notice for their testimony to be anything else than worthless I shall be very thankful for any information on this subject for to myself and doubtless also to many others it is exceedingly interesting Any one wishing to breed rich brown tabbies should use a tortoiseshell she cat with a very brown and black banded he cat They are not so good from the spotted tabby often producing merely tortoiseshell tabbies instead of brown tabbies or true tortoiseshells My remarks as to the colouring of the tortoiseshell he cat are equally applicable to the she cat which should not have any white Of the tortoiseshell and white hereafter To breed tortoiseshell he cats I should use males of a whole colour such as either white black or blue and on no account any tabby no matter the colour What is wanted is patches of colour not tiny streaks or spots and I feel certain that for those who persevere there will be successful results Illustration Illustration THE TORTOISESHELL AND WHITE CAT This is a more common mixture of colouring than the tortoiseshell pure and simple without white and seems to be widely spread over different parts of the world It is the opinion of some that this colour and the pure tortoiseshell is the original domestic cat and that the other varieties of marking and colours are but deviations produced by crossing with wild varieties My brother John Jenner Weir F L S F Z S holds somewhat to this opinion but to me it is rather difficult to arrive at this conclusion In fact I can scarcely realise the ground on which the theory is based at the same time I do not mean to ignore it entirely And yet if this be so from what starting point was the original domestic cat derived and by what means were the rich and varied markings obtained I am fully aware that by selection cats with large patches of colour may be obtained still there remain the peculiar markings of the tortoiseshell Nor is this by any means an uncommon colour not only in this country but in many others and there also appears to be a peculiar fixedness of this especially in the female but why it is not so in the male I am at a loss to understand the males almost invariably coming either red tabby or red tabby and white One would suppose that black or white would be equally likely but as far as my observations take me this is not so though I have seen both pure white yellow red and black in litters of kittens but this might be different were the he parent tortoiseshell Some years ago I was out with a shooting party not far from Snowdon in Wales when turning past a large rock I came on a sheltered nook and there in a nest made of dry grasses laid six tortoiseshell and white kittens about eight to ten days old I was much surprised at this as I did not know of any house near therefore these must have been the offspring of some cat or cats that were leading a roving or wild life and yet it had no effect as to the deviation of the colour I left them there and without observing the sex I was afterwards sorry as it is just possible though scarcely probable that one or more of the six being all of the same colour might have proved to be a male As I left the neighbourhood a few days after I saw no more of them nor have I since heard of any being there so conclude they in some way were destroyed I have observed in the breed of tortoiseshell or tortoise shell and white that the hair is of a coarser texture than the ordinary domestic cat and that the tail is generally thicker especially at the base though some few are thin tailed yet I prefer the thick and tapering form Some are very much so and of a good length the legs are generally somewhat short I do not ever remember seeing a really long legged tortoiseshell though when this is so if not too long it adds much to its grace of action I give a drawing of what I consider to be a GOOD tortoiseshell and white tom or he cat It will be observed that there is more white on the chest belly and hind legs than is allowable in the black and white cat This I deem necessary for artistic beauty when the colour is laid on in patches although it should be even clear and distinct in its outline the larger space of white adds brilliancy to the red yellow and black colouring The face is one of the parts which should have some uniformity of colour and yet not so but a mere balancing of colour that is to say that there should be a relief in black with the yellow and red on each side and so in the body and tail The nose should be white the eyes orange and the whole colouring rich and varied without the least Tabbyness either brown or gray or an approach to it such being highly detrimental to its beauty I have received a welcome letter from mister Herbert Young of James Street Harrogate informing me of the existence of what is said to be a tortoiseshell tom or he cat somewhere in Yorkshire and the price is fifty guineas but he unfortunately has forgotten the exact address He also kindly favours me with the further information of a tortoiseshell and white he cat He describes it as splendid and extra good in colour and it is at present in the vicinity of Harrogate And still further mister Herbert Young says I am breeding from a dark colour cat and two tortoiseshell females and he hopes by careful selection to succeed in breeding the other colour out This I deem is by no means an unlikely thing to happen and by careful management may not take very long to accomplish but much depends on the ancestry or rather the pedigree of both sides I for one most heartily wish mister Herbert Young success and it will be most gratifying should he arrive at the height of his expectations Failing the producing of the desired colour in the he cats by the legitimate method of tortoiseshell with tortoiseshell I would advise the trial of some whole colours such as solid black and white This may prove a better way than the other as we pigeon fanciers go an apparently roundabout way often to obtain what we want to attain in colour and yet there is almost a certainty in the method As regards the tortoiseshell cat there is a distinct variety known to us cat fanciers as the tortoiseshell tabby This must not be confounded with the true variety as it consists only of a variegation in colour of the yellow the red and the dark tabby and is more in lines than patches or patches of lines or spots These are by no means ugly and a well marked richly coloured specimen is really very handsome They may also be intermixed with white and should be marked the same as the true tortoiseshell but in competition with the real tortoiseshell they would stand no chance whatever and ought in my opinion to be disqualified as being wrong class and be put in that for any other colour Illustration missus VYVYAN S ROYAL CAT OF SIAM Illustration BROWN TABBY BARS THE RIGHT WIDTH THE BROWN TABBY CAT The tabby cat is doubtless one of if not the most common of colours and numbers many almost endless varieties of both tint and markings Of these those with very broad bands of black or narrow bands of black on nearly a black ground are usually called black tabby and if the bands are divided into spots instead of being in continuous lines then it is a spotted black tabby but I purpose in this paper to deal mostly with the brown tabby that is to say a tabby whose ground colour is of a very rich orangey dark brown ground without any white and that is evenly proportionably and not too broadly but elegantly marked on the face head breast sides back belly legs and tail with bands of solid deep shining black The front part of the head or face and legs breast and belly should have a more rich red orange tint than the back but which should be nearly if not equal in depth of colour though somewhat browner the markings should be graceful in curve sharply well and clearly defined with fine deep black edges so that the brown and black are clear and distinct the one from the other not blurred in any way The banded tabby should not be spotted in any way excepting those few that nearly always occur on the face and sometimes on the fore legs The clearer redder and brighter the brown the better The nose should be deep red bordered with black the eyes an orange colour slightly diffused with green in form the head should not be large nor too wide being rather longer than broad so as not to give too round or clumsy an appearance ears not large nor small but of moderate size and of good form legs medium length rather long than short so as not to lose grace of action body long narrow and deep towards the fore part Tail long and gradually tapering towards the point feet round with black claws and black pads yellowish white around the black lips and brown whiskers are allowable but orange tinted are far preferable and pure white should disqualify A cat of this description is now somewhat rare What are generally shown as brown tabbies are not sufficiently orange brown but mostly of a dark brownish gray This is simply the ordinary tabby and not the brown tabby proper Illustration BROWN TABBY MARKINGS MUCH TOO WIDE As I stated in my notes on the Tortoiseshell cat the best parents to obtain a good brown tabby from is to have a strongly marked not too broad banded tabby he cat and a tortoiseshell she cat with little black or red tabby she cat the produce being when tabby generally of a rich brown or sometimes what is termed black tabby and also red tabby The picture illustrating these notes is from one so bred and is a particularly handsome specimen There were two he cats in the litter one the dark brown tabby just mentioned which I named Aaron and the other a very fine red tabby Moses This last was even a finer animal than Aaron being very beautiful in colour and very large in size but he alas like many others was caught in wires set by poachers and was found dead His handsome brother still survives though no longer my property The banded red tabby should be marked precisely the same as the brown tabby only the bands should be of deep red on an orange ground the deeper in colour the better almost a chocolate on orange is very fine The nose deep pink as also the pads of the feet The ordinary dark tabby the same way as the brown and so also the blue or silver only the ground colour should be of a pale soft blue colour not the slightest tint of brown in it The clearer the lighter and brighter the blue the better bearing in mind always that the bands should be of a jet black sharply and very clearly defined Illustration WELL MARKED PRIZE SILVER TABBY The word tabby was derived from a kind of taffeta or ribbed silk which when calendered or what is now termed watered is by that process covered with wavy lines This stuff in bygone times was often called tabby hence the cat with lines or markings on its fur was called a tabby cat But it might also one would suppose with as much justice be called a taffety cat unless the calendering of taffety caused it to become tabby Certain it is that the word tabby only referred to the marking or stripes not to the absolute colour for in Wit and Drollery sixteen eighty two p three hundred forty three is the following Her petticoat of satin Her gown of crimson tabby Be that as it may I think there is little doubt that the foregoing was the origin of the term Yet it was also called the brinded cat or the brindled cat also tiger cat with some the gray cat graymalkin but I was rather unprepared to learn that in Norfolk and Suffolk it is called a Cyprus cat Why Cyprus cat quoth I I do not know said my informant All I know is that such is the case So I referred to my Bailey s Dictionary of seventeen thirty and there sure enough was the elucidation for I found that Cyprus was a kind of cloth made of silk and hair showing wavy lines on it and coming from Cyprus therefore this somewhat strengthens the argument in favour of taffeta or tabby but it is still curious that the Norfolk and Suffolk people should have adopted a kind of cloth as that representing the markings and colour of the cat and that of a different name from that in use for the cat one or more counties calling it a tabby cat as regards colour and the other naming the same as Cyprus I take this to be exceedingly interesting How or when such naming took place I am at present unable to get the least clue though I think from what I gather from one of the Crystal Palace Cat Show catalogues that it must have been after fifteen ninety seven as the excerpt shows that at that time the shape and colour was like a leopard s which of course is spotted and is always called the spotted leopard Since this I have learned that the domestic cat is said to have been brought from Cyprus by merchants as also was the tortoiseshell Cyprus is a colour a sort of reddish yellow something like citron so a Cyprus cat may mean a red or yellow tabby However I find Holloway in his Dictionary of Provincialisms eighteen thirty nine gives the following Calimanco Cat s calimanco a glossy stuff a tortoiseshell cat Norfolk Salmon in The Compleat English Physician sixteen ninety three p three hundred twenty six writing of the cat says It is a neat and cleanly creature often licking itself to keep it fair and clean and washing its face with its fore feet the best are such as of a fair and large kind and of an exquisite tabby color called Cyprus cats Illustration Illustration SPOTTED TABBY CAT I have thought it best to give two illustrations of the peculiar markings of the spotted tabby or leopard cat of some as showing its distinctness from the ordinary and banded Tabby one of my reasons being that I have when judging at cat shows often found excellent specimens of both entered in the wrong class thereby losing all chance of a prize though if rightly entered either might very possibly have taken honours I therefore wish to direct particular attention to the spotted character of the markings of the variety called the spotted tabby It will be observed that there are no lines but what are lines in other tabbies are broken up into a number of spots and the more these spots prevail to the exclusion of lines or bands the better the specimen is considered to be The varieties of the ground colour or tint on which these markings or spots are placed constitutes the name such as black spotted tabby brown spotted tabby and so on the red spotted tabby or yellow spotted tabby in she cats being by far the most scarce These should be marked with spots instead of bands on the same ground colour as the red or yellow banded tabby cat In the former the ground colour should be a rich red with spots of a deep almost chocolate colour while that of the yellow tabby may be a deep yellow cream with yellowish brown spots Both are very scarce and are extremely pretty Any admixture of white is not allowable in the class for yellow or red tabbies such exhibit must be put into the class should there be one which is usually the case at large shows for red or yellow and white tabbies This exhibitors will do well to make a note of There is a rich coloured brown tabby hybrid to be seen at the Zoological Society Gardens in Regent s Park between the wild cat of Bengal and a tabby she cat It is handsome but very wild These hybrids I am told will breed again with tame variety or with others Illustration In the brown spotted tabby the dark gray spotted tabby the black spotted tabby the gray or the blue spotted tabby the eyes are best yellow or orange tinted with the less of the green the better The nose should be of a dark red edged with black or dark brown in the dark colours or somewhat lighter colour in the gray or blue tabbies The pads of the feet in all instances must be black In the yellow and the red tabby the nose and the pads of the feet are to be pink As regards the tail that should have large spots on the upper and lower sides instead of being annulated but this is difficult to obtain It has always occurred to me that the spotted tabby is a much nearer approach to the wild English cat and some other wild cats in the way of colour than the ordinary broad banded tabby Those specimens of the crosses said to be between the wild and domestic cat that I have seen have had a tendency to be spotted tabbies And these crosses were not infrequent in bygone times when the wild cats were more numerous than at present as is stated to be the case by that reliable authority Thomas Bewick In the year eighteen seventy three there was a specimen shown at the Crystal Palace Cat Show and also the last year or two there has been exhibited at the same place a most beautiful hybrid between the East Indian wild cat and the domestic cat It was shown in the spotted tabby class and won the first prize The ground colour was a deep blackish brown with well defined black spots black pads to the feet rich in colour and very strong and powerfully made and not by any means a sweet temper It was a he cat and though I have made inquiry I have not been able to ascertain that any progeny has been reared from it yet I have been informed that such hybrids between the Indian wild cat and the domestic cat breed freely Illustration THE ABYSSINIAN I now come to the last variety of the tabby cat and this can scarcely be called a tabby proper as it is nearly destitute of markings excepting sometimes on the legs and a broad black band along the back It is mostly of a deep brown ticked with black somewhat resembling the back of a wild only not so gray rabbit Along the centre of the back from the nape of the neck to the tip of the tail there is a band of black very slightly interspersed with dark brown hairs The inner sides of the legs and belly are more of a rufous orange tint than the body and are marked in some cases with a few dark patches but they are best without these marks and in the exhibition pens it is a point lost The eyes are deep yellow tinted with green nose dark red black edged ears rather small dark brown with black edges and tips the pads of the feet are black Altogether it is a pretty and interesting variety It has been shown under a variety of names such as Russian Spanish Abyssinian Hare cat Rabbit cat and some have gone so far as to maintain that it is a cross between the latter and a cat proving very unmistakably there is nothing however absurd or impossible in animal or everyday life that some people are not ready to credit and believe A hybrid between the English wild cat and the domestic much resembles it and I do not consider it different in any way with the exception of its colour from the ordinary tabby cat from which I have seen kittens and adults bearing almost the same appearance Some years ago when out rabbit shooting on the South Downs not far from Eastbourne one of our party shot a cat of this colour in a copse not far from the village of Eastdean He mistook it at first for a rabbit as it dashed into the underwood It proved not to be wild but belonged to one of the villagers and was bred in the village When the ground colour is light gray or blue it is generally called chinchilla to the fur of which animal the coat has a general resemblance I have but little inclination to place it as a distinct though often it is of foreign breed such may be though ours is merely a variety and a very interesting one of the ordinary tabby with which its form habits temper et cetera seem fully to correspond still several have been imported from Abyssinia all of which were precisely similar and it is stated that this is the origin of the Egyptian cat that was worshipped so many centuries ago The mummies of the cats I have seen in no case had any hair left so that it was impossible to determine what colour they were The imported cats are of stouter build than the English and less marked These bred with an English tabby often give a result of nearly black the back band extending very much down the sides and the brown ticks almost disappearing producing a rich and beautiful colouring I find there is yet another tint or colour of the tabby proper which I have not mentioned that is to say a cat marked with light wavy lines and an exceedingly pretty one it is It is very rare in fact so much so that it has never had a class appropriated to it and therefore is only admissible to or likely to win in the class For Any Other Colour in which class usually a number of very beautiful varieties are to be found some of which I shall have occasion to notice further on The colour however that I now refer to is often called the silver tabby for want of a better name It is this The whole of the ground colour is of a most delicate silver gray clear and firm in tone slightly blue if anything apart from the gray and the markings thereon are but a little darker with a tinge of lilac in them making the fur to look like an evening sky rayed with light clouds The eyes are orange yellow and when large and full make a fine contrast to the colour of the fur The nose is red edged with a lilac tint and the pads of the feet and claws are black or nearly so The hair is generally very fine short and soft Altogether it is most lovely and well worthy of attention forming as it does a beautiful contrast to the red the yellow or even the brown tabby A turquoise ribbon about its neck will show to great advantage the delicate lilac tints of its coat or if a contrast is preferred a light orange scarlet or what is often called geranium colour will perhaps give a brighter and more pleasing effect Illustration missus HERRING S BLUE SMALL BANDED TABBY This is by no means so uncommon a colour in the long haired cats some of which are exquisite and are certainly the acme of beauty in the way of cat colouring but I must here remark that there is a vast difference in the way of disposition between these two light varieties that of the former being far more gentle In fact I am of opinion that the short haired cat in general is of a more genial temperament more cossetty more observant more quick in adapting itself to its surroundings and circumstances than its long haired brother and as a rule it is also more cleanly in its habits Though at the same time I am willing to admit that some of these peculiarities being set aside the long haired cat is charmingly beautiful and at the same time has a large degree of intelligence in fact much more than most animals that I know not even setting aside the dog and I have come to this conclusion after much long careful and mature consideration Illustration Illustration THE SHORT HAIRED WHITE CAT This of all as it depends entirely on its comeliness should be graceful and elegant in the outline of its form and also action the head small not too round nor thick for this gives a clumsy heavy appearance but broad on the forehead and gently tapering towards the muzzle the nose small tip even and pink the ears rather small than large and not too pointed the neck slender shoulders narrow and sloping backwards loin full and long legs of moderate length tail well set on long broad at the base and gradually tapering towards the end the white should be the yellow white that is the white of the colours such as tortoiseshell red tabby or blues not the gray white bred from the black as these are coarser in the quality of the furs The eye should be large round full and blue I noted this peculiarity of white when breeding white Cochins many years ago those chickens that were black when hatched were a colder and harder white than those which were hatched buff This colouring of white should be fully borne in mind when crossing colours in breeding as the results are widely different from the two varieties The whole colour yellow white will not do to match with blue or gray as it will assuredly give the wrong tinge or colour The eyes should be blue green is a great defect bright yellow is allowable or what in horses is called wall eyes Orange gives a heavy appearance but yellow will harmonise and look well with a gray white White cats with blue eyes are hardy mister Timbs in Things Not Generally Known relates that even they are not so likely to be deaf as is supposed and mentions one of seventeen years old which retained its hearing faculties perfectly Some specimens I have seen with one yellow eye and one blue this is a most singular freak of nature and to the best of my knowledge is not to be found among any of the other colours It is stated that one of the white horses recently presented by the Shah of Persia to the Emperor of Russia has blue eyes I can scarcely credit this but think it must be a true albino with the gray pink coloured eyes they generally have or possibly the blue eye is that peculiar to the albino cat and horse as I have never seen an albino horse or cat with pink eyes but a kind of opalesque colour or what is termed wall eye No doubt many of my readers have observed the differences in the white of our horses they mostly being the gray white with dark skin but the purer white has a pink skin and is much softer and elegant in appearance It is the same with our white cats THE BLACK CAT It is often said What s in a name the object whatever it is by any other would be the same and yet there is much in a name but this is not the question at issue which is that of colour Why should a black cat be thought so widely different from all others by the foolish unthinking and ignorant Why simply on account of its colour being black should it have ascribed to it a numberless variety of bad omens besides having certain necromantic power In Germany for instance black cats are kept away from children as omens of evil and if a black cat appeared in the room of one lying ill it was said to portend death To meet a black cat in the twilight was held unlucky In the good old times a black cat was generally the only colour that was favoured by men reported to be wizards and also were said to be the constant companions of reputed witches and in such horror and detestation were they then held that when the unfortunate creatures were ill treated drowned or even burned very frequently we are told that their cats suffered martyrdom at the same time It is possible that one of the reasons for such wild savage superstition may have arisen from the fact of the larger amount of electricity to be found by friction in the coat of the black cat to any other experiments prove there is but very little either in that of the white or the red tabby cat Be this as it may still the fact remains that for some reason or other the black cat is held by the prejudiced ignorant as an animal most foul and detestable and wonderful stories are related of their actions in the dead of the night during thunder storms and windy nights Yet as far as I can discover there appears little difference either of temper or habit in the black cat distinct from that of any other colour though it is maintained by many even to this day that black cats are far more vicious and spiteful and of higher courage and this last I admit Still when a black cat is enraged and its coat and tail are well set up its form swollen its round bright orange yellow eye distended and all aglow with anger it certainly presents to even the most impartial observer to say the least of it a most uncanny appearance But for all this their admirers are by no means few and to my thinking a jet black cat fine and glossy in fur and elegantly formed certainly has its attractions but I will refer to the superstitions connected with the black cat further on A black cat for show purposes should be of a uniform intense black a brown black is richer than a blue black I mean by this that when the hair is parted it should show in the division a dark brown black in preference to any tint of blue whatever The coat or fur should be short velvety and very glossy The eyes round and full and of a deep orange colour nose black and also the pads of the feet tail long wide at the base and tapering gradually towards the end A long thin tail is a great fault and detracts much from the merits it may otherwise possess A good deep rich coloured black cat is not so common as many may at first suppose as often those that are said to be black show tabby markings under certain conditions of light and again others want depth and richness of colour some being only a very dark gray In form it is the same as other short haired cats such as I have described in the white and this brings me to the variety called blue Illustration ARCHANGEL BLUE CAT THE BLUE CAT This is shown often under a number of names It was at first shown as the Archangel cat then Russian blue Spanish blue Chartreuse blue and lastly and I know not why the American blue It is not in my belief a distinct breed but merely a light coloured form of the black cat In fact I have ascertained that one shown at the Crystal Palace and which won many prizes on account of its beautiful blue colour slightly tinged with purple was the offspring of a tabby and white she cat and a black and white he cat and I have seen the same colour occur when bred from the cats usually kept about a farmhouse as a protection from rats and mice though none of the parents had any blue colour Being so beautiful and as it is possible in some places abroad it may be bred in numbers I deemed it advisable when making out the prize schedule to give special prizes for this colour the fur being used for various purposes on account of its hue A fine specimen should be even in colour of a bluish lilac tint with no sootiness or black and though light be firm and rich in tone the nose and pads dark and the eyes orange yellow If of a very light blue gray the nose and pads may be of a deep chocolate colour and the eyes deep yellow not green If it is a foreign variety I can only say that I see no distinction in form temper or habit and as I have before mentioned it is sometimes bred here in England from cats bearing no resemblance to the bluish lilac colour nor of foreign extraction or pedigree I feel bound however to admit that those that came from Archangel were of a deeper purer tint than the English cross breeds and on reference to my notes I find they had larger ears and eyes and were larger and longer in the head and legs also the coat or fur was excessively short rather inclined to woolliness but bright and glossy the hair inside the ears being shorter than is usual in the English cat Illustration Illustration THE BLACK AND WHITE CAT This is distinct from the white and black cat the ground colour being black marked with white while the other is white marked with black The chief points of excellence for show purposes are a dense bright brown black evenly marked with white Of this I give an illustration showing the most approved way in which the white should be distributed coming to a point between the eyes The feet should be white and the chest the nose and the pads white No black on the lips or nose whiskers white eyes of orange yellow Any black on the white portions is highly detrimental to its beauty and its chance of a prize The same markings are applicable to the brown tabby and white the dark tabby and white the red tabby and white the yellow tabby and white the blue or silver tabby and white and the blue and white One great point is to obtain a perfectly clear and distinct gracefully curved outline of colour and this to be maintained throughout the blaze on the forehead to be central It is stated that if a dog has white anywhere he is sure to have a white tip to his tail and I think on observation it will be found usually the case although this is not so in the cat for I cannot call to mind a single instance where a black and white had a white tip to its tail but taking the various colours of the domestic cat into consideration I think it will be found that there is a larger number with some white about them than those of entirely one colour without even a few white hairs which if they appear at all are mostly to be found on the chest though they often are exceedingly few in number Illustration missus VYVYAN S ROYAL CAT OF SIAM Illustration THE WHITE AND BLACK CAT This differs entirely from the black and white cat as just explained and is the opposite as regards colour the ground being white instead of black and the markings black on white For exhibition purposes and points of excellence no particular rule exists beyond that the exhibit shall be evenly marked with the colour distributed so as to balance as for example If a cat has a black patch just under one eye with a little above the balance of colour would be maintained if the other eye had a preponderance of colour above instead of below and so with the nose shoulders or back but it would be far better if the patches of colour were the same size and shape and equal in position It might be that a cat evenly marked on the head had a mark on the left shoulder with more on the right with a rather larger patch on the right side of the loin or a black tail would help considerably to produce what is termed balance though a cat of this description would lose if competing against one of entirely uniform markings I have seen several that have been marked in a very singular way One was entirely white with black ears Another white with a black tail only This had orange eyes and was very pretty Another had a black blaze up the nose the rest of the animal being white This had blue eyes and was deaf Another had the two front feet black all else being white the eyes were yellow tinted green All these it will be observed were perfect in the way they were marked I give an illustration of a cat belonging to mister S Lyon of Crewe It is remarkable in more ways than one and in all probability had it been born in the dark ages a vast degree of importance would have been attached to it not only on account of the peculiar distribution of the colour and its form but also as to the singular coincidence of its birth The head is white with a black mark over the eyes and ears which when looked at from above presents the appearance of a fleur de lis The body is white with a distinct black cross on the right side or rather more on the back than side The cross resembles that known as Maltese in form and is clearly defined The tail is black the legs and feet white Nor does the cat s claim to notice entirely end here for marvellous to relate it was born on Easter Sunday A D eighteen eighty six Now what would have been said of such a coincidence had this peculiar development of Nature occurred in bygone times There is just the possibility that the credulous would have flocked to see the wondrous animal from far and near and even now in these enlightened times I learn from mister Lyon that the cat is not by any means devoid of interest and attraction for as he tells me a number of persons have been to see it some of whom predict that luck will follow and that he and his household will in consequence doubtless enjoy many blessings and that all things will prosper with him accordingly Although my remarks are directed to the white and black cat the same will apply to the white and red white and yellow white and tabby white and blue or dun colour all these and the foregoing will most probably have to be exhibited in the Any Other Colour class as there is seldom one at even the largest shows for peculiar markings with white as the ground or principal colour Illustration WHITE CAT Illustration SIAMESE CAT

none	none	There are cavies so marked and many years ago I saw a mouse similarly coloured mister Young informs me that the kittens he has bred from his dark variety have invariably come the usual gray or light dun colour with dark points 
6006_60480_000005_000003	train-clean-360	I therefore take that to be the correct form and colour and the darker colour to be an accidental deviation 
none	none	In pug dogs such a depth of colour would be considered a blemish however beautiful it might be even black pugs do not obtain prizes in competition with a true marked light dun but whatever colour the body is it should be clear and firm rich and not clouded in any way 
6006_60480_000005_000005	train-clean-360	But I give mister Young s own views 
6006_60480_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 The dun Siamese we have has won whenever shown the body is of a dun colour nose part of the face ears feet and tail of a very dark chocolate brown nearly black eyes of a beautiful blue by day and of a red colour at night 
6006_60480_000006_000001	train-clean-360	My other prize cat is of a very rich chocolate or seal with darker face ears and tail the legs are a shade darker which intensifies towards the feet 
none	none	The eyes small of a rich amber colour the ears are bare of hair and not so much hair between the eyes and the ears as the English cats have 
6006_60480_000006_000003	train-clean-360	The dun unless under special judges invariably beats the chocolate at the shows 
6006_60480_000006_000004	train-clean-360	The tail is shorter and finer than our English cats 
6006_60480_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I may add that we lately have had four kittens from the chocolate cat by a pure dun Siamese he cat 
6006_60480_000007_000001	train-clean-360	All the young are dun coloured and when born were very light nearly white but are gradually getting the dark points of the parents in fact I expect that one will turn chocolate The cats are very affectionate and make charming ladies pets but are rather more delicate than our cats but after they have once wintered in England they seem to get acclimatised 
6006_60480_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Brennand who brought the chocolate one and another a male from Singapore last year informs me that there are two varieties a large and small 
6006_60480_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Ours are the small he also tells me the chocolate is the most rare 
6006_60480_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I have heard a little more regarding the Siamese cats from Miss Walker the daughter of General Walker who brought over one male and three females 
none	none	It seems the only pure breed is kept at the King of Siam s palace and the cats are very difficult to procure for in Siam it took three different gentlemen of great influence three months before they could get any
6006_60480_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Their food is fish and rice boiled together until quite soft and Miss Walker finds the kittens bred have thriven on it 
6006_60480_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 It is my intention to try and breed from a white English female with blue eyes and a Siamese male 
6006_60480_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 The Siamese cats are very prolific breeders having generally five at each litter and three litters a year 
none	none	We have never succeeded in breeding any like our chocolate cat they all come fawn with black or dark brown points the last family are a little darker on their backs which gives them a richer appearance than the pale fawn 
6006_60480_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Hitherto we have never had any half bred Siamese but there used to be a male Siamese at Hurworth on Tees and there were many young bred from English cats 
none	none	They invariably showed the Siamese cross in the ground colour From the foregoing it will be seen how very difficult it is to obtain the pure breed even in Siam and on reference to the Crystal Palace catalogues from the year eighteen seventy one until eighteen eighty seven I find that there were fifteen females and only four males and some of these were not entire and I have always understood that the latter were not allowed to be exported and were only got by those so fortunate as a most extraordinary favour as the King of Siam is most jealous of keeping the breed entirely in Siam as royal cats The one exhibited by Lady Dorothy Nevill missus 
6006_60480_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Poodle had three kittens by an English cat but none showed any trace of the Siamese being all tabby 
none	none	Although mister Herbert Young was informed by mister Brennand that there is another and a larger breed in Siam it does not appear that any of these have been imported nor have we any description of them either as to colour size form or quality of coat or whether they resemble the lesser variety in this or any respect yet it is to be hoped that ere long some specimens may be secured for this country Besides mister Herbert Young I am also much indebted to the courtesy of missus Vyvyan of Dover who is a lover of this beautiful breed and who kindly sends the following information
6006_60480_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 The original pair were sent from Bangkok and it is believed that they came from the King s Palace where alone the breed are said to be kept pure 
none	none	At any rate they were procured as a great favour after much delay and great difficulty and since that time no others have been attainable by the same person 
6006_60480_000018_000002	train-clean-360	We were in China when they reached us and the following year eighteen eighty six we brought the father mother and a pair of kittens to England 
6006_60480_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Their habits are in general the same as the common cat though it has been observed by strangers there is a pleasant wild animal odour which is not apparent to us 
none	none	Most of the kittens have a kink in the tail it varies in position sometimes in the middle close to the body or at the extreme end like a hook 
6006_60480_000021_000000	train-clean-360	This tallies with the description given by mister Darwin of the Malayan and also the Siamese cats 
6006_60480_000021_000001	train-clean-360	See my notes on the Manx cat 
6006_60480_000021_000002	train-clean-360	mister Young had also noted this peculiarity in the Royal cat of Siam 
6006_60480_000022_000000	train-clean-360	missus Vyvyan further remarks 
6006_60480_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 They are very affectionate and personally attached to their human friends not liking to be left alone and following us from room to room more after the manner of dogs than cats 
6006_60480_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 They are devoted parents the old father taking the greatest interest in the young ones 
6006_60480_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 They are friendly with the dogs of the house occupying the same baskets but the males are very strong and fight with great persistency with strange dogs and conquer all other tom cats in their neighbourhood 
none	none	We lost one however a very fine cat in China in this way as he returned to the house almost torn to pieces and in a dying condition from an encounter with some animal which we think was one of the wild cats of the hills We feed them on fresh fish boiled with rice until the two are nearly amalgamated they also take bread and milk warm the milk having been boiled and this diet seems to suit them better than any other 
6006_60480_000026_000001	train-clean-360	They also like chicken and game 
6006_60480_000026_000002	train-clean-360	We have proved the fish diet is not essential as two of our cats in Cornwall never get it 
6006_60480_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Rather a free life seems necessary to their perfect acclimatisation where they can go out and provide themselves with raw animal food feather and fur 
6006_60480_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 We find these cats require a great deal of care unless they live in the country and become hardy through being constantly out of doors 
6006_60480_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The kittens are difficult to rear unless they are born late in the spring thus having the warm weather before them 
6006_60480_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Most deaths occur before they are six months old 
none	none	We have lost several kittens from worms which they endeavour to vomit as relief we give them raw chicken heads with the feathers on with success 
6006_60480_000029_000001	train-clean-360	We also give cod liver oil if the appetite fails and weight diminishes 
none	none	When first born the colour is nearly pure white the only trace of points being a fine line of dark gray at the edge of the ears a gradual alteration takes place the body becoming creamy the ears face tail and feet darkening until about a year old they attain perfection when the points should be the deepest brown nearly black and the body ash or fawn colour eyes opal or blue looking red in the dark 
6006_60480_000030_000001	train-clean-360	After maturity they are apt to darken considerably though not in all specimens 
6006_60480_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 They are most interesting and delightful pets 
none	none	But owing to their delicacy and the great care they require no one unless a real cat lover should attempt to keep them they cannot with safety to their health be treated as common cats During Susan s one of the cats illness the old he cat came daily to condole with her bringing delicate attentions in the form of freshly caught mice
6006_60480_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Loquat also provided this for a young family for whom she had no milk 
none	none	Another Saiwan is very clever at undoing the latch of the window in order to let himself out tying it up with string is of no use and he has even managed to untwist wire that has been used to prevent his going out in the snow 
6006_60480_000033_000001	train-clean-360	We have at present two males four adult females and five kittens One of our kittens sent to Scotland last August has done well 
6006_60480_000034_000000	train-clean-360	missus Lee of Penshurst also has some fine specimens of the breed and of the same colours as described 
6006_60480_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I take it therefore that the true breed by consensus of opinion is that of the dun fawn or ash coloured ground with black points 
6006_60480_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Other colours should be shown in the variety classes 
6006_60480_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The head should be long from the ears to the eyes and not over broad and then rather sharply taper off towards the muzzle the forehead flat and receding the eyes somewhat aslant downwards towards the nose and the eyes of a pearly yet bright blue colour the ears usual size and black with little or no hair on the inside with black muzzle and round the eyes black 
6006_60480_000035_000001	train-clean-360	The form should be slight graceful and delicately made body long tail rather short and thin and the legs somewhat short slender and the feet oval not so round as the ordinary English cat 
6006_60480_000035_000002	train-clean-360	The body should be one bright uniform even colour not clouded either rich fawn dun or ash 
none	none	The legs feet and tail black The back slightly darker is allowable if of a rich colour and the colour softened not clouded Illustration PROPERLY MARKED SIAMESE CAT Illustration THE MANX CAT The Manx cat is well known and is by no means uncommon It differs chiefly from the ordinary domestic cat in being tailless or nearly so the best breeds not having any the hind legs are thicker and rather longer particularly in the thighs It runs more like a hare than a cat the action of the legs being awkward nor does it seem to turn itself so readily or with such rapidity and ease the head is somewhat small for its size yet thick and well set on a rather long neck the eyes large round and full ears medium and rather rounded at the apex In colour they vary but I do not remember to have seen a white or many black though one of the best that has come under my notice was the latter colour I have examined a number of specimens sent for exhibition at the Crystal Palace and other cat shows and found in some a very short thin twisted tail in others a mere excrescence and some with an appendage more like a knob These I have taken as having been operated upon when young the tail being removed but this may not be the case as mister saint George Mivart in his very valuable book on the cat mentions a case where a female cat had her tail so injured by the passage of a cart wheel over it that her master judged it best to have it cut off near the base Since then she has had two litters of kittens and in each litter one or more of the kittens had a stump of tail while their brothers and sisters had tails of the usual length But were there no Manx cats in the neighbourhood is a query This case is analogous to the statement that the short tailed sheep dog was produced from parents that had had their tails amputated and yet this is now an established breed Also a small black breed of dogs from the Netherlands which is now very fashionable They are called Chipperkes and have no tails at least when exhibited mister saint George Mivart further states that mister Bartlett told him as he has so stated to myself that in the Isle of Man the cats have tails of different lengths from nothing up to ten inches I have also been informed on good authority that the Fox Terrier dogs which invariably have as a matter of fashion their tails cut short sometimes have puppies with much shorter tails than the original breed but this does not appear to take effect on sheep whose tails are generally cut off I cannot myself come to the same conclusion as to the origin of the Manx cat Be this as it may one thing is certain that cross bred Manx with other cats often have young that are tailless As a proof of this mister Herbert Young of Harrogate has had in his possession a very fine red female long haired tailless cat that was bred between the Manx and a Persian Another case showing the strong prepotency of the Manx cat mister Hodgkin of Eridge some time ago had a female Manx cat sent to him Not only does she produce tailless cats when crossed with the ordinary cat but the progeny again crossed also frequently have some tailless kittens in each litter I have also been told there is a breed of tailless cats in Cornwall mister Darwin states in his book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication vol i p forty seven that throughout an immense area namely the Malayan Archipelago Siam Pequan and Burmah all the cats have truncated tails about half the proper length often with a sort of knob at the end This description tallies somewhat with the appearance of some of the Siamese cats that have been imported several of which though they have fairly long and thin tails and though they are much pointed at the end often have a break or kink In a note mister Darwin says The Madagascar cat is said to have a twisted tail See Desmares in Encyclop Nat Mamm eighteen twenty p two hundred thirty three for some other breeds mister saint George Mivart also corroborates the statement so far as the Malay cat is concerned He says the tail is only half the ordinary length and often contorted into a sort of knot so that it cannot be straightened He further states Its contortion is due to deformity of the bones of the tail and there is a tailless breed of cats in the Crimea Some of the Manx cats I have examined have precisely the kind of tail here described thin very short and twisted that cannot be straightened Is it possible that the Manx cat originated from the Malayan Or rather is it a freak of nature perpetuated by selection Be this as it may we have the Manx cat now as a distinct breed and when crossed with others will almost always produce some entirely tailless kittens if not all Many of the Siamese kittens bred here have kinks in their tails The illustration I give is that of a prize winner at the Crystal Palace in eighteen eighty eighteen eighty one eighteen eighty two and is the property of mister J M Thomas of Parliament Street In colour it is a brindled tortoiseshell It is eight years old At the end of this description I also give a portrait of one of its kittens a tabby both are true Manx and neither have a particle of tail only a very small tuft of hair which is boneless The hind quarters are very square and deep as contrasted with other cats and the flank deeper giving an appearance of great strength the hind legs being longer and thicker in proportion to the fore legs which are much slighter and tapering even the toes are smaller The head is round for a she cat and the ears somewhat large and pointed but thin and fine in the hair the cavity of the ear has less hair within it also a trait of the Siamese than some other short haired cats the neck is long and thin as are the shoulders Its habits are the same as those of most cats I may add that mister Thomas who is an old friend of mine has had this breed many years and kept it perfectly pure Illustration VARIOUS COLOURS Those who have had much to do with breeding and crossing of animals birds or plants well know that with time leisure and patience how comparatively easy it is to improve alter enlarge or diminish any of these or any part of them and looking at the cat from this standpoint now that it is becoming a fancy animal there is no prophesying what forms colours markings or other variations will be made by those who understand what can be done by careful well considered matching and skilful selection We have now cats with no tails short tails and some of moderate length long tails bushy and hairy but should a very long tail be in request I have no doubt whatever but that in a few years it would be produced and now that there is a cat club constituted for the welfare and improvement of the condition as well as the careful breeding of cats curious and unforeseen results are most likely to be attained but whether any will ever excel the many beautiful varieties we now have is a problem that remains to be solved This concludes the numerous varieties of colours and the proper markings of the domestic cat as regards beauty and the points of excellence to be observed for the purposes of exhibition These are distinct and as such nearly all have classes for each individual colour and marking and therefore it is imperative that the owner should note carefully the different properties and beauties of his or her particular specimen and also as carefully read the schedule of prizes with such attention as to be enabled to enter his or her pet in the proper class for it is not only annoying to the exhibitor but to the judge to find an animal sometimes of extraordinary merit placed in the wrong class by sheer inattention to the printed rules and instructions prepared by the committee or promoters of the show It is exceedingly distasteful and I may say almost distressing to a judge to find a splendid animal wrongly entered and so to feel himself compelled to pass it and to affix the words fatal to all chance of winning Wrong class Again let me impress on exhibitors to be careful very careful in this matter this matter of entry for I may say it is one of the reasons which has led to my placing these notes on paper though I have done so with much pleasure and with earnest hope that they will be found of some value and service to the uninitiated Of course there are as there must be a number of beautiful shades of colour tints and markings that are difficult to define or describe colours and markings that are intermediate with those noticed but though in themselves they are extremely interesting and even very beautiful they do not come within the range of the classes for certain definite forms of lines spots or colourings as I have endeavoured to point out and indeed it was almost impossible to make a sufficient number of classes to comprehend the whole Therefore it has been considered wisest and even necessary as the most conducive to the best interests of the exhibitor and also to simplify the difficulties of judging and for the maintenance of the various forms of beauty of the cat to have classes wherein they are shown under rules of colour points of beauty and excellence that are hard and fast and by this means all may not only know how and in what class to exhibit but also what their chance is of taking honours As I have just stated there are intermediate colours markings and forms so extra classes have been provided for these under the heading of any other variety of colour and any other variety not before mentioned and any cats of peculiar structure In this last case the cats that have abnormal formations such as seven toes or even nine on their fore and hind legs peculiar in other ways such as three legs or only two legs as I have seen may be exhibited I regard these however as malformations and not to be encouraged being generally devoid of beauty and lacking interest for the ordinary observer and they also tend to create a morbid taste for the unnatural and ugly instead of the beautiful the beautiful be it what it may is always pleasant to behold and there is but little if any doubt in my mind but that the constant companionship of even a beautiful cat must have a soothing effect Therefore not in cats only but in all things have the finest and best Surround yourself with the elegant the graceful the brilliant the beautiful the agile and the gentle Be it what it may animal bird or flower be careful to have the best A man it is said is made more or less by his environments and doubtless this is to a great extent if not entirely a fact that being so the contemplation of the beautiful must have its quieting restful influences and tend to a brighter and happier state of existence I am fully aware there are many that may differ from me though I feel sure I am not far wrong when I aver there are few animals really more beautiful than a cat If it is a good carefully selected specimen well kept well cared for in high condition in its prime of life well trained graceful in every line bright in colour distinct in markings supple and elegant in form agile and gentle in its ways it is beautiful to look at and must command admiration Yes the contemplation of the beautiful elevates the mind if only in a cat beauty of any kind is beauty and has its refining influences Illustration USEFULNESS OF CATS In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats In our sitting or bedrooms our libraries in our kitchens and storerooms our farms barns and rickyards in our docks our granaries our ships and our wharves in our corn markets meat markets and other places too numerous to mention how useful they are In our ships however the rats oft set them at defiance still they are of great service How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is their home How well Shakespeare in Pericles Act iii describes this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit The cat with eyne of burning coal Now crouches from before the mouse s hole A slight rustle and the fugitive comes forth a quick sharp resolute motion and the cat has proved its usefulness Let any one have a plague of rats and mice as I once had and let them be delivered therefrom by cats as I was and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them A friend not long since informed me that a cat at Stone s Distillery was seen to catch two rats at one time a fore foot on each All the cats kept at this establishment and there are several are of the red tabby colour and therefore most likely all males I am credibly informed of a still more extraordinary feat of a cat in catching mice that of a red tabby cat which on being taken into a granary at Sevenoaks where there were a number of mice dashed in among a retreating group and secured four one with each paw and two in her mouth At the office of The Morning Advertiser I am informed by my old friend mister Charles Williams they boast of a race of cats bred there for nearly half a century In colour these are mostly tortoiseshell and some are very handsome The Government mindful also of their utility pay certain sums which are regularly passed through the accounts quarterly for the purpose of providing and keeping cats in our public offices dockyards stores shipping et cetera thereby proving if proof were wanting their acknowledged worth In Vienna four cats are employed by the town magistrates to catch mice on the premises of the municipality A regular allowance is voted for their keep and after a limited period of active service they are placed on the retired list with a comfortable pension There are also a number of cats in the service of the United States Post Office These cats are distributed over the different offices to protect the bags from being eaten by rats and mice and the cost of providing for them is duly inscribed in the accounts When a birth takes place the local postmaster informs the district superintendent of the fact and obtains an addition to his rations A short time ago the budget of the Imperial Printing Office in France amongst other items contained one for cats which caused some merriment in the legislative chamber during its discussion According to the Pays these cats are kept for the purpose of destroying the numerous rats and mice which infest the premises and cause considerable damage to the large stock of paper which is always stored there This feline staff is fed twice a day and a man is employed to look after them so that for cats meat and the keeper s salary no little expense is annually incurred sufficient in fact to form a special item in the national expenditure mister W M Acworth in his excellent book The Railways of England gives a very interesting account of the usefulness of the cat He says writing of the Midland Railway A few miles further off however at Trent is a still more remarkable portion of the company s staff eight cats who are borne on the strength of the establishment and for whom a sufficient allowance of milk and cats meat is provided And when we say that the cats have under their charge according to the season of the year from one to three or four hundred thousand empty corn sacks it will be admitted that the company cannot have many servants who better earn their wages The holes in the sacks which are eaten by the rats which are not killed by the cats are darned by twelve women who are employed by the company Few people know or wish to know what a boon to mankind is The Domestic Cat Liked or disliked there is the cat in some cases unthought of or uncared for but simply kept on account of the devastation that would otherwise take place were rats and mice allowed to have undivided possession An uncle of mine had some hams sent from Yorkshire during the transit by rail the whole of the interior of one of the largest was consumed by rats More cats at the stations would possibly have prevented such irritating damage And further it is almost incredible and likewise almost unknown the great benefit the cat is to the farmer All day they sleep in the barns stables or outhouses among the hay or straw At eve they are seen about the rick yard the corn stack the cow and bullock yards the stables the gardens and the newly sown or mown fields in quest of their natural prey the rat and mouse In the fields the mice eat and carry off the newly sown peas or corn so in the garden or the ripened garnered corn in stacks but when the cat is on guard much of this is prevented Rats eat corn and carry off more kill whole broods of ducklings and chickens in a night undermine buildings stop drains and unwittingly do much other injury to the well being of the farmers and others What a ruinous thing it would be and what a dreadfully horrible thing it is to be overrun with rats to say nothing of mice In this matter man s best friend is the cat Silent careful cautious and sure it is at work while the owner sleeps with an industry a will and purpose that never rests nor tires from dewy eve till rosy morn when it will glide through the cat hole into the barn for repose among the straw and when night comes forth again its usefulness scarcely imagined much less known and appreciated They who remember old Fleet Prison in Farringdon Street will scarcely believe that the debtors there confined were at times so neglected as to be absolutely starving so much so that a mister Morgan a surgeon of Liverpool being put into that prison was ultimately reduced so low by poverty neglect and hunger as to catch mice by the means of a cat for his sustenance This is stated to be the fact in a book written by Moses Pitt The Cries of the Oppressed sixteen ninety one Illustration GENERAL MANAGEMENT FEEDING Adult cats require less food in proportion than kittens for two reasons One is this a kitten is growing and therefore extra bone flesh skin hair and all else has to be provided for while in the adults these are more or less acquired and also they procure for themselves in various ways in country or suburban localities much live and other food and no animal is the better for over or excessive feeding especially if confined or its chances of exercise contracted I have tried many ways or methods of feeding biscuits of sorts liver lights horseflesh bread and milk rice fish and cat mixtures but have always attained the best results by giving new milk as drink and raw shin of beef for food with grass boiled asparagus stems cabbage lettuce or some other vegetable either cooked or fresh Good horseflesh is much liked by the cat and it thrives well on it I do not believe in either liver or lights as a flesh or bone maker Besides the beef there are the tit bits that the household cat not only usually receives but looks for or expects My dear friend mister John Timbs in Things not Generally Known avers that cats are not so fond of fish as flesh and that the statement that they are is a fallacy He says put both before them and they will take the flesh first and this I have found to be correct I should only give fresh fish as a rule to a cat when unwell more as an alternative than food As raw meat or other raw food is natural to the cat it is far the best with vegetables for keeping the body coat and skin in good condition and health and the securing of a rich bright high colour and quality On no account try to improve these by either medicinal liquids pills or condiments nothing can be much worse as reflection will prove If the cat is healthy it is at its best and will keep so by proper food if unwell then use such medicines as the disease or complaint it suffers from requires and not otherwise Many horses and other animals have their constitutions entirely ruined by what are called coat tonics which are useless and only believed in and practised by the thoughtless gullible and foolish Does any one or will any one take pills powders or liquids for promoting the colour or texture of their hair would any one be so silly And yet we are coolly told to give such things to our animals Granted that in illness medicine is of much service in health it is harmful and tends to promote disease where none exists SLEEPING PLACES I much prefer a round basket filled with oat straw to anything else some urge that a box is better my cats have a basket It is well to sprinkle the straw occasionally with Keating s Powder or flour of sulphur which is a preventive of insect annoyances and Prevention is better than cure Never shut cats up in close cupboards for the night there being little or no ventilation it is most injurious pure air being as essential to a cat as to a human being Always have a box with dry earth near the cat s sleeping place unless there is an opening for egress near Do not as a rule put either collar or ribbon on your cat though they may thereby be improved in appearance they are too apt to get entangled or caught by the collar and often strangulation ensues besides which in long haired cats it spoils their mane or frill Of course at shows it is allowable All cats as well as other animals should have ready access to a pan of clear water which should be changed every day and the pan cleaned Fresh air sunlight and warm sunshine are good both for cats and their owners It is related of Charles James Fox that walking up saint James s Street from one of the club houses with the Prince of Wales he laid a wager that he would see more cats than the Prince in his walk and that he might take which side of the street he liked When they reached the top it was found that mister Fox had seen thirteen cats and the Prince not one The Royal personage asked for an explanation of this apparent miracle mister Fox said Your Royal Highness took of course the shady side of the way as most agreeable I knew the sunny side would be left for me and cats always prefer the sunshine A most essential requisite for the health of the cat is cleanliness In itself the animal is particularly so as may be observed by its constant habit of washing or cleaning its fur many times a day therefore a clean basket clean straw or clean flannel to lie on in fact everything clean is not only necessary but is a necessity for its absolute comfort mister Timbs says It is equally erroneous that she is subject to fleas the small insect which infests the half grown kitten being a totally different animal exceedingly swift in running but not salient or leaping like a flea In this mister Timbs slightly errs Cats do have fleas but not often and of a different kind to the ordinary flea but I have certainly seen them jump In dressing the coat of the cat no comb should be used more especially with the long haired varieties but if so which I do not recommend great care should be used not to drag the hair so that it comes out or breaks otherwise a rough uneven coat will and must be the result Should the hair become clotted matted or felted as is sometimes the case it ought to be moistened either with oil or soft soap a little water being added and when the application has well soaked in it will be found comparatively easy to separate the tangle with the fingers by gently pulling out from the mass a few hairs at a time after which wash thoroughly and use a soft long haired brush but this must be done with discretion so as not to spoil the natural waviness of the hair or to make it lie in breadths instead of the natural easy carelessly parted flaky appearance which shows the white or blue cat off to such advantage WASHING Most cats have a dislike to water and as a rule and under ordinary conditions generally keep themselves clean more especially the short haired breeds but as is well known the Angora Persian and Russian if not taken care of are sure to require washing the more so to prepare them for exhibition as there is much gain in the condition in which a cat comes before the judge There are many cases of cats taking to the water and swimming to certain points to catch fish or for other food on record yet it is seldom that they take a pleasure in playing about in it I therefore think it well to mention that I had a half bred black and white Russian that would frequently jump into the bath while it was being filled and sit there until the water rose too high for its safety Thus cats may be taught to like washing If a cat is to be washed treat it as kindly and gently as is possible speaking in a soothing tone and in no way be hasty or sudden in your movements so as to raise distrust or fear Let the water be warm but not hot put the cat in slowly and when its feet rest on the bottom of the tub you may commence the washing mister A A Clarke the well known cat fancier says I seldom wash my cats I rather prefer giving them a good clean straw bed and attending to their general health and condition and they will then very seldom require washing I find that much washing makes the coat harsh and poor and I also know from experience that it is a work of art to wash a cat properly and requires an artist in that way to do it My plan is to prepare some liquid soap by cutting a piece into shreds and putting it into cold water and then boiling it for an hour I then have two clean tubs got ready one to wash the other to rinse in Have soft water about blood heat with a very small piece of soda in the washing tub into which I place the cat hind quarters first having some one that it knows perfectly well to hold and talk to the cat while the washing is going on I begin with the tail and thoroughly rubbing in the soap with my hands and getting by degrees over the body and shoulders up to the ears leaving the head until the cat is rinsed in the other tub which ought to be half filled with warm soft water into which I place the cat and thoroughly rinse out all the soap when at the same time I wash the head and I then sit in front of the fire and dry with warm towels and if it is done well and thoroughly it is a good three hours hard work I would add to the foregoing that I should use Naldire s dog soap which I have found excellent in all ways and it also destroys any insect life that may be present Also in washing be careful not to move the hands in circles or the hair will become entangled and knotty and very difficult to untwist or unravel Take the hair in the hands and press the softened soap through and through the interstices and when rinsing do the same with the water using a large sponge for the purpose After drying I should put the cat in a box lightly full of oat straw and place it in front of or near a fire at such distance as not to become too warm and only near enough to prevent a chill before the cat is thoroughly dry MATING Yet nature is made better by no mean But nature makes that mean so o er that art Which you say adds to nature is an art That nature makes Coriolanus Act II Scene I This requires much and careful consideration and in this as well as in many other things experience and theory join hands while the knowledge of the naturalist and fancier is of great and superlative value yet with all combined anything like certainty can never be assured although the possession of pedigree is added and the different properties of food health quality and breed understood and taken into account Still much may be gained by continued observation and close study of the peculiar properties of colour besides that of form If for instance a really absolutely blue cat without a shade of any other colour were obtainable and likewise a pure clear canary yellow there is little doubt that at a distant period a green would be the ultimate goal of success But the yellow tabby is not a yellow nor the blue a blue There being then only a certain variety of colours in cats the tints to be gained are limited entirely to a certain set of such colours and the numerous shades and half shades of these mixed broken or not into tints markings light or dark as desired To all colour arrangements if I may so call them by the mind intellect or hand of man there is a limit beyond which none can go It is thus far and no further There is the black cat and the white and between these are intervening shades from very light or white gray to darker blue dark blue blackish blue gray and black If a blue black is used the lighter colours are of one tint if a brown black they are another Then in what are termed the sandies and browns it commences with the yellow white tint scarcely visible apart from white to the uninitiated eye then darker and darker until it culminates in deep brown with the intervening yellows reds chestnuts mahoganys and such colours which generally are striped with a darker colour of nearly their own shade until growing denser it ends in brown black The gray tabby has a ground colour of gray In this there are the various shades from little or no markings leaving the colour a brown or gray or the gray gradually disappearing before the advance of the black in broader and broader bands until the first is excluded and black is the result The tortoiseshell is a mixture of colours in patches and is certainly an exhibition of what may be done by careful selection mating and crossing of an animal while under the control of man in a state of thorough domestication What the almond tumbler is to the pigeon fancier so is the tortoiseshell cat to the cat fancier or the bizarre tulip to the florist As regards colour it is a triumph of art over nature by the means of skilful careful mating continued with unwearying patience We get the same combination of colour in the guinea pig both male and female and therefore this is in part a proof that by proper mating eventually a tortoiseshell male cat should soon be by no means a rarity There are rules which if strictly followed under favourable conditions ought to produce certain properties such properties that may be desired either by foolish which generally it is fashion or the production of absolute beauty of form markings in colours or other brilliant effects and which the true fanciers endeavour to obtain It is to this latter I shall address my remarks rather than to the reproduction of the curious the inelegant or the deformed such as an undesirable number of toes which are impediments to utility In the first place the fancier must thoroughly make up his mind as to the variety of form colour association of colours or markings by which he wishes to produce if possible perfection and having done so he must provide himself with such stock as on being mated are likely to bring such progeny as will enable him in due time to attain the end he has in view This being gained he must also prepare himself for many disappointments which are the more likely to accrue from the reason that in all probability he starts without any knowledge of the ancestry or pedigree of the animals with which he begins his operations Therefore for this reason he has to gain his knowledge of any aptitude for divergence from the ordinary or the common they may exhibit or which his practical experience discovers and thus as it were build up a family with certain points and qualities before he can actually embark in the real business of accurately matching and crossing so as to produce the results which by a will undeviating perseverance and patience he is hoping to gain eventually the perfection he so long ardently and anxiously seeks to acquire but he must bear in mind that that on which he sets his mark though high must come within the limits and compass of that which is attainable for it is not the slightest use to attempt that which is not within the charmed circle of possibilities TORTOISESHELLS I place these first on the list because being an old pigeon fancier and somewhat of a florist I deem these to be the breed wherein there is the most art and skill required to produce properly all the varied mottled beauty of bright colours that a cat of this breed should possess and those who have bred tortoiseshells well know how difficult a task it is In breeding for this splendid gorgeous and diversified arrangement of colouring a black or even a blue may be used with a yellow or red tabby female or a white male supposing either or both were the offspring of a tortoiseshell mother The same males might be used with advantage with a tortoiseshell female This is on the theory of whole colours and patches or portions of whole colours without bars or markings when possible In the same way some of the best almond tumbler pigeons are bred from an almond cock mated to a yellow hen The difficulty here until lately has been to breed hens of the varied mottling on almond colour the hen almost invariably coming nearly if not quite yellow so much so that forty to fifty years ago a yellow hen was considered as a pair to an almond cock in the same way as the red tabby male is now regarded in respect to the tortoiseshell female and it was not until at Birmingham many years ago when acting as judge I refused to award prizes to them as such that the effort was made and a successful one to breed almond coloured hens with the same plumage as the cock that is the three colours With cats the matter is entirely different it being the male at present that is the difficulty if a real difficulty it may be called mister Herbert Young a most excellent cat fancier and authority on the subject is of opinion that if a tortoiseshell male cat could be found it would not prove fertile with a tortoiseshell female But of this I am very doubtful because if the red and the yellow tabby is so which is decidedly a weaker colour I do not see how it can possess more vitality than a cat marked with the three colours in fact the latter ought in reality to be more prolific having black as one of the colours which is a strong colour blue being only the weak substitute or with white combined A whole black is one of the strongest colours and most powerful of cats Reverting once again to the pigeon fancier by way of analogy take as an instance what is termed the silver coloured pigeon or the yellow These two and duns are by loss of certain pigments differently coloured and constituted like the tortoiseshell among cats from other varieties of pigeons of harder colours such as blues and blacks or even reds For a long time silver turbit cock pigeons were so scarce that until I bred some myself I had never seen such a thing yet hens were common enough and got from silver and blues In the nestling before the feathers come the young of these colours are without down and are thus thought to be and doubtless are a weakly breed yet there is no absolute diminution of strength beyond that of colour when silver is matched to silver but dun with dun these last go lower in the scale losing the black tint and not unfrequently the colour is yellow or matched with black breed true blacks I am therefore of opinion that a tortoiseshell male and female would and should produce the best of tortoiseshells both male and female It not unfrequently happens that from a tortoiseshell mother in the litter of kittens there are male blacks and clear whites and I have known of one case when a good blue and one where the mixed colours were blue light red and light yellow were produced while the sisters in the litter were of the usual pure tortoiseshell markings In such cases generally the latter only are kept unless it is the blue the others being too often destroyed My own plan would be to breed from such black or white males and if not successful in the first attempt to breed again in the same way with the young obtained with such cross and I have but little doubt that by so doing the result so long sought after would be achieved At least I deem it far more likely to be so than the present plan of using the red tabby as the male which are easily produced though very few are of high excellence in richness of ground tints TORTOISESHELL AND WHITE If tortoiseshell and white are desired then a black and white male may be selected being bred in the same way as those recommended for the pure tortoiseshell or one without white if the female has white but on no account should an ordinary tabby be tolerated but a red tabby female of deep colour or having white may be held in request though I would prefer patches of colour not in any way barred The gray tabby will throw barred spotted or banded kittens mixed with tortoiseshell which is the very worst form of mottling and is very difficult to eradicate A gray ticking will most likely appear between the dark colour as it does between the black bars of the tabby BLACK The best black undoubtedly are those bred from tortoiseshell mothers or females The black is generally more dense and less liable to show any signs of spots bands or bars when the animal is in the sun or a bright light when this is so it is fatal to a black as regards its chance of a prize or even notice and it comes under the denomination of a black tabby If a black and a white cat are mated let the black be the male blacks having more stamina the issue will probably be either white or black and also when you wish the black to be perpetuated the black male must be younger In eighteen eighty four a black female cat was exhibited with five white kittens I have just seen a beautiful black Persian whose mother was a clear white this and the foregoing example prove either colour represents the same for the purpose of breeding to colour For breeding black with white take care that the white is the gray white and not the yellow white the first generally has orange or yellow eyes and this is one of the required qualities in the black cat If a yellow white with blue eyes this type of eye would be detrimental and most likely the eyes of the offspring would have a green stain or possibly be of odd colours It should be borne in mind that black kittens are seldom or ever so rich in colour when newly born as they afterwards become therefore if without spots or bars and of a deep self brown black they will in all possibility be fine in colour when they gain their adult coat This the experienced fancier well knows though the tyro often destroys that which will ultimately prove of value simply from ignorance An instance of the brown black kitten is before me as I write in a beautiful Persian which is now changing from the dull kitten self brown black on to a brilliant glossy jetty beauty BLUES Blue in cats is one of the most extraordinary colours of any for the reason that it is the mixture of black which is no colour and white which is no colour and this is the more curious because black mated with white generally produces either one colour or the other or breaks black and white or white and black The blue being as it were a weakened black or a withdrawal by white of some if not all of the brown or red varying in tint according to the colour of the black from which it was bred dark gray or from weakness in the stamina of the litter In the human species an alliance of the Negro or African race and the European produces the mulatto and some other shades of coloured skin though the hair generally retains the black hue but seldom or ever are the colours broken up as in animal life the only instance that has come to my knowledge and I believe on record being that of the spotted Negro boy exhibited at fairs in England by Richardson the famous showman but in this case both the parents were black and natives of South Africa The boy arrived in England in September eighteen oh nine and died February eighteen thirteen His skin and hair were everywhere parti coloured transparent brown and white on the crown of his head several triangles one within the other were formed by alternations of the colour of the hair In other domestic animals blue colour is not uncommon Blue tinted dogs rabbits horses of a blue gray or spotted with blue on a pink flesh colour as in the naked horse shown at the Crystal Palace some years ago also pigs and all these have likewise broken colours of blue or black and white I do not remember having seen any blue cattle nor any blue guinea pigs but no doubt these latter will soon exist When once the colour or break from the black is acquired it is then easy to go on multiplying the different shades and varieties of tint and tone from the dark blue black to the very light almost white gray In some places in Russia I am told blue cats are exceedingly common I have seen several shown under the names of Archangel and others as Chartreuse and Maltese cats Persians are imported sometimes of this colour both dark and light Next kin to it is the very light gray tabby with almost the same hue if not quite so light gray markings Two such mated have been known to produce very light self grays and of a lovely hue a sort of morning gray these matched with black should breed blues Old male black and young female white cats have been known to produce kittens this colour There is a colony of farm cats at Rodmell Sussex from which very fine blues are bred Light silver tabby males and white females are also apt to have one or so in a litter of kittens but these generally are not such good blues the colour being a gray white or nearly so should the hair or coat be parted or divided the skin being light The very dark if from brown black are not so blue but come under the denomination of smokies or blue smokies with scarcely a tint of blue in them some smokies are white or nearly so with dark tips to the hair these more often occur among Persian than English cats though I once had a smoky tabby bred from a black and a silver tabby Importations of some of the former are often extremely light scarcely showing any markings These and such as these are very valuable where a self blue is desired If these light colours are females a smoke coloured male is an excellent cross as it already shows a weakened colour For a very light tender delicate light gray long haired self I should try a white male and either a rich blue or a soft gray extremely lightly marked tabby As a rule all broken whites such as black and white should be avoided because as I explained at the commencement of these notes on blues the blue is black and white amalgamated or the brown withdrawn from the colouring or if not with the colours breaking or becoming black and white If whole coloured blues are in request then parti colours such as white and black or black and white are best excluded Blue and white are easily attainable by mating a blue male with a white and black female The best and deepest coloured of the blue short haired cats are from Archangel Those I have seen were very fine in colour the pelage being the same colour to the skin which was also dark and of a uniform lilac tinted blue Some come by chance I knew of a blue English cat winner of several prizes whose parents were a black and white male mated with a light gray tabby and white but this was an exception to the rule for strongly marked tabbies are not a good cross BROWN TABBY For the purpose of breeding rich brown black striped tabbies a male of a rich dark rufous or red tabby should be selected the bands being regular and not too broad the lighter or ground colour showing well between the lines if the black lines are very broad it is then a black striped with brown instead of a brown with black which is wrong With this match a female of a good brown ground colour marked with dense not broad black bands having clear sharply defined edges Note also that the centre line of the back is a distinct line with the brown ground colour on which it is placed being in no way interspersed with black and at least as broad as the black line by this cross finely marked kittens of a brilliant colour may be expected But if the progeny are not so bright as required and the ground colour not glowing enough then when the young arrive at maturity mate with a dark yellow red tabby either male or female Very beautiful brown tabbies are also to be found among the litters of the female tortoiseshell allied with a dark brown tabby with narrow black bars It is a cross that may be tried with advantage for both variety and richness of colour among which it will not be found difficult to find something worthy of notice WHITE Of English or short haired cats the best white are those from a tortoiseshell mother and as often some of the best blacks These whites are generally of soft yellow or sandy tint of white Although they have pink noses as also are the cushions of their feet they are not Albinos not having the peculiar pink or red eyes nor are they deficient in sight I have seen and examined with much care some hundreds of white cats but have never yet seen one with pink eyes though it has been asserted that such exist and there is no reason why they should not Still I am inclined to think they do not and the pale blue eyes or the red tinted blue like those of the Siamese take the place of it in the feline race neither have I ever seen a white horse with pink eyes but I find it mentioned in one of the daily papers that among other presents to the Emperor of Russia the Bokhara Embassy took with them ten thoroughbred saddle horses of different breeds one of them being a magnificent animal a pure white stallion with blue eyes The cold gray white is the opposite of the black and this knowledge should not be lost sight of in mating It generally has yellow or light orange eyes This colour in a male may be crossed with the yellow white with advantage when more strength of constitution is required but otherwise I deem the best matching is that of two yellow white both with blue eyes for soft hair elegance and beauty but even a black male and a white female produce whites and sometimes blacks but the former are generally of a coarse description and harsh in coat by comparison I think the blue eyed white are a distinct breed from the common ordinary white cat nor do I remember any such being bred from those with eyes of yellow colour ABYSSINIAN To breed these true it is well to procure imported or pedigree stock for many cats are bred in England from ordinary tabbies that so nearly resemble Abyssinian in colour as scarcely to be distinguished from the much prized foreigners The males are generally of a darker colour than the females and are mostly marked with dark brown bands on the forehead a black band along the back which ends at the tip of the tail with which it is annulated The ticking should be of the truest kind each hair being of three distinct colours blue yellow or red and black at the points the cushions of the feet black and back of the hind legs Choose a female with either more red or yellow the markings being the same and with care in the selection there will be some very brilliant specimens Eyes bright orange yellow ABYSSINIAN CROSSES Curiously coloured as the Abyssinian cat is and being a true breed no doubt of long far back ancestry it is most useful in crossing with other varieties even with the Persian Russian Angora or the Archangel the ticking hues being easy of transmission and is then capable of charming and delightful tints with breadths of beautiful mottled or grizzled colouring if judiciously mated The light tabby Persian matched with a female Abyssinian would give unexpected surprises so with the dark blue Archangel a well ticked blue would not only be a novelty but an elegant colour hitherto unseen A deep red tabby might result in a whole colour bright red or a yellow tint I have seen a cat nearly black ticked with white which had yellow eyes It was truly a splendid and very beautiful animal of a most recherche colour Matched with a silver gray tabby a silver gray tick is generally the sequence A yellow white will possibly prove excellent Try it WHITE AND BLACK For white and black choose evenly marked animals in which white predominates I have seen three differently bred cats white with black ears and tails all else being white and been informed of others I failed to notice the colour of the eyes which came under my own observation for which I am sorry for much depends on the colour of the eyes in selection for though the parents are white and black many gray and white tabby and white even yellow and white will appear among the kittens gray being the original colour and black the sport BLACK AND WHITE A deep brown dense black ground with a blaze up the face white nose and lips should be chosen white chest and white feet Get a female as nearly as possible so marked and being a dense blue black both with orange eyes when satisfactorily marked and sable and white kittens may be expected BLUE TABBY A slate colour or a blue male cat mated with a strongly black marked though narrow banded blue or gray tabby is the best for dark blue tabbies or a light gray evenly marked female may be used What a lovely thing a white cat marked with black stripes would be It may be got SPOTTED TABBY For spotted tabby the best brown are those got by mating a spotted red tabby the darker the better and a brown and black spotted female These should be carefully selected not only for their ground colour but also for the roundness distinctness blackness and arrangements of their spots For grays blues and light ash coloured tabbies the same care should be exercised the only difference being the choice of ground colours FANCY COLOURS By other odd and fanciful combinations many beautiful mottles and stripes may be secured and strange quaint harmonious arrangements of lines and spots produced according to fancy s dictates but the foregoing are the chief colours in request for exhibition purposes and most of the colour marking In any other colour classes the beauties whatever they may be are chiefly the result of accident or sports selected for such beauty or in other ways equally interesting Illustration Illustration CAT AND KITTENS Care and attention is necessary when the cat is likely to become a mother A basket or box half filled with sweet hay or clean oat straw with some flannel in the winter is absolutely requisite and a quiet nook or corner selected away from light noise and intrusion Some prefer a box made like a rabbit hutch with sleeping place and a barred door to one or both compartments which may be closed when thought necessary for comfort and quiet The cat should be placed within with food and new milk by or inside and there be regularly fed for a few days all pans and plates to be kept well washed and only as much food given at a time as can be eaten at one meal so that everything is clean and fresh Cats as I have before stated delight in cleanliness therefore this nor any comfort should not be forgotten or omitted for so much depends on her health and the growth of her little family with regard to their future well being The cat brings forth three times a year and often more The time of gestation is to sixty three days and the number of the kittens varies much Some will have five to six at a birth while others never have more than two or three I had a blue tabby The Old Lady which never had more than one The cat however is a very prolific animal and if of long life produces a very numerous progeny The Derby Gazette December tenth eighteen eighty six states There is a cat at Cromford the age of which is nineteen years It belonged to the late mister Isaac Orme who died a few months ago The old man made an entry of all the kittens the cat had given birth to which up to the time of his death numbered one hundred twenty It has now just given birth to one more It will not leave the house where the old man died except to visit a neighbouring house where there is a harmonium and when the instrument is being played the cat will go and stand on its hind legs beside the player Cats live to various ages the oldest I have seen being twenty one years and the foregoing is the greatest age at which I have known one to breed But I am indebted to missus Paterson of Tunbridge Wells for the information that mister Sandal had a cat that lived to the extraordinary age of twenty four years I have seen mister Sandal and found that such was the case It was a short haired cat and rather above the usual size and tabby in colour When littered the kittens are weak blind deaf helpless little things and it appears almost impossible they can ever attain the supple grace and elegance of form and motion so much admired in the fully developed cat The state of visual darkness continues until the eighth or ninth day during which the eyesight is gradually developing After this they grow rapidly and at the age of a few weeks the gamboling frolicsome life of kittenhood begins and they begin to feed lap milk if slightly warm when placed in front of them No animal is more fond and attentive than the cat she is the most tender and gentle of nurses watching closely every movement of her young With the utmost solicitude she brings the choicest morsels of her own food which she lays before them softly purring while with gentle and motherly ways she attracts them to the spot while she sits or stands looking on with evident satisfaction full of almost uncontrollable pleasure and delight at their eager but often futile attempts and endeavours to eat and enjoy the dainty morsel Yet nothing is wasted for after waiting what appears to her a reasonable time and giving them every encouragement and with the most exemplary patience she teaches them what they should do and how by slowly making a meal of the residue herself frequently stopping and fondling and licking them in the hope they will yet make another effort What can be more sensitively touching than the following anecdote sent to The Animal World by C E N in eighteen seventy six It is a little poem of everyday life full of deep feeling and feline love I have a small tabby cat very comely and graceful Being very fond of her kitten she is always uneasy if she loses sight of it if only for a short time For the last six weeks the mother failing to recall the truant back by her voice even returns to the kitchen for the lower portion of a rabbit s fore leg which has served as a plaything for some time With this in her mouth she proceeds to search for her lost one crying all the time and putting it down at her feet repeats her entreaties to which the kitten allured by the sight of its plaything generally responds Owing to its gambols in the open air during the inclement weather the kitten was seized with an affliction of the throat the mother puzzled with the prostration of its offspring brought down the rabbit s foot to attract attention In vain the kitten died Even now the loving mother searches for the rabbit s foot and brings it down An instance of the peculiar foresight and instinct so often observable in the cat is related in The Animal World October eighteen eighty two Miss M writes This house is very old and big impudent rats often appear in the shop so a cat is always kept on the premises Pussy is about five years old and is a handsome light tortoiseshell with a pretty face and coaxing ways A month ago she had three kittens one of which was kept they were born in the drawing room by the side of the piano When the two were taken away pussy carried the one remaining to the fireplace and made it a bed under the grate with shavings When a fortnight old both were removed downstairs to the room behind the shop One day last week an enormous rat appeared pussy spied him and set up her back but her motherly instinct prevailed She looked round the shop and finding a drawer high up a little way open she jumped with her kitten in her mouth and dropped it into the drawer after which she descended and fought a battle royal with the rat which she soon despatched and carried to her mistress then went back to the drawer and brought out her kitten Here is another fact as regards the observation of cats which possibly in this respect is not far different from some other domestic animals A gray and white cat Jenny a house cat had three kittens in the hollow stump of an old ash tree some distance from the house There from time to time she took them food and there nursed them One day looking from the window I observed a very heavy storm was approaching and also what should I see but Mistress Jenny running across the meadow as fast as she could and on her drawing nearer I noticed that she had one of her kittens in her mouth She ran past and put the kitten into a small outhouse when she immediately hastened back and returned bringing another of her kittens which she put in the same place Again she started for the wood and shortly reappeared bringing her third and last kitten though more slowly seemingly very tired I was just thinking of going to help her when she suddenly quickened her pace and ran for the outhouse just then a few drops of rain began to fall In a few moments a deluge of water was falling the lightning was flashing the thunder crashed overhead and rumbled in the distance but Jenny did not mind for she had her three kittens comfortably housed and she and they were all nestled together in an apple basket warm and dry Surely she must have known by instinct or observation that the storm was coming From my Book of Animal Stories Old and New Should it be deemed necessary to destroy some if not all of the litter which unfortunately is sometimes the case it is not well to take away the whole at once but it is advisable to let a day or two intervene between each removal the mother will thus be relieved of much suffering especially if one at least is left for her to rear but two is preferable Still when the progeny are well marked or otherwise valuable and large specimens are required for show or other purposes three kittens are enough to leave though some advocate as many as five but if this is done it is better to provide a foster mother for two for which even a dog will often prove a very good substitute for one of the feline race In either case slightly warm new milk should be given at least three times a day the milk should not be heated but some hot water put to it and as soon as their teeth are sufficiently grown for them to be of use in mastication give some raw beef cut very small and fine Some prefer chopped liver I do not but never give more than they can lap or eat at each meal This liberal treatment will make a wonderful difference in their growth and also their general health and strength and being so fed makes them more docile And it should be borne in mind that in a state of nature cats always bring raw food to their young as soon as they are able to eat therefore raw meat is far the best to give them their dentition proves this Illustration KITTENS Kittenhood the baby time especially of country cats is with most the brightest sprightliest and prettiest period of their existence and perhaps the most happy True when first born and in the earliest era of their lives they are blind helpless little things dull weak and staggering scarcely able to stand if at all almost rolling over at every attempt making querulous fretful noises if wakeful or cold or for the time motherless But tis not for long awhile and she the fondest of mothers is with them They are nestled about her or amid her soft warm fluffy fur cossetted with parental tenderness caressed nurtured and with low sweet tones and fondlings they are soothed again and again to sleep They sleep Noiseless and with many a longing lingering look the careful watchful loving creature slowly and reluctantly steals away soon to return when she and her little ones are lost in the land of dreams And so from day to day until bright meek eyed innocent inquiring little faces with eager eyes peep above the basket that is yet their home One bolder than the others springs out when scared at its own audacity as quickly and oft clumsily scrambles back then out in and out in happy varied wild frolicsome gambolsome play they clutch twist turn and wrestle in artless mimicry of desperate quarrelling the struggle over in liveliest antics they chase and rechase in turn or in fantastic mood play tis but play and such wondrous play bright joyous and light and so life glides on with them as kittens frisky skittish playful kittens A few more days and their mother leads them forth with many an anxious look and turn softly calling in a subdued voice they halting almost at every step suddenly oft at nothing panic stricken quickly scamper back not one yet daring to follow where all is so oddly strange and new their natural shyness being stronger than the love of freedom Again with scared look and timid steps they come when again at nothing frightened or with infantile pretence they are off helter skelter without a pause or stay one and all they o er and into their basket clamber tumble in turn about and stare with a more than half bewildered self satisfied safety look about them Gaining courage once more they peer about with dreamy startled anxious eyes watching for dangers that never are although expected Noiseless comes their patient loving mother with what new delight they cling about her how fondly and tenderly she tends them lures cossets coaxes and talks as only a gentle mother cat can There is no danger no nothing to fear Is she not with them will she not guard keep and defend them There is a paradise out there through this door they must see it Come she will show them come have confidence Now then come When followed by her three little ones and they with much misgiving she passes out out into the garden out among the lovely blooming fragrant roses out among the sweet stocks and the damask coloured gilly flowers the pink daisies brown red and orange wallflowers the spice scented pinks and other gay and modest floral beauties that make so sweet the soft and balmy breath of Spring Out into the sunshine almost dazed amid a flood of light warmed by the glowing midday sun Light above light around and everywhere about while the sweet scented breezes come joy laden with the happy wild birds melodious songs wearied with wonderment under the flower crowned lilacs they gather themselves to rest How beautiful all is how full of young delights the odorous wind fans soothes and lulls them to rest while rustling leaves softly whisper them to sleep they and their loving mother slumber unconscious of all things and with all things at peace There stretched in the warm sunshine asleep possibly dreaming of their after life when they are kittens no longer they rest and sleep Their young bright life has begun how charming all is how peaceful under the young green leaves bright as emeralds about them flickering chequering lights play with the never wearying restless shadows they know of nothing but bliss so happy they enjoy all sweet faced gentle eyed and pretty Happy there is no other word Happy as a kitten Sprightly as a kitten As they sleep they dream of delight awake they more than realise their dreams Illustration OF KITTENS IN GENERAL Kittens usually shed their first teeth from five to seven months old and seldom possess even part of a set of the small sharp dentition after that time When shown as kittens under six months old and they have changed the whole of their kittenhood teeth for those of the adult it is generally considered a fairly strong proof that their life is in excess of that age and the judge is therefore certainly justified in disqualifying such exhibit though sometimes as in other domestic animals there occurs premature change as well as inexplicable delay Kittens are not so cleanly in their habits as cats of a mature growth this is more generally the case when they have been separated from the mother cat or when removed to some place that is strange to them or when sufficient care is not taken by letting them out of the house occasionally When they cannot from various reasons be so turned out a box should be provided partly filled with dry earth to which they may retire This is always a requisite when cats or kittens are valuable and therefore obliged to be kept within doors especially in neighbourhoods where there is a chance of their being lost or stolen It should also be borne in mind that the present and future health of an animal be it what it may is subject to many incidences and not the least of these is good and appropriate food shelter warmth and cleanliness It is best to feed at regular intervals In confinement mister Bartlett the skilful and experienced manager of the Zoological Society s Gardens at Regent s Park finds that one meal a day is sufficient and this is thought also to be the case with a full grown cat more especially when it has the opportunity of ranging and getting other food such as mice and such small deer but with young things it is different as it is deemed necessary to get as much strength and growth as possible I therefore advocate several meals a day at least three with a variety of food such as raw shin of beef cut very small bones to pick fish of sorts with all the bones taken out or refuse parts milk with a little hot water boiled rice or oatmeal with milk or without it and grass if possible if not some boiled vegetables stalks of asparagus cabbage or even carrots Let the food be varied from time to time but never omitting the finely cut raw beef every day I am not in favour of liver or lights as it is called either for cats or kittens If horseflesh can be depended on it is a very favourite and strengthening food and may be given The kitten should be kept warm and dry and away from draughts Also take especial care not in any way to frighten tease or worry a young animal but do everything possible to give confidence and engender regard fondness or affection for its owner always be gentle and yet firm in its training Do not allow it to do one day uncorrected that for which it is punished the next for the same kind of fault If it is doing wrong remove it speaking gently at the time and not wait long after the fault is committed or they will not know what the punishment is for Many animals tempers are spoiled entirely by this mode of proceeding Take care there is always a clean vessel with pure clear water for them to drink when thirsty Illustration MISS MOORE S KITTEN CHLOE MANAGEMENT OF KITTENS AND CATS These require quiet and kindly treatment Do nothing quickly or suddenly so as in any way to scare or frighten but when speaking to them let the voice be moderated gentle and soft in tone Cats are not slow to understand kind treatment and may often be seen to watch the countenance as though trying to fathom our thoughts Some cats are of a very timorous nature and are thus easily dismayed Others again are more bold in their ways and habits and are ever ready for cossetty attention but treat both as you would be treated kindly As to food as already noted I have found raw beef the best with milk mixed with a little hot water to drink never boil it and give plenty of grass or some boiled vegetable such as asparagus sea kale or celery they also are fond of certain weeds such as cat mint and equisetum or mares or cats tails as it is sometimes called If fish is given it is best mixed with either rice or oatmeal and boiled otherwise it is apt to produce diarrhoea Horse flesh may be given as a change provided that it is not from a diseased animal and should be boiled and be fresh Brown bread and milk is also good and healthy food the bread should be cut in cubes of half an inch and the warm milk and water poured on only enough for one meal should be prepared at a time Let the cat and kittens have as much fresh air as is possible and if fed on some dainty last thing at night they will be sure to come in and thus preserved from doing and receiving injury If cats are in any way soiled in their coat especially the long haired varieties and cannot cleanse themselves they may be washed in warm soapy water but this is not advisable in kittens unless great care is used to prevent their taking cold Some cats like being brushed and it is often an improvement to the pelage or fur if carefully done but in all cases the brush should have soft close hair which should be rather long than otherwise Do not let your cats or kittens wear collars or ribbons always especially if they are ramblers for the reason that they are liable to get caught on spikes of railings or twigs of bushes and so starved to death or strangled unless discovered For sending cats to an exhibition a close made basket is best which will allow for ventilation as fresh air is most essential and have it sufficiently large to allow of the cat standing and turning about especially if a long journey is before them I have seen cats sent to shows taken out of small boxes dead stifled to death poor things Bear in mind that the higher and better condition your cat is in on its arrival at the show the greater is the chance of winning Do not put carpet or woollen fabrics in the basket but plenty of good sweet hay or oat straw this will answer all purposes and does not get sodden If you use a padlock for the fastening do not forget to send the key to the manager of the show as is sometimes the case Illustration CAT CLUB CHALLENGE CUP Illustration POINTS BY WHICH CATS ARE JUDGED AS

6006_60489_000004_000000	train-clean-360	CATARRHAL FEVERS 
none	none	Cats are like some other of the domesticated animals liable to be attacked by two kinds of Catarrhal Fever one of which is undoubtedly very infectious like distemper in dogs and the other may be looked upon as the result of a simple cold and therefore not transmissible The first is of course the most severe and fatal and often prevails most extensively affecting cats generally over wide areas sometimes entire continents being invaded by it 
6006_60489_000005_000001	train-clean-360	From A D fourteen fourteen up to eighteen thirty two no fewer than nineteen widespread outbreaks of this kind have been recorded 
6006_60489_000005_000002	train-clean-360	The most notable of these was in seventeen ninety six when the cats in England and Holland were generally attacked by the disease and in the following year when it had spread over Europe and extended to America in eighteen oh three it again appeared in this country and over a large part of the European continent 
6006_60489_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 The symptoms are intense fever prostration vomiting diarrhoea sneezing cough and profuse discharge from the nose and eyes 
6006_60489_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Sometimes the parotid glands are swollen as in human mumps 
none	none	doctor Darwin of Derby uncle to Charles Darwin thought it was a kind of mumps and therefore designated it Parotitis felina
6006_60489_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 The treatment consists in careful nursing and cleanliness keeping the animal moderately warm and comfortable 
6006_60489_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The disease rapidly produces intense debility and therefore the strength should be maintained from the very commencement by frequent small doses of strong beef tea into which one grain of quinine has been introduced twice a day a small quantity of port wine from half to one teaspoonful according to the size of the cat and the state of debility 
6006_60489_000007_000002	train-clean-360	If there is no diarrhoea but constipation a small dose of castor oil or syrup of buckthorn should be given 
6006_60489_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Solid food should not be allowed until convalescence has set in 
6006_60489_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Isolation with regard to other cats and disinfection should be attended to

none	none	If the discharge obstructs the nostrils it should be removed with a sponge and these and the eyes may be bathed with a weak lotion of vinegar and water As regards inoculation for distemper doctor Fleming says it has been tried but the remedy is often worse than the disease at least as bad as the natural disease Vaccination has also been tried but it is valueless 
6006_60489_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Probably inoculation with cultivated or modified virus would be found a good and safe preventative 
6006_60489_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I was anxious to know about this as inoculation used to be the practice with packs of hounds 
6006_60489_000011_000000	train-clean-360	It will be observed that doctor Fleming treats the distemper as a kind of influenza and considers one of the most important things is to keep up the strength of the suffering animal 
6006_60489_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Other members of the R C V S whom I have consulted have all given the same kind of advice not only prescribing for the sick animal wine but brandy as a last resource to arouse sinking vitality 
6006_60489_000011_000002	train-clean-360	mister George Cheverton of High Street Tunbridge Wells who is very successful with animals and their diseases thinks it best to treat them homoeopathically

blossom Illustration THE WILD CAT OF BRITAIN The wild cat is said to be now extinct in England and only found in some of the northern parts of Scotland or the rocky parts of the mountains of the south where I am informed it may yet occasionally be seen The drawing I give above was made from one sent to the first Crystal Palace Cat Show in eighteen seventy one by the Duke of Sutherland from Sutherlandshire It was caught in a trap by the fore leg which was much injured but not so as to prevent its moving with great alacrity even with agility endeavouring frequently to use the claws of both fore feet with a desperate determination and amazing vigour It was a very powerful animal possessing great strength taking size into consideration and of extraordinary fierceness mister Wilson the manager of the show though an excellent naturalist tried to get it out of the thick barred heavy made travelling box in which it arrived into one of the ordinary wire show cages thinking it would appear to better advantage but in this endeavour he was unsuccessful the animal resisting all attempts to expel it from the one into the other making such frantic and determined opposition that the idea was abandoned This was most fortunate for the wire cages then in use were afterwards found unequal to confining even the ordinary domestic cat which in more than one instance forced the bars apart sufficiently to allow of escape As it was the wild cat maintained its position sullenly retiring to one corner of the box where it scowled growled and fought in a most fearful and courageous manner during the time of its exhibition never once relaxing its savage watchfulness or attempts to injure even those who fed it I never saw anything more unremittingly ferocious nor apparently more untamable It was a grand animal however and most interesting to the naturalist being even then scarcely ever seen if so only in districts far away and remote from the dwellings of civilisation Yet I believe I saw one among the rocks of Bodsbeck in Dumfriesshire many years ago though of this I am not certain as it was too far away for accurate observation before it turned and stood at bay and on my advancing it disappeared The animal shown at the Crystal Palace was very much lighter in colour and with less markings than those in the British Museum the tail shorter and the dark rings fewer the lines on the body not much deeper in tint than the ground colour excepting on the forehead and the inside of the fore legs which were darker rather a light red round the mouth and almost white on the chest which appears to be usual with the wild cat the eyes were yellow tinted green the tips of the ears the lips cushions of the feet and a portion of the back part of the hind legs black the markings were in short irregular thin lines and in no way resembled those of the ordinary black marked domestic tabby cat possessing little elegance of line in character it was bolder having a rugged sturdiness being stronger and broader built the fore arms thick massive and endowed with great power with long curved claws the feet were stout sinewy and strong altogether it was a very peculiar interesting and extraordinary animal What became of it I never learned In eighteen seventy one and eighteen seventy two a wild cat was exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat Show by the Earl of Hopetoun aged three years also some hybrid kittens the father of which was a long haired cat the mother a sandy by a wild cat out of a long haired tabby which proves if proof were wanting that such hybrids breed freely either with hybrids the domestic or the wild cat mister Frank Buckland also exhibited a hybrid between the wild and tame cat The Zoological Society a pair of wild cats which did not appear to be British In eighteen seventy three mister A H Senger sent a fine specimen of hybrid between the domestic cat and Scotch wild cat An early description of the wild cat in England is to be found in an old book on Natural History and copied into a work on Menageries Bartholomoeus de Proprietatibus Rerum which was translated into English by Thomas Berthlet and printed by Wynkyn de Worde as early as fourteen ninety eight There is a very interesting description of the cat which gives nearly all the properties of the wild animal in an odd and very amusing way It states He is most like to the leopard and hath a great mouthe and saw teeth and sharp and long tongue and pliant thin and subtle and lappeth therewith when he drinketh as other beasts do that have the nether lip shorter than the over for by cause of unevenness of lips such beasts suck not in drinking but lap and lick as Aristotle saith and Plinius also And he is a full lecherous beast in youth swift pliant and merry and leapeth and riseth on all things that is tofore him and is led by a straw and playeth therewith and is a right heavy beast in age and full sleepy and lieth slyly in wait for mice and is ware where they bene more by smell than by sight and hunteth and riseth on them in privy places and when he taketh a mouse he playeth therewith and eateth him after the play and is a cruel beast when he is wild and dwelleth in woods and hunteth there small wild beasts as conies and hares The next appears in John Bossewell s Workes of Armorie folio A D fifteen ninety seven This beaste is called a Musion for that he is enimie to Myse and Rattes He is slye and wittie and seeth so sharpely that he overcommeth darknes of the nighte by the shyninge lyghte of his eyne In shape of body he is like unto a Leoparde and hathe a great mouth He dothe delight that he enioyeth his libertye and in his youthe he is swifte plyante and merye He maketh a rufull noyse and a gastefull when he profereth to fighte with an other He is a cruell beaste when he is wilde and falleth on his owne feete from most high places and vneth is hurt therewith When he hath a fayre skinne he is as it were prowde thereof and then he goeth faste aboute to be seene Those who have seen the wild cat of Britain especially in confinement will doubtless be ready to endorse this description as being true to the life even to the rufull noyse or his industry in the way of fighting Yet even this old chronicler mentions the fact of his being wilde clearly indicating a similar animal in a state of domestication Later on we find Maister Salmon giving an account of the cat in his strangely curious book Salmon s Compleat English Physician or the Druggist s Shop Opened A D sixteen ninety three in which he relates that marvellous properties exist in the brain bones et cetera of the cat giving recipes mostly cruel and incredible He describes Catus the Cat in such terms as these The Cat of Mountain all which are of one nature and agree much in one shape save as to their magnitude the wild Cat being larger than the Tame and the Cat of Mountain much larger than the wild Cat It has a broad Face almost like a Lyon short Ears large Whiskers shining Eyes short smooth Hair long Tail rough Tongue and armed on its Feet with Claws being a crafty subtle watchful Creature very loving and familiar with Man kind the mortal enemy to the Rat Mouse and all sorts of Birds which it seizes on as its prey As to its Eyes Authors say that they shine in the Night and see better at the full and more dimly at the change of the moon as also that the Cat doth vary his Eyes with the Sun the Apple of its Eye being long at Sun rise round towards Noon and not to be seen at all at night but the whole Eye shining in the night These appearances of the Cats Eyes I am sure are true but whether they answer to the times of the day I never observed Its flesh is not usually eaten yet in some countries it is accounted an excellent dish mister Blaine in his excellent and useful work the Encyclopaedia of Rural Sports a book no sportsman should be without thus discusses the origin of the domestic cat compared with the British wild cat We have yet however to satisfy ourselves with regard to the origin of the true wild cat Felis catus Linn which following the analogies of the Felinae generally are almost exclusively native to countries warmer than our own It is true that occasionally varieties of the Felinae do breed in our caravans and menageries where artificial warmth is kept up to represent something like a tropical temperature but the circumstance is too rare to ground any opinion on of their ever having been indigenous here at least since our part of the globe has cooled down to its present temperature It is therefore more than probable that both the wild and the tame cat have been derived from some other extra European source or sources We say source or sources for such admission begets another difficulty not easily got over which is this that if both of these grimalkins own one common root in which variety was it that the very marked differences between them have taken place Most sportsmen we believe suspect that they own one common origin and some naturalists also do the same contending that the differences observable between them are attributable solely to the long continued action of external agencies which had modified the various organs to meet the varied necessities of the animals The wild cat according to this theory having to contend with powerful enemies expanded in general dimensions its limbs particularly became massive and its long and strong claws with the powerful muscular mechanism which operated on them fitted it for a life of predacity Thus its increased size enabled it to stand some time before any other dogs than high bred foxhounds and even before them also in any place but the direct open ground There exist however in direct contradiction to this opinion certain specialities proper to the wild and certain other to the domestic cat besides the simple expansion of bulk which sufficiently disprove their identity It will be seen that a remarkable difference exists between the tails of the two animals that of the domestic being as is well known long and tapering elegantly to a point whereas that of the wild cat is seen to be broad and to terminate abruptly in a blunt or rounded extremity Linnaeus and Buffon having both of them confounded these two species into one have contributed much to propagate this error which affords us another opportunity of adding to the many we have taken of remarking on the vast importance of comparative anatomy which enables us to draw just distinctions between animals that might otherwise erroneously be adjudged to be dependent on external agencies et cetera Nor need we rest here for what doubt can be entertained on the subject when we point at the remarkable difference between the intestines of the two Those of the domestic are nine times the length of its body whereas in the wild cat they are little more than three times as long as the body The food of the wild cat is said to consist of animals and in the opinion of some fish should be added Why not also birds eggs Cats are particularly fond of the latter In the event of their finding and destroying a nest they invariably eat the eggs and generally the shells Much has been written as to the aptitude of the domestic cat at catching fish If this be so are fish necessarily a part of the food of the native wild cat Numerous instances are adduced of our household cat plunging into water in pursuit of and capture of fish Although I have spent much time in watching cats that were roaming beside streams and about ponds there has never been even an attempt at fishing Frogs they will take and kill often greedily devouring the small ones Yet doubtless they will hunt catch and eat fish for the fact has become proverbial Illustration WILD CAT BRITISH MUSEUM A writer in Menageries states There is no doubt that wild cats will seize on fish and the passionate longing of the domestic cat after this food is an evidence of the natural desire We have seen a cat overcome her natural reluctance to wet her feet and take an eel out of a pail of water doctor Darwin alludes to this propensity mister Leonard a very intelligent friend of mine saw a cat catch a trout by darting on it in deep clear water at the Mill Wexford near Lichfield The cat belonged to mister Stanley who had often seen it catch fish Cases have also been known of cats catching fish in shallow water springing on them from the banks of streams and ponds but I take this as not the habit of the domestic cat though it is not unusual Gray in a poem tells of a cat s death through drowning while attempting to take gold fish from a vase filled with water Of doctor Samuel Johnson it is related that his cat having fallen sick and refused all food he became aware that cats are fond of fish With this knowledge before him he went to the fishmonger s and bought an oyster for the sick creature wrapped it in paper and brought the appetising morsel home The cat relished the dainty food and the Doctor was seen going on the same kindly errand every day until his suffering feline friend was restored to health Still this is no proof that the wild cat in a pure state of nature feeds on fish Again it is nothing unusual for domestic cats to catch and eat cockroaches crickets cockchafers also large and small moths but not so all In domesticity some are almost omnivorous But is the wild cat Taking its anatomical structure into consideration there is doubtless a wide distinction both as regards food and habit In Daniel s Rural Sports A D eighteen thirteen the wild cat is stated to be now scarce in England inhabiting the mountainous and woody parts mister Pennant describes it as four times the size of the house cat but the head larger that it multiplies as fast and may be called the British tiger being the fiercest and most destructive beast we have When only wounded with shot they will attack the person who injured them and often have strength enough to be no despicable enemy Through the kind courtesy of that painstaking excellent observant and eminent naturalist mister J E Harting I am enabled to reprint a portion of his lecture on the origin of the domestic cat and which afterwards appeared in The Field Although many of the statements are known to naturalists still I prefer giving them in the order in which they are so skilfully arranged presenting as they do a very garland of facts connected with the British wild cat Felis catus up to the present and which I deem valuable from many points of view but the more particularly as a record of an animal once abundant in England where it has now apparently almost if not quite ceased to exist In England in former days the wild cat was included amongst the beasts of chase and is often mentioned in royal grants giving liberty to inclose forest land and licence to hunt there extracts from several such grants will be found in the Zoologist for eighteen seventy eight p two hundred fifty one and eighteen eighty p two hundred fifty one Nor was it for diversion alone that the wild cat was hunted Its fur was much used as trimming for dresses and in this way was worn even by nuns at one time Thus in Archbishop Corboyle s Canons anno eleven twenty seven it is ordained that no abbess or nun use more costly apparel than such as is made of lambs or cats skins and as no other part of the animal but the skin was of any use here it grew into a proverb that You can have nothing of a cat but her skin The wild cat is believed to be now extinct not only in England and Wales but in a great part of the south of Scotland About five years ago a Scottish naturalist resident in Stirlingshire mister J A Harvie Brown took a great deal of trouble by means of printed circulars addressed to the principal landowners throughout Scotland and the Isles to ascertain the existing haunts of the wild cat in that part of the United Kingdom The result of his inquiries embodying some very interesting information was published in the Zoologist for January eighteen eighty one The replies which he received indicated pretty clearly although perhaps unexpectedly that there are now no wild cats in Scotland south of a line drawn from Oban on the west coast up the Brander Pass to Dalmally and thence following the borders of Perthshire to the junction of the three counties of Perth Forfar and Aberdeen northward to Tomintoul and so to the city of Inverness We are assured that it is only to the northward and westward of this line that the animal still keeps a footing in suitable localities finding its principal shelter in the great deer forests Thus we see that the wild cat is being gradually driven northward before advancing civilisation and the increased supervision of moors and forests Just as the reindeer in the twelfth century was driven northward from England and found its last home in Caithness and as the wolf followed it a few centuries later so we may expect one day that the wild cat will come to be numbered amongst the extinct British animals A recent writer in the new edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica art Cat expresses the opinion that the wild cat still exists in Wales and in the north of England but gives no proof of its recent occurrence there From time to time we see reports in the newspapers to the effect that a wild cat has been shot or trapped in some out of the way part of the country but it usually turns out to be a large example of the domestic cat coloured like the wild form It is remarkable that when cats in England are allowed to return to a feral state their offspring in the course of generations show a tendency to revert to the wild type of the country partly no doubt in consequence of former interbreeding with the wild species when the latter was common throughout all the wooded portions of the country and partly because the light coloured varieties of escaped cats being more readily seen and destroyed are gradually eliminated while the darker wild type is perpetuated The great increase in size observable in the offspring of escaped domestic cats is no doubt due to continuous living on freshly killed warm blooded animals and to the greater use of the muscles which their new mode of life requires In this way I think we may account for the size and appearance of the so called wild cats which are from time to time reported south of the Tweed Perhaps the last genuine wild cat seen in England was the one shot by Lord Ravensworth at Eslington Northumberland in eighteen fifty three A although so recently as March eighteen eighty three a cat was shot in Bullington Wood Lincolnshire which in point of size colour and markings was said to be quite indistinguishable from the wild Felis catus Bullington Wood is one of an almost continuous chain of great woodlands extending from Mid Lincolnshire to near Peterborough Much of the district has never been preserved for game and keepers are few and far between hence the wild animals have enjoyed an almost complete immunity from persecution Cats are known to have bred in these woods in a wild state for generations and there is no improbability that the cat in question may have descended directly from the old British wild cat Under all the circumstances however it seems more likely to be a case of reversion under favourable conditions from the domestic to the wild type A Trans Tyneside Nat Field Club eighteen sixty four vol vi p one hundred twenty three In Ireland strange to say notwithstanding reports to the contrary all endeavours to find a genuine wild cat have failed the so called wild cat of the natives proving to be the marten cat a very different animal We thus come back to the question with which we started namely the question of origin of the domestic cat and the conclusion I think at which we must arrive is that although Felis catus has contributed to the formation of the existing race of domestic cats it is not the sole ancestor Several wild species of Egyptian and Indian origin having been ages ago reclaimed the interbreeding of their offspring and crossing with other wild species in the countries to which they have been at various times exported has resulted in the gradual production of the many varieties so different in shape and colour with which we are now familiar Before quitting the subject I would point to the fact that when the domestic cat takes to the woods and becomes wild it becomes much larger stronger and changes in colour and there can be little doubt that during the centuries of the existence of the cat in England there must have been numberless crosses and intercrosses both with regard to the males of the domestic cat as with wild females and vice versa yet the curious fact remains that the wild cat still retains its peculiar colouring and form as is shown by the skins preserved in the British Museum and elsewhere mister Darwin in his Voyage of the Beagle eighteen forty five p one hundred twenty in his notes of the first colonists of La Plata A D fifteen thirty five says among other animals that he saw was the common cat altered into a large and fierce animal inhabiting the rocky hills et cetera Another point on which I wish to give my impressions is the act of the cat in what is termed sharpening its claws mister Darwin notes certain trees where the jaguars sharpen their claws and mentions the scars were of different ages he also thought they did this to tear off the horny points This I believe is the received opinion among naturalists but I differ entirely from this view of the practice It is a fact however and worthy of notice that all cats do so even the domestic cat I had one of the legs of a kitchen table entirely torn to pieces by my cats and after much observation I came to the conclusion that it has nothing whatever to do with sharpening the claws but is done to stretch the muscles and tendons of the feet so that they work readily and strongly as the retraction of the claws for lengthened periods must tend to contract the tendons used for the purpose of extending or retracting therefore the cats fix the points of their claws in something soft and bear downwards with the whole weight of the body simply to stretch and by use to strengthen the ligatures that pull the claws forward It is also to be noted that even the domestic cat goes to one particular place or tree to insert the claws and drag forward the muscles perhaps even in the leather of an arm chair a costly practice Why one object is always selected is that they may not betray their presence by numerous marks in the neighbourhood if wild to other animals or their enemies I have mentioned this to my brother John Jenner Weir F L S and he concurs with me throughout I find in Strutt s Sports and Pastimes that of the names applied to companies of animals in the Middle Ages several are still in use though many have become obsolete and also a few of the beasts have ceased to exist in a wild state Some were very curious such as a skulk of foxes a cete of badgers a huske or down of hares a nest of rabbits and a clowder of cats and a kindle of young cats Now cats are said to kitten and rabbits kindle The following shows the value of the cat nearly a thousand years ago it is to be found in Bewick s Quadrupeds In the time of Hoel the Good King of Wales who died in the year nine hundred forty eight laws were made as well to preserve as to fix the different prices of animals among which the cat is included as being at that period of great importance on account of its scarcity and utility The price of a kitten before it could see was fixed at one penny till proof could be given of its having caught a mouse twopence after which it was rated at fourpence which was a great sum in those days when the value of specie was extremely high It was likewise required that it should be perfect in its sense of hearing and seeing should be a good mouser have its claws whole and if a female be a careful nurse If it failed in any of these good qualities the seller was to forfeit to the buyer a third part of its value If any one should steal or kill a cat that guarded the Prince s granary he was either to forfeit a milch ewe her fleece and lamb or as much wheat as when poured on the cat suspended by its feet its head touching the floor would form a heap high enough to cover the tip of the former Bewick remarks Hence we may conclude that cats were not originally natives of these islands and from the great care taken to improve the breed of this prolific creature we may suppose were but little known at that period I scarcely think this the right conclusion the English wild cat being anatomically different In Hone s popular works it is stated that Cats are supposed to have been brought into England from the island of Cyprus by some foreign merchants who came hither for tin mister Hone further says Wild cats were kept by our ancient kings for hunting The officers who had charge of these cats seem to have had appointments of equal consequence with the masters of the king s hounds they were called Catatores Beaumont and Fletcher in The Scornful Lady allude to the hunting of cats in the line Bring out the cat hounds I ll make you take a tree But although large and ferocious the wild cat was not considered a match for some of the lesser animals for in Salmon s English Physician sixteen ninety three we read that The weasel is an enemy to ravens crows and cats and although cats may sometimes set upon them yet they can scarcely overcome them Nevertheless we find in Daniel s Rural Sports eighteen thirteen that Wild cats formerly were an object of sport to huntsmen Thus Gerard Camvile six John had special licence to hunt the hare fox and wild cat throughout all the King s forests and twenty three Henry III Earl Warren by giving Simon de Pierpont a goshawk obtained leave to hunt the buck doe hart hind hare fox goat cat or any other wild beast in certain lands of Simon s But it was not for diversion alone that this animal was pursued for the skin was much used by the nuns in their habits as a fur Still it appears from mister Charles Darwin s Voyage of the Beagle that tastes vary Doctor Shaw was laughed at for stating the flesh of the lion is in great esteem having no small affinity with veal both in the colour taste and flavour Such certainly is the case with the puma The Guachos differ in their opinion whether the jaguar is good eating but were unanimous in saying the cat is excellent It is also stated that the Chinese fatten and eat cats with considerable relish but of this I can obtain no reliable information some of my friends from China not having heard of the custom if such it is Again referring to the skin of the cat vide Strutt In the thirty seventh year of the reign of Edward III it was decreed after enumerating the various kinds of cloth that were to be worn by the nobles knights dames and others that Article two tradesmen artificers and men in office called yeomen their wives and children shall wear no kind of furs excepting those of lambs of rabbits of cats and of foxes Further No man unless he be possessed of the yearly value of forty shillings shall wear any furs but black and white lambs skins Lambs and cats skins were equivalent in value and order In the twenty second year of this monarch s reign all the former statutes against excess in apparel were repealed My old friend Fairholt in his useful work on costume says of the Middle Ages The peasants wore cat skins badger skins et cetera One of the reasons why the skin of cats was used on cloaks and other garments for trimming being that it showed humility in dress and not by way of affectation or vanity but for warmth and comfort it being of the lowest value of any with the exception of lambs skin and badgers and adopted by some priests as well as nuns when wishing to impress others with their deep sense of humility in all things even to their wearing apparel The proof of which Strutt s Habits of the Anglo Normans circa twelfth century fully illustrates William of Malmesbury speaking of Wulfstan Bishop of Worcester assures us that he avoided all appearance of pride and ostentation in his dress and though he was very wealthy he never used any furs finer than lambs skin for the lining of his garments Being blamed for such needless humility by Geoffrey Bishop of Constans who told him that He not only could afford but even ought to wear those of sables of beavers or of foxes he replied It may indeed be proper for you politicians skilful in the affairs of the world to adorn yourselves in the skins of such cunning animals but for me who am a plain man and not subject to change my opinion the skins of lambs are quite sufficient If returned his opponent the finer furs are unpleasant you might at least make use of those of the cat Believe me answered the facetious prelate the lamb of God is much oftener sung in the Church than the cat of God This witty retort put Geoffrey to the blush and threw the whole company into a violent fit of laughter Of a very different character was the usage of the cat at clerical festivals In Mill s History of the Crusades one reads with some degree of horror that In the Middle Ages the cat was a very important personage in religious festivals At Aix in Provence on the festival of the Corpus Christi the finest he cat of the country wrapped like a child in swaddling clothes was exhibited in a magnificent shrine to public admiration Every knee was bent every hand strewed flowers or poured incense and pussy was treated in all respects as the god of the day On the festival however of saint John June twenty four the poor cat s fate was reversed A number of cats were put in a wicker basket and thrown alive into the midst of a large fire kindled in the public square by the bishop and his clergy Hymns and anthems were sung and processions were made by the priests and people in honour of the sacrifice While the foregoing was about being printed mister Edward Hamilton M D writing to The Field May eleventh eighteen eighty nine gives information of a wild cat being shot in Inverness shire I therefore insert the paragraph as every record of so scarce an animal is of importance and value especially when it is descriptive He states A fine specimen of the wild cat Felis sylvestris was sent to me on May third trapped in Inverness shire on the Ben Nevis range It was too much decomposed to exhibit Its dimensions were from nose to base of tail one foot eleven inches length of tail one foot height at shoulder one foot two inches the length of small intestine one foot eight one two inches and the large intestine one foot one inch It will be seen by these measurements that the animal was not so large as some that have been taken though excelling in size many of the domestic varieties CONCERNING CATS CAT Irish Cat

symbolical of the waxing and waning of the night goddess But Bailey in his dictionary says cats see best as the sun approaches and that their eyesight decays as it goes down in the evening Yet on this account says mister Thiselton Dyer in his English Folk lore it was so highly esteemed as to receive sacrifices and even to have stately temples erected to its honour Whenever a cat died Brand tells us all the family shaved their eyebrows and Diodorus Siculus relates that a Roman happening accidentally to kill a cat the mob immediately gathered round the house where he was and neither the entreaties of some principal men by the king nor the fear of the Romans with whom the Egyptians were then negotiating a peace could save the man s life In so much esteem also was it held that on the death of its

Shakespeare mentions the cat forty four times and in this like nearly all else of which he wrote displayed both wonderful and accurate knowledge not only of the form nature habits and food of the animal but also the inner life the disposition what it was of what capable and what it resembled How truly he saw either from study observation or intuitively knew not only the outward contour of men and things but could see within the casket which held the life and being noting clearly thoughts feelings aspirations intents and purposes not of the one only but that also of the brute creation How truthfully he alludes to the peculiar eyes of the cat the fine mark that the pupil dwindles to when the sun rides high in the heavens Hear Grumio in The Taming of the Shrew And so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat As to the food of the cat he well informs us that at this distant period domestic cats were fed and cared for to a certain extent for

every unworthy thing Here is Hamlet s opinion The cat will mew the dog will have his day In Cymbeline there is In killing creatures vile as cats and dogs The foregoing is enough to show the great poet s opinion of the cat SUPERSTITION AND WITCHCRAFT A very remarkable peculiarity of the domestic cat and possibly one that has had much to do with the ill favour with which it has been regarded especially in the Middle Ages is the extraordinary property which its fur possesses of yielding electric sparks when hand rubbed or by other friction the black in a larger degree than any other colour even the rapid motion of a fast retreating cat through rough tangled underwood having been known to produce a luminous effect In frosty weather it is the more noticeable the coldness of the weather apparently giving intensity and brilliancy which to the ignorant would certainly be attributed to the interference of the spiritual or superhuman To sensitive natures and nervous temperaments the very contact with the fur of the black cat will often produce a startling thrill or absolutely an electric shock That carefully observant naturalist Gilbert White speaking of the frost of seventeen eighty five notes During those two Siberian days my parlour cat was so electric that had a person stroked her and been properly insulated the shock might have been given to a whole circle of people Possibly from this lively fiery sparkling tendency combined with its noiseless motion and stealthy habits our ancestors were led in the happily bygone superstitious days to regard the unconscious animal as a familiar of Satan or some other evil spirit which generally appeared in the form of a black cat hence witches were said to have a black cat as their familiar or could at will change themselves into the form of a black cat with eyes of fire Shakespeare says the cat with eyne of burning coal and in Middleton s Witch Act III Hecate says I will but noint and then I ll mount A Spirit like a cat descends Voice above There s one come down to fetch his dues Later on the Voice calls Hark hark the cat sings a brave treble in her own language Then HECATE Now I go now I fly Malkin my sweet spirit

connects him with cats of great renown in the annals of witchcraft a science whereto they have been allied as poor old women one of whom it appears on the authority of an old pamphlet entitled Newes from Scotland et cetera printed in the year fifteen ninety one confessed that she took a cat and christened it et cetera and that in the night following the said cat was conveyed into the middest of the sea by all these witches sayling in their Riddles or Cives and so left the said cat right before the towne of Leith in Scotland This done there did arise such a tempest at sea as a greater hath not been seen et cetera Againe it is confessed that the said christened cat was the cause of the kinges majestie s shippe at his coming forthe of Denmarke had a contrarie winde to the rest of the shippes then being in his companie which thing was most straunge and true as the kinges majestie acknowledgeth for when the rest of the shippes had a fair and good winde then was the winde contrairie and altogether against his majestie et cetera C C Hone s Every day Book vol i In some parts black cats are said to bring good luck and in Scarborough Henderson s Folk lore of the Northern Counties A few years ago sailors wives were in the habit of keeping one thinking thereby to ensure the safety of their husbands at sea This consequently gave black cats such a value that no one else could keep them as they were nearly always stolen There are various proverbs which attach equal importance to this lucky animal as for example Whenever the cat o the house is black The lasses o lovers will have no lack And again Kiss the black cat An twill make ye fat Kiss the white ane Twill make ye lean In Scotland there is a children s rhyme upon the purring of the cat Dirdum drum Three threads and a thrum Thrum gray thrum gray In Devonshire and Wiltshire it is believed that a May cat or in other words a cat born in the month of May will never catch any rats or mice but contrary to the wont of cats will bring into the house snakes and slow worms and other disagreeable reptiles In Huntingdonshire it is a common saying that a May kitten makes a dirty cat If a cat should leap over a corpse it is said to portend misfortune Gough in his Sepulchral Monuments says that in Orkney during the time the corpse remains in the house all the cats are locked up and the looking glasses covered over In Devonshire a superstition prevails that a cat will not remain in a house with an unburied corpse and stories are often told how on the death of one of the inmates of a house the cat has suddenly made its disappearance and not returned again until after the funeral The sneezing of the cat says Brand Popular Antiquities eighteen forty nine vol iii p one hundred eighty seven appears to have been considered as a lucky omen to a bride who was to be married on the succeeding day In Cornwall says Hunt those little gatherings which come on children s eyelids locally called whilks and also warts are cured by passing the tail of a black cat nine times over the place If a ram cat the cure is more certain In Ireland it is considered highly unlucky D D mister T F Thiselton Dyer s English Folk lore Sailors are very superstitious as regards cats If a black cat comes on board it is a presage of disaster if the ship s cat is more lively than ordinary it is a sign of wind but if the cat is accidentally drowned then there is consternation which does not wear off until the vessel is safe in harbour Lady Wilde in her Irish Legends gives a cat story quite of the fairy type and well in keeping with many of witchcraft and sorcery One dark cold night as an old woman was spinning there came three taps at her door and not until after the last did she open it when a pleading voice said Let me in let me in and a handsome black cat with a white breast and two white kittens entered The old woman spun on and the cats purred loudly till the mother puss warned her that it was very late that they wanted some milk and that the fairies wanted her room that night to dance and sup in The milk was given the cats thanked her and said they would not forget her kindness but ere they vanished up the chimney they left her a great silver coin and the fairies had their ball untroubled by the old woman s presence for the pussy s warning was a gentle hint If a kitten comes to a house in the morning it is lucky if in the evening it portends evil of some kind unless it stays to prevent it A cat s hair is said to be indigestible and if one is swallowed death will ensue Northern Milton in his Astrologaster p forty eight tells us That when the cat washes her face over her eares we shall have great store of raine Lord Westmoreland in a poem To a cat bore me company in confinement says Scratch but thine ear Then boldly tell what weather s drawing near The cat sneezing appears to be a lucky omen to a bride It was a vulgar notion that cats when hungry would eat coals and even to this day in some parts there is a doubt about it In The Tamer Tamed or Woman s Pride Izamo says to Moroso I d learn to eat coals with a hungry cat and in Boduca the first daughter says They are cowards eat coals like compelled cats The crying of cats ospreys ravens or other birds upon the tops of houses in the night time are observed by the vulgar to presignify death to the sick Brand There is also a superstition that cats will suck the breath of infants Nothing could be more ridiculous The formation of the cat s mouth is not well adapted for such action the under jaw being shorter than the upper which is one reason why it laps fluids instead of drinking Cats will creep into cradles but for no other purpose than that of sleep the bed and clothes being warm and soft and of course comfortable yet instead of doing harm they help to keep the child s temperature more even in cold weather Of course if they lie on the infant it is a different matter WEATHER NOTIONS Signs of Foul Weather by doctor Erasmus Darwin In a poem the well known relative of the eminent Charles Darwin describes the various natural indications of coming storms Among the animals and birds he notes the cat Low o er the grass the swallow wings The cricket too how sharp he sings Puss on the hearth with velvet paws Sits wiping o er his whiskered jaws In England says mister T F Thiselton Dyer the superstitious still hold the cat in high esteem and oftentimes when observing the weather attribute much importance to its various movements Thus according to some when they sneeze it is a sign of rain and Herrick in his Hesperides tells us how True calendars as pusses eare Wash t o re to tell what change is neare It is a common notion that when a cat scratches the legs of a table it is a prognostic of change of weather John Swan in his Speculum Mundi Cambridge sixteen forty three writing of the cat says She useth therefore to wash her face with her feet which she licketh and moisteneth with her tongue and it is observed by some that if she put her feet beyond the crown of her head in this kind of washing it is a signe of rain Indeed in the eyes of the superstitious there is scarcely a movement of the cat which is not supposed to have some significance Cats are exceedingly fond of valerian V officinalis and in Topsell s Four footed Beasts sixteen fifty eight p eighty one we find the following curious remarks The root of the herb valerian called Phu is very like to the eye of a cat and wheresoever it groweth if cats come thereunto they instantly dig it up for the love thereof as I myself have seen in mine own garden for it smelleth moreover like a cat There is also an English rhyme on the plant marum to the following effect If you see it The cats will eat it If you sow it The cats will know it In Suffolk cats eyes are supposed to dilate and contract with the flow and ebb of the tide In Lancashire the common people have an idea that those who play much with cats never have good health E E mister T F Thiselton Dyer s English Folk lore If tincture of valerian is sprinkled on a plant or bush the neighbouring cats roll and rub themselves on or against it often biting and scratching the plant to pieces H W In Lancashire it is regarded as unlucky to allow a cat to die in a house Hence F when they are ill they are usually drowned F Harland and Wilkinson Lancashire Folk lore p one

given in the first instance to cats and dogs G G Edwards s Old English Customs p fifty four If a cat tears at the cushions carpet and other articles of furniture with its claws it is considered a sign of wind Hence the saying the cat is raising the wind mister Park s note in his copy of Bourn and Brand s Popular Antiquities p ninety two says Cats sitting with their tails to the fire or washing with their paws behind their ears are said to foretell a change of weather In Pules play of The Novice is the line Ere Gil our cat can lick her ear This is from Brand and I do not think it refers to the weather but to an impossibility A CAT CLOCK The following curious incident is to be found in Huc s Chinese Empire One day when we went to pay a visit to some families of Chinese Christian peasants we met near a farm a young lad who was taking a buffalo to graze along our path We asked him carelessly as we passed whether it was yet noon The child raised his head to look at the sun but it was hidden behind thick clouds and he could read no answer there The sky is so cloudy said he but wait a moment and with these words he ran towards the farm and came back a few minutes afterwards with a cat in his arms Look here said he it is not noon yet and he showed us the cat s eyes by pushing up the lids with his hands We looked at the child with surprise but he was evidently in earnest and the cat though astonished and not much pleased at the experiment made on her eyes behaved with most exemplary complaisance Very well said we thank you and he then let go the cat who made her escape pretty quickly and we continued our route To say the truth we had not at all understood the proceeding but did not wish to question the little pagan lest he should find out that we were Europeans by our ignorance As soon as we reached the farm however we made haste to ask our Christians whether they could tell the clock by looking into the cat s eyes They seemed surprised at the question but as there was no danger in confessing to them our ignorance of the properties of the cat s eyes we related what had just taken place That was all that was necessary our complaisant neophytes immediately gave chase to all the cats in the neighbourhood They brought us three or four and explained in what manner they might be made use of for watches They pointed out that the pupils of their eyes went on constantly growing narrower until twelve o clock when they became like a fine line as thin as a hair drawn perpendicularly across the eye and that after twelve the dilatation recommenced Archbishop Whately once declared that there was only one noun in English which had a real vocative case It was cat vocative puss I wonder if this derivation is true I take it from a New York journal When the Egyptians of old worshipped the cat they settled it that she was like the moon because she was more bright at night and because her eyes changed just as the moon changes from new to crescent and to full So they made an idol of the cat s head and named it pasht which meant the face of the moon Pasht became pas pus puss Church Times March eighth eighteen eighty eight PUSS IN BOOTS Le Chat Botte Is from the Eleventh Night of Straparola s Italian fairy tales where Constantine s cat procures his master a fine castle and the king s heiress first translated into French in fifteen eighty five Our version is taken from that of Charles Perrault There is a similar one in the Scandinavian nursery tales This clever cat secures a fortune and a royal partner for his master who passes off as the Marquis of Carabas but is in reality a young miller without a penny in the world The above is from doctor Brewer s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable and goes far to prove the antiquity of what is generally believed to be a modern story many believing it to be one of the numberless pleasant amusing and in a sense instructive nursery or children s stories of the present time SIGNS D Urfey in his poem on Knole speaks of The Cats at Sevenoaks The Cat or Cats is by no means a common sign The subject is well alluded to in The Cat Past and Present from the French of M Champfleury translated by missus Cashel Hoey at page thirty three A sign is pictured from the Lombards quarter Paris It is there over a confectioner s shop and is a cat seated or rather two a sign being placed on either side of the corner Underneath one is Au Chat the other Noir I may add the work is a most excellent and amusing collection of much appertaining to cats and is well worthy of a place in the cat lover s library In Larwood and Hotten s History of Sign boards a work of much research and merit occurs the following As I was going through a street of London where I had never been till then I felt a general damp and faintness all over me which I could not tell how to account for till I chanced to cast my eyes upwards and found I was passing under a sign post on which the picture of a cat was hung This little incident of the cat hater told in No five hundred thirty eight of The Spectator is a proof of the presence of cats on the sign board where indeed they are still to be met with but very rarely There is a sign of The Cat at Egremont in Cumberland a Black Cat at saint Leonard s Gate Lancaster and a Red Cat at Birkenhead and a Red Cat in the Hague Holland to which is attached an amusing story worthy of perusal The Cat and Parrot and The Cat and Lion apparently have no direct meaning unless by the former may be inferred that if you lap like a cat of the liquids sold at the hostelry you will talk like a parrot yet according to Larwood and Hotten it was a bookseller s sign The Cat and Cage and The Cat in Basket were signs much in vogue during the frost fair on the Thames in seventeen thirty nine forty a live cat being hung outside some of the booths which afterwards was not infrequent at other festive meetings What the exact origin was is not quite apparent Cat and Fiddle a public house sign is a corruption either of the French Catherine la fidele wife of Czar Peter the Great of Russia or of Caton le fidele meaning Caton governor of Calais doctor BREWER S Dictionary of Phrase and Fable Cat and Fiddle While on the subject of sign boards says a writer in Cassell s Old and New London vol i p five hundred seven we may state that Piccadilly was the place in which The Cat and Fiddle first appeared as a public house sign The story is that a Frenchwoman a small shopkeeper at the eastern end soon after it was built had a very faithful and favourite cat and that in the lack of any other sign she put over her door the words Voici un Chat fidele From some cause or other the Chat fidele soon became a popular sign in France and was speedily Anglicised into The Cat and Fiddle because the words form part of one of our most popular nursery rhymes We do not pledge ourselves as to the accuracy of this definition In Farringdon Devon is the sign of La Chatte Fidele in commemoration of a faithful cat Without scanning the phrase too nicely it may simply indicate that the game of cat trap ball and a fiddle for dancing are provided for customers Yet according to Larwood and Hotten s History of Sign boards there is yet another version and another of the matter for it is stated a little hidden meaning is there in the Cat and Fiddle still a great favourite in Hampshire the only connection between the animal and the instrument being that the strings are made from cats entrails sic and that a small fiddle is called a kit and a small cat a kitten besides they have been united from time immemorial in the nursery rhyme Heigh diddle diddle The Cat and the fiddle Amongst the other explanations offered is the one that it may have originated with the sign of a certain Caton Fidele a staunch Protestant in the reign of Queen Mary and only have been changed into the cat and fiddle by corruption but if so it must have lost its original appellation very soon for as early as fifteen eighty nine we find Henry Carr signe of the Catte and Fidle in the olde Chaunge Formerly there was a Cat and Fiddle at Norwich the Cat being represented playing on a fiddle and a number of mice dancing round her Cat and Bagpipes Was not uncommon in Ireland this instrument being the national one in place of the fiddle When doctors disagree who shall decide Thus I leave it Cat

boards which are rather curious They have upon them the following doggerel lines Pray Puss do not tare Because the Mutton is so rare Pray Puss do not claw Because the Mutton is so raw Cat and Wheel Most likely to be a corruption of Catherine Wheel there was a sign of this name in the Borough Southwark In France some signs are still more peculiar as a Cat Playing at Raquet Chatte qui pelote Fishing Cat La Chatte qui peche The Dancing Cat and the well known Puss in Boots Whittington and his Cat is by no means uncommon and was not unknown in the early part of the seventeenth century Somewhere I remember having seen Whittington s Cat without the master which I suppose arose from the painter not knowing how to portray Sir Richard Cat and Kittens A public house sign alluding to the pewter pots so called Stealing these pots is termed Cat and kitten sneaking We still call a large kettle a kitchen and speak of a soldier s kit Saxon cytel a pot pan or vessel generally BREWER S Dictionary of Phrase and Fable May not this sign be intended to mean merely what is shown The Cat and Kittens indicative of comfort and rest Or may it have been Cat and Chitterlings in allusion to the source from which fiddlestrings were said to be derived Cat and Tortoise This seems to have no meaning other than at a tavern extremes meet the fast and the slow the lively and the stolid or it is possibly a corruption of something widely different THE LAW ON CAT KILLING An Articled Clerk writing to The Standard with regard to the illegality of killing cats states It is clearly laid down in Addison on Torts that a person is not justified in killing his neighbour s cat or dog which he finds on his land unless the animal is in the act of doing some injurious act which can only be prevented by its slaughter And it has been decided by the case of Townsend v Watken nine last two hundred seventy seven that if a person sets on his lands a trap for foxes and baits it with such strong smelling meat as to attract his neighbour s dog or cat on to his land to the trap and such animal is thereby killed or injured he is liable for the act though he had no intention of doing it and though the animal ought not to have been on his land DEAD CATS Lifeless cats have been from time immemorial suggestive of foolish hoaxing a parcel being made up or a basket with the legs of a hare projecting directed to some one at a distance and on which the charge for carriage comes to a considerable sum the fortunate recipient ultimately to his great annoyance finding his present was nothing else but a dead cat Dead cats which not infrequently were cast into the streets or accidentally killed there were sometimes used as objects of sport by the silly low minded and vulgar and it was thought a clever thing if they could deposit such in a drawing room through an open window or pitch the unfortunate animal often crushed and dirty into a passing carriage but the time of times when it was considered to be a legitimate object to use was that of either a borough or county election cats and rotten eggs forming the material with which the assault was conducted in the event of an unpopular candidate for honours attempting to give his political views to a depreciatory mob surrounding the hustings An anecdote is recorded in Grose s Olio of mister Fox who in seventeen eighty four was a candidate for Westminster which goes far to show what dirty degrading disgusting indignities the would be people s representative had to endure at that period and with what good humour such favours of popular appreciation or otherwise were received During the poll a dead cat being thrown on the hustings one of Sir Cecil Wray s party observed it stunk worse than a fox to which mister Fox replied there was nothing extraordinary in that considering it was a poll cat This is by no means the only ready and witty answer that has been attributed to mister Fox though not bearing on the present subject

they could not endure servitude It is a bold and daring creature and also cruel to its enemy and never gives over till it has destroyed it if possible It is also watchful dexterous swift pliable and has good nerves thus if it falls from a place never so high it still alights on its feet and therefore may denote those who have much forethought that whatsoever befalls them they are still on their guard In coat armour they must always be represented as full faced and not showing one side of it but both their eyes and both their ears Argent three cats in pale sable is the coat of the family of Keat of Devonshire Many families have adopted the cat as their emblem In Cats Past and Present several are noted In Scotland the Clan Chattan bore as their chief cognizance the wild cat and called their chief Mohr au Chat the great wild cat Nor is the name uncommon as an English surname frequently appearing as Cat Catt Catte but the most strange association of the name with the calling was one I knew in my old sporting days of a gamekeeper whose name was Cat PERFORMING CATS Cats unlike dogs are not amused by nor do they in any way take an interest in what are termed tricks Performing dogs will sit about their master watching anxiously for their turn and they have been known on more than one occasion to slip before the dog that has next jump through the hoop or over a stick barking merrily exulting in having excelled the other generally they await with intense eagerness the agility of the others and strenuously try to surpass them Possibly this is so from the long time the dog has been under the dominion of man and taught by him how to be of service either in hunting sporting shepherding watching in a sense his friend though more his bond or slave even to dragging carts waggons and sleighs to fetch and carry even to smuggle Long teaching persistent teaching from time immemorial has undoubtedly had its due effect and in some instances if not all has been transmitted such as in the pointer and setter which particular sections have been known to require little or no present training taking to their duties naturally receiving but little guidance as to how much when and where such instinctive qualities are required With the cat it is widely different Beyond being the necessary cat the pet cat or kitten it never has been an object of interest beyond that of keeping from increase those veritable plagues rats and mice the enormous use it has thus been to man has had but scant acknowledgment never thoroughly appreciated vastly underrated with but little attention not only to its beauty nor in modifying its nature to the actual requirements of civilisation The cat through long ages has had as it were to shift for itself with the few approved with the many not only neglected but in bygone days and with some even in the present it has been and is looked on as a thing that is not to be cared for or domesticated but often absolutely ill treated not because there has been wrong done but because it is a cat I heard a man of gentle blood once say that there was no good in a cat and the only use they were as far as he could see was as an animal to try the courage of his terriers upon Happily all are not alike and so the cat survives and by the present generation is petted and noticed with a growing interest Though long closely connected with man in many ways still as I have before said it has been left to itself to a certain degree In no way or but slightly has it been guided and thus as a domestic animal it has become what it is one repelling most attempts to make it of the same kind of value as the dog its great powers of observation coupled with timidity make a barrier to its being trained into that which its nature dislikes and its natural and acquired repugnance to confinement and tuition prevent it at least at present from being the humble servant as the dog past and present has been and is Studying closely the habits of the cat for years as I have I believe there is a natural sullen antipathy to being taught or restrained or made to do anything to which its nature or feelings are averse and this arises from long continued persecution and no training Try for instance to make a cat lie still if it wants to go out You may hold it at first then gently relinquish your grasp stroke it talk to it fondle it until it purrs and purrs with seeming pleasure but it never once forgets it is restrained and the first opportunity it will make a sudden dash and is gone However all animals more or less may be trained and the cat of course is among them and a notable one By bringing them up among birds such as canaries pigeons chickens and ducklings it will respect and not touch them while those wild will be immediately sacrificed One of the best instances of this was a small collection of animals and birds in a large cage that used to be shown by a man by the name of Austin and to which I have already referred This man was a lover and trainer of animal life and an adept His Happy Family generally consisted of a cat or two some kittens rats mice rabbits guinea pigs an owl a kestrel falcon starlings goldfinches canaries et cetera a most incongruous assembly Yet among them all there was a freedom of action a self reliance and an air of happiness that I have never seen in performing cats mister Austin informed me that he had been a number of years studying their different natures but that he found the cats the most difficult to deal with only the most gentle treatment accomplishing the object he had in view Any fresh introduction had to be done by degrees and shown outside first for some time It was quite apparent however that the cats were quite at their ease and I have seen a canary sitting on the head of the cat while a starling was resting on the back But all are gone Austin and his pets and no other reigns in his stead Occasionally one sees at the corners of some of the London streets a man who professes to have trained cats and birds the latter certainly are clever but the former have a frightened scared look and seem by no means comfortable I should say the tuition was on different lines to that of Austin The man takes a canary opens a cat s mouth puts it in takes it out makes the cat or cats go up a short ladder and down another then they are told to fight and placed in front of each other but fight they will not with their fore paws so the master moves their paws for them each looking away from the other There is no training in this but fear There is an innate timidity the offspring of long persecution in the cat that prevents as a rule its performing in public Not so the dog time and place matter not to him from generation to generation he has been used to it In Cats Past and Present by Champfleury there are descriptions of performing cats and one Valmont de Bomare mentions that in a booth at the fair of saint Germain s during the eighteenth century there was a cat concert the word Miaulique in huge letters being on the outside In seventeen eighty nine there is an account of a Venetian giving cat concerts and the facsimile of a print of the seventeenth century picturing a cat showman In seventeen fifty eight or the following year Bisset the famous animal trainer hired a room near the Haymarket at which he announced a public performance of a CATS OPERA supplemented by tricks of a horse a dog and some monkeys et cetera The Cats Opera was attended by crowded houses and Bisset cleared a thousand pounds in a few days After a successful season in London he sold some of the animals and made a provincial tour with the rest rapidly accumulating a considerable fortune mister FROST S Old Showman Many years ago a concert was given at Paris wherein cats were the performers They were placed in rows and a monkey beat time to them According as he beat the time so the cats mewed and the historian of the FACT relates that the diversity of the tones which they emitted produced a very ludicrous effect This exhibition was announced to the Parisian public by the title of Concert Miaulant Zoological Anecdotes Another specimen of discipline is to be found in Menageries The writer says Cats may be taught to perform tricks such as leaping over a stick but they always do such feats unwillingly There is at present an exhibition of cats in Regent Street who at the bidding of their master an Italian turn a wheel and draw up water in a bucket ring a bell and in doing these things begin continue and stop as they are commanded But the commencez continuez arretez of their keeper is always enforced with a threatening eye and often with a severe blow and the poor creatures exhibit the greatest reluctance to proceed with their unnatural employments They have a subdued and piteous look but the scratches upon their master s arms show that his task is not always an easy one Illustration Of performing cats on the stage there have been several companies of late in London one of which I went to see at the royal Aquarium Westminster and I am bound to say that the relations between master and cats were on a better footing than any that have hitherto come under my notice On each side of the stage there were cat kennels from which the cats made their appearance on a given signal ran across on or over whatever was placed between and disappeared quickly into the opposite kennels But about it all there was a decided air of timidity and an eagerness to get the performance over and done with it When the cats came out they were caressed and encouraged which seemed to have a soothing effect and I have a strong apprehension that they received some dainty morsel when they reached their destination One ran up a pole at command over which there was a cap at the top into which it disappeared for a few seconds evidently for some reason food perhaps It then descended But before this supreme act several cats had crossed a bridge of chairs stepping only on the backs until they reached the opposite house or box into which to retire The process was repeated and the performance varied by two cats crossing the bridge together one passing over and the other under the horizontal rung between the seat and the top of the chair A long plank was next produced upon which was placed a row of wine bottles at intervals and the cats ran along the plank winding in and out between the bottles first to the right then to the left without making a mistake This part of the performance was varied by placing on the top of each bottle a flat disc of thick wood one of the cats strode then from disc to disc without displacing or upsetting a bottle while the other animal repeated its serpentine walk on the plank below The plank being removed a number of trestles were brought in and placed at intervals in a row between the two sets of houses when the cats on being called jumped from trestle to trestle varying the feat by leaping through a hoop which was held up by the trainer between the trestles To this succeeded a performance on the tight rope which was not the least curious part of the exhibition A rope being stretched across the arena from house to house the cats walked across in turn without making a mistake Some white rats were then brought and placed at intervals along the rope when the cats re crossing from one end to the other strode over the rats without injuring them A repetition of this feat was rendered a little more difficult by substituting for rats which sat pretty quietly in one place several white mice and small birds which were more restless and kept changing their positions The cats re crossed the rope and passed over all these obstacles without even noticing the impediments placed in their way with one or two exceptions when they stopped and cosseted one or more of the white rats two of which rode triumphantly on the back of a large black cat Perhaps the most odd performance was that of Cat Harris an imitator of the voice of cats in seventeen forty seven When Foote first opened the Haymarket Theatre amongst other projects he proposed to entertain the public with imitation of cat music For this purpose he engaged a man famous for his skill in mimicking the mewing of the cat This person was called Cat Harris As he did not attend the rehearsal of this odd concert Foote desired Shuter would endeavour to find him out and bring him with him Shuter was directed to some court in the Minories where this extraordinary musician lived but not being able to find the house Shuter began a cat solo upon this the other looked out of the window and answered him with a cantata of the same sort Come along said Shuter I want no better information that you are the man Foote stays for us we cannot begin the cat opera without you CASSELL S Old and New London vol iv Illustration CAT RACING IN BELGIUM On festival days parties of young men assemble in various places to shoot with cross bows and muskets and prizes of considerable value are often distributed to the winners Then there are pigeon clubs and canary clubs for granting rewards to the trainers of the fleetest carrier pigeons and best warbling canaries Of these clubs many individuals of high rank are the honorary presidents and even royal princes deign to present them banners without which no Belgian club can lay claim to any degree of importance But the most curious thing is cat racing which takes place according to an engraving in the public thoroughfare the cats being turned loose at a given time It is thus described Cat racing is a sport which stands high in popular favour In one of the suburbs of Liege it is an affair of annual observance during carnival time Numerous individuals of the feline tribe are collected each having round his neck a collar with a seal attached to it precisely like those of the carrier pigeons The cats are tied up in sacks and as soon as the clock strikes the solemn hour of midnight the sacks are unfastened the cats let loose and the race begins The winner is the cat which first reaches home and the prize awarded to its owner is sometimes a ham sometimes a silver spoon On the occasion of the last competition the prize was won by a blind cat Pictorial Times June sixteenth eighteen sixty Illustration CAT IMAGES Those with long memories will not have forgotten the Italian with a board on his head on which were tied a number of plaster casts and possibly still seem to hear in the far away time the unforgotten cry of Yah im a gees Notably among these works of art were models of cats such cats such expressive faces and what forms How droll too were those with a moving head wagging and nodding as it were with a grave and thoughtful semi reproachful vacant gaze Yah im a gees has passed on and the country pedlar with his crockery cats mostly red and white Sure such cats alive were never seen but in burnt clay they existed and often adorned the mantel shelves of the poor What must the live cat sitting before the fire have thought if cats think when it looked up at the stolid staring stiff and stark new comer One never sees these things now nor the cats made of paste board covered with black velvet and two large brass spangles for eyes These were put into dark corners with an idea of deception with the imbecile hope that visitors would take them to be real flesh and bone everyday black cats But was any one ever taken in but the maker Then there were cats and cats and kittens made of silk for selling at fancy fairs not much like cats but for the purposes good Cats sitting on pen wipers clay cats of burnt brick earth These were generally something to remember rather than possess Wax cats also with a cotton wick coming out at the top of the head It was a saddening sight to see these beauties burning slowly away Was this a remnant of the burning of the live cats in the good old times And cats made of rabbits skins were not uncommon and far better to give children to play with than the tiny lovable patient live kitten which if it submit to be tortured it is well but if it resent pain and suffering then it is beaten There is more ill done from want of thought than want of heart But kittens have fallen upon evil times ay even in these days of education and enlightenment As long as the world lasts probably there will be the foolish the gay unthinking and in tastes the ridiculous But then there are and there ever will be those that are always craving thirsting longing shall I say mad for something new Light headed with softened intellects who must they say they must have some excitement or some novelty no matter what to talk of or possess though all this is ephemeral and the silliness only lasts a few hours Long or short they are never conscious of these absurdities and look forward with all the eagerness of doll pleased infancy for another craze The world is being denuded of some of its brightest ornaments and its heaven taught music in the slaughter of birds to gratify for scarcely a few hours the insane vanity that is now rife in the ball room fashion What has all this to do with cats Why this class of people are not content they never are so but are adding to the evil by piling up a fresh one It is the kitten now the small about two or three weeks old kitten that is the fashion Not long ago they were killed and stuffed for children to play with better so than alive perhaps but now they are to please children of a larger growth their tightly filled skins adorned with glass eyes being put in sportive attitudes about portrait frames and such like uses It is comical and were it not for the stupid bad taste and absurdity of the thing one would feel inclined to laugh at clambering kitten skins about and supposed to be peeping into the face of a languor struck beauty Who buys such Does any one If so where do they go Over thirty kittens in one shop window What next and next Truly frivolity is not dead From these and such as these turn to the models fair and proper the china the porcelain the terra cotta the bronze and the silver both English French German and Japanese some exquisite with all the character elegance and grace of the living animals In these there has been a great advance of late years Miss A Chaplin taking the lead Then in bold point tracery on pottery Miss Barlow tells of the animal s flowing lines and non angular posing Art true art all of it and art to be coveted by the lover of cats or for art alone But I have almost forgotten the old time custom of when the young ladies came from school bringing home a sampler in the days before linen stamping was known or thought of On these in needlework were alphabets numbers trees such trees dogs and cats Then too there were cats of silk and satin in needlework and cats in various materials but the most curious among the young people s accomplishments was the making of tortoiseshell cats from a snail shell with a smaller one for a head with either wax or bread ears fore legs and tail and yellow or green beads for eyes Droll looking things very I give a drawing of one And last not least often the edible cats cats made of cheese cats of sweet sponge cake cats of sugar and once I saw a cat of jelly In the old times of country pleasure fairs when every one brought home gingerbread nuts and cakes as a fairing the gingerbread cat in boots was not forgotten nor left unappreciated generally fairly good in form and gilt over with Dutch metal it occupied a place of honour in many a country cottage home and for the matter of that also in the busy town If good gingerbread it was saved for many a day or until the holiday time was ended and feasting over and the next fair talked of But after all said and done what a little respect regard and reverence is there in our mode to that of the Egyptians They had three varieties of cats but they were all the same to them as their pets as useful beautiful and typical they were individually and nationally regarded their bodies embalmed and verses chaunted in their praise and the image of the cat then a thousand years ago was a deity What do they think of the cat now these same though modern Egyptians Scarcely anything And we who in bygone ages persecuted it to day give it a growing recognition as an animal both useful beautiful and worthy of culture Illustration Illustration LOVERS OF CATS The Turks greatly admire Cats to them their alluring Figure appears preferable to the Docility Instinct and Fidelity of the Dog Mahomet was very partial to Cats It is related that being called up on some urgent Business he preferred cutting off the Sleeve of his Robe to waking the Cat that lay upon it asleep Nothing more was necessary to bring these Animals into high Request A Cat may even enter a Mosque it is caressed there as the Favourite Animal of the Prophet while the Dog that should dare appear in the Temples would pollute them with his Presence and would be punished with instant Death H H Daniel s Rural Sports eighteen thirteen I am indebted to the reverend T G Gardner of saint Paul s Cray for the following from the French A recluse in the time of Gregory the Great had it revealed to him in a vision that in the world to come he should have equal share of beatitude with that Pontiff but this scarcely contented him and he thought some compensation was his due inasmuch as the Pope enjoyed immense wealth in this present life and he himself had nothing he could call his own save one pet cat But in another vision he was censured his worldly detachment was not so entire as he imagined and that Gregory would with far greater equanimity part with his vast treasures than he could part with his beloved puss CATS ENDOWED BY LA BELLE STEWART One of the chief ornaments of the Court of saint James in the reign of Charles II was La Belle Stewart afterwards the Duchess of Richmond to whom Pope alluded as the Duchess of R in the well known line Die and endow a college or a cat The endowment satirised by Pope has been favourably explained by Warton She left annuities to several female friends with the burden of maintaining some of her cats a delicate way of providing for poor and probably proud gentlewomen without making them feel that they owed their livelihood to her mere liberality But possibly there may have been a kindliness of thought for both deeming that those who were dear friends would be most likely to attend to her wishes mister Samuel Pepys had at least a gentle nature as regards animals if he was not a lover of cats for in his Diary occurs this note as to the Fire of London sixteen sixty six September fifth Thence homeward having passed

family of Rottingdean seem also to be possessed with a similar kind of feeling towards cats exhibiting no fewer than twenty one specimens at one Cat Show which at the time were said to represent only a small portion of their stock these ultimately became almost too numerous getting beyond control Signor Foli is a lover of cats and has exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat Show Petrarch loved his cat

sent up her name She was admitted and found him lolling on a sofa surrounded by twenty seven cats of all ages The following is from the Echo respecting a lady well known in her profession Miss Ellen Terry has a passionate fondness for cats She will frolic for hours with her feline pets never tiring of studying their graceful gambols An author friend of mine told me of once reading a play to her During the reading she posed on an immense tiger skin surrounded by a small army of cats At first the playful capers of the mistress and her pets were toned down to suit the quiet situations of the play but as the reading progressed and the plot approached a climax the antics of the group became so vigorous and drolly excited that my poor friend closed the MS in despair and abandoned himself to the unrestrained expression of his mirth declaring that if he could write a play to equal the fun of Miss Terry and her cats his fortune would be made Cowper loved his pet hares spaniel and cat and wrote the well known Cat retired from business Gray wrote a poem on a cat drowned in a vase which contained gold fish Cardinal Richelieu was a lover of the cat Montaigne had a favourite cat Among painters Gottfried Mind was not only fond of cats but was one of if not the best at portraying them in action and in England no one has surpassed Couldery in delineation nor Miss Chaplin in perfection of modelling I am the fortunate possessor of several of her models in terra cotta which though small are beautiful in finish Of one Miss Chaplin informed me the details were scratched in with a pin for want of better and proper tools GAMES CAT S CRADLE OR CATCH CRADLE doctor Brewer in his Dictionary of Phrase and Fable thinks this the corrupt for cratch cradle or manger cradle in which the infant Saviour was laid Cratch is the French creche a rack or manger and to the present hour the racks which stand in the fields for cattle to eat from are called cratches Of this however I am doubtful though there is much reason in his suggestion In Sussex and Kent when I was a boy it was commonly played among children but always called cat s catch or scratch cradle and consisted generally of two or more players A piece of string being tied at the ends was placed on the fingers and crossed and re crossed to make a sort of cradle the next player inserted his or her fingers quickly taking it off then the first catching it back then the second again then the first as fast as possible catching and taking off the string Sometimes the sides were caught by the teeth of the players one on each side and as the hands were relaxed the faces were apart then when drawn out it brought the faces together the string being let go or not and caught again as it receded was according to the will of the players the catching and letting go affording much merriment When four or five played the string rapidly passed from hand to hand until in the rapidity of the motion one missed who then stood out and so on until only one was left winning the game of cat s catch or scratch cradle It was varied also to single and double cradle according to the number of crossings of the string Catch is easily converted into cat s or it might be so called from the catching or clawing at to get and to hold the entanglement CAT TRAP BAT AND BALL L With the form of the trap our readers are doubtless acquainted it will only be necessary for us to give the laws of the game Two boundaries are equally placed at some distance from the trap between which it is necessary for the ball to pass when struck by the batsman if it fall outside either of them he loses his innings Innings are drawn for and the player who wins places the ball in the spoon of the trap touches the trigger with the bat and as the ball ascends from the trap strikes it as far as he can One of the other players who may be from two to half a dozen endeavours to catch it If he do so before it reaches the ground or hops more than once or if the striker miss the ball when he aims at it or hits the trigger more than once without striking the ball he loses his innings and the next in order which must previously be agreed on takes his place Should the ball be fairly struck and not caught as we have stated the out player into whose hand it comes bowls it from the place where he picks it up at the trap which if he hit the striker is out if he miss it the striker counts one towards the game which may be any number decided on There is also a practice in some places when the bowler has sent in the ball of the striker s guessing the number of bats lengths it is from the trap if he guess within the real number he reckons that number toward his game but if he guess more than there really are he loses his innings It is not necessary to make the game in one innings PUSS IN THE CORNER L L The Boy s Own Book This is a very simple but at the same time a very lively and amusing game It is played by five only and the place chosen for the sport should be a square court or yard with four corners or any place where there are four trees or posts about equidistant from each other and forming the four points of a square Each of these points or corners is occupied by a player the fifth who is called Puss stands in the centre The game now commences the players exchange corners in all directions it is the object of the one who stands out to occupy any of the corners which may remain vacant for an instant during the exchanges When he succeeds in so doing that player who is left without a corner becomes the puss It is to be observed that if A and B attempt to exchange corners and A gets to B s corner but B fails to reach A s before the player who stands out gets there it is B and not A who becomes Puss CAT AND MOUSE This is a French sport The toys with which it is played consist of two flat bits of hard wood the edges of one of which are notched The game is played by two only they are both blindfolded and tied to the ends of a long string which is fastened in the centre to a post by a loose knot so as to play easily in the evolutions made by the players The party who plays the mouse occasionally scrapes the toys together and the other who plays the cat attracted by the sound endeavours to catch him CAT AND MOUSE HUNTING The game of Hunt the Slipper used frequently to be called Cat and Mouse hunting It is generally played with a slipper shoe or even a piece of wood which was called the mouse the centre player being the cat and trying to catch or find the mouse The Boy s Own Book thus describes the game but not as Cat and Mouse Several young persons sit on the ground in a circle a slipper is given them and one who generally volunteers to accept the office in order to begin the game stands in the centre and whose business it is to chase the slipper by its sound The parties who are seated pass it round so as to prevent if possible its being found in the possession of any individual In order that the player in the centre may know where the slipper is it is occasionally tapped on the ground and then suddenly handed on to right or left When the slipper is found in the possession of any one in the circle by the player who is hunting it the party on whom it is found takes the latter player s place TIP CAT Is a game played with sticks of a certain length and a piece of wood sharpened off at each end which is called the cat A ring is made on the ground with chalk or the pointed part of the cat which is then placed in the centre One end being smartly struck by the player it springs spinning upwards as it rises it is again struck and thus knocked to a considerable distance It is played in two ways one being for the antagonist to guess how many sticks length it is off the ring which is measured and if right he goes in or he may elect to pitch the cat if possible into the ring which if he succeeds in doing he then has the pleasure of knocking the wood called the cat recklessly he knows not whither until it alights somewhere on something or some one CAT I THE HOLE M M Jamieson s Scottish Dictionary The name of a game well known in Fife and perhaps in other counties If seven boys are to play six holes are made at certain distances Each of the six stands at a hole with a short stick in his hand the seventh stands at a certain distance holding a ball When he gives the word or makes the sign agreed upon all the six must change holes each running to his neighbour s hole and putting his stick in the hole which he has newly seized In making this change the boy who has the ball tries to put it into the empty hole If he succeeds in this the boy who had not his stick for the stick is the cat in the hole for which he had run is put out and must take the ball When the Cat is in the Hole it is against the laws of the game to put the ball into it NURSERY RHYMES AND STORIES These are as plentiful as blackberries and are far too numerous to be treated of here Some are very old such as Puss in Boots Whittington and his Cat Hey diddle diddle et cetera Some have a political meaning others satirical others amusing funny or instructive while a few are unmeaning jangles Dame Trot and her Wonderful Cat The Cat and the Mouse and later The White Cat The Adventures of Miss Minette Cattina are familiar to many of the present time Of the older stories and rhymes there are enough to fill a book not of or about the cat in particular possibly but even that the old combined with those of modern date might be done and for such information and perusal the Popular Rhymes by J O Halliwell will be found very interesting space preventing the subject being amplified here Nor do they come within the scope and intention for which I have written respecting the cat FISHING CATS Having just come across a communication made to The Kelso Mail in eighteen eighty by a correspondent giving the signature of March Brown bearing on the subject to which I have already alluded Fishing Cats I deem it worthy of notice corroborating as it does the statement so often made and almost as often denied that cats are adept fishers not only for food but likewise for the sport and pleasure they so derive The writer says that for several years it has been my happy fortune to fish the lovely Tweed for salmon and trout From Tweed Well to Coldstream is a long stretch but I have fished it all and believe that though other rivers have their special advantages there is not one in Britain which offers such varied and successful angling as the grand Border stream Many have been the boatmen whom I have employed whilst fishing for salmon and all were fairly honest except in the matter of a little poaching Some had the complaint more fiercely than others and some so bad as to be incurable One of the afflicted Donald by name was an excellent boatman by day as to his nocturnal doings I deemed it best not to inquire except on those occasions when he needed a holiday to attend a summons with which the police had favoured him Now any one who has studied the proclivities of poachers knows that they have wonderful powers over all animals who depend upon them such as dogs cats ferrets tame badgers otters et cetera et cetera Donald s special favourite was a lady cat which followed him in his frequent fishings and took deep interest in the sport Near to his cottage on the river bank was a dam or weir over which the water trickled here and there a few inches deep In the evenings of spring and summer Donald was generally to be found fishing upon this favourite stretch with artificial fly for trout and being an adept in the art he seldom fished in vain Pretty puss always kept close behind him watching the trail of the mimic flies till a fish was hooked and then her eagerness and love of sport could not be controlled and so soon as the captive was in shoal water in sprang puss up to the shoulders and fixing her claws firmly in the fish brought it to the bank when with a caress from Donald she again took her place behind him till another trout was on the line and the sport was repeated In this way did puss and her master pass the evenings each proud of the other s doings and happy in their companionship Such was the affection of the cat for her master that she could not even bear to be separated from him by day Donald had charge of a ferry across the river and no sooner did a bell at the opposite side of the stream give notice that a passenger was ready to voyage across than down scampered puss to the boat and leaping in she journeyed with her master to the further side and again returned gravely watching each stroke of the oar Many a voyage did she thus daily make and I question with these luxurious boatings and the exciting fishing in the evenings if ever cat was more truly happy The love of fishing once developed itself to the disturbance of my own sport With careful prevision my boatman had in the floods of November and December secured a plentiful supply of minnows to be held in readiness till wanted in my fishings for salmon in the ensuing February and March The minnows were placed in a well two or three feet deep and the cold spring water rendered them as tough as angler could desire All went well for the first few days of the salmon fishing the minnows were deemed admirable for the purpose and the supply ample for our needs but this good fortune was not to last One morning the boatman reported a serious diminution of stock in the well and on the following day things were still worse Suspicion fell on more than one honest person and we determined to watch late and early till the real thief was discovered When the guidwife and bairns were abed the boatman kept watch from the cottage window and by the aid of a bright moon the mystery was soon solved At the well side stood puss the favourite of the household with arched back and extended paw she took her prey When an unfortunate minnow approached the surface sharp was the dash made by puss arm and shoulder were boldly immersed and straightway the victim lay gasping on the bank Fishing in this manner she soon captured half a dozen and was then driven away From that evening the well was always covered with a net which scared puss into enforced honesty By nature cats love dry warmth and sunshine whilst they hate water and cold Who has not seen the misery of a cat when compelled to step into a shallow pool and how she examines her wet paw with anxiety holding it up as something to be pitied And yet the passion of destructiveness is so strong within them as to overcome even their aversion to water The following still more extraordinary circumstance of a cat fishing in the sea appeared in The Plymouth Journal June eighteen twenty eight There is now at the battery on the Devil s Point a cat which is an expert catcher of the finny tribe being in the constant habit of diving into the sea and bringing up the fish alive in her mouth and depositing them in the guard room for the use of the soldiers She is now seven years old and has long been a useful caterer It is supposed that her pursuits of the water rats first taught her to venture into the water to which it is well known puss has a natural aversion She is as fond of the water as a Newfoundland dog and takes her regular peregrinations along the rocks at its edge looking out for her prey ready to dive for them at a moment s notice ED CATS AND HORSES From time immemorial cats have been kept in stables and when this is the case there is generally a friendly feeling between one or other of the horses and the cat or cats Such I have known with the heavy ponderous cart horse and his feline companion such was the case in my stable and so in many others Cats are as a rule fond of horses and the feeling is generally reciprocated Several of our race winners have had their favourites at home among others the well known Foxhall Many famous horses have had their stable cats and the great amiable Foxhall has adopted a couple of kittens if it would not be more correct to say that they have adopted him A pretty little white and a tabby own brothers live in Foxhall s box and when Hatcher his attendant has rubbed him over and put on his clothing he takes up the kittens from the corner of the box where they have been waiting and gently throws them on Foxhall s back They are quite accustomed to the process and catching hold soon settle down and curl themselves up into little fluffy balls much to their own satisfaction and to the good horse s likewise to judge from the way in which he turns and watches the operation In Lawrence s History of the Horse it is stated that the celebrated Arabian stallion Godolphin and a black cat were for many years the warmest friends When the horse died in seventeen fifty three the cat sat upon his carcase till it was put under ground and then crawling slowly and reluctantly away was never seen again till her dead body was found in a hay loft Stubbs painted the portraits of the Arabian and the cat There was a hunter in the King s stables at Windsor to which a cat was so attached that whenever he was in the stable the creature would never leave her usual seat on the horse s back and the horse was so well pleased with the attention that to accommodate his friend he slept as horses will sometimes do standing GRAMMER

graceful so mild and yet so majestic Ah I was a younger man then of course than I am now and possibly more impressionable but I thought her then the most perfect creature I had ever beheld And even now looking back through the gathering mists of time and the chilling frosts of advancing age and recalling what she was I endorse that earlier sentiment she lives in my memory now as she lived in my presence then as the most perfect creature I ever beheld I had gone the round of all the best boarding houses in town when at last I went to missus Honeywold s and there in her small unpretending establishment I General Leslie Auchester having been subdued I trust to a proper and humble state of mind by my past experiences agreed to take up my abode And it was there I first met her Hers was the early maturity of loveliness perfect in repose with mild thoughtful eyes intelligent and tender a trifle sad at times but lighting up with quick brilliancy as some new object met her view or some vivid thought darted its lightning flash through her brain for she was wonderfully quick of perception with an exquisite figure splendidly symmetrical yet swaying and supple as a young willow and with unstudied grace in every quick sinewy motion She spent little upon dress I was sure she was not wealthy but though there was little variety her dress was always exquisitely neat and in perfect good taste of some soft glossy fabric smooth as silk and lustrous as satin and of the softest shade of silver gray that colour so beautiful in itself and so becoming to beautiful wearers simply made but fitting with a nicety more like the work of nature than of art to every curve and outline of that full and stately figure and finished off round her white throat with something scarcely whiter She never wore ornaments of any kind no chain no brooch no ring or pin She had twins two beautiful little blue eyed things wonderfully like herself little shy graceful creatures always together always playful She never spoke of her own affairs and affable as she was and gentle in manner there was something about her which repelled intrusion When after some weeks residence there I had gained the good will of my simple minded but kindly little landlady I cautiously ventured to ask her to gratify my not I think unnatural curiosity but I found to my surprise she knew but little more than I did myself She came to me she said just at the edge of the evening one cold rainy night and I could not refuse to give her shelter at least for the night or till she could do better I did not think of her remaining but she is so pretty and gentle and innocent looking I could not turn her out of my house could I now I know I am silly in such ways but what could I do But is it possible I said that she has remained here ever since and you know nothing more about her No more than you do yourself general said missus Honeywold I do not even know where she lived before she came here I cannot question her and now indeed I have become so fond of her I should not be willing to part with her and I would not turn her and her little ones out of my house for the world Further conversation elicited the fact that she was not a boarder but that she and her little ones were the dependents upon missus Honeywold s charity One fine summer day I had made an appointment with a friend to drive out to his place in the suburbs and dine with him returning in the evening When I came down in the afternoon dressed for my excursion I went into the dining room to tell missus Honeywold she need not wait for me As I came back through the parlour she was there alone She was sitting on the sofa A book lay near her but I do not think she had been reading She was sitting perfectly still as if lost in reverie and her eyes looked heavy with sleep or thought But as I passed out of the room I looked back I saw she had risen to her feet and standing with her graceful figure drawn up to its full height she was looking after me with a look which I flattered myself was a look of interest Ah how well I remember that look The day had been a beautiful one though sultry but in the early evening we had a heavy thunder shower the violence of the summer rain delaying my return to town for an hour or two and when the rain ceased the evening was still starless cloudy and damp and as I drove back to town I remember that the night air although somewhat freshened by the rain was warm and heavy with the scent of unseen flowers It was late when I reached the quiet street where I had taken up my abode and as I mounted the steps I involuntarily felt for my latch key but to my surprise I found the hall door not only unfastened but a little way opened Why how is this missus Honeywold I said as my landlady met me in the hall Do you know that your street door was left open Yes she said quietly I know it But is it safe I asked as I turned to lock the door and so late too I do not think there is any danger she said I was on the watch I was in the hall myself waiting Not waiting for me I hope said I that was surely unnecessary No not for you she answered I presume you can take care of yourself but she added in a low voice she is out and I was waiting to let her in Out at this time of night that seems strange Where has she gone I do not know And how long has she been gone I asked as I hung up my hat I cannot tell just what time she went out she said I know she was in the garden with the little ones and came in just before tea After they had had their suppers and gone to bed I saw her in the parlour alone and when I came into the room again she was gone and she has not returned and I Oh then she went out before the rain did she Yes sir some time before the rain Oh then that explains it she was probably caught out by the rain and took shelter somewhere and has been persuaded to stay There is nothing to be alarmed at you had better not wait up another moment But I don t like to shut her out general I should not sleep a wink Nonsense nonsense I said Go to bed you silly woman you will hear her when she comes of course and can come down and let her in And so saying I retired to my own room The next morning at breakfast I noticed that my landlady was looking pale and troubled and I felt sure she had spent a sleepless night Well missus Honeywold I said with assumed cheerfulness as she handed my coffee to me how long did you have to sit up What time did she come in She did not come in all night general said my landlady in a troubled voice She has not come home yet and I am very anxious about it No need of that I trust I said reassuringly she will come this morning no doubt I don t know I wish I was sure of that I don t know what to make of it I don t understand it She never did so before How she could have stayed out and left those two blessed little things all night and she always seemed such a tender loving mother too I don t understand it When I returned at dinner time I found matters still worse She had not returned My poor landlady was almost in hysterics though she tried hard to control herself To satisfy her I set off to consult the police My mission was not encouraging They promised to do their best but gave slight hopes of a successful result So sad weary and discouraged I returned home only to learn there were no tidings of the missing one I give her up now said my weeping landlady I shall never see her again She is lost for ever and those two poor pretty little creatures By the way I said I wanted to speak to you about them If she never does return what do you purpose to do with them Keep them said the generous and impulsive little woman I wanted to say if she does not return I will if you like relieve you of one of them My sister who lives with me and keeps my house is a very kind tender hearted woman There are no children in the house and she would I am sure be very kind to the poor little thing What do you say No no sobbed the poor woman I cannot part with them I am a poor woman it is true but not too poor to give them a home and while I have a bit and a sup for myself they shall have one too Their poor mother left them here and if she ever does return she shall find them here And if she never returns then And she never did return and no tidings of her fate ever reached us If she was enticed away by artful blandishments or kidnapped by cruel violence we knew not But I honestly believe the latter Either way it was her fatal beauty that led her to destruction for as I have said before she was the most perfect creature the most beautiful Maltese cat that I ever beheld in my life I am sure she never deserted her two pretty little kittens of her own accord And if poor dumb thing she was stolen and killed for her beautiful fur still I say as I said at first she was more sinned against than sinning C H GRATTAN in Tit Bits INDEX PAGE Abyssinian cats fifty eight Angora cats twenty one Antipathy to
