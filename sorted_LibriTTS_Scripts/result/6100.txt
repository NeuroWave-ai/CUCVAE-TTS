fascinating way It was a wonderful hour I don t know her name yet but I know HER so it s all right The instrument that you play on Pollyanna will be the great heart of the world Involuntarily she turned as if to flee I m glad GLAD GLAD for everything now CHAPTER I DELLA SPEAKS HER MIND Della Wetherby tripped up the somewhat imposing steps of her sister s Commonwealth Avenue home and pressed an energetic finger against the electric bell button From the tip of her wing trimmed hat to the toe of her low heeled shoe she radiated health capability and alert decision Even her voice as she greeted the maid that opened the door vibrated with the joy of living Good morning Mary Is my sister in Y yes ma am missus Carew is in hesitated the girl but she gave orders she d see no one Did she Well I m no one smiled Miss Wetherby so she ll see me Don t worry I ll take the blame she nodded in answer to the frightened remonstrance in the girl s eyes Where is she in her sitting room Y yes ma am but that is she said Miss Wetherby however was already halfway up the broad stairway and with a despairing backward glance the maid turned away In the hall above Della Wetherby unhesitatingly walked toward a half open door and knocked Well Mary answered a dear me what now voice Haven t I Oh Della The voice grew suddenly warm with love and surprise You dear girl where did you come from Yes it s Della smiled that young woman blithely already halfway across the room I ve come from an over Sunday at the beach with two of the other nurses and I m on my way back to the Sanatorium now That is I m here now but I sha n t be long I stepped in for this she finished giving the owner of the dear me what now voice a hearty kiss missus Carew frowned and drew back a little coldly The slight touch of joy and animation that had come into her face fled leaving only a dispirited fretfulness that was plainly very much at home there Oh of course I might have known she said You never stay here Here Della Wetherby laughed merrily and threw up her hands then abruptly her voice and manner changed She regarded her sister with grave tender eyes Ruth dear I couldn t I just couldn t live in this house You know I couldn t she finished gently missus Carew stirred irritably I m sure I don t see why not she fenced Della Wetherby shook her head Yes you do dear You know I m entirely out of sympathy with it all the gloom the lack of aim the insistence on misery and bitterness But I AM miserable and bitter You ought not to be Why not What have I to make me otherwise Della Wetherby gave an impatient gesture Ruth look here she challenged You re thirty three years old You have good health or would have if you treated yourself properly and you certainly have an abundance of time and a superabundance of money Surely anybody would say you ought to find SOMETHING to do this glorious morning besides sitting moped up in this tomb like house with instructions to the maid that you ll see no one But I don t WANT to see anybody Then I d MAKE myself want to missus Carew sighed wearily and turned away her head Oh Della why won t you ever understand I m not like you I can t forget A swift pain crossed the younger woman s face You mean Jamie I suppose I don t forget that dear I couldn t of course But moping won t help us find him As if I hadn t TRIED to find him for eight long years and by something besides moping flashed missus Carew indignantly with a sob in her voice Of course you have dear soothed the other quickly and we shall keep on hunting both of us till we do find him or die But THIS sort of thing doesn t help But I don t want to do anything else murmured Ruth Carew drearily For a moment there was silence The younger woman sat regarding her sister with troubled disapproving eyes Ruth she said at last with a touch of exasperation forgive me but are you always going to be like this You re widowed I ll admit but your married life lasted only a year and your husband was much older than yourself You were little more than a child at the time and that one short year can t seem much more than a dream now Surely that ought not to embitter your whole life No oh no murmured missus Carew still drearily Then ARE you going to be always like this Well of course if I could find Jamie Yes yes I know but Ruth dear isn t there anything in the world but Jamie to make you ANY happy There doesn t seem to be that I can think of sighed missus Carew indifferently Ruth ejaculated her sister stung into something very like anger Then suddenly she laughed Oh Ruth Ruth I d like to give you a dose of Pollyanna I don t know any one who needs it more missus Carew stiffened a little Well what pollyanna may be I don t know but whatever it is I don t want it she retorted sharply nettled in her turn This isn t your beloved Sanatorium and I m not your patient to be dosed and bossed please remember Della Wetherby s eyes danced but her lips remained unsmiling Pollyanna isn t a medicine my dear she said demurely though I have heard some people call her a tonic Pollyanna is a little girl A child Well how should I know retorted the other still aggrievedly You have your belladonna so I m sure I don t see why not pollyanna Besides you re always recommending something for me to take and you distinctly said dose and dose usually means medicine of a sort Well Pollyanna IS a medicine of a sort smiled Della Anyway the Sanatorium doctors all declare that she s better than any medicine they can give She s a little girl Ruth twelve or thirteen years old who was at the Sanatorium all last summer and most of the winter I didn t see her but a month or two for she left soon after I arrived But that was long enough for me to come fully under her spell Besides the whole Sanatorium is still talking Pollyanna and playing her game GAME Yes nodded Della with a curious smile Her glad game I ll never forget my first introduction to it One feature of her treatment was particularly disagreeable and even painful It came every Tuesday morning and very soon after my arrival it fell to my lot to give it to her I was dreading it for I knew from past experience with other children what to expect fretfulness and tears if nothing worse To my unbounded amazement she greeted me with a smile and said she was glad to see me and if you ll believe it there was never so much as a whimper from her lips through the whole ordeal though I knew I was hurting her cruelly I fancy I must have said something that showed my surprise for she explained earnestly Oh yes I used to feel that way too and I did dread it so till I happened to think twas just like Nancy s wash days and I could be gladdest of all on TUESDAYS cause there wouldn t be another one for a whole week Why how extraordinary frowned missus Carew not quite comprehending But I m sure I don t see any GAME to that No I didn t till later Then she told me It seems she was the motherless daughter of a poor minister in the West and was brought up by the Ladies Aid Society and missionary barrels When she was a tiny girl she wanted a doll and confidently expected it in the next barrel but there turned out to be nothing but a pair of little crutches The child cried of course and it was then that her father taught her the game of hunting for something to be glad about in everything that happened and he said she could begin right then by being glad she didn t NEED the crutches That was the beginning Pollyanna said it was a lovely game and she d been playing it ever since and that the harder it was to find the glad part the more fun it was only when it was too AWFUL hard like she had found it sometimes Why how extraordinary murmured missus Carew still not entirely comprehending You d think so if you could see the results of that game in the Sanatorium nodded Della and doctor Ames says he hears she s revolutionized the whole town where she came from just the same way He knows doctor Chilton very well the man that married Pollyanna s aunt And by the way I believe that marriage was one of her ministrations She patched up an old lovers quarrel between them You see two years ago or more Pollyanna s father died and the little girl was sent East to this aunt In October she was hurt by an automobile and was told she could never walk again In April doctor Chilton sent her to the Sanatorium and she was there till last March almost a year She went home practically cured You should have seen the child There was just one cloud to mar her happiness that she couldn t WALK all the way there As near as I can gather the whole town turned out to meet her with brass bands and banners But you can t TELL about Pollyanna One has to SEE her And that s why I say I wish you could have a dose of Pollyanna It would do you a world of good missus Carew lifted her chin a little Really indeed I must say I beg to differ with you she returned coldly I don t care to be revolutionized and I have no lovers quarrel to be patched up and if there is ANYTHING that would be insufferable to me it would be a little Miss Prim with a long face preaching to me how much I had to be thankful for I never could bear But a ringing laugh interrupted her Oh Ruth Ruth choked her sister gleefully Miss Prim indeed POLLYANNA Oh oh if only you could see that child now But there I might have known I SAID one couldn t TELL about Pollyanna And of course you won t be apt to see her But Miss Prim indeed And off she went into another gale of laughter Almost at once however she sobered and gazed at her sister with the old troubled look in her eyes Seriously dear can t anything be done she pleaded You ought not to waste your life like this Won t you try to get out a little more and meet people Why should I when I don t want to I m tired of people You know society always bored me Then why not try some sort of work charity missus Carew gave an impatient gesture Della dear we ve been all over this before I do give money lots of it and that s enough In fact I m not sure but it s too much I don t believe in pauperizing people But if you d give a little of yourself dear ventured Della gently If you could only get interested in something outside of your own life it would help so much and Now Della dear interrupted the elder sister restively I love you and I love to have you come here but I simply cannot endure being preached to It s all very well for you to turn yourself into an angel of mercy and give cups of cold water and bandage up broken heads and all that Perhaps YOU can forget Jamie that way but I couldn t It would only make me think of him all the more wondering if HE had any one to give him water and bandage up his head Besides the whole thing would be very distasteful to me mixing with all sorts and kinds of people like that Did you ever try it Why no of course not missus Carew s voice was scornfully indignant Then how can you know till you do try asked the young nurse rising to her feet a little wearily But I must go dear I m to meet the girls at the South Station Our train goes at twelve thirty I m sorry if I ve made you cross with me she finished as she kissed her sister good by I m not cross with you Della sighed missus Carew but if you only would understand One minute later Della Wetherby made her way through the silent gloomy halls and out to the street Face step and manner were very different from what they had been when she tripped up the steps less than half an hour before All the alertness the springiness the joy of living were gone For half a block she listlessly dragged one foot after the other Then suddenly she threw back her head and drew a long breath One week in that house would kill me she shuddered I don t believe even Pollyanna herself could so much as make a dent in the gloom And the only thing she could be glad for there would be that she didn t have to stay That this avowed disbelief in Pollyanna s ability to bring about a change for the better in missus Carew s home was not Della Wetherby s real opinion however was quickly proved for no sooner had the nurse reached the Sanatorium than she learned something that sent her flying back over the fifty mile journey to Boston the very next day So exactly as before did she find circumstances at her sister s home that it seemed almost as if missus Carew had not moved since she left her Ruth she burst out eagerly after answering her sister s surprised greeting I just HAD to come and you must this once yield to me and let me have my way Listen You can have that little Pollyanna here I think if you will But I won t returned missus Carew with chilly promptness Della Wetherby did not seem to have heard She plunged on excitedly When I got back yesterday I found that doctor Ames had had a letter from doctor Chilton the one who married Pollyanna s aunt you know Well it seems in it he said he was going to Germany for the winter for a special course and was going to take his wife with him if he could persuade her that Pollyanna would be all right in some boarding school here meantime But missus Chilton didn t want to leave Pollyanna in just a school and so he was afraid she wouldn t go And now Ruth there s our chance I want YOU to take Pollyanna this winter and let her go to some school around here What an absurd idea Della As if I wanted a child here to bother with She won t bother a bit She must be nearly or quite thirteen by this time and she s the most capable little thing you ever saw I don t like capable children retorted missus Carew perversely but she laughed and because she did laugh her sister took sudden courage and redoubled her efforts Perhaps it was the suddenness of the appeal or the novelty of it Perhaps it was because the story of Pollyanna had somehow touched Ruth Carew s heart Perhaps it was only her unwillingness to refuse her sister s impassioned plea Whatever it was that finally turned the scale when Della Wetherby took her hurried leave half an hour later she carried with her Ruth Carew s promise to receive Pollyanna into her home But just remember missus Carew warned her at parting just remember that the minute that child begins to preach to me and to tell me to count my mercies back she goes to you and you may do what you please with her I sha n t keep her I ll remember but I m not worrying any nodded the younger woman in farewell To herself she whispered as she hurried away from the house Half my job is done Now for the other half to get Pollyanna to come But she s just got to come I ll write that letter so they can t help letting her come CHAPTER II SOME OLD FRIENDS In Beldingsville that August day missus Chilton waited until Pollyanna had gone to bed before she spoke to her husband about the letter that had come in the morning mail For that matter she would have had to wait anyway for crowded office hours and the doctor s two long drives over the hills had left no time for domestic conferences It was about half past nine indeed when the doctor entered his wife s sitting room His tired face lighted at sight of her but at once a perplexed questioning came to his eyes Why Polly dear what is it he asked concernedly His wife gave a rueful laugh Well it s a letter though I didn t mean you should find out by just looking at me Then you mustn t look so I can he smiled But what is it missus Chilton hesitated pursed her lips then picked up a letter near her I ll read it to you she said It s from a Miss Della Wetherby at doctor Ames Sanatorium All right Fire away directed the man throwing himself at full length on to the couch near his wife s chair But his wife did not at once fire away She got up first and covered her husband s recumbent figure with a gray worsted afghan missus Chilton s wedding day was but a year behind her She was forty two now It seemed sometimes as if into that one short year of wifehood she had tried to crowd all the loving service and babying that had been accumulating through twenty years of lovelessness and loneliness Nor did the doctor who had been forty five on his wedding day and who could remember nothing but loneliness and lovelessness on his part object in the least to this concentrated tending He acted indeed as if he quite enjoyed it though he was careful not to show it too ardently he had discovered that missus Polly had for so long been Miss Polly that she was inclined to retreat in a panic and dub her ministrations silly if they were received with too much notice and eagerness So he contented himself now with a mere pat of her hand as she gave the afghan a final smooth and settled herself to read the letter aloud My dear missus Chilton Della Wetherby had written Just six times I have commenced a letter to you and torn it up so now I have decided not to commence at all but just to tell you what I want at once I want Pollyanna May I have her I met you and your husband last March when you came on to take Pollyanna home but I presume you don t remember me I am asking doctor Ames who does know me very well to write your husband so that you may I hope not fear to trust your dear little niece to us I understand that you would go to Germany with your husband but for leaving Pollyanna and so I am making so bold as to ask you to let us take her Indeed I am begging you to let us have her dear missus Chilton And now let me tell you why My sister missus Carew is a lonely broken hearted discontented unhappy woman She lives in a world of gloom into which no sunshine penetrates Now I believe that if anything on earth can bring the sunshine into her life it is your niece Pollyanna Won t you let her try I wish I could tell you what she has done for the Sanatorium here but nobody could TELL You would have to see it I long ago discovered that you can t TELL about Pollyanna The minute you try to she sounds priggish and preachy and impossible Yet you and I know she is anything but that You just have to bring Pollyanna on to the scene and let her speak for herself And so I want to take her to my sister and let her speak for herself She would attend school of course but meanwhile I truly believe she would be healing the wound in my sister s heart I don t know how to end this letter I believe it s harder than it was to begin it I m afraid I don t want to end it at all I just want to keep talking and talking for fear if I stop it ll give you a chance to say no And so if you ARE tempted to say that dreadful word won t you please consider that that I m still talking and telling you how much we want and need Pollyanna Hopefully yours DELLA WETHERBY There ejaculated missus Chilton as she laid the letter down Did you ever read such a remarkable letter or hear of a more preposterous absurd request Well I m not so sure smiled the doctor I don t think it s absurd to want Pollyanna But but the way she puts it healing the wound in her sister s heart and all that One would think the child was some sort of of medicine The doctor laughed outright and raised his eyebrows Well I m not so sure but she is Polly I ALWAYS said I wished I could prescribe her and buy her as I would a box of pills and Charlie Ames says they always made it a point at the Sanatorium to give their patients a dose of Pollyanna as soon as possible after their arrival during the whole year she was there Dose indeed scorned missus Chilton Then you don t think you ll let her go Go Why of course not Do you think I d let that child go to perfect strangers like that and such strangers Why Thomas I should expect that that nurse would have her all bottled and labeled with full directions on the outside how to take her by the time I d got back from Germany Again the doctor threw back his head and laughed heartily but only for a moment His face changed perceptibly as he reached into his pocket for a letter I heard from doctor Ames myself this morning he said with an odd something in his voice that brought a puzzled frown to his wife s brow Suppose I read you my letter now Dear Tom he began Miss Della Wetherby has asked me to give her and her sister a character which I am very glad to do I have known the Wetherby girls from babyhood They come from a fine old family and are thoroughbred gentlewomen You need not fear on that score There were three sisters Doris Ruth and Della Doris married a man named John Kent much against the family s wishes Kent came from good stock but was not much himself I guess and was certainly a very eccentric disagreeable man to deal with He was bitterly angry at the Wetherbys attitude toward him and there was little communication between the families until the baby came The Wetherbys worshiped the little boy James Jamie as they called him Doris the mother died when the boy was four years old and the Wetherbys were making every effort to get the father to give the child entirely up to them when suddenly Kent disappeared taking the boy with him He has never been heard from since though a world wide search has been made The loss practically killed old mister and missus Wetherby They both died soon after Ruth was already married and widowed Her husband was a man named Carew very wealthy and much older than herself He lived but a year or so after marriage and left her with a young son who also died within a year From the time little Jamie disappeared Ruth and Della seemed to have but one object in life and that was to find him They have spent money like water and have all but moved heaven and earth but without avail In time Della took up nursing She is doing splendid work and has become the cheerful efficient sane woman that she was meant to be though still never forgetting her lost nephew and never leaving unfollowed any possible clew that might lead to his discovery But with missus Carew it is quite different After losing her own boy she seemed to concentrate all her thwarted mother love on her sister s son As you can imagine she was frantic when he disappeared That was eight years ago for her eight long years of misery gloom and bitterness Everything that money can buy of course is at her command but nothing pleases her nothing interests her Della feels that the time has come when she must be gotten out of herself at all hazards and Della believes that your wife s sunny little niece Pollyanna possesses the magic key that will unlock the door to a new existence for her Such being the case I hope you will see your way clear to granting her request And may I add that I too personally would appreciate the favor for Ruth Carew and her sister are very old dear friends of my wife and myself and what touches them touches us As ever yours CHARLIE The letter finished there was a long silence so long a silence that the doctor uttered a quiet Well Polly Still there was silence The doctor watching his wife s face closely saw that the usually firm lips and chin were trembling He waited then quietly until his wife spoke How soon do you think they ll expect her she asked at last In spite of himself doctor Chilton gave a slight start You mean that you WILL let her go he cried His wife turned indignantly Why Thomas Chilton what a question Do you suppose after a letter like that I could do anything BUT let her go Besides didn t doctor Ames HIMSELF ask us to Do you think after what that man has done for Pollyanna that I d refuse him ANYTHING no matter what it was Dear dear I hope now that the doctor won t take it into his head to ask for for YOU my love murmured the husband of a year with a whimsical smile But his wife only gave him a deservedly scornful glance and said You may write doctor Ames that we ll send Pollyanna and ask him to tell Miss Wetherby to give us full instructions It must be sometime before the tenth of next month of course for you sail then and I want to see the child properly established myself before I leave naturally When will you tell Pollyanna To morrow probably What will you tell her I don t know exactly but not any more than I can t help certainly Whatever happens Thomas we don t want to spoil Pollyanna and no child could help being spoiled if she once got it into her head that she was a sort of of Of medicine bottle with a label of full instructions for taking interpolated the doctor with a smile Yes sighed missus Chilton It s her unconsciousness that saves the whole thing YOU know that dear Yes I know nodded the man She knows of course that you and I and half the town are playing the game with her and that we we are wonderfully happier because we ARE playing it missus Chilton s voice shook a little then went on more steadily But if consciously she should begin to be anything but her own natural sunny happy little self playing the game that her father taught her she would be just what that nurse said she sounded like impossible So whatever I tell her I sha n t tell her that she s going down to missus Carew s to cheer her up concluded missus Chilton rising to her feet with decision and putting away her work Which is where I think you re wise approved the doctor Pollyanna was told the next day and this was the manner of it My dear began her aunt when the two were alone together that morning how would you like to spend next winter in Boston With you No I have decided to go with your uncle to Germany But missus Carew a dear friend of doctor Ames has asked you to come and stay with her for the winter and I think I shall let you go Pollyanna s face fell But in Boston I won t have Jimmy or mister Pendleton or missus Snow or anybody that I know Aunt Polly No dear but you didn t have them when you came here till you found them Pollyanna gave a sudden smile Why Aunt Polly so I didn t And that means that down to Boston there are some Jimmys and mister Pendletons and missus Snows waiting for me that I don t know doesn t it Yes dear Then I can be glad of that I believe now Aunt Polly you know how to play the game better than I do I never thought of the folks down there waiting for me to know them And there s such a lot of em too I saw some of them when I was there two years ago with missus Gray We were there two whole hours you know on my way here from out West There was a man in the station a perfectly lovely man who told me where to get a drink of water Do you suppose he s there now I d like to know him And there was a nice lady with a little girl They live in Boston They said they did The little girl s name was Susie Smith Perhaps I could get to know them Do you suppose I could And there was a boy and another lady with a baby only they lived in Honolulu so probably I couldn t find them there now But there d be missus Carew anyway Who is missus Carew Aunt Polly Is she a relation Dear me Pollyanna exclaimed missus Chilton half laughingly half despairingly How do you expect anybody to keep up with your tongue much less your thoughts when they skip to Honolulu and back again in two seconds No missus Carew isn t any relation to us She s Miss Della Wetherby s sister Do you remember Miss Wetherby at the Sanatorium Pollyanna clapped her hands HER sister Miss Wetherby s sister Oh then she ll be lovely I know Miss Wetherby was I loved Miss Wetherby She had little smile wrinkles all around her eyes and mouth and she knew the NICEST stories I only had her two months though because she only got there a little while before I came away At first I was sorry that I hadn t had her ALL the time but afterwards I was glad for you see if I HAD had her all the time it would have been harder to say good by than twas when I d only had her a little while And now it ll seem as if I had her again cause I m going to have her sister missus Chilton drew in her breath and bit her lip But Pollyanna dear you must not expect that they ll be quite alike she ventured Why they re SISTERS Aunt Polly argued the little girl her eyes widening and I thought sisters were always alike We had two sets of em in the Ladies Aiders One set was twins and THEY were so alike you couldn t tell which was missus Peck and which was missus Jones until a wart grew on missus Jones s nose then of course we could because we looked for the wart the first thing And that s what I told her one day when she was complaining that people called her missus Peck and I said if they d only look for the wart as I did they d know right off But she acted real cross I mean displeased and I m afraid she didn t like it though I don t see why for I should have thought she d been glad there was something they could be told apart by specially as she was the president and didn t like it when folks didn t ACT as if she was the president best seats and introductions and special attentions at church suppers you know But she didn t and afterwards I heard missus White tell missus Rawson that missus Jones had done everything she could think of to get rid of that wart even to trying to put salt on a bird s tail But I don t see how THAT could do any good Aunt Polly DOES putting salt on a bird s tail help the warts on people s noses Of course not child How you do run on Pollyanna especially if you get started on those Ladies Aiders Do I Aunt Polly asked the little girl ruefully And does it plague you I don t mean to plague you honestly Aunt Polly And anyway if I do plague you about those Ladies Aiders you can be kind o glad for if I m thinking of the Aiders I m sure to be thinking how glad I am that I don t belong to them any longer but have got an aunt all my own You can be glad of that can t you Aunt Polly Yes yes dear of course I can of course I can laughed missus Chilton rising to leave the room and feeling suddenly very guilty that she was conscious sometimes of a little of her old irritation against Pollyanna s perpetual gladness During the next few days while letters concerning Pollyanna s winter stay in Boston were flying back and forth Pollyanna herself was preparing for that stay by a series of farewell visits to her Beldingsville friends Everybody in the little Vermont village knew Pollyanna now and almost everybody was playing the game with her The few who were not were not refraining because of ignorance of what the glad game was So to one house after another Pollyanna carried the news now that she was going down to Boston to spend the winter and loudly rose the clamor of regret and remonstrance all the way from Nancy in Aunt Polly s own kitchen to the great house on the hill where lived John Pendleton Nancy did not hesitate to say to every one except her mistress that SHE considered this Boston trip all foolishness and that for her part she would have been glad to take Miss Pollyanna home with her to the Corners she would she would and then missus Polly could have gone to Germany all she wanted to On the hill John Pendleton said practically the same thing only he did not hesitate to say it to missus Chilton herself As for Jimmy the twelve year old boy whom John Pendleton had taken into his home because Pollyanna wanted him to and whom he had now adopted because he wanted to himself as for Jimmy Jimmy was indignant and he was not slow to show it But you ve just come he reproached Pollyanna in the tone of voice a small boy is apt to use when he wants to hide the fact that he has a heart Why I ve been here ever since the last of March Besides it isn t as if I was going to stay It s only for this winter I don t care You ve just been away for a whole year most and if I d s posed you was going away again right off the first thing I wouldn t have helped one mite to meet you with flags and bands and things that day you come from the Sanatorium Why Jimmy Bean ejaculated Pollyanna in amazed disapproval Then with a touch of superiority born of hurt pride she observed I m sure I didn t ASK you to meet me with bands and things and you made two mistakes in that sentence You shouldn t say you was and I think you come is wrong It doesn t sound right anyway Well who cares if I did Pollyanna s eyes grew still more disapproving You SAID you did when you asked me this summer to tell you when you said things wrong because mister Pendleton was trying to make you talk right Well if you d been brought up in a sylum without any folks that cared instead of by a whole lot of old women who didn t have anything to do but tell you how to talk right maybe you d say you was and a whole lot more worse things Pollyanna Whittier Why Jimmy Bean flared Pollyanna My Ladies Aiders weren t old women that is not many of them so very old she corrected hastily her usual proclivity for truth and literalness superseding her anger and Well I m not Jimmy Bean either interrupted the boy uptilting his chin You re not Why Jimmy Be What do you mean demanded the little girl I ve been adopted LEGALLY He s been intending to do it all along he says only he didn t get to it Now he s done it I m to be called Jimmy Pendleton and I m to call him Uncle John only I ain t are not I mean I AM not used to it yet so I hain t haven t begun to call him that much The boy still spoke crossly aggrievedly but every trace of displeasure had fled from the little girl s face at his words She clapped her hands joyfully Oh how splendid Now you ve really got FOLKS folks that care you know And you won t ever have to explain that he wasn t BORN your folks cause your name s the same now I m so glad GLAD GLAD The boy got up suddenly from the stone wall where they had been sitting and walked off His cheeks felt hot and his eyes smarted with tears It was to Pollyanna that he owed it all this great good that had come to him and he knew it And it was to Pollyanna that he had just now been saying He kicked a small stone fiercely then another and another He thought those hot tears in his eyes were going to spill over and roll down his cheeks in spite of himself He kicked another stone then another then he picked up a third stone and threw it with all his might A minute later he strolled back to Pollyanna still sitting on the stone wall I bet you I can hit that pine tree down there before you can he challenged airily Bet you can t cried Pollyanna scrambling down from her perch The race was not run after all for Pollyanna remembered just in time that running fast was yet one of the forbidden luxuries for her But so far as Jimmy was concerned it did not matter His cheeks were no longer hot his eyes were not threatening to overflow with tears Jimmy was himself again CHAPTER III A DOSE OF POLLYANNA As the eighth of September approached the day Pollyanna was to arrive missus Ruth Carew became more and more nervously exasperated with herself She declared that she had regretted just ONCE her promise to take the child and that was ever since she had given it Before twenty four hours had passed she had indeed written to her sister demanding that she be released from the agreement but Della had answered that it was quite too late as already both she and doctor Ames had written the Chiltons Soon after that had come Della s letter saying that missus Chilton had given her consent and would in a few days come to Boston to make arrangements as to school and the like So there was nothing to be done naturally but to let matters take their course missus Carew realized that and submitted to the inevitable but with poor grace True she tried to be decently civil when Della and missus Chilton made their expected appearance but she was very glad that limited time made missus Chilton s stay of very short duration and full to the brim of business It was well indeed perhaps that Pollyanna s arrival was to be at a date no later than the eighth for time instead of reconciling missus Carew to the prospective new member of her household was filling her with angry impatience at what she was pleased to call her absurd yielding to Della s crazy scheme Nor was Della herself in the least unaware of her sister s state of mind If outwardly she maintained a bold front inwardly she was very fearful as to results but on Pollyanna she was pinning her faith and because she did pin her faith on Pollyanna she determined on the bold stroke of leaving the little girl to begin her fight entirely unaided and alone She contrived therefore that missus Carew should meet them at the station upon their arrival then as soon as greetings and introductions were over she hurriedly pleaded a previous engagement and took herself off missus Carew therefore had scarcely time to look at her new charge before she found herself alone with the child Oh but Della Della you mustn t I can t she called agitatedly after the retreating figure of the nurse But Della if she heard did not heed and plainly annoyed and vexed missus Carew turned back to the child at her side What a shame She didn t hear did she Pollyanna was saying her eyes also wistfully following the nurse And I didn t WANT her to go now a bit But then I ve got you haven t I I can be glad for that Oh yes you ve got me and I ve got you returned the lady not very graciously Come we go this way she directed with a motion toward the right Obediently Pollyanna turned and trotted at missus Carew s side through the huge station but she looked up once or twice rather anxiously into the lady s unsmiling face At last she spoke hesitatingly I expect maybe you thought I d be pretty she hazarded in a troubled voice P pretty repeated missus Carew Yes with curls you know and all that And of course you did wonder how I DID look just as I did you Only I KNEW you d be pretty and nice on account of your sister I had her to go by and you didn t have anybody And of course I m not pretty on account of the freckles and it ISN T nice when you ve been expecting a PRETTY little girl to have one come like me and Nonsense child interrupted missus Carew a trifle sharply Come we ll see to your trunk now then we ll go home I had hoped that my sister would come with us but it seems she didn t see fit even for this one night Pollyanna smiled and nodded I know but she couldn t probably Somebody wanted her I expect Somebody was always wanting her at the Sanatorium It s a bother of course when folks do want you all the time isn t it cause you can t have yourself when you want yourself lots of times Still you can be kind of glad for that for it IS nice to be wanted isn t it There was no reply perhaps because for the first time in her life missus Carew was wondering if anywhere in the world there was any one who really wanted her not that she WISHED to be wanted of course she told herself angrily pulling herself up with a jerk and frowning down at the child by her side Pollyanna did not see the frown Pollyanna s eyes were on the hurrying throngs about them My what a lot of people she was saying happily There s even more of them than there was the other time I was here but I haven t seen anybody yet that I saw then though I ve looked for them everywhere Of course the lady and the little baby lived in Honolulu so probably THEY WOULDN T be here but there was a little girl Susie Smith she lived right here in Boston Maybe you know her though Do you know Susie Smith No I don t know Susie Smith replied missus Carew dryly Don t you She s awfully nice and SHE S pretty black curls you know the kind I m going to have when I go to Heaven But never mind maybe I can find her for you so you WILL know her Oh my what a perfectly lovely automobile And are we going to ride in it broke off Pollyanna as they came to a pause before a handsome limousine the door of which a liveried chauffeur was holding open Illustration Oh my What a perfectly lovely automobile The chauffeur tried to hide a smile and failed missus Carew however answered with the weariness of one to whom rides are never anything but a means of locomotion from one tiresome place to another probably quite as tiresome Yes we re going to ride in it Then Home Perkins she added to the deferential chauffeur Oh my is it yours asked Pollyanna detecting the unmistakable air of ownership in her hostess s manner How perfectly lovely Then you must be rich awfully I mean EXCEEDINGLY rich more than the kind that just has carpets in every room and ice cream Sundays like the Whites one of my Ladies Aiders you know That is SHE was a Ladies Aider I used to think THEY were rich but I know now that being really rich means you ve got diamond rings and hired girls and sealskin coats and dresses made of silk and velvet for every day and an automobile Have you got all those Why y yes I suppose I have admitted missus Carew with a faint smile Then you are rich of course nodded Pollyanna wisely My Aunt Polly has them too only her automobile is a horse My but don t I just love to ride in these things exulted Pollyanna with a happy little bounce You see I never did before except the one that ran over me They put me IN that one after they d got me out from under it but of course I didn t know about it so I couldn t enjoy it Since then I haven t been in one at all Aunt Polly doesn t like them Uncle Tom does though and he wants one He says he s got to have one in his business He s a doctor you know and all the other doctors in town have got them now I don t know how it will come out Aunt Polly is all stirred up over it You see she wants Uncle Tom to have what he wants only she wants him to want what she wants him to want See missus Carew laughed suddenly Yes my dear I think I see she answered demurely though her eyes still carried for them a most unusual twinkle All right sighed Pollyanna contentedly I thought you would still it did sound sort of mixed when I said it Oh Aunt Polly says she wouldn t mind having an automobile so much if she could have the only one there was in the world so there wouldn t be any one else to run into her but My what a lot of houses broke off Pollyanna looking about her with round eyes of wonder Don t they ever stop Still there d have to be a lot of them for all those folks to live in of course that I saw at the station besides all these here on the streets And of course where there ARE more folks there are more to know I love folks Don t you LOVE FOLKS Yes just folks I mean Anybody everybody Well no Pollyanna I can t say that I do replied missus Carew coldly her brows contracted missus Carew s eyes had lost their twinkle They were turned rather mistrustfully indeed on Pollyanna To herself missus Carew was saying Now for preachment number one I suppose on my duty to mix with my fellow men a la Sister Della Don t you Oh I do sighed Pollyanna They re all so nice and so different you know And down here there must be such a lot of them to be nice and different Oh you don t know how glad I am so soon that I came I knew I would be anyway just as soon as I found out you were YOU that is Miss Wetherby s sister I mean I love Miss Wetherby so I knew I should you too for of course you d be alike sisters so even if you weren t twins like missus Jones and missus Peck and they weren t quite alike anyway on account of the wart But I reckon you don t know what I mean so I ll tell you And thus it happened that missus Carew who had been steeling herself for a preachment on social ethics found herself much to her surprise and a little to her discomfiture listening to the story of a wart on the nose of one missus Peck Ladies Aider By the time the story was finished the limousine had turned into Commonwealth Avenue and Pollyanna immediately began to exclaim at the beauty of a street which had such a lovely big long yard all the way up and down through the middle of it and which was all the nicer she said after all those little narrow streets Only I should think every one would want to live on it she commented enthusiastically Very likely but that would hardly be possible retorted missus Carew with uplifted eyebrows Pollyanna mistaking the expression on her face for one of dissatisfaction that her own home was not on the beautiful Avenue hastened to make amends Why no of course not she agreed And I didn t mean that the narrower streets weren t just as nice she hurried on and even better maybe because you could be glad you didn t have to go so far when you wanted to run across the way to borrow eggs or soda and Oh but DO you live here she interrupted herself as the car came to a stop before the imposing Carew doorway Do you live here missus Carew Why yes of course I live here returned the lady with just a touch of irritation Oh how glad GLAD you must be to live in such a perfectly lovely place exulted the little girl springing to the sidewalk and looking eagerly about her Aren t you glad missus Carew did not reply With unsmiling lips and frowning brow she was stepping from the limousine For the second time in five minutes Pollyanna hastened to make amends Of course I don t mean the kind of glad that s sinfully proud she explained searching missus Carew s face with anxious eyes Maybe you thought I did same as Aunt Polly used to sometimes I don t mean the kind that s glad because you ve got something somebody else can t have but the kind that just just makes you want to shout and yell and bang doors you know even if it isn t proper she finished dancing up and down on her toes The chauffeur turned his back precipitately and busied himself with the car missus Carew still with unsmiling lips and frowning brow led the way up the broad stone steps Come Pollyanna was all she said crisply It was five days later that Della Wetherby received the letter from her sister and very eagerly she tore it open It was the first that had come since Pollyanna s arrival in Boston My dear Sister missus Carew had written For pity s sake Della why didn t you give me some sort of an idea what to expect from this child you have insisted upon my taking I m nearly wild and I simply can t send her away I ve tried to three times but every time before I get the words out of my mouth she stops them by telling me what a perfectly lovely time she is having and how glad she is to be here and how good I am to let her live with me while her Aunt Polly has gone to Germany Now how pray in the face of that can I turn around and say Well won t you please go home I don t want you And the absurd part of it is I don t believe it has ever entered her head that I don t WANT her here and I can t seem to make it enter her head either Of course if she begins to preach and to tell me to count my blessings I SHALL send her away You know I told you to begin with that I wouldn t permit that And I won t Two or three times I have thought she was going to preach I mean but so far she has always ended up with some ridiculous story about those Ladies Aiders of hers so the sermon gets sidetracked luckily for her if she wants to stay But really Della she is impossible Listen In the first place she is wild with delight over the house The very first day she got here she begged me to open every room and she was not satisfied until every shade in the house was up so that she might see all the perfectly lovely things which she declared were even nicer than mister John Pendleton s whoever he may be somebody in Beldingsville I believe Anyhow he isn t a Ladies Aider I ve found out that much Then as if it wasn t enough to keep me running from room to room as if I were the guide on a personally conducted what did she do but discover a white satin evening gown that I hadn t worn for years and beseech me to put it on And I did put it on why I can t imagine only that I found myself utterly helpless in her hands But that was only the beginning She begged then to see everything that I had and she was so perfectly funny in her stories of the missionary barrels which she used to dress out of that I had to laugh though I almost cried too to think of the wretched things that poor child had to wear Of course gowns led to jewels and she made such a fuss over my two or three rings that I foolishly opened the safe just to see her eyes pop out And Della I thought that child would go crazy She put on to me every ring brooch bracelet and necklace that I owned and insisted on fastening both diamond tiaras in my hair when she found out what they were until there I sat hung with pearls and diamonds and emeralds and feeling like a heathen goddess in a Hindu temple especially when that preposterous child began to dance round and round me clapping her hands and chanting Oh how perfectly lovely how perfectly lovely How I would love to hang you on a string in the window you d make such a beautiful prism I was just going to ask her what on earth she meant by that when down she dropped in the middle of the floor and began to cry And what do you suppose she was crying for Because she was so glad she d got eyes that could see Now what do you think of that Of course this isn t all It s only the beginning Pollyanna has been here four days and she s filled every one of them full She already numbers among her friends the ash man the policeman on the beat and the paper boy to say nothing of every servant in my employ They seem actually bewitched with her every one of them But please do not think I am for I m not I would send the child back to you at once if I didn t feel obliged to fulfil my promise to keep her this winter As for her making me forget Jamie and my great sorrow that is impossible She only makes me feel my loss all the more keenly because I have her instead of him But as I said I shall keep her until she begins to preach Then back she goes to you But she hasn t preached yet Lovingly but distractedly yours RUTH Hasn t preached yet indeed chuckled Della Wetherby to herself folding up the closely written sheets of her sister s letter Oh Ruth Ruth and yet you admit that you ve opened every room raised every shade decked yourself in satin and jewels and Pollyanna hasn t been there a week yet But she hasn t preached oh no she hasn t preached CHAPTER IV THE GAME AND missus CAREW Boston to Pollyanna was a new experience and certainly Pollyanna to Boston such part of it as was privileged to know her was very much of a new experience Pollyanna said she liked Boston but that she did wish it was not quite so big You see she explained earnestly to missus Carew the day following her arrival I want to see and know it ALL and I can t It s just like Aunt Polly s company dinners there s so much to eat I mean to see that you don t eat I mean see anything because you re always trying to decide what to eat I mean to see Of course you can be glad there IS such a lot resumed Pollyanna after taking breath cause a whole lot of anything is nice that is GOOD things not such things as medicine and funerals of course but at the same time I couldn t used to help wishing Aunt Polly s company dinners could be spread out a little over the days when there wasn t any cake and pie and I feel the same way about Boston I wish I could take part of it home with me up to Beldingsville so I d have SOMETHING new next summer But of course I can t Cities aren t like frosted cake and anyhow even the cake didn t keep very well I tried it and it dried up specially the frosting I reckon the time to take frosting and good times is while they are going so I want to see all I can now while I m here Pollyanna unlike the people who think that to see the world one must begin at the most distant point began her seeing Boston by a thorough exploration of her immediate surroundings the beautiful Commonwealth Avenue residence which was now her home This with her school work fully occupied her time and attention for some days There was so much to see and so much to learn and everything was so marvelous and so beautiful from the tiny buttons in the wall that flooded the rooms with light to the great silent ballroom hung with mirrors and pictures There were so many delightful people to know too for besides missus Carew herself there were Mary who dusted the drawing rooms answered the bell and accompanied Pollyanna to and from school each day Bridget who lived in the kitchen and cooked Jennie who waited at table and Perkins who drove the automobile And they were all so delightful yet so different Pollyanna had arrived on a Monday so it was almost a week before the first Sunday She came downstairs that morning with a beaming countenance I love Sundays she sighed happily Do you missus Carew s voice had the weariness of one who loves no day Yes on account of church you know and Sunday school Which do you like best church or Sunday school Well really I began missus Carew who seldom went to church and never went to Sunday school Tis hard to tell isn t it interposed Pollyanna with luminous but serious eyes But you see I like church best on account of father You know he was a minister and of course he s really up in Heaven with mother and the rest of us but I try to imagine him down here lots of times and it s easiest in church when the minister is talking I shut my eyes and imagine it s father up there and it helps lots I m so glad we can imagine things aren t you I m not so sure of that Pollyanna Oh but just think how much nicer our IMAGINED things are than our really truly ones that is of course yours aren t because your REAL ones are so nice missus Carew angrily started to speak but Pollyanna was hurrying on And of course MY real ones are ever so much nicer than they used to be But all that time I was hurt when my legs didn t go I just had to keep imagining all the time just as hard as I could And of course now there are lots of times when I do it like about father and all that And so to day I m just going to imagine it s father up there in the pulpit What time do we go GO To church I mean But Pollyanna I don t that is I d rather not missus Carew cleared her throat and tried again to say that she was not going to church at all that she almost never went But with Pollyanna s confident little face and happy eyes before her she could not do it Why I suppose about quarter past ten if we walk she said then almost crossly It s only a little way Thus it happened that missus Carew on that bright September morning occupied for the first time in months the Carew pew in the very fashionable and elegant church to which she had gone as a girl and which she still supported liberally so far as money went To Pollyanna that Sunday morning service was a great wonder and joy The marvelous music of the vested choir the opalescent rays from the jeweled windows the impassioned voice of the preacher and the reverent hush of the worshiping throng filled her with an ecstasy that left her for a time almost speechless Not until they were nearly home did she fervently breathe Oh missus Carew I ve just been thinking how glad I am we don t have to live but just one day at a time missus Carew frowned and looked down sharply missus Carew was in no mood for preaching She had just been obliged to endure it from the pulpit she told herself angrily and she would NOT listen to it from this chit of a child Moreover this living one day at a time theory was a particularly pet doctrine of Della s Was not Della always saying But you only have to live one minute at a time Ruth and any one can endure anything for one minute at a time Well said missus Carew now tersely Yes Only think what I d do if I had to live yesterday and to day and to morrow all at once sighed Pollyanna Such a lot of perfectly lovely things you know But I ve had yesterday and now I m living to day and I ve got to morrow still coming and next Sunday too Honestly missus Carew if it wasn t Sunday now and on this nice quiet street I should just dance and shout and yell I couldn t help it But it s being Sunday so I shall have to wait till I get home and then take a hymn the most rejoicingest hymn I can think of What is the most rejoicingest hymn Do you know missus Carew No I can t say that I do answered missus Carew faintly looking very much as if she were searching for something she had lost For a woman who expects because things are so bad to be told that she need stand only one day at a time it is disarming to say the least to be told that because things are so good it is lucky she does not HAVE to stand but one day at a time On Monday the next morning Pollyanna went to school for the first time alone She knew the way perfectly now and it was only a short walk Pollyanna enjoyed her school very much It was a small private school for girls and was quite a new experience in its way but Pollyanna liked new experiences missus Carew however did not like new experiences and she was having a good many of them these days For one who is tired of everything to be in so intimate a companionship with one to whom everything is a fresh and fascinating joy must needs result in annoyance to say the least And missus Carew was more than annoyed She was exasperated Yet to herself she was forced to admit that if any one asked her why she was exasperated the only reason she could give would be Because Pollyanna is so glad and even missus Carew would hardly like to give an answer like that To Della however missus Carew did write that the word glad had got on her nerves and that sometimes she wished she might never hear it again She still admitted that Pollyanna had not preached that she had not even once tried to make her play the game What the child did do however was invariably to take missus Carew s gladness as a matter of course which to one who HAD no gladness was most provoking It was during the second week of Pollyanna s stay that missus Carew s annoyance overflowed into irritable remonstrance The immediate cause thereof was Pollyanna s glowing conclusion to a story about one of her Ladies Aiders She was playing the game missus Carew But maybe you don t know what the game is I ll tell you It s a lovely game But missus Carew held up her hand Never mind Pollyanna she demurred I know all about the game My sister told me and and I must say that I I should not care for it Why of course not missus Carew exclaimed Pollyanna in quick apology I didn t mean the game for you You couldn t play it of course I COULDN T play it ejaculated missus Carew who though she WOULD not play this silly game was in no mood to be told that she COULD not Why no don t you see laughed Pollyanna gleefully The game is to find something in everything to be glad about and you couldn t even begin to hunt for there isn t anything about you but what you COULD be glad about There wouldn t BE any game to it for you Don t you see missus Carew flushed angrily In her annoyance she said more than perhaps she meant to say Well no Pollyanna I can t say that I do she differed coldly As it happens you see I can find nothing whatever to be glad for For a moment Pollyanna stared blankly Then she fell back in amazement Why missus CAREW she breathed Well what is there for me challenged the woman forgetting all about for the moment that she was never going to allow Pollyanna to preach Why there s there s everything murmured Pollyanna still with that dazed unbelief There there s this beautiful house It s just a place to eat and sleep and I don t want to eat and sleep But there are all these perfectly lovely things faltered Pollyanna I m tired of them And your automobile that will take you anywhere I don t want to go anywhere Pollyanna quite gasped aloud But think of the people and things you could see missus Carew They would not interest me Pollyanna Once again Pollyanna stared in amazement The troubled frown on her face deepened But missus Carew I don t see she urged Always before there have been BAD things for folks to play the game on and the badder they are the more fun tis to get them out find the things to be glad for I mean But where there AREN T any bad things I shouldn t know how to play the game myself 
188_141613_000035_000000	train-clean-360	There was no answer 
none	none	for a time missus Carew sat with her eyes out the window Gradually the angry rebellion on her face changed to a look of hopeless sadness Very slowly then she turned and said Pollyanna I had thought I wouldn t tell you this but I ve decided that I will I m going to tell you why nothing that I have can make me glad And she began the story of Jamie the little four year old boy who eight long years before had stepped as into another world leaving the door fast shut between And you ve never seen him since anywhere faltered Pollyanna with tear wet eyes when the story was done Never But we ll find him missus Carew I m sure we ll find him missus Carew shook her head sadly But I can t I ve looked everywhere even in foreign lands But he must be somewhere He may be dead Pollyanna Pollyanna gave a quick cry Oh no missus Carew Please don t say that Let s imagine he s alive We CAN do that and that ll help and when we get him IMAGINED alive we can just as well imagine we re going to find him And that ll help a whole lot more But I m afraid he s dead Pollyanna choked missus Carew You don t know it for sure do you besought the little girl anxiously N no Well then you re just imagining it maintained Pollyanna in triumph And if you can imagine him dead you can just as well imagine him alive and it ll be a whole lot nicer while you re doing it Don t you see And some day I m just sure you ll find him Why missus Carew you CAN play the game now You can play it on Jamie You can be glad every day for every day brings you just one day nearer to the time when you re going to find him See But missus Carew did not see She rose drearily to her feet and said No no child You don t understand you don t understand Now run away please and read or do anything you like My head aches I m going to lie down And Pollyanna with a troubled sober face slowly left the room CHAPTER V POLLYANNA TAKES A WALK It was on the second Saturday afternoon that Pollyanna took her memorable walk Heretofore Pollyanna had not walked out alone except to go to and from school That she would ever attempt to explore Boston streets by herself never occurred to missus Carew hence she naturally had never forbidden it In Beldingsville however Pollyanna had found especially at the first her chief diversion in strolling about the rambling old village streets in search of new friends and new adventures On this particular Saturday afternoon missus Carew had said as she often did say There there child run away please do Go where you like and do what you like only don t please ask me any more questions to day Until now left to herself Pollyanna had always found plenty to interest her within the four walls of the house for if inanimate things failed there were yet Mary Jennie Bridget and Perkins To day however Mary had a headache Jennie was trimming a new hat Bridget was making apple pies and Perkins was nowhere to be found Moreover it was a particularly beautiful September day and nothing within the house was so alluring as the bright sunlight and balmy air outside So outside Pollyanna went and dropped herself down on the steps For some time she watched in silence the well dressed men women and children who walked briskly by the house or else sauntered more leisurely through the parkway that extended up and down the middle of the Avenue Then she got to her feet skipped down the steps and stood looking first to the right then to the left Pollyanna had decided that she too would take a walk It was a beautiful day for a walk and not once yet had she taken one at all not a REAL walk Just going to and from school did not count So she would take one to day missus Carew would not mind Had she not told her to do just what she pleased so long as she asked no more questions And there was the whole long afternoon before her Only think what a lot one might see in a whole long afternoon And it really was such a beautiful day She would go this way And with a little whirl and skip of pure joy Pollyanna turned and walked blithely down the Avenue Into the eyes of those she met Pollyanna smiled joyously She was disappointed but not surprised that she received no answering smile in return She was used to that now in Boston She still smiled however hopefully there might be some one sometime who would smile back missus Carew s home was very near the beginning of Commonwealth Avenue so it was not long before Pollyanna found herself at the edge of a street crossing her way at right angles Across the street in all its autumn glory lay what to Pollyanna was the most beautiful yard she had ever seen the Boston Public Garden For a moment Pollyanna hesitated her eyes longingly fixed on the wealth of beauty before her That it was the private grounds of some rich man or woman she did not for a moment doubt Once with doctor Ames at the Sanatorium she had been taken to call on a lady who lived in a beautiful house surrounded by just such walks and trees and flower beds as these Pollyanna wanted now very much to cross the street and walk in those grounds but she doubted if she had the right To be sure others were there moving about she could see but they might be invited guests of course After she had seen two women one man and a little girl unhesitatingly enter the gate and walk briskly down the path however Pollyanna concluded that she too might go Watching her chance she skipped nimbly across the street and entered the Garden It was even more beautiful close at hand than it had been at a distance Birds twittered over her head and a squirrel leaped across the path ahead of her On benches here and there sat men women and children Through the trees flashed the sparkle of the sun on water and from somewhere came the shouts of children and the sound of music Once again Pollyanna hesitated then a little timidly she accosted a handsomely dressed young woman coming toward her Please is this a party she asked The young woman stared A party she repeated dazedly Yes m I mean is it all right for me to be here For you to be here Why of course It s for for everybody exclaimed the young woman Oh that s all right then I m glad I came beamed Pollyanna The young woman said nothing but she turned back and looked at Pollyanna still dazedly as she hurried away Pollyanna not at all surprised that the owner of this beautiful place should be so generous as to give a party to everybody continued on her way At the turn of the path she came upon a small girl and a doll carriage She stopped with a glad little cry but she had not said a dozen words before from somewhere came a young woman with hurrying steps and a disapproving voice a young woman who held out her hand to the small girl and said sharply Here Gladys Gladys come away with me Hasn t mama told you not to talk to strange children But I m not strange children explained Pollyanna in eager defense I live right here in Boston now and But the young woman and the little girl dragging the doll carriage were already far down the path and with a half stifled sigh Pollyanna fell back For a moment she stood silent plainly disappointed then resolutely she lifted her chin and went forward Well anyhow I can be glad for that she nodded to herself for now maybe I ll find somebody even nicer Susie Smith perhaps or even missus Carew s Jamie Anyhow I can IMAGINE I m going to find them and if I don t find THEM I can find SOMEBODY she finished her wistful eyes on the self absorbed people all about her Undeniably Pollyanna was lonesome Brought up by her father and the Ladies Aid Society in a small Western town she had counted every house in the village her home and every man woman and child her friend Coming to her aunt in Vermont at eleven years of age she had promptly assumed that conditions would differ only in that the homes and the friends would be new and therefore even more delightful possibly for they would be different and Pollyanna did so love different things and people Her first and always her supreme delight in Beldingsville therefore had been her long rambles about the town and the charming visits with the new friends she had made Quite naturally in consequence Boston as she first saw it seemed to Pollyanna even more delightfully promising in its possibilities Thus far however Pollyanna had to admit that in one respect at least it had been disappointing she had been here nearly two weeks and she did not yet know the people who lived across the street or even next door More inexplicable still missus Carew herself did not know many of them and not any of them well She seemed indeed utterly indifferent to her neighbors which was most amazing from Pollyanna s point of view but nothing she could say appeared to change missus Carew s attitude in the matter at all They do not interest me Pollyanna was all she would say and with this Pollyanna whom they did interest very much was forced to be content To day on her walk however Pollyanna had started out with high hopes yet thus far she seemed destined to be disappointed Here all about her were people who were doubtless most delightful if she only knew them But she did not know them Worse yet there seemed to be no prospect that she would know them for they did not apparently wish to know her Pollyanna was still smarting under the nurse s sharp warning concerning strange children Well I reckon I ll just have to show em that I m not strange children she said at last to herself moving confidently forward again Pursuant of this idea Pollyanna smiled sweetly into the eyes of the next person she met and said blithely It s a nice day isn t it Er what Oh y yes it is murmured the lady addressed as she hastened on a little faster Twice again Pollyanna tried the same experiment but with like disappointing results Soon she came upon the little pond that she had seen sparkling in the sunlight through the trees It was a beautiful pond and on it were several pretty little boats full of laughing children As she watched them Pollyanna felt more and more dissatisfied to remain by herself It was then that spying a man sitting alone not far away she advanced slowly toward him and sat down on the other end of the bench Once Pollyanna would have danced unhesitatingly to the man s side and suggested acquaintanceship with a cheery confidence that had no doubt of a welcome but recent rebuffs had filled her with unaccustomed diffidence Covertly she looked at the man now He was not very good to look at His garments though new were dusty and plainly showed lack of care They were of the cut and style though Pollyanna of course did not know this that the State gives its prisoners as a freedom suit His face was a pasty white and was adorned with a week s beard His hat was pulled far down over his eyes With his hands in his pockets he sat idly staring at the ground For a long minute Pollyanna said nothing then hopefully she began It IS a nice day isn t it The man turned his head with a start Eh Oh er what did you say he questioned with a curiously frightened look around to make sure the remark was addressed to him I said twas a nice day explained Pollyanna in hurried earnestness but I don t care about that especially That is of course I m glad it s a nice day but I said it just as a beginning to things and I d just as soon talk about something else anything else It s only that I wanted you to talk about something you see The man gave a low laugh Even to Pollyanna the laugh sounded a little queer though she did not know as did the man that a laugh to his lips had been a stranger for many months So you want me to talk do you he said a little sadly Well I don t see but what I shall have to do it then Still I should think a nice little lady like you might find lots nicer people to talk to than an old duffer like me Oh but I like old duffers exclaimed Pollyanna quickly that is I like the OLD part and I don t know what a duffer is so I can t dislike that Besides if you are a duffer I reckon I like duffers Anyhow I like you she finished with a contented little settling of herself in her seat that carried conviction Humph Well I m sure I m flattered smiled the man ironically Though his face and words expressed polite doubt it might have been noticed that he sat a little straighter on the bench And pray what shall we talk about It s it s infinitesimal to me That means I don t care doesn t it asked Pollyanna with a beaming smile Aunt Polly says that whatever I talk about anyhow I always bring up at the Ladies Aiders But I reckon that s because they brought me up first don t you We might talk about the party I think it s a perfectly beautiful party now that I know some one P party Yes this you know all these people here to day It IS a party isn t it The lady said it was for everybody so I stayed though I haven t got to where the house is yet that s giving the party The man s lips twitched Well little lady perhaps it is a party in a way he smiled but the house that s giving it is the city of Boston This is the Public Garden a public park you understand for everybody Is it Always And I may come here any time I want to Oh how perfectly lovely That s even nicer than I thought it could be I d worried for fear I couldn t ever come again after to day you see I m glad now though that I didn t know it just at the first for it s all the nicer now Nice things are nicer when you ve been worrying for fear they won t be nice aren t they Perhaps they are if they ever turn out to be nice at all conceded the man a little gloomily Yes I think so nodded Pollyanna not noticing the gloom But isn t it beautiful here she gloried I wonder if missus Carew knows about it that it s for anybody so Why I should think everybody would want to come here all the time and just stay and look around The man s face hardened Well there are a few people in the world who have got a job who ve got something to do besides just to come here and stay and look around but I don t happen to be one of them Don t you Then you can be glad for that can t you sighed Pollyanna her eyes delightedly following a passing boat The man s lips parted indignantly but no words came Pollyanna was still talking I wish I didn t have anything to do but that I have to go to school Oh I like school but there s such a whole lot of things I like better Still I m glad I CAN go to school I m specially glad when I remember how last winter I didn t think I could ever go again You see I lost my legs for a while I mean they didn t go and you know you never know how much you use things till you don t have em And eyes too Did you ever think what a lot you do with eyes I didn t till I went to the Sanatorium There was a lady there who had just got blind the year before I tried to get her to play the game finding something to be glad about you know but she said she couldn t and if I wanted to know why I might tie up my eyes with my handkerchief for just one hour And I did It was awful Did you ever try it Why n no I didn t A half vexed half baffled expression was coming to the man s face Well don t It s awful You can t do anything not anything that you want to do But I kept it on the whole hour Since then I ve been so glad sometimes when I see something perfectly lovely like this you know I ve been so glad I wanted to cry cause I COULD see it you know She s playing the game now though that blind lady is Miss Wetherby told me The GAME Yes the glad game Didn t I tell you Finding something in everything to be glad about Well she s found it now about her eyes you know Her husband is the kind of a man that goes to help make the laws and she had him ask for one that would help blind people specially little babies And she went herself and talked and told those men how it felt to be blind And they made it that law And they said that she did more than anybody else even her husband to help make it and that they didn t believe there would have been any law at all if it hadn t been for her So now she says she s glad she lost her eyes cause she s kept so many little babies from growing up to be blind like her So you see she s playing it the game But I reckon you don t know about the game yet after all so I ll tell you It started this way And Pollyanna with her eyes on the shimmering beauty all about her told of the little pair of crutches of long ago which should have been a doll When the story was finished there was a long silence then a little abruptly the man got to his feet Oh are you going away NOW she asked in open disappointment Yes I m going now He smiled down at her a little queerly But you re coming back sometime He shook his head but again he smiled I hope not and I believe not little girl You see I ve made a great discovery to day I thought I was down and out I thought there was no place for me anywhere now But I ve just discovered that I ve got two eyes two arms and two legs Now I m going to use them and I m going to MAKE somebody understand that I know how to use them The next moment he was gone Why what a funny man mused Pollyanna Still he was nice and he was different too she finished rising to her feet and resuming her walk Pollyanna was now once more her usual cheerful self and she stepped with the confident assurance of one who has no doubt Had not the man said that this was a public park and that she had as good a right as anybody to be there She walked nearer to the pond and crossed the bridge to the starting place of the little boats For some time she watched the children happily keeping a particularly sharp lookout for the possible black curls of Susie Smith She would have liked to take a ride in the pretty boats herself but the sign said Five cents a trip and she did not have any money with her She smiled hopefully into the faces of several women and twice she spoke tentatively But no one spoke first to her and those whom she addressed eyed her coldly and made scant response After a time she turned her steps into still another path Here she found a white faced boy in a wheel chair She would have spoken to him but he was so absorbed in his book that she turned away after a moment s wistful gazing Soon then she came upon a pretty but sad looking young girl sitting alone staring at nothing very much as the man had sat With a contented little cry Pollyanna hurried forward Oh how do you do she beamed I m so glad I found you I ve been hunting ever so long for you she asserted dropping herself down on the unoccupied end of the bench The pretty girl turned with a start an eager look of expectancy in her eyes Oh she exclaimed falling back in plain disappointment I thought Why what do you mean she demanded aggrievedly I never set eyes on you before in my life No I didn t you either smiled Pollyanna but I ve been hunting for you just the same That is of course I didn t know you were going to be YOU exactly It s just that I wanted to find some one that looked lonesome and that didn t have anybody Like me you know So many here to day have got folks See Yes I see nodded the girl falling back into her old listlessness But poor little kid it s too bad YOU should find it out so soon Find what out That the lonesomest place in all the world is in a crowd in a big city Pollyanna frowned and pondered Is it I don t see how it can be I don t see how you can be lonesome when you ve got folks all around you Still she hesitated and the frown deepened I WAS lonesome this afternoon and there WERE folks all around me only they didn t seem to to think or notice The pretty girl smiled bitterly That s just it They don t ever think or notice crowds don t But some folks do We can be glad some do urged Pollyanna Now when I Oh yes some do interrupted the other As she spoke she shivered and looked fearfully down the path beyond Pollyanna Some notice too much Pollyanna shrank back in dismay Repeated rebuffs that afternoon had given her a new sensitiveness Do you mean me she stammered That you wished I hadn t noticed you No no kiddie I meant some one quite different from you Some one that hadn t ought to notice I was glad to have you speak only I thought at first it was some one from home Oh then you don t live here either any more than I do I mean for keeps Oh yes I live here now sighed the girl that is if you can call it living what I do What do you do asked Pollyanna interestedly Do I ll tell you what I do cried the other with sudden bitterness From morning till night I sell fluffy laces and perky bows to girls that laugh and talk and KNOW each other Then I go home to a little back room up three flights just big enough to hold a lumpy cot bed a washstand with a nicked pitcher one rickety chair and me It s like a furnace in the summer and an ice box in the winter but it s all the place I ve got and I m supposed to stay in it when I ain t workin But I ve come out to day I ain t goin to stay in that room and I ain t goin to go to any old library to read neither It s our last half holiday this year and an extra one at that and I m going to have a good time for once I m just as young and I like to laugh and joke just as well as them girls I sell bows to all day Well to day I m going to laugh and joke Pollyanna smiled and nodded her approval I m glad you feel that way I do too It s a lot more fun to be happy isn t it Besides the Bible tells us to rejoice and be glad I mean It tells us to eight hundred times Probably you know about em though the rejoicing texts The pretty girl shook her head A queer look came to her face Well no she said dryly I can t say I WAS thinkin of the Bible Weren t you Well maybe not but you see MY father was a minister and he A MINISTER Yes Why was yours too cried Pollyanna answering something she saw in the other s face Y yes A faint color crept up to the girl s forehead Oh and has he gone like mine to be with God and the angels The girl turned away her head No He s still living back home she answered half under her breath Oh how glad you must be sighed Pollyanna enviously Sometimes I get to thinking if only I could just SEE father once but you do see your father don t you Not often You see I m down here But you CAN see him and I can t mine He s gone to be with mother and the rest of us up in Heaven and Have you got a mother too an earth mother Y yes The girl stirred restlessly and half moved as if to go Oh then you can see both of them breathed Pollyanna unutterable longing in her face Oh how glad you must be For there just isn t anybody is there that really CARES and notices quite so much as fathers and mothers You see I know for I had a father until I was eleven years old but for a mother I had Ladies Aiders for ever so long till Aunt Polly took me Ladies Aiders are lovely but of course they aren t like mothers or even Aunt Pollys and On and on Pollyanna talked Pollyanna was in her element now Pollyanna loved to talk That there was anything strange or unwise or even unconventional in this intimate telling of her thoughts and her history to a total stranger on a Boston park bench did not once occur to Pollyanna To Pollyanna all men women and children were friends either known or unknown and thus far she had found the unknown quite as delightful as the known for with them there was always the excitement of mystery and adventure while they were changing from the unknown to the known To this young girl at her side therefore Pollyanna talked unreservedly of her father her Aunt Polly her Western home and her journey East to Vermont She told of new friends and old friends and of course she told of the game Pollyanna almost always told everybody of the game either sooner or later It was indeed so much a part of her very self that she could hardly have helped telling of it As for the girl she said little She was not now sitting in her old listless attitude however and to her whole self had come a marked change The flushed cheeks frowning brow troubled eyes and nervously working fingers were plainly the signs of some inward struggle From time to time she glanced apprehensively down the path beyond Pollyanna and it was after such a glance that she clutched the little girl s arm See here kiddie for just a minute don t you leave me Do you hear Stay right where you are There s a man I know comin but no matter what he says don t you pay no attention and DON T YOU GO I m goin to stay with YOU See Before Pollyanna could more than gasp her wonderment and surprise she found herself looking up into the face of a very handsome young gentleman who had stopped before them Oh here you are he smiled pleasantly lifting his hat to Pollyanna s companion I m afraid I ll have to begin with an apology I m a little late It don t matter sir said the young girl speaking hurriedly I I ve decided not to go The young man gave a light laugh Oh come my clear don t be hard on a chap because he s a little late It isn t that really defended the girl a swift red flaming into her cheeks I mean I m not going Nonsense The man stopped smiling He spoke sharply You said yesterday you d go I know but I ve changed my mind I told my little friend here I d stay with her Oh but if you d rather go with this nice young gentleman began Pollyanna anxiously but she fell back silenced at the look the girl gave her I tell you I had NOT rather go I m not going And pray why this sudden right about face demanded the young man with an expression that made him suddenly look to Pollyanna not quite so handsome Yesterday you said I know I did interrupted the girl feverishly But I knew then that I hadn t ought to Let s call it that I know it even better now That s all And she turned away resolutely It was not all The man spoke again twice He coaxed then he sneered with a hateful look in his eyes At last he said something very low and angry which Pollyanna did not understand The next moment he wheeled about and strode away The girl watched him tensely till he passed quite out of sight then relaxing she laid a shaking hand on Pollyanna s arm Thanks kiddie I reckon I owe you more than you know Good by But you aren t going away NOW bemoaned Pollyanna The girl sighed wearily I got to He might come back and next time I might not be able to She clipped the words short and rose to her feet For a moment she hesitated then she choked bitterly You see he s the kind that notices too much and that hadn t ought to notice ME at all With that she was gone Why what a funny lady murmured Pollyanna looking wistfully after the vanishing figure She was nice but she was sort of different too she commented rising to her feet and moving idly down the path CHAPTER VI JERRY TO THE RESCUE It was not long before Pollyanna reached the edge of the Garden at a corner where two streets crossed It was a wonderfully interesting corner with its hurrying cars automobiles carriages and pedestrians A huge red bottle in a drug store window caught her eye and from down the street came the sound of a hurdy gurdy Hesitating only a moment Pollyanna darted across the corner and skipped lightly down the street toward the entrancing music Pollyanna found much to interest her now In the store windows were marvelous objects and around the hurdy gurdy when she had reached it she found a dozen dancing children most fascinating to watch So altogether delightful indeed did this pastime prove to be that Pollyanna followed the hurdy gurdy for some distance just to see those children dance Presently she found herself at a corner so busy that a very big man in a belted blue coat helped the people across the street For an absorbed minute she watched him in silence then a little timidly she herself started to cross It was a wonderful experience The big blue coated man saw her at once and promptly beckoned to her He even walked to meet her Then through a wide lane with puffing motors and impatient horses on either hand she walked unscathed to the further curb It gave her a delightful sensation so delightful that after a minute she walked back Twice again after short intervals she trod the fascinating way so magically opened at the lifting of the big man s hand But the last time her conductor left her at the curb he gave a puzzled frown Illustration Twice again after short intervals she trod the fascinating way See here little girl ain t you the same one what crossed a minute ago he demanded And again before that Yes sir beamed Pollyanna I ve been across four times Well the officer began to bluster but Pollyanna was still talking And it s been nicer every time Oh h it has has it mumbled the big man lamely Then with a little more spirit he sputtered What do you think I m here for just to tote you back and forth Oh no sir dimpled Pollyanna Of course you aren t just for me There are all these others I know what you are You re a policeman We ve got one of you out where I live at missus Carew s only he s the kind that just walks on the sidewalk you know I used to think you were soldiers on account of your gold buttons and blue hats but I know better now Only I think you ARE a kind of a soldier cause you re so brave standing here like this right in the middle of all these teams and automobiles helping folks across Ho ho Brrrr spluttered the big man coloring like a schoolboy and throwing back his head with a hearty laugh Ho ho Just as if He broke off with a quick lifting of his hand The next moment he was escorting a plainly very much frightened little old lady from curb to curb If his step were a bit more pompous and his chest a bit more full it must have been only an unconscious tribute to the watching eyes of the little girl back at the starting point A moment later with a haughtily permissive wave of his hand toward the chafing drivers and chauffeurs he strolled back to Pollyanna Oh that was splendid she greeted him with shining eyes I love to see you do it and it s just like the Children of Israel crossing the Red Sea isn t it with you holding back the waves for the people to cross And how glad you must be all the time that you can do it I used to think being a doctor was the very gladdest business there was but I reckon after all being a policeman is gladder yet to help frightened people like this you know And But with another Brrrr and an embarrassed laugh the big blue coated man was back in the middle of the street and Pollyanna was all alone on the curbstone For only a minute longer did Pollyanna watch her fascinating Red Sea then with a regretful backward glance she turned away I reckon maybe I d better be going home now she meditated It must be most dinner time And briskly she started to walk back by the way she had come Not until she had hesitated at several corners and unwittingly made two false turns did Pollyanna grasp the fact that going back home was not to be so easy as she had thought it to be And not until she came to a building which she knew she had never seen before did she fully realize that she had lost her way She was on a narrow street dirty and ill paved Dingy tenement blocks and a few unattractive stores were on either side All about were jabbering men and chattering women though not one word of what they said could Pollyanna understand Moreover she could not help seeing that the people looked at her very curiously as if they knew she did not belong there Several times already she had asked her way but in vain No one seemed to know where missus Carew lived and the last two times those addressed had answered with a gesture and a jumble of words which Pollyanna after some thought decided must be Dutch the kind the Haggermans the only foreign family in Beldingsville used On and on down one street and up another Pollyanna trudged She was thoroughly frightened now She was hungry too and very tired Her feet ached and her eyes smarted with the tears she was trying so hard to hold back Worse yet it was unmistakably beginning to grow dark Well anyhow she choked to herself I m going to be glad I m lost cause it ll be so nice when I get found I CAN be glad for that It was at a noisy corner where two broader streets crossed that Pollyanna finally came to a dismayed stop This time the tears quite overflowed so that lacking a handkerchief she had to use the backs of both hands to wipe them away Hullo kid why the weeps queried a cheery voice What s up With a relieved little cry Pollyanna turned to confront a small boy carrying a bundle of newspapers under his arm Oh I m so glad to see you she exclaimed I ve so wanted to see some one who didn t talk Dutch The small boy grinned Dutch nothin he scoffed You mean Dago I bet ye Pollyanna gave a slight frown Well anyway it it wasn t English she said doubtfully and they couldn t answer my questions But maybe you can Do you know where missus Carew lives Nix You can search me Wha at queried Pollyanna still more doubtfully The boy grinned again I say not in mine I guess I ain t acquainted with the lady But isn t there anybody anywhere that is implored Pollyanna You see I just went out for a walk and I got lost I ve been ever and ever so far but I can t find the house at all and it s supper I mean dinner time and getting dark I want to get back I MUST get back Gee Well I should worry sympathized the boy Yes and I m afraid missus Carew ll worry too sighed Pollyanna Gorry if you ain t the limit chuckled the youth unexpectedly But say listen Don t ye know the name of the street ye want No only that it s some kind of an avenue desponded Pollyanna A avenOO is it Sure now some class to that We re doin fine What s the number of the house Can ye tell me that Just scratch your head Scratch my head Pollyanna frowned questioningly and raised a tentative hand to her hair The boy eyed her with disdain Aw come off yer perch Ye ain t so dippy as all that I say don t ye know the number of the house ye want N no except there s a seven in it returned Pollyanna with a faintly hopeful air Won t ye listen ter that gibed the scornful youth There s a seven in it an she expects me ter know it when I see it Oh I should know the house if I could only see it declared Pollyanna eagerly and I think I d know the street too on account of the lovely long yard running right up and down through the middle of it This time it was the boy who gave a puzzled frown YARD he queried in the middle of a street Yes trees and grass you know with a walk in the middle of it and seats and But the boy interrupted her with a whoop of delight Gee whiz Commonwealth Avenue sure as yer livin Wouldn t that get yer goat now Oh do you know do you really besought Pollyanna That sounded like it only I don t know what you meant about the goat part There aren t any goats there I don t think they d allow Goats nothin scoffed the boy You bet yer sweet life I know where tis Don t I tote Sir James up there to the Garden most ev ry day An I ll take YOU too Jest ye hang out here till I get on ter my job again an sell out my stock Then we ll make tracks for that ere Avenue fore ye can say Jack Robinson You mean you ll take me home appealed Pollyanna still plainly not quite understanding Sure It s a cinch if you know the house Oh yes I know the house replied the literal Pollyanna anxiously but I don t know whether it s a a cinch or not If it isn t can t you But the boy only threw her another disdainful glance and darted off into the thick of the crowd A moment later Pollyanna heard his strident call of paper paper Herald Globe paper sir With a sigh of relief Pollyanna stepped back into a doorway and waited She was tired but she was happy In spite of sundry puzzling aspects of the case she yet trusted the boy and she had perfect confidence that he could take her home He s nice and I like him she said to herself following with her eyes the boy s alert darting figure But he does talk funny His words SOUND English but some of them don t seem to make any sense with the rest of what he says But then I m glad he found me anyway she finished with a contented little sigh It was not long before the boy returned his hands empty Come on kid All aboard he called cheerily Now we ll hit the trail for the Avenue If I was the real thing now I d tote ye home in style in a buzzwagon but seein as how I hain t got the dough we ll have ter hoof it It was for the most part a silent walk Pollyanna for once in her life was too tired to talk even of the Ladies Aiders and the boy was intent on picking out the shortest way to his goal When the Public Garden was reached Pollyanna did exclaim joyfully Oh now I m most there I remember this place I had a perfectly lovely time here this afternoon It s only a little bit of a ways home now That s the stuff Now we re gettin there crowed the boy What d I tell ye We ll just cut through here to the Avenue an then it ll be up ter you ter find the house Oh I can find the house exulted Pollyanna with all the confidence of one who has reached familiar ground It was quite dark when Pollyanna led the way up the broad Carew steps The boy s ring at the bell was very quickly answered and Pollyanna found herself confronted by not only Mary but by missus Carew Bridget and Jennie as well All four of the women were white faced and anxious eyed Child child where HAVE you been demanded missus Carew hurrying forward Why I I just went to walk began Pollyanna and I got lost and this boy Where did you find her cut in missus Carew turning imperiously to Pollyanna s escort who was at the moment gazing in frank admiration at the wonders about him in the brilliantly lighted hall Where did you find her boy she repeated sharply For a brief moment the boy met her gaze unflinchingly then something very like a twinkle came into his eyes though his voice when he spoke was gravity itself Well I found her round Bowdoin Square but I reckon she d been doin the North End only she couldn t catch on ter the lingo of the Dagos so I don t think she give em the glad hand ma am The North End that child alone Pollyanna shuddered missus Carew Oh I wasn t alone missus Carew fended Pollyanna There were ever and ever so many people there weren t there boy But the boy with an impish grin was disappearing through the door Pollyanna learned many things during the next half hour She learned that nice little girls do not take long walks alone in unfamiliar cities nor sit on park benches and talk to strangers She learned also that it was only by a perfectly marvelous miracle that she had reached home at all that night and that she had escaped many many very disagreeable consequences of her foolishness She learned that Boston was not Beldingsville and that she must not think it was But missus Carew she finally argued despairingly I AM here and I didn t get lost for keeps Seems as if I ought to be glad for that instead of thinking all the time of the sorry things that might have happened Yes yes child I suppose so I suppose so sighed missus Carew but you have given me such a fright and I want you to be sure SURE SURE never to do it again Now come dear you must be hungry It was just as she was dropping off to sleep that night that Pollyanna murmured drowsily to herself The thing I m the very sorriest for of anything is that I didn t ask that boy his name nor where he lived Now I can t ever say thank you to him CHAPTER VII A NEW ACQUAINTANCE Pollyanna s movements were most carefully watched over after her adventurous walk and except to go to school she was not allowed out of the house unless Mary or missus Carew herself accompanied her This to Pollyanna however was no cross for she loved both missus Carew and Mary and delighted to be with them They were too for a while very generous with their time Even missus Carew in her terror of what might have happened and her relief that it had not happened exerted herself to entertain the child Thus it came about that with missus Carew Pollyanna attended concerts and matinees and visited the Public Library and the Art Museum and with Mary she took the wonderful seeing Boston trips and visited the State House and the Old South Church Greatly as Pollyanna enjoyed the automobile she enjoyed the trolley cars more as missus Carew much to her surprise found out one day Do we go in the trolley car Pollyanna asked eagerly No Perkins will take us answered missus Carew Then at the unmistakable disappointment in Pollyanna s face she added in surprise Why I thought you liked the auto child Oh I do acceded Pollyanna hurriedly and I wouldn t say anything anyway because of course I know it s cheaper than the trolley car and Cheaper than the trolley car exclaimed missus Carew amazed into an interruption Why yes explained Pollyanna with widening eyes the trolley car costs five cents a person you know and the auto doesn t cost anything cause it s yours And of course I LOVE the auto anyway she hurried on before missus Carew could speak It s only that there are so many more people in the trolley car and it s such fun to watch them Don t you think so Well no Pollyanna I can t say that I do responded missus Carew dryly as she turned away As it chanced not two days later missus Carew heard something more of Pollyanna and trolley cars this time from Mary I mean it s queer ma am explained Mary earnestly in answer to a question her mistress had asked it s queer how Miss Pollyanna just gets round EVERYBODY and without half trying It isn t that she DOES anything She doesn t She just just looks glad I guess that s all But I ve seen her get into a trolley car that was full of cross looking men and women and whimpering children and in five minutes you wouldn t know the place The men and women have stopped scowling and the children have forgot what they re cryin for Sometimes it s just somethin that Miss Pollyanna has said to me and they ve heard it Sometimes it s just the Thank you she gives when somebody insists on givin us their seat and they re always doin that givin us seats I mean And sometimes it s the way she smiles at a baby or a dog All dogs everywhere wag their tails at her anyway and all babies big and little smile and reach out to her If we get held up it s a joke and if we take the wrong car it s the funniest thing that ever happened And that s the way tis about everythin One just can t stay grumpy with Miss Pollyanna even if you re only one of a trolley car full of folks that don t know her Hm m very likely murmured missus Carew turning away October proved to be that year a particularly warm delightful month and as the golden days came and went it was soon very evident that to keep up with Pollyanna s eager little feet was a task which would consume altogether too much of somebody s time and patience and while missus Carew had the one she had not the other neither had she the willingness to allow Mary to spend quite so much of HER time whatever her patience might be in dancing attendance to Pollyanna s whims and fancies To keep the child indoors all through those glorious October afternoons was of course out of the question Thus it came about that before long Pollyanna found herself once more in the lovely big yard the Boston Public Garden and alone Apparently she was as free as before but in reality she was surrounded by a high stone wall of regulations She must not talk to strange men or women she must not play with strange children and under no circumstances must she step foot outside the Garden except to come home Furthermore Mary who had taken her to the Garden and left her made very sure that she knew the way home that she knew just where Commonwealth Avenue came down to Arlington Street across from the Garden And always she must go home when the clock in the church tower said it was half past four Pollyanna went often to the Garden after this Occasionally she went with some of the girls from school More often she went alone In spite of the somewhat irksome restrictions she enjoyed herself very much She could WATCH the people even if she could not talk to them and she could talk to the squirrels and pigeons and sparrows that so eagerly came for the nuts and grain which she soon learned to carry to them every time she went Pollyanna often looked for her old friends of that first day the man who was so glad he had his eyes and legs and arms and the pretty young lady who would not go with the handsome man but she never saw them She did frequently see the boy in the wheel chair and she wished she could talk to him The boy fed the birds and squirrels too and they were so tame that the doves would perch on his head and shoulders and the squirrels would burrow in his pockets for nuts But Pollyanna watching from a distance always noticed one strange circumstance in spite of the boy s very evident delight in serving his banquet his supply of food always ran short almost at once and though he invariably looked fully as disappointed as did the squirrel after a nutless burrowing yet he never remedied the matter by bringing more food the next day which seemed most short sighted to Pollyanna When the boy was not playing with the birds and squirrels he was reading always reading In his chair were usually two or three worn books and sometimes a magazine or two He was nearly always to be found in one especial place and Pollyanna used to wonder how he got there Then one unforgettable day she found out It was a school holiday and she had come to the Garden in the forenoon and it was soon after she reached the place that she saw him being wheeled along one of the paths by a snub nosed sandy haired boy She gave a keen glance into the sandy haired boy s face then ran toward him with a glad little cry Oh you you I know you even if I don t know your name You found me Don t you remember Oh I m so glad to see you I ve so wanted to say thank you Gee if it ain t the swell little lost kid of the AveNOO grinned the boy Well what do you know about that Lost again Oh no exclaimed Pollyanna dancing up and down on her toes in irrepressible joy I can t get lost any more I have to stay right here And I mustn t talk you know But I can to you for I KNOW you and I can to him after you introduce me she finished with a beaming glance at the lame boy and a hopeful pause The sandy haired youth chuckled softly and tapped the shoulder of the boy in the chair Listen ter that will ye Ain t that the real thing now Just you wait while I introDOOCE ye And he struck a pompous attitude Madam this is me friend Sir James Lord of Murphy s Alley and But the boy in the chair interrupted him Jerry quit your nonsense he cried vexedly Then to Pollyanna he turned a glowing face I ve seen you here lots of times before I ve watched you feed the birds and squirrels you always have such a lot for them And I think YOU like Sir Lancelot the best too Of course there s the Lady Rowena but wasn t she rude to Guinevere yesterday snatching her dinner right away from her like that Pollyanna blinked and frowned looking from one to the other of the boys in plain doubt Jerry chuckled again Then with a final push he wheeled the chair into its usual position and turned to go Over his shoulder he called to Pollyanna Say kid jest let me put ye wise ter somethin This chap ain t drunk nor crazy See Them s jest names he s give his young friends here with a flourish of his arms toward the furred and feathered creatures that were gathering from all directions An they ain t even names of FOLKS They re just guys out of books Are ye on Yet he d ruther feed them than feed hisself Ain t he the limit Ta ta Sir James he added with a grimace to the boy in the chair Buck up now nix on the no grub racket for you See you later And he was gone Pollyanna was still blinking and frowning when the lame boy turned with a smile You mustn t mind Jerry That s just his way He d cut off his right hand for me Jerry would but he loves to tease Where d you see him Does he know you He didn t tell me your name I m Pollyanna Whittier I was lost and he found me and took me home answered Pollyanna still a little dazedly I see Just like him nodded the boy Don t he tote me up here every day A quick sympathy came to Pollyanna s eyes Can t you walk at all er Sir J James The boy laughed gleefully Sir James indeed That s only more of Jerry s nonsense I ain t a Sir Pollyanna looked clearly disappointed You aren t Nor a a lord like he said I sure ain t Oh I hoped you were like Little Lord Fauntleroy you know rejoined Pollyanna And But the boy interrupted her with an eager Do YOU know Little Lord Fauntleroy And do you know about Sir Lancelot and the Holy Grail and King Arthur and his Round Table and the Lady Rowena and Ivanhoe and all those DO you Pollyanna gave her head a dubious shake Well I m afraid maybe I don t know ALL of em she admitted Are they all in books The boy nodded I ve got em here some of em he said I like to read em over and over There s always SOMETHING new in em Besides I hain t got no others anyway These were father s Here you little rascal quit that he broke off in laughing reproof as a bushy tailed squirrel leaped to his lap and began to nose in his pockets Gorry guess we d better give them their dinner or they ll be tryin to eat us chuckled the boy That s Sir Lancelot He s always first you know From somewhere the boy produced a small pasteboard box which he opened guardedly mindful of the numberless bright little eyes that were watching every move All about him now sounded the whir and flutter of wings the cooing of doves the saucy twitter of the sparrows Sir Lancelot alert and eager occupied one arm of the wheel chair Another bushy tailed little fellow less venturesome sat back on his haunches five feet away A third squirrel chattered noisily on a neighboring tree branch From the box the boy took a few nuts a small roll and a doughnut At the latter he looked longingly hesitatingly Did you bring anything he asked then Lots in here nodded Pollyanna tapping the paper bag she carried Oh then perhaps I WILL eat it to day sighed the boy dropping the doughnut back into the box with an air of relief Pollyanna on whom the significance of this action was quite lost thrust her fingers into her own bag and the banquet was on It was a wonderful hour To Pollyanna it was in a way the most wonderful hour she had ever spent for she had found some one who could talk faster and longer than she could This strange youth seemed to have an inexhaustible fund of marvelous stories of brave knights and fair ladies of tournaments and battles Moreover so vividly did he draw his pictures that Pollyanna saw with her own eyes the deeds of valor the knights in armor and the fair ladies with their jeweled gowns and tresses even though she was really looking at a flock of fluttering doves and sparrows and a group of frisking squirrels on a wide sweep of sunlit grass Illustration It was a wonderful hour The Ladies Aiders were forgotten Even the glad game was not thought of Pollyanna with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes was trailing down the golden ages led by a romance fed boy who though she did not know it was trying to crowd into this one short hour of congenial companionship countless dreary days of loneliness and longing Not until the noon bells sent Pollyanna hurrying homeward did she remember that she did not even yet know the boy s name I only know it isn t Sir James she sighed to herself frowning with vexation But never mind I can ask him to morrow CHAPTER VIII JAMIE Pollyanna did not see the boy to morrow It rained and she could not go to the Garden at all It rained the next day too Even on the third day she did not see him for though the sun came out bright and warm and though she went very early in the afternoon to the Garden and waited long he did not come at all But on the fourth day he was there in his old place and Pollyanna hastened forward with a joyous greeting Oh I m so glad GLAD to see you But where ve you been You weren t here yesterday at all I couldn t The pain wouldn t let me come yesterday explained the lad who was looking very white The PAIN Oh does it ache stammered Pollyanna all sympathy at once Oh yes always nodded the boy with a cheerfully matter of fact air Most generally I can stand it and come here just the same except when it gets TOO bad same as twas yesterday Then I can t But how can you stand it to have it ache always gasped Pollyanna Why I have to answered the boy opening his eyes a little wider Things that are so are SO and they can t be any other way So what s the use thinking how they might be Besides the harder it aches one day the nicer tis to have it let up the next I know That s like the ga began Pollyanna but the boy interrupted her Did you bring a lot this time he asked anxiously Oh I hope you did You see I couldn t bring them any to day Jerry couldn t spare even a penny for peanuts this morning and there wasn t really enough stuff in the box for me this noon Pollyanna looked shocked You mean that you didn t have enough to eat yourself for YOUR luncheon Sure smiled the boy But don t worry Tisn t the first time and twon t be the last I m used to it Hi there here comes Sir Lancelot Pollyanna however was not thinking of squirrels And wasn t there any more at home Oh no there s NEVER any left at home laughed the boy You see mumsey works out stairs and washings so she gets some of her feed in them places and Jerry picks his up where he can except nights and mornings he gets it with us then if we ve got any Pollyanna looked still more shocked But what do you do when you don t have anything to eat Go hungry of course But I never HEARD of anybody who didn t have ANYTHING to eat gasped Pollyanna Of course father and I were poor and we had to eat beans and fish balls when we wanted turkey But we had SOMETHING Why don t you tell folks all these folks everywhere that live in these houses What s the use Why they d give you something of course The boy laughed once more this time a little queerly Guess again kid You ve got another one coming Nobody I know is dishin out roast beef and frosted cakes for the askin Besides if you didn t go hungry once in a while you wouldn t know how good taters and milk can taste and you wouldn t have so much to put in your Jolly Book Your WHAT The boy gave an embarrassed laugh and grew suddenly red Forget it I didn t think for a minute but you was mumsey or Jerry But what IS your Jolly Book pleaded Pollyanna Please tell me Are there knights and lords and ladies in that The boy shook his head His eyes lost their laughter and grew dark and fathomless No I wish t there was he sighed wistfully But when you you can t even WALK you can t fight battles and win trophies and have fair ladies hand you your sword and bestow upon you the golden guerdon A sudden fire came to the boy s eyes His chin lifted itself as if in response to a bugle call Then as suddenly the fire died and the boy fell back into his old listlessness You just can t do nothin he resumed wearily after a moment s silence You just have to sit and think and times like that your THINK gets to be something awful Mine did anyhow I wanted to go to school and learn things more things than just mumsey can teach me and I thought of that I wanted to run and play ball with the other boys and I thought of that I wanted to go out and sell papers with Jerry and I thought of that I didn t want to be taken care of all my life and I thought of that I know oh I know breathed Pollyanna with shining eyes Didn t I lose MY legs for a while Did you Then you do know some But you ve got yours again I hain t you know sighed the boy the shadow in his eyes deepening But you haven t told me yet about the Jolly Book prompted Pollyanna after a minute The boy stirred and laughed shamefacedly Well you see it ain t much after all except to me YOU wouldn t see much in it I started it a year ago I was feelin specially bad that day Nothin was right For a while I grumped it out just thinkin and then I picked up one of father s books and tried to read And the first thing I see was this I learned it afterwards so I can say it now Pleasures lie thickest where no pleasures seem There s not a leaf that falls upon the ground But holds some joy of silence or of sound Footnote Blanchard Lyric Offerings Hidden Joys Well I was mad I wished I could put the guy that wrote that in my place and see what kind of joy he d find in my leaves I was so mad I made up my mind I d prove he didn t know what he was talkin about so I begun to hunt for em the joys in my leaves you know I took a little old empty notebook that Jerry had given me and I said to myself that I d write em down Everythin that had anythin about it that I liked I d put down in the book Then I d just show how many joys I had Yes yes cried Pollyanna absorbedly as the boy paused for breath Well I didn t expect to get many but do you know I got a lot There was somethin about most everythin that I liked a LITTLE so in it had to go The very first one was the book itself that I d got it you know to write in Then somebody give me a flower in a pot and Jerry found a dandy book in the subway After that it was really fun to hunt em out I d find em in such queer places sometimes Then one day Jerry got hold of the little notebook and found out what twas Then he give it its name the Jolly Book And and that s all All ALL cried Pollyanna delight and amazement struggling for the mastery on her glowing little face Why that s the game You re playing the glad game and don t know it only you re playing it ever and ever so much better than I ever could Why I I couldn t play it at all I m afraid if I I didn t have enough to eat and couldn t ever walk or anything she choked The game What game I don t know anything about any game frowned the boy Pollyanna clapped her hands I know you don t I know you don t and that s why it s so perfectly lovely and so so wonderful But listen I ll tell you what the game is And she told him Gee breathed the boy appreciatively when she had finished Now what do you think of that And here you are playing MY game better than anybody I ever saw and I don t even know your name yet nor anything exclaimed Pollyanna in almost awestruck tones But I want to I want to know everything Pooh there s nothing to know rejoined the boy with a shrug Besides see here s poor Sir Lancelot and all the rest waiting for their dinner he finished Dear me so they are sighed Pollyanna glancing impatiently at the fluttering and chattering creatures all about them Recklessly she turned her bag upside down and scattered her supplies to the four winds There now that s done and we can talk again she rejoiced And there s such a lot I want to know First please what IS your name I only know it isn t Sir James The boy smiled No it isn t but that s what Jerry most always calls me Mumsey and the rest call me Jamie JAMIE Pollyanna caught her breath and held it suspended A wild hope had come to her eyes It was followed almost instantly however by fearful doubt Does mumsey mean mother Sure Pollyanna relaxed visibly Her face fell If this Jamie had a mother he could not of course be missus Carew s Jamie whose mother had died long ago Still even as he was he was wonderfully interesting But where do you live she catechized eagerly Is there anybody else in your family but your mother and and Jerry Do you always come here every day Where is your Jolly Book Mayn t I see it Don t the doctors say you can ever walk again And where was it you said you got it this wheel chair I mean The boy chuckled Say how many of them questions do you expect me to answer all at once I ll begin at the last one anyhow and work backwards maybe if I don t forget what they be I got this chair a year ago Jerry knew one of them fellers what writes for papers you know and he put it in about me how I couldn t ever walk and all that and and the Jolly Book you see The first thing I knew a whole lot of men and women come one day toting this chair and said twas for me That they d read all about me and they wanted me to have it to remember them by My how glad you must have been I was It took a whole page of my Jolly Book to tell about that chair But can t you EVER walk again Pollyanna s eyes were blurred with tears It don t look like it They said I couldn t Oh but that s what they said about me and then they sent me to doctor Ames and I stayed most a year and HE made me walk Maybe he could YOU The boy shook his head He couldn t you see I couldn t go to him anyway Twould cost too much We ll just have to call it that I can t ever walk again But never mind The boy threw back his head impatiently I m trying not to THINK of that You know what it is when when your THINK gets to going Yes yes of course and here I am talking about it cried Pollyanna penitently I SAID you knew how to play the game better than I did now But go on You haven t told me half yet Where do you live And is Jerry all the brothers and sisters you ve got A swift change came to the boy s face His eyes glowed Yes and he ain t mine really He ain t any relation nor mumsey ain t neither And only think how good they ve been to me What s that questioned Pollyanna instantly on the alert Isn t that that mumsey your mother at all No and that s what makes And haven t you got any mother interrupted Pollyanna in growing excitement No I never remember any mother and father died six years ago How old were you I don t know I was little Mumsey says she guesses maybe I was about six That s when they took me you see And your name is Jamie Pollyanna was holding her breath Why yes I told you that And what s the other name Longingly but fearfully Pollyanna asked this question I don t know YOU DON T KNOW I don t remember I was too little I suppose Even the Murphys don t know They never knew me as anything but Jamie A great disappointment came to Pollyanna s face but almost immediately a flash of thought drove the shadow away Well anyhow if you don t know what your name is you can t know it isn t Kent she exclaimed Kent puzzled the boy Yes began Pollyanna all excitement You see there was a little boy named Jamie Kent that She stopped abruptly and bit her lip It had occurred to Pollyanna that it would be kinder not to let this boy know yet of her hope that he might be the lost Jamie It would be better that she make sure of it before raising any expectations otherwise she might be bringing him sorrow rather than joy She had not forgotten how disappointed Jimmy Bean had been when she had been obliged to tell him that the Ladies Aid did not want him and again when at first mister Pendleton had not wanted him either She was determined that she would not make the same mistake a third time so very promptly now she assumed an air of elaborate indifference on this most dangerous subject as she said But never mind about Jamie Kent Tell me about yourself I m SO interested There isn t anything to tell I don t know anything nice hesitated the boy They said father was was queer and never talked They didn t even know his name Everybody called him The Professor Mumsey says he and I lived in a little back room on the top floor of the house in Lowell where they used to live They were poor then but they wasn t near so poor as they are now Jerry s father was alive them days and had a job Yes yes go on prompted Pollyanna Well mumsey says my father was sick a lot and he got queerer and queerer so that they had me downstairs with them a good deal I could walk then a little but my legs wasn t right I played with Jerry and the little girl that died Well when father died there wasn t anybody to take me and some men were goin to put me in an orphan asylum but mumsey says I took on so and Jerry took on so that they said they d keep me And they did The little girl had just died and they said I might take her place And they ve had me ever since And I fell and got worse and they re awful poor now too besides Jerry s father dyin But they ve kept me Now ain t that what you call bein pretty good to a feller Yes oh yes cried Pollyanna But they ll get their reward I know they ll get their reward Pollyanna was quivering with delight now The last doubt had fled She had found the lost Jamie She was sure of it But not yet must she speak First missus Carew must see him Then THEN Even Pollyanna s imagination failed when it came to picturing the bliss in store for missus Carew and Jamie at that glad reunion She sprang lightly to her feet in utter disregard of Sir Lancelot who had come back and was nosing in her lap for more nuts I ve got to go now but I ll come again to morrow Maybe I ll have a lady with me that you ll like to know You ll be here to morrow won t you she finished anxiously Sure if it s pleasant Jerry totes me up here most every mornin They fixed it so he could you know and I bring my dinner and stay till four o clock Jerry s good to me he is I know I know nodded Pollyanna And maybe you ll find somebody else to be good to you too she caroled With which cryptic statement and a beaming smile she was gone CHAPTER IX PLANS AND PLOTTINGS On the way home Pollyanna made joyous plans To morrow in some way or other missus Carew must be persuaded to go with her for a walk in the Public Garden Just how this was to be brought about Pollyanna did not know but brought about it must be To tell missus Carew plainly that she had found Jamie and wanted her to go to see him was out of the question There was of course a bare chance that this might not be her Jamie and if it were not and if she had thus raised in missus Carew false hopes the result might be disastrous Pollyanna knew from what Mary had told her that twice already missus Carew had been made very ill by the great disappointment of following alluring clues that had led to some boy very different from her dead sister s son So Pollyanna knew that she could not tell missus Carew why she wanted her to go to walk to morrow in the Public Garden But there would be a way declared Pollyanna to herself as she happily hurried homeward Fate however as it happened once more intervened in the shape of a heavy rainstorm and Pollyanna did not have to more than look out of doors the next morning to realize that there would be no Public Garden stroll that day Worse yet neither the next day nor the next saw the clouds dispelled and Pollyanna spent all three afternoons wandering from window to window peering up into the sky and anxiously demanding of every one DON T you think it looks a LITTLE like clearing up So unusual was this behavior on the part of the cheery little girl and so irritating was the constant questioning that at last missus Carew lost her patience For pity s sake child what is the trouble she cried I never knew you to fret so about the weather Where s that wonderful glad game of yours to day Pollyanna reddened and looked abashed Dear me I reckon maybe I did forget the game this time she admitted And of course there IS something about it I can be glad for if I ll only hunt for it I can be glad that that it will HAVE to stop raining sometime cause God said he WOULDN T send another flood But you see I did so want it to be pleasant to day Why especially Oh I I just wanted to go to walk in the Public Garden Pollyanna was trying hard to speak unconcernedly I I thought maybe you d like to go with me too Outwardly Pollyanna was nonchalance itself Inwardly however she was aquiver with excitement and suspense I go to walk in the Public Garden queried missus Carew with brows slightly uplifted Thank you no I m afraid not she smiled Oh but you you wouldn t REFUSE faltered Pollyanna in quick panic I have refused Pollyanna swallowed convulsively She had grown really pale But missus Carew please PLEASE don t say you WON T go when it gets pleasant she begged You see for a a special reason I wanted you to go with me just this once missus Carew frowned She opened her lips to make the no more decisive but something in Pollyanna s pleading eyes must have changed the words for when they came they were a reluctant acquiescence Well well child have your own way But if I promise to go YOU must promise not to go near the window for an hour and not to ask again to day if I think it s going to clear up Yes m I will I mean I won t palpitated Pollyanna Then as a pale shaft of light that was almost a sunbeam came aslant through the window she cried joyously But you DO think it IS going to Oh she broke off in dismay and ran from the room Unmistakably it cleared up the next morning But though the sun shone brightly there was a sharp chill in the air and by afternoon when Pollyanna came home from school there was a brisk wind In spite of protests however she insisted that it was a beautiful day out and that she should be perfectly miserable if missus Carew would not come for a walk in the Public Garden And missus Carew went though still protesting As might have been expected it was a fruitless journey Together the impatient woman and the anxious eyed little girl hurried shiveringly up one path and down another Pollyanna not finding the boy in his accustomed place was making frantic search in every nook and corner of the Garden To Pollyanna it seemed that she could not have it so Here she was in the Garden and here with her was missus Carew but not anywhere to be found was Jamie and yet not one word could she say to missus Carew At last thoroughly chilled and exasperated missus Carew insisted on going home and despairingly Pollyanna went Sorry days came to Pollyanna then What to her was perilously near a second deluge but according to missus Carew was merely the usual fall rains brought a series of damp foggy cold cheerless days filled with either a dreary drizzle of rain or worse yet a steady downpour If perchance occasionally there came a day of sunshine Pollyanna always flew to the Garden but in vain Jamie was never there It was the middle of November now and even the Garden itself was full of dreariness The trees were bare the benches almost empty and not one boat was on the little pond True the squirrels and pigeons were there and the sparrows were as pert as ever but to feed them was almost more of a sorrow than a joy for every saucy switch of Sir Lancelot s feathery tail but brought bitter memories of the lad who had given him his name and who was not there And to think I didn t find out where he lived mourned Pollyanna to herself over and over again as the days passed And he was Jamie I just know he was Jamie And now I ll have to wait and wait till spring comes and it s warm enough for him to come here again And then maybe I sha n t be coming here by that time O dear O dear and he WAS Jamie I know he was Jamie Then one dreary afternoon the unexpected happened Pollyanna passing through the upper hallway heard angry voices in the hall below one of which she recognized as being Mary s while the other the other The other voice was saying Not on yer life It s nix on the beggin business Do yer get me I wants ter see the kid Pollyanna I got a message for her from from Sir James Now beat it will ye and trot out the kid if ye don t mind With a glad little cry Pollyanna turned and fairly flew down the stairway Oh I m here I m here I m right here she panted stumbling forward What is it Did Jamie send you In her excitement she had almost flung herself with outstretched arms upon the boy when Mary intercepted a shocked restraining hand Miss Pollyanna Miss Pollyanna do you mean to say you know this this beggar boy The boy flushed angrily but before he could speak Pollyanna interposed valiant championship He isn t a beggar boy He belongs to one of my very best friends Besides he s the one that found me and brought me home that time I was lost Then to the boy she turned with impetuous questioning What is it Did Jamie send you Sure he did He hit the hay a month ago and he hain t been up since He hit what puzzled Pollyanna Hit the hay went ter bed He s sick I mean and he wants ter see ye Will ye come Sick Oh I m so sorry grieved Pollyanna Of course I ll come I ll go get my hat and coat right away Miss Pollyanna gasped Mary in stern disapproval As if missus Carew would let you go ANYWHERE with a strange boy like this But he isn t a strange boy objected Pollyanna I ve known him ever so long and I MUST go I What in the world is the meaning of this demanded missus Carew icily from the drawing room doorway Pollyanna who is this boy and what is he doing here Pollyanna turned with a quick cry Oh missus Carew you ll let me go won t you Go where To see my brother ma am cut in the boy hurriedly and with an obvious effort to be very polite He s sort of off his feed ye know and he wouldn t give me no peace till I come up after her with an awkward gesture toward Pollyanna He thinks a sight an all of her I may go mayn t I pleaded Pollyanna missus Carew frowned Go with this boy YOU Certainly not Pollyanna I wonder you are wild enough to think of it for a moment Oh but I want you to come too began Pollyanna I Absurd child That is impossible You may give this boy here a little money if you like but Thank ye ma am but I didn t come for money resented the boy his eyes flashing I come for her Yes and missus Carew it s Jerry Jerry Murphy the boy that found me when I was lost and brought me home appealed Pollyanna NOW won t you let me go missus Carew shook her head It is out of the question Pollyanna But he says Ja the other boy is sick and wants me I can t help that And I know him real well missus Carew I do truly He reads books lovely books all full of knights and lords and ladies and he feeds the birds and squirrels and gives em names and everything And he can t walk and he doesn t have enough to eat lots of days panted Pollyanna and he s been playing my glad game for a year and didn t know it And he plays it ever and ever so much better than I do And I ve hunted and hunted for him ever and ever so many days Honest and truly missus Carew I ve just GOT to see him almost sobbed Pollyanna I can t lose him again An angry color flamed into missus Carew s cheeks Pollyanna this is sheer nonsense I am surprised I am amazed at you for insisting upon doing something you know I disapprove of I CAN NOT allow you to go with this boy Now please let me hear no more about it A new expression came to Pollyanna s face With a look half terrified half exalted she lifted her chin and squarely faced missus Carew Tremulously but determinedly she spoke Then I ll have to tell you I didn t mean to till I was sure I wanted you to see him first But now I ve got to tell I can t lose him again I think missus Carew he s Jamie Jamie Not my Jamie missus Carew s face had grown very white Yes Impossible I know but please his name IS Jamie and he doesn t know the other one His father died when he was six years old and he can t remember his mother He s twelve years old he thinks These folks took him in when his father died and his father was queer and didn t tell folks his name and But missus Carew had stopped her with a gesture missus Carew was even whiter than before but her eyes burned with a sudden fire We ll go at once she said Mary tell Perkins to have the car here as soon as possible Pollyanna get your hat and coat Boy wait here please We ll be ready to go with you immediately The next minute she had hurried up stairs In the hall the boy drew a long breath Gee whiz he muttered softly If we ain t goin ter go in a buzz wagon Some class ter that Gorry what ll Sir James say CHAPTER X IN MURPHY S ALLEY With the opulent purr that seems to be peculiar to luxurious limousines missus Carew s car rolled down Commonwealth Avenue and out upon Arlington Street to Charles Inside sat a shining eyed little girl and a white faced tense woman Outside to give directions to the plainly disapproving chauffeur sat Jerry Murphy inordinately proud and insufferably important When the limousine came to a stop before a shabby doorway in a narrow dirty alley the boy leaped to the ground and with a ridiculous imitation of the liveried pomposities he had so often watched threw open the door of the car and stood waiting for the ladies to alight Pollyanna sprang out at once her eyes widening with amazement and distress as she looked about her Behind her came missus Carew visibly shuddering as her gaze swept the filth the sordidness and the ragged children that swarmed shrieking and chattering out of the dismal tenements and surrounded the car in a second Jerry waved his arms angrily Here you beat it he yelled to the motley throng This ain t no free movies CAN that racket and get a move on ye Lively now We gotta get by Jamie s got comp ny missus Carew shuddered again and laid a trembling hand on Jerry s shoulder Not HERE she recoiled But the boy did not hear With shoves and pushes from sturdy fists and elbows he was making a path for his charges and before missus Carew knew quite how it was done she found herself with the boy and Pollyanna at the foot of a rickety flight of stairs in a dim evil smelling hallway Once more she put out a shaking hand Wait she commanded huskily Remember Don t either of you say a word about about his being possibly the boy I m looking for I must see for myself first and question him Of course agreed Pollyanna Sure I m on nodded the boy I gotta go right off anyhow so I won t bother ye none Now toddle easy up these ere stairs There s always holes and most generally there s a kid or two asleep somewheres An the elevator ain t runnin ter day he gibed cheerfully We gotta go ter the top too missus Carew found the holes broken boards that creaked and bent fearsomely under her shrinking feet and she found one kid a two year old baby playing with an empty tin can on a string which he was banging up and down the second flight of stairs On all sides doors were opened now boldly now stealthily but always disclosing women with tousled heads or peering children with dirty faces Somewhere a baby was wailing piteously Somewhere else a man was cursing Everywhere was the smell of bad whiskey stale cabbage and unwashed humanity At the top of the third and last stairway the boy came to a pause before a closed door I m just a thinkin what Sir James ll say when he s wise ter the prize package I m bringin him he whispered in a throaty voice I know what mumsey ll do she ll turn on the weeps in no time ter see Jamie so tickled The next moment he threw wide the door with a gay Here we be an we come in a buzz wagon Ain t that goin some Sir James It was a tiny room cold and cheerless and pitifully bare but scrupulously neat There were here no tousled heads no peering children no odors of whiskey cabbage and unclean humanity There were two beds three broken chairs a dry goods box table and a stove with a faint glow of light that told of a fire not nearly brisk enough to heat even that tiny room On one of the beds lay a lad with flushed cheeks and fever bright eyes Near him sat a thin white faced woman bent and twisted with rheumatism missus Carew stepped into the room and as if to steady herself paused a minute with her back to the wall Pollyanna hurried forward with a low cry just as Jerry with an apologetic I gotta go now good by dashed through the door Oh Jamie I m so glad I ve found you cried Pollyanna You don t know how I ve looked and looked for you every day But I m so sorry you re sick Jamie smiled radiantly and held out a thin white hand I ain t sorry I m GLAD he emphasized meaningly cause it s brought you to see me Besides I m better now anyway Mumsey this is the little girl you know that told me the glad game and mumsey s playing it too he triumphed turning back to Pollyanna First she cried cause her back hurts too bad to let her work then when I was took worse she was GLAD she couldn t work cause she could be here to take care of me you know At that moment missus Carew hurried forward her eyes half fearfully half longingly on the face of the lame boy in the bed It s missus Carew I ve brought her to see you Jamie introduced Pollyanna in a tremulous voice The little twisted woman by the bed had struggled to her feet by this time and was nervously offering her chair missus Carew accepted it without so much as a glance Her eyes were still on the boy in the bed Your name is Jamie she asked with visible difficulty Yes ma am The boy s bright eyes looked straight into hers What is your other name I don t know He is not your son For the first time missus Carew turned to the twisted little woman who was still standing by the bed No madam And you don t know his name No madam I never knew it With a despairing gesture missus Carew turned back to the boy But think think don t you remember ANYTHING of your name but Jamie The boy shook his head Into his eyes was coming a puzzled wonder No nothing Haven t you anything that belonged to your father with possibly his name in it There wasn t anythin worth savin but them books interposed missus Murphy Them s his Maybe you d like to look at em she suggested pointing to a row of worn volumes on a shelf across the room Then in plainly uncontrollable curiosity she asked Was you thinkin you knew him ma am I don t know murmured missus Carew in a half stifled voice as she rose to her feet and crossed the room to the shelf of books There were not many perhaps ten or a dozen There was a volume of Shakespeare s plays an Ivanhoe a much thumbed Lady of the Lake a book of miscellaneous poems a coverless Tennyson a dilapidated Little Lord Fauntleroy and two or three books of ancient and medieval history But though missus Carew looked carefully through every one she found nowhere any written word With a despairing sigh she turned back to the boy and to the woman both of whom now were watching her with startled questioning eyes I wish you d tell me both of you all you know about yourselves she said brokenly dropping herself once more into the chair by the bed And they told her It was much the same story that Jamie had told Pollyanna in the Public Garden There was little that was new nothing that was significant in spite of the probing questions that missus Carew asked At its conclusion Jamie turned eager eyes on missus Carew s face Do you think you knew my father he begged missus Carew closed her eyes and pressed her hand to her head I don t know she answered But I think not Pollyanna gave a quick cry of keen disappointment but as quickly she suppressed it in obedience to missus Carew s warning glance With new horror however she surveyed the tiny room Jamie turning his wondering eyes from missus Carew s face suddenly awoke to his duties as host Wasn t you good to come he said to Pollyanna gratefully How s Sir Lancelot Do you ever go to feed him now Then as Pollyanna did not answer at once he hurried on his eyes going from her face to the somewhat battered pink in a broken necked bottle in the window Did you see my posy Jerry found it Somebody dropped it and he picked it up Ain t it pretty And it SMELLS a little But Pollyanna did not seem even to have heard him She was still gazing wide eyed about the room clasping and unclasping her hands nervously But I don t see how you can ever play the game here at all Jamie she faltered I didn t suppose there could be anywhere such a perfectly awful place to live she shuddered Ho scoffed Jamie valiantly You d oughter see the Pikes down stairs Theirs is a whole lot worse n this You don t know what a lot of nice things there is about this room Why we get the sun in that winder there for most two hours every day when it shines And if you get real near it you can see a whole lot of sky from it If we could only KEEP the room but you see we ve got to leave we re afraid And that s what s worrin us Leave Yes We got behind on the rent mumsey bein sick so and not earnin anythin In spite of a courageously cheerful smile Jamie s voice shook Mis Dolan down stairs the woman what keeps my wheel chair for me you know is helpin us out this week But of course she can t do it always and then we ll have to go if Jerry don t strike it rich or somethin Oh but can t we began Pollyanna She stopped short missus Carew had risen to her feet abruptly with a hurried Come Pollyanna we must go Then to the woman she turned wearily You won t have to leave I ll send you money and food at once and I ll mention your case to one of the charity organizations in which I am interested and they will In surprise she ceased speaking The bent little figure of the woman opposite had drawn itself almost erect missus Murphy s cheeks were flushed Her eyes showed a smouldering fire Thank you no missus Carew she said tremulously but proudly We re poor God knows but we ain t charity folks Nonsense cried missus Carew sharply You re letting the woman down stairs help you This boy said so I know but that ain t charity persisted the woman still tremulously missus Dolan is my FRIEND She knows I D do HER a good turn just as quick I have done em for her in times past Help from FRIENDS ain t charity They CARE and that that makes a difference We wa n t always as we are now you see and that makes it hurt all the more all this Thank you but we couldn t take your money missus Carew frowned angrily It had been a most disappointing heart breaking exhausting hour for her Never a patient woman she was exasperated now besides being utterly tired out Very well just as you please she said coldly Then with vague irritation she added But why don t you go to your landlord and insist that he make you even decently comfortable while you do stay Surely you re entitled to something besides broken windows stuffed with rags and papers And those stairs that I came up are positively dangerous missus Murphy sighed in a discouraged way Her twisted little figure had fallen back into its old hopelessness We have tried to have something done but it s never amounted to anything We never see anybody but the agent of course and he says the rents are too low for the owner to put out any more money on repairs Nonsense snapped missus Carew with all the sharpness of a nervous distraught woman who has at last found an outlet for her exasperation It s shameful What s more I think it s a clear case of violation of the law those stairs are certainly I shall make it my business to see that he s brought to terms What is the name of that agent and who is the owner of this delectable establishment I don t know the name of the owner madam but the agent is mister Dodge Dodge missus Carew turned sharply an odd look on her face You don t mean Henry Dodge Yes madam His name is Henry I think A flood of color swept into missus Carew s face then receded leaving it whiter than before Very well I I ll attend to it she murmured in a half stifled voice turning away Come Pollyanna we must go now Over at the bed Pollyanna was bidding Jamie a tearful good by But I ll come again I ll come real soon she promised brightly as she hurried through the door after missus Carew Not until they had picked their precarious way down the three long flights of stairs and through the jabbering gesticulating crowd of men women and children that surrounded the scowling Perkins and the limousine did Pollyanna speak again But then she scarcely waited for the irate chauffeur to slam the door upon them before she pleaded Dear missus Carew please please say that it was Jamie Oh it would be so nice for him to be Jamie But he isn t Jamie O dear Are you sure There was a moment s pause then missus Carew covered her face with her hands No I m not sure and that s the tragedy of it she moaned I don t think he is I m almost positive he isn t But of course there IS a chance and that s what s killing me Then can t you just THINK he s Jamie begged Pollyanna and play he was Then you could take him home and But missus Carew turned fiercely Take that boy into my home when he WASN T Jamie Never Pollyanna I couldn t But if you CAN T help Jamie I should think you d be so glad there was some one like him you COULD help urged Pollyanna tremulously What if your Jamie was like this Jamie all poor and sick wouldn t you want some one to take him in and comfort him and Don t don t Pollyanna moaned missus Carew turning her head from side to side in a frenzy of grief When I think that maybe somewhere our Jamie is like that Only a choking sob finished the sentence That s just what I mean that s just what I mean triumphed Pollyanna excitedly Don t you see If this IS your Jamie of course you ll want him and if it isn t you couldn t be doing any harm to the other Jamie by taking this one and you d do a whole lot of good for you d make this one so happy so happy And then by and by if you should find the real Jamie you wouldn t have lost anything but you d have made two little boys happy instead of one and But again missus Carew interrupted her Don t Pollyanna don t I want to think I want to think Tearfully Pollyanna sat back in her seat By a very visible effort she kept still for one whole minute Then as if the words fairly bubbled forth of themselves there came this Oh but what an awful awful place that was I just wish the man that owned it had to live in it himself and then see what he d have to be glad for missus Carew sat suddenly erect Her face showed a curious change Almost as if in appeal she flung out her hand toward Pollyanna Don t she cried Perhaps she didn t know Pollyanna Perhaps she didn t know I m sure she didn t know she owned a place like that But it will be fixed now it will be fixed SHE Is it a woman that owns it and do you know her And do you know the agent too Yes missus Carew bit her lips I know her and I know the agent Oh I m so glad sighed Pollyanna Then it ll be all right now Well it certainly will be better avowed missus Carew with emphasis as the car stopped before her own door missus Carew spoke as if she knew what she was talking about And perhaps indeed she did better than she cared to tell Pollyanna Certainly before she slept that night a letter left her hands addressed to one Henry Dodge summoning him to an immediate conference as to certain changes and repairs to be made at once in tenements she owned There were moreover several scathing sentences concerning rag stuffed windows and rickety stairways that caused this same Henry Dodge to scowl angrily and to say a sharp word behind his teeth though at the same time he paled with something very like fear CHAPTER XI A SURPRISE FOR missus CAREW The matter of repairs and improvements having been properly and efficiently attended to missus Carew told herself that she had done her duty and that the matter was closed She would forget it The boy was not Jamie he could not be Jamie That ignorant sickly crippled boy her dead sister s son Impossible She would cast the whole thing from her thoughts It was just here however that missus Carew found herself against an immovable impassable barrier the whole thing refused to be cast from her thoughts Always before her eyes was the picture of that bare little room and the wistful faced boy Always in her ears was that heartbreaking What if it WERE Jamie And always too there was Pollyanna for even though missus Carew might as she did silence the pleadings and questionings of the little girl s tongue there was no getting away from the prayers and reproaches of the little girl s eyes Twice again in desperation missus Carew went to see the boy telling herself each time that only another visit was needed to convince her that the boy was not the one she sought But even though while there in the boy s presence she told herself that she WAS convinced once away from it the old old questioning returned At last in still greater desperation she wrote to her sister and told her the whole story I had not meant to tell you she wrote after she had stated the bare facts of the case I thought it a pity to harrow you up or to raise false hopes I am so sure it is not he and yet even as I write these words I know I am NOT sure That is why I want you to come why you must come I must have you see him I wonder oh I wonder what you ll say Of course we haven t seen our Jamie since he was four years old He would be twelve now This boy is twelve I should judge He doesn t know his age He has hair and eyes not unlike our Jamie s He is crippled but that condition came upon him through a fall six years ago and was made worse through another one four years later Anything like a complete description of his father s appearance seems impossible to obtain but what I have learned contains nothing conclusive either for or against his being poor Doris s husband He was called the Professor was very queer and seemed to own nothing save a few books This might or might not signify John Kent was certainly always queer and a good deal of a Bohemian in his tastes Whether he cared for books or not I don t remember Do you And of course the title Professor might easily have been assumed if he wished or it might have been merely given him by others As for this boy I don t know I don t know but I do hope YOU will Your distracted sister RUTH Della came at once and she went immediately to see the boy but she did not know Like her sister she said she did not think it was their Jamie but at the same time there was that chance it might be he after all Like Pollyanna however she had what she thought was a very satisfactory way out of the dilemma But why don t you take him dear she proposed to her sister Why don t you take him and adopt him It would be lovely for him poor little fellow and But missus Carew shuddered and would not even let her finish No no I can t I can t she moaned I want my Jamie my own Jamie or no one And with a sigh Della gave it up and went back to her nursing If missus Carew thought that this closed the matter however she was again mistaken for her days were still restless and her nights were still either sleepless or filled with dreams of a may be or a might be masquerading as an it is so She was moreover having a difficult time with Pollyanna Pollyanna was puzzled She was filled with questionings and unrest For the first time in her life Pollyanna had come face to face with real poverty She knew people who did not have enough to eat who wore ragged clothing and who lived in dark dirty and very tiny rooms Her first impulse of course had been to help With missus Carew she made two visits to Jamie and greatly did she rejoice at the changed conditions she found there after that man Dodge had tended to things But this to Pollyanna was a mere drop in the bucket There were yet all those other sick looking men unhappy looking women and ragged children out in the street Jamie s neighbors Confidently she looked to missus Carew for help for them also Indeed exclaimed missus Carew when she learned what was expected of her so you want the whole street to be supplied with fresh paper paint and new stairways do you Pray is there anything else you d like Oh yes lots of things sighed Pollyanna happily You see there are so many things they need all of them And what fun it will be to get them How I wish I was rich so I could help too but I m most as glad to be with you when you get them missus Carew quite gasped aloud in her amazement She lost no time though she did lose not a little patience in explaining that she had no intention of doing anything further in Murphy s Alley and that there was no reason why she should No one would expect her to She had canceled all possible obligations and had even been really very generous any one would say in what she had done for the tenement where lived Jamie and the Murphys That she owned the tenement building she did not think it necessary to state At some length she explained to Pollyanna that there were charitable institutions both numerous and efficient whose business it was to aid all the worthy poor and that to these institutions she gave frequently and liberally Even then however Pollyanna was not convinced But I don t see she argued why it s any better or even so nice for a whole lot of folks to club together and do what everybody would like to do for themselves I m sure I d much rather give Jamie a a nice book now than to have some old Society do it and I KNOW he d like better to have me do it too Very likely returned missus Carew with some weariness and a little exasperation But it is just possible that it would not be so well for Jamie as as if that book were given by a body of people who knew what sort of one to select This led her to say much also none of which Pollyanna in the least understood about pauperizing the poor the evils of indiscriminate giving and the pernicious effect of unorganized charity Besides she added in answer to the still perplexed expression on Pollyanna s worried little face very likely if I offered help to these people they would not take it You remember missus Murphy declined at the first to let me send food and clothing though they accepted it readily enough from their neighbors on the first floor it seems Yes I know sighed Pollyanna turning away There s something there somehow that I don t understand But it doesn t seem right that WE should have such a lot of nice things and that THEY shouldn t have anything hardly As the days passed this feeling on the part of Pollyanna increased rather than diminished and the questions she asked and the comments she made were anything but a relief to the state of mind in which missus Carew herself was Even the test of the glad game in this case Pollyanna was finding to be very near a failure for as she expressed it I don t see how you can find anything about this poor people business to be glad for Of course we can be glad for ourselves that we aren t poor like them but whenever I m thinking how glad I am for that I get so sorry for them that I CAN T be glad any longer Of course we COULD be glad there were poor folks because we could help them But if we DON T help them where s the glad part of that coming in And to this Pollyanna could find no one who could give her a satisfactory answer Especially she asked this question of missus Carew and missus Carew still haunted by the visions of the Jamie that was and the Jamie that might be grew only more restless more wretched and more utterly despairing Nor was she helped any by the approach of Christmas Nowhere was there glow of holly or flash of tinsel that did not carry its pang to her for always to missus Carew it but symbolized a child s empty stocking a stocking that might be Jamie s Finally a week before Christmas she fought what she thought was the last battle with herself Resolutely but with no real joy in her face she gave terse orders to Mary and summoned Pollyanna Pollyanna she began almost harshly I have decided to to take Jamie The car will be here at once I m going after him now and bring him home You may come with me if you like A great light transfigured Pollyanna s face Oh oh oh how glad I am she breathed Why I m so glad I I want to cry missus Carew why is it when you re the very gladdest of anything you always want to cry I don t know I m sure Pollyanna rejoined missus Carew abstractedly On missus Carew s face there was still no look of joy Once in the Murphys little one room tenement it did not take missus Carew long to tell her errand In a few short sentences she told the story of the lost Jamie and of her first hopes that this Jamie might be he She made no secret of her doubts that he was the one at the same time she said she had decided to take him home with her and give him every possible advantage Then a little wearily she told what were the plans she had made for him At the foot of the bed missus Murphy listened crying softly Across the room Jerry Murphy his eyes dilating emitted an occasional low Gee Can ye beat that now As to Jamie Jamie on the bed had listened at first with the air of one to whom suddenly a door has opened into a longed for paradise but gradually as missus Carew talked a new look came to his eyes Very slowly he closed them and turned away his face When missus Carew ceased speaking there was a long silence before Jamie turned his head and answered They saw then that his face was very white and that his eyes were full of tears Thank you missus Carew but I can t go he said simply You can t what cried missus Carew as if she doubted the evidence of her own ears Jamie gasped Pollyanna Oh come kid what s eatin ye scowled Jerry hurriedly coming forward Don t ye know a good thing when ye see it Yes but I can t go said the crippled boy again But Jamie Jamie think THINK what it would mean to you quavered missus Murphy at the foot of the bed I am a thinkin choked Jamie Don t you suppose I know what I m doin what I m givin up Then to missus Carew he turned tear wet eyes I can t he faltered I can t let you do all that for me If you CARED it would be different But you don t care not really You don t WANT me not ME You want the real Jamie and I ain t the real Jamie You don t think I am I can see it in your face I know But but began missus Carew helplessly And it isn t as if as if I was like other boys and could walk either interrupted the cripple feverishly You d get tired of me in no time And I d see it comin I couldn t stand it to be a burden like that Of course if you CARED like mumsey here He threw out his hand choked back a sob then turned his head away again I m not the Jamie you want I can t go he said With the words his thin boyish hand fell clenched till the knuckles showed white against the tattered old shawl that covered the bed There was a moment s breathless hush then very quietly missus Carew got to her feet Her face was colorless but there was that in it that silenced the sob that rose to Pollyanna s lips Come Pollyanna was all she said Well if you ain t the fool limit babbled Jerry Murphy to the boy on the bed as the door closed a moment later But the boy on the bed was crying very much as if the closing door had been the one that had led to paradise and that had closed now forever CHAPTER XII FROM BEHIND A COUNTER missus Carew was very angry To have brought herself to the point where she was willing to take this lame boy into her home and then to have the lad calmly refuse to come was unbearable missus Carew was not in the habit of having her invitations ignored or her wishes scorned Furthermore now that she could not have the boy she was conscious of an almost frantic terror lest he were after all the real Jamie She knew then that her true reason for wanting him had been not because she cared for him not even because she wished to help him and make him happy but because she hoped by taking him that she would ease her own mind and forever silence that awful eternal questioning on her part What if he WERE her own Jamie It certainly had not helped matters any that the boy had divined her state of mind and had given as the reason for his refusal that she did not care To be sure missus Carew now very proudly told herself that she did not indeed care that he was NOT her sister s boy and that she would forget all about it But she did not forget all about it However insistently she might disclaim responsibility and relationship just as insistently responsibility and relationship thrust themselves upon her in the shape of panicky doubts and however resolutely she turned her thoughts to other matters just so resolutely visions of a wistful eyed boy in a poverty stricken room loomed always before her Then too there was Pollyanna Clearly Pollyanna was not herself at all In a most unPollyanna like spirit she moped about the house finding apparently no interest anywhere Oh no I m not sick she would answer when remonstrated with and questioned But what IS the trouble Why nothing It it s only that I was thinking of Jamie you know how HE hasn t got all these beautiful things carpets and pictures and curtains It was the same with her food Pollyanna was actually losing her appetite but here again she disclaimed sickness Oh no she would sigh mournfully It s just that I don t seem hungry Some way just as soon as I begin to eat I think of Jamie and how HE doesn t have only old doughnuts and dry rolls and then I I don t want anything missus Carew spurred by a feeling that she herself only dimly understood and recklessly determined to bring about some change in Pollyanna at all costs ordered a huge tree two dozen wreaths and quantities of holly and Christmas baubles For the first time in many years the house was aflame and aglitter with scarlet and tinsel There was even to be a Christmas party for missus Carew had told Pollyanna to invite half a dozen of her schoolgirl friends for the tree on Christmas Eve But even here missus Carew met with disappointment for though Pollyanna was always grateful and at times interested and even excited she still carried frequently a sober little face And in the end the Christmas party was more of a sorrow than a joy for the first glimpse of the glittering tree sent her into a storm of sobs Why Pollyanna ejaculated missus Carew What in the world is the matter now N n nothing wept Pollyanna It s only that it s so perfectly perfectly beautiful that I just had to cry I was thinking how Jamie would love to see it It was then that missus Carew s patience snapped Jamie Jamie Jamie she exclaimed Pollyanna CAN T you stop talking about that boy You know perfectly well that it is not my fault that he is not here I asked him to come here to live Besides where is that glad game of yours I think it would be an excellent idea if you would play it on this I AM playing it quavered Pollyanna And that s what I don t understand I never knew it to act so funny Why before when I ve been glad about things I ve been happy But now about Jamie I m so glad I ve got carpets and pictures and nice things to eat and that I can walk and run and go to school and all that but the harder I m glad for myself the sorrier I am for him I never knew the game to act so funny and I don t know what ails it Do you But missus Carew with a despairing gesture merely turned away without a word It was the day after Christmas that something so wonderful happened that Pollyanna for a time almost forgot Jamie missus Carew had taken her shopping and it was while missus Carew was trying to decide between a duchesse lace and a point lace collar that Pollyanna chanced to spy farther down the counter a face that looked vaguely familiar For a moment she regarded it frowningly then with a little cry she ran down the aisle Oh it s you it IS you she exclaimed joyously to a girl who was putting into the show case a tray of pink bows I m so glad to see you The girl behind the counter lifted her head and stared at Pollyanna in amazement But almost immediately her dark somber face lighted with a smile of glad recognition Well well if it isn t my little Public Garden kiddie she ejaculated Yes I m so glad you remembered beamed Pollyanna But you never came again I looked for you lots of times I couldn t I had to work That was our last half holiday and Fifty cents madam she broke off in answer to a sweet faced old lady s question as to the price of a black and white bow on the counter Fifty cents Hm m The old lady fingered the bow hesitated then laid it down with a sigh Hm yes well it s very pretty I m sure my dear she said as she passed on Immediately behind her came two bright faced girls who with much giggling and bantering picked out a jeweled creation of scarlet velvet and a fairy like structure of tulle and pink buds As the girls turned chattering away Pollyanna drew an ecstatic sigh Is this what you do all day My how glad you must be you chose this GLAD Yes It must be such fun such lots of folks you know and all different And you can talk to em You HAVE to talk to em it s your business I should love that I think I ll do this when I grow up It must be such fun to see what they all buy Fun Glad bristled the girl behind the counter Well child I guess if you knew half That s a dollar madam she interrupted herself hastily in answer to a young woman s sharp question as to the price of a flaring yellow bow of beaded velvet in the show case Well I should think twas time you told me snapped the young woman I had to ask you twice The girl behind the counter bit her lip I didn t hear you madam I can t help that It is your business TO hear You are paid for it aren t you How much is that black one Fifty cents And that blue one One dollar No impudence miss You needn t be so short about it or I shall report you Let me see that tray of pink ones The salesgirl s lips opened then closed in a thin straight line Obediently she reached into the show case and took out the tray of pink bows but her eyes flashed and her hands shook visibly as she set the tray down on the counter The young woman whom she was serving picked up five bows asked the price of four of them then turned away with a brief I see nothing I care for Well said the girl behind the counter in a shaking voice to the wide eyed Pollyanna what do you think of my business now Anything to be glad about there Pollyanna giggled a little hysterically My wasn t she cross But she was kind of funny too don t you think Anyhow you can be glad that that they aren t ALL like HER can t you I suppose so said the girl with a faint smile But I can tell you right now kiddie that glad game of yours you was tellin me about that day in the Garden may be all very well for you but Once more she stopped with a tired Fifty cents madam in answer to a question from the other side of the counter Are you as lonesome as ever asked Pollyanna wistfully when the salesgirl was at liberty again Well I can t say I ve given more n five parties nor been to more n seven since I saw you replied the girl so bitterly that Pollyanna detected the sarcasm Oh but you did something nice Christmas didn t you Oh yes I stayed in bed all day with my feet done up in rags and read four newspapers and one magazine Then at night I hobbled out to a restaurant where I had to blow in thirty five cents for chicken pie instead of a quarter But what ailed your feet Blistered Standin on em Christmas rush Oh shuddered Pollyanna sympathetically And you didn t have any tree or party or anything she cried distressed and shocked Well hardly O dear How I wish you could have seen mine sighed the little girl It was just lovely and But oh say she exclaimed joyously You can see it after all It isn t gone yet Now can t you come out to night or to morrow night and PollyANNA interrupted missus Carew in her chilliest accents What in the world does this mean Where have you been I have looked everywhere for you I even went way back to the suit department Pollyanna turned with a happy little cry Oh missus Carew I m so glad you ve come she rejoiced This is well I don t know her name yet but I know HER so it s all right I met her in the Public Garden ever so long ago And she s lonesome and doesn t know anybody And her father was a minister like mine only he s alive And she didn t have any Christmas tree only blistered feet and chicken pie and I want her to see mine you know the tree I mean plunged on Pollyanna breathlessly I ve asked her to come out to night or to morrow night And you ll let me have it all lighted up again won t you Illustration I don t know her name yet but I know HER so it s all right Well really Pollyanna began missus Carew in cold disapproval But the girl behind the counter interrupted with a voice quite as cold and even more disapproving Don t worry madam I ve no notion of goin Oh but PLEASE begged Pollyanna You don t know how I want you and I notice the lady ain t doin any askin interrupted the salesgirl a little maliciously missus Carew flushed an angry red and turned as if to go but Pollyanna caught her arm and held it talking meanwhile almost frenziedly to the girl behind the counter who happened at the moment to be free from customers Oh but she will she will Pollyanna was saying She wants you to come I know she does Why you don t know how good she is and how much money she gives to to charitable sociations and everything PollyANNA remonstrated missus Carew sharply Once more she would have gone but this time she was held spellbound by the ringing scorn in the low tense voice of the salesgirl Oh yes I know There s lots of em that ll give to RESCUE work There s always plenty of helpin hands stretched out to them that has gone wrong And that s all right I ain t findin no fault with that Only sometimes I wonder there don t some of em think of helpin the girls BEFORE they go wrong Why don t they give GOOD girls pretty homes with books and pictures and soft carpets and music and somebody round em to care Maybe then there wouldn t be so many Good heavens what am I sayin she broke off under her breath Then with the old weariness she turned to a young woman who had stopped before her and picked up a blue bow That s fifty cents madam missus Carew heard as she hurried Pollyanna away CHAPTER XIII A WAITING AND A WINNING It was a delightful plan Pollyanna had it entirely formulated in about five minutes then she told missus Carew missus Carew did not think it was a delightful plan and she said so very distinctly Oh but I m sure THEY LL think it is argued Pollyanna in reply to missus Carew s objections And just think how easy we can do it The tree is just as it was except for the presents and we can get more of those It won t be so very long till just New Year s Eve and only think how glad she ll be to come Wouldn t YOU be if you hadn t had anything for Christmas only blistered feet and chicken pie Dear dear what an impossible child you are frowned missus Carew Even yet it doesn t seem to occur to you that we don t know this young person s name So we don t And isn t it funny when I feel that I know HER so well smiled Pollyanna You see we had such a good talk in the Garden that day and she told me all about how lonesome she was and that she thought the lonesomest place in the world was in a crowd in a big city because folks didn t think nor notice Oh there was one that noticed but he noticed too much she said and he hadn t ought to notice her any which is kind of funny isn t it when you come to think of it But anyhow he came for her there in the Garden to go somewhere with him and she wouldn t go and he was a real handsome gentleman too until he began to look so cross just at the last Folks aren t so pretty when they re cross are they Now there was a lady to day looking at bows and she said well lots of things that weren t nice you know And SHE didn t look pretty either after after she began to talk But you will let me have the tree New Year s Eve won t you missus Carew and invite this girl who sells bows and Jamie He s better you know now and he COULD come Of course Jerry would have to wheel him but then we d want Jerry anyway Oh of course JERRY exclaimed missus Carew in ironic scorn But why stop with Jerry I m sure Jerry has hosts of friends who would love to come And Oh missus Carew MAY I broke in Pollyanna in uncontrollable delight Oh how good GOOD GOOD you are I ve so wanted But missus Carew fairly gasped aloud in surprise and dismay No no Pollyanna I she began protestingly But Pollyanna entirely mistaking the meaning of her interruption plunged in again in stout championship Indeed you ARE good just the bestest ever and I sha n t let you say you aren t Now I reckon I ll have a party all right There s Tommy Dolan and his sister Jennie and the two Macdonald children and three girls whose names I don t know that live under the Murphys and a whole lot more if we have room for em And only think how glad they ll be when I tell em Why missus Carew seems to me as if I never knew anything so perfectly lovely in all my life and it s all your doings Now mayn t I begin right away to invite em so they ll KNOW what s coming to em And missus Carew who would not have believed such a thing possible heard herself murmuring a faint yes which she knew bound her to the giving of a Christmas tree party on New Year s Eve to a dozen children from Murphy s Alley and a young salesgirl whose name she did not know Perhaps in missus Carew s memory was still lingering a young girl s Sometimes I wonder there don t some of em think of helpin the girls BEFORE they go wrong Perhaps in her ears was still ringing Pollyanna s story of that same girl who had found a crowd in a big city the loneliest place in the world yet who had refused to go with the handsome man that had noticed too much Perhaps in missus Carew s heart was the undefined hope that somewhere in it all lay the peace she had so longed for Perhaps it was a little of all three combined with utter helplessness in the face of Pollyanna s amazing twisting of her irritated sarcasm into the wide sweeping hospitality of a willing hostess Whatever it was the thing was done and at once missus Carew found herself caught into a veritable whirl of plans and plottings the center of which was always Pollyanna and the party To her sister missus Carew wrote distractedly of the whole affair closing with What I m going to do I don t know but I suppose I shall have to keep right on doing as I am doing There is no other way Of course if Pollyanna once begins to preach but she hasn t yet so I can t with a clear conscience send her back to you Della reading this letter at the Sanatorium laughed aloud at the conclusion Hasn t preached yet indeed she chuckled to herself Bless her dear heart And yet you Ruth Carew own up to giving two Christmas tree parties within a week and as I happen to know your home which used to be shrouded in death like gloom is aflame with scarlet and green from top to toe But she hasn t preached yet oh no she hasn t preached yet The party was a great success Even missus Carew admitted that Jamie in his wheel chair Jerry with his startling but expressive vocabulary and the girl whose name proved to be Sadie Dean vied with each other in amusing the more diffident guests Sadie Dean much to the others surprise and perhaps to her own disclosed an intimate knowledge of the most fascinating games and these games with Jamie s stories and Jerry s good natured banter kept every one in gales of laughter until supper and the generous distribution of presents from the laden tree sent the happy guests home with tired sighs of content If Jamie who with Jerry was the last to leave looked about him a bit wistfully no one apparently noticed it Yet missus Carew when she bade him good night said low in his ear half impatiently half embarrassedly Well Jamie have you changed your mind about coming The boy hesitated A faint color stole into his cheeks He turned and looked into her eyes wistfully searchingly Then very slowly he shook his head If it could always be like to night I could he sighed But it wouldn t There d be to morrow and next week and next month and next year comin and I d know before next week that I hadn t oughter come If missus Carew had thought that the New Year s Eve party was to end the matter of Pollyanna s efforts in behalf of Sadie Dean she was soon undeceived for the very next morning Pollyanna began to talk of her And I m so glad I found her again she prattled contentedly Even if I haven t been able to find the real Jamie for you I ve found somebody else for you to love and of course you ll love to love her cause it s just another way of loving Jamie missus Carew drew in her breath and gave a little gasp of exasperation This unfailing faith in her goodness of heart and unhesitating belief in her desire to help everybody was most disconcerting and sometimes most annoying At the same time it was a most difficult thing to disclaim under the circumstances especially with Pollyanna s happy confident eyes full on her face But Pollyanna she objected impotently at last feeling very much as if she were struggling against invisible silken cords I you this girl really isn t Jamie at all you know I know she isn t sympathized Pollyanna quickly And of course I m just as sorry she ISN T Jamie as can be But she s somebody s Jamie that is I mean she hasn t got anybody down here to love her and and notice you know and so whenever you remember Jamie I should think you couldn t be glad enough there was SOMEBODY you could help just as you d want folks to help Jamie wherever HE is missus Carew shivered and gave a little moan But I want MY Jamie she grieved Pollyanna nodded with understanding eyes I know the child s presence mister Pendleton told me about it only you ve GOT the woman s hand Woman s hand Yes to make a home you know He said that it took a woman s hand or a child s presence to make a home That was when he wanted me and I found him Jimmy and he adopted him instead JIMMY missus Carew looked up with the startled something in her eyes that always came into them at the mention of any variant of that name Yes Jimmy Bean Oh BEAN said missus Carew relaxing Yes He was from an Orphan s Home and he ran away I found him He said he wanted another kind of a home with a mother in it instead of a Matron I couldn t find him the mother part but I found him mister Pendleton and he adopted him His name is Jimmy Pendleton now But it was Bean Yes it was Bean Oh said missus Carew this time with a long sigh missus Carew saw a good deal of Sadie Dean during the days that followed the New Year s Eve party She saw a good deal of Jamie too In one way and another Pollyanna contrived to have them frequently at the house and this missus Carew much to her surprise and vexation could not seem to prevent Her consent and even her delight were taken by Pollyanna as so much a matter of course that she found herself helpless to convince the child that neither approval nor satisfaction entered into the matter at all as far as she was concerned But missus Carew whether she herself realized it or not was learning many things things she never could have learned in the old days shut up in her rooms with orders to Mary to admit no one She was learning something of what it means to be a lonely young girl in a big city with one s living to earn and with no one to care except one who cares too much and too little But what did you mean she nervously asked Sadie Dean one evening what did you mean that first day in the store what you said about helping the girls Sadie Dean colored distressfully I m afraid I was rude she apologized Never mind that Tell me what you meant I ve thought of it so many times since For a moment the girl was silent then a little bitterly she said Twas because I knew a girl once and I was thinkin of her She came from my town and she was pretty and good but she wa n t over strong For a year we pulled together sharin the same room boiling our eggs over the same gas jet and eatin our hash and fish balls for supper at the same cheap restaurant There was never anything to do evenin s but to walk in the Common or go to the movies if we had the dime to blow in or just stay in our room Well our room wasn t very pleasant It was hot in summer and cold in winter and the gas jet was so measly and so flickery that we couldn t sew or read even if we hadn t been too fagged out to do either which we most generally was Besides over our heads was a squeaky board that some one was always rockin on and under us was a feller that was learnin to play the cornet Did you ever hear any one learn to play the cornet N no I don t think so murmured missus Carew Well you ve missed a lot said the girl dryly Then after a moment she resumed her story Sometimes specially at Christmas and holidays we used to walk up here on the Avenue and other streets huntin for windows where the curtains were up and we could look in You see we were pretty lonesome them days specially and we said it did us good to see homes with folks and lamps on the center tables and children playin games but we both of us knew that really it only made us feel worse than ever because we were so hopelessly out of it all Twas even harder to see the automobiles and the gay young folks in them laughing and chatting You see we were young and I suspect we wanted to laugh and chatter We wanted a good time too and by and by my chum began to have it this good time Well to make a long story short we broke partnership one day and she went her way and I mine I didn t like the company she was keepin and I said so She wouldn t give em up so we quit I didn t see her again for most two years then I got a note from her and I went This was just last month She was in one of them rescue homes It was a lovely place soft rugs fine pictures plants flowers and books a piano a beautiful room and everything possible done for her Rich women came in their automobiles and carriages to take her driving and she was taken to concerts and matinees She was learnin stenography and they were going to help her to a position just as soon as she could take it Everybody was wonderfully good to her she said and showed they wanted to help her in every way But she said something else too She said Sadie if they d taken one half the pains to show me they cared and wanted to help long ago when I was an honest self respectin hard workin homesick girl I wouldn t have been here for them to help now And well I never forgot it That s all It ain t that I m objectin to the rescue work it s a fine thing and they ought to do it Only I m thinkin there wouldn t be quite so much of it for them to do if they d just show a little of their interest earlier in the game But I thought there were working girls homes and and settlement houses that that did that sort of thing faltered missus Carew in a voice that few of her friends would have recognized There are Did you ever see the inside of one of them Why n no though I I have given money to them This time missus Carew s voice was almost apologetically pleading in tone Sadie Dean smiled curiously Yes I know There are lots of good women that have given money to them and have never seen the inside of one of them Please don t understand that I m sayin anythin against the homes I m not They re good things They re almost the only thing that s doing anything to help but they re only a drop in the bucket to what is really needed I tried one once but there was an air about it somehow I felt But there what s the use Probably they aren t all like that one and maybe the fault was with me If I should try to tell you you wouldn t understand You d have to live in it and you haven t even seen the inside of one But I can t help wonderin sometimes why so many of those good women never seem to put the real HEART and INTEREST into the preventin that they do into the rescuin But there I didn t mean to talk such a lot But you asked me Yes I asked you said missus Carew in a half stifled voice as she turned away Not only from Sadie Dean however was missus Carew learning things never learned before but from Jamie also Jamie was there a great deal Pollyanna liked to have him there and he liked to be there At first to be sure he had hesitated but very soon he had quieted his doubts and yielded to his longings by telling himself and Pollyanna that after all visiting was not staying for keeps missus Carew often found the boy and Pollyanna contentedly settled on the library window seat with the empty wheel chair close by Sometimes they were poring over a book She heard Jamie tell Pollyanna one day that he didn t think he d mind so very much being lame if he had so many books as missus Carew and that he guessed he d be so happy he d fly clean away if he had both books and legs Sometimes the boy was telling stories and Pollyanna was listening wide eyed and absorbed missus Carew wondered at Pollyanna s interest until one day she herself stopped and listened After that she wondered no longer but she listened a good deal longer Crude and incorrect as was much of the boy s language it was always wonderfully vivid and picturesque so that missus Carew found herself hand in hand with Pollyanna trailing down the Golden Ages at the beck of a glowing eyed boy Dimly missus Carew was beginning to realize too something of what it must mean to be in spirit and ambition the center of brave deeds and wonderful adventures while in reality one was only a crippled boy in a wheel chair But what missus Carew did not realize was the part this crippled boy was beginning to play in her own life She did not realize how much a matter of course his presence was becoming nor how interested she now was in finding something new for Jamie to see Neither did she realize how day by day he was coming to seem to her more and more the lost Jamie her dead sister s child As February March and April passed however and May came bringing with it the near approach of the date set for Pollyanna s home going missus Carew did suddenly awake to the knowledge of what that home going was to mean to her She was amazed and appalled Up to now she had in belief looked forward with pleasure to the departure of Pollyanna She had said that then once again the house would be quiet with the glaring sun shut out Once again she would be at peace and able to hide herself away from the annoying tiresome world Once again she would be free to summon to her aching consciousness all those dear memories of the lost little lad who had so long ago stepped into that vast unknown and closed the door behind him All this she had believed would be the case when Pollyanna should go home But now that Pollyanna was really going home the picture was far different The quiet house with the sun shut out had become one that promised to be gloomy and unbearable The longed for peace would be wretched loneliness and as for her being able to hide herself away from the annoying tiresome world and free to summon to her aching consciousness all those dear memories of that lost little lad just as if anything could blot out those other aching memories of the new Jamie who yet might be the old Jamie with his pitiful pleading eyes Full well now missus Carew knew that without Pollyanna the house would be empty but that without the lad Jamie it would be worse than that To her pride this knowledge was not pleasing To her heart it was torture since the boy had twice said that he would not come For a time during those last few days of Pollyanna s stay the struggle was a bitter one though pride always kept the ascendancy Then on what missus Carew knew would be Jamie s last visit her heart triumphed and once more she asked Jamie to come and be to her the Jamie that was lost What she said she never could remember afterwards but what the boy said she never forgot After all it was compassed in six short words For what seemed a long long minute his eyes had searched her face then to his own had come a transfiguring light as he breathed Oh yes Why you CARE now

none	none	 JIMMY AND THE GREEN EYED MONSTER 
188_141613_000005_000000	train-clean-360	This time Beldingsville did not literally welcome Pollyanna home with brass bands and bunting perhaps because the hour of her expected arrival was known to but few of the townspeople 
188_141613_000005_000001	train-clean-360	But there certainly was no lack of joyful greetings on the part of everybody from the moment she stepped from the railway train with her Aunt Polly and doctor Chilton 
188_141613_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Nor did Pollyanna lose any time in starting on a round of fly away minute calls on all her old friends 
188_141613_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Indeed for the next few days according to Nancy There wasn t no putting of your finger on her anywheres for by the time you d got your finger down she wa n t there 
188_141613_000006_000000	train-clean-360	And always everywhere she went Pollyanna met the question Well how did you like Boston Perhaps to no one did she answer this more fully than she did to mister Pendleton 
188_141613_000006_000001	train-clean-360	As was usually the case when this question was put to her she began her reply with a troubled frown 
188_141613_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I liked it I just loved it some of it 
188_141613_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 But not all of it smiled mister Pendleton 
none	none	No 
188_141613_000009_000001	train-clean-360	There s parts of it Oh I was glad to be there she explained hastily 
188_141613_000009_000002	train-clean-360	 I had a perfectly lovely time and lots of things were so queer and different you know like eating dinner at night instead of noons when you ought to eat it 
188_141613_000009_000003	train-clean-360	But everybody was so good to me and I saw such a lot of wonderful things Bunker Hill and the Public Garden and the Seeing Boston autos and miles of pictures and statues and store windows and streets that didn t have any end 
188_141613_000009_000004	train-clean-360	And folks 
none	none	I never saw such a lot of folks
188_141613_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I m sure I thought you liked folks commented the man 
188_141613_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I do Pollyanna frowned again and pondered 
none	none	But what s the use of such a lot of them if you don t know em 
188_141613_000011_000002	train-clean-360	And missus Carew wouldn t let me 
188_141613_000011_000003	train-clean-360	She didn t know em herself 
188_141613_000011_000004	train-clean-360	She said folks didn t down there 
188_141613_000012_000000	train-clean-360	There was a slight pause then with a sigh Pollyanna resumed 
none	none	I reckon maybe that s the part I don t like the most that folks don t know each other 
188_141613_000013_000001	train-clean-360	It would be such a lot nicer if they did 
188_141613_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Why just think mister Pendleton there are lots of folks that live on dirty narrow streets and don t even have beans and fish balls to eat nor things even as good as missionary barrels to wear 
188_141613_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Then there are other folks missus 
188_141613_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Carew and a whole lot like her that live in perfectly beautiful houses and have more things to eat and wear than they know what to do with 
188_141613_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Now if THOSE folks only knew the other folks But mister Pendleton interrupted with a laugh 
188_141613_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear child did it ever occur to you that these people don t CARE to know each other he asked quizzically 
188_141613_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh but some of them do maintained Pollyanna in eager defense Now there s Sadie Dean she sells bows lovely bows in a big store she WANTS to know people and I introduced her to missus Carew and we had her up to the house and we had Jamie and lots of others there too and she was SO glad to know them 
none	none	And that s what made me think that if only a lot of missus Carew s kind could know the other kind but of course I couldn t do the introducing I didn t know many of them myself anyway 
188_141613_000015_000003	train-clean-360	But if they COULD know each other so that the rich people could give the poor people part of their money 
188_141613_000016_000000	train-clean-360	But again mister Pendleton interrupted with a laugh 
188_141613_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Pollyanna Pollyanna he chuckled I m afraid you re getting into pretty deep water 
none	none	You ll be a rabid little socialist before you know it
188_141613_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 A what questioned the little girl dubiously 
188_141613_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 I I don t think I know what a socialist is 
none	none	But I know what being SOCIABLE is and I like folks that are that 
188_141613_000018_000003	train-clean-360	If it s anything like that I don t mind being one a mite 
188_141613_000018_000004	train-clean-360	I d like to be one 
188_141613_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t doubt it Pollyanna smiled the man 
188_141613_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 But when it comes to this scheme of yours for the wholesale distribution of wealth you ve got a problem on your hands that you might have difficulty with 
none	none	Pollyanna drew a long sigh I know she nodded
188_141613_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 That s the way missus Carew talked 
188_141613_000021_000002	train-clean-360	She says I don t understand that twould er pauperize her and be indiscriminate and pernicious and Well it was SOMETHING like that anyway bridled the little girl aggrievedly as the man began to laugh 
188_141613_000021_000003	train-clean-360	 And anyway I DON T understand why some folks should have such a lot and other folks shouldn t have anything and I DON T like it 
188_141613_000021_000004	train-clean-360	And if I ever have a lot I shall just give some of it to folks who don t have any even if it does make me pauperized and pernicious and But mister Pendleton was laughing so hard now that Pollyanna after a moment s struggle surrendered and laughed with him 
188_141613_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Well anyway she reiterated when she had caught her breath I don t understand it all the same 
188_141613_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 No dear I m afraid you don t agreed the man growing suddenly very grave and tender eyed nor any of the rest of us for that matter 
188_141613_000023_000001	train-clean-360	But tell me he added after a minute who is this Jamie you ve been talking so much about since you came 
188_141613_000024_000000	train-clean-360	And Pollyanna told him 
188_141613_000025_000000	train-clean-360	In talking of Jamie Pollyanna lost her worried baffled look Pollyanna loved to talk of Jamie 
188_141613_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Here was something she understood Here was no problem that had to deal with big fearsome sounding words 
188_141613_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Besides in this particular instance would not mister Pendleton be especially interested in missus Carew s taking the boy into her home for who better than himself could understand the need of a child s presence 
188_141613_000026_000000	train-clean-360	For that matter Pollyanna talked to everybody about Jamie 
188_141613_000026_000001	train-clean-360	She assumed that everybody would be as interested as she herself was 
188_141613_000026_000002	train-clean-360	On most occasions she was not disappointed in the interest shown but one day she met with a surprise 
188_141613_000026_000003	train-clean-360	It came through Jimmy Pendleton 
188_141613_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Say look a here he demanded one afternoon irritably 
188_141613_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 Wasn t there ANYBODY else down to Boston but just that everlasting Jamie 
188_141613_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Jimmy Bean what do you mean cried Pollyanna 
188_141613_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The boy lifted his chin a little 
none	none	I m not Jimmy Bean 
188_141613_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I m Jimmy Pendleton 
188_141613_000030_000002	train-clean-360	And I mean that I should think from your talk that there wasn t ANYBODY down to Boston but just that loony boy who calls them birds and squirrels Lady Lancelot and all that tommyrot 
188_141613_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Jimmy Be Pendleton gasped Pollyanna 
188_141613_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Then with some spirit Jamie isn t loony 
188_141613_000031_000002	train-clean-360	He is a very nice boy 
188_141613_000031_000003	train-clean-360	And he knows a lot books and stories 
188_141613_000031_000004	train-clean-360	Why he can MAKE stories right out of his own head Besides it isn t Lady Lancelot it s Sir Lancelot If you knew half as much as he does you d know that too she finished with flashing eyes 
188_141613_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Jimmy Pendleton flushed miserably and looked utterly wretched 
188_141613_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Growing more and more jealous moment by moment still doggedly he held his ground 
none	none	Well anyhow he scoffed I don t think much of his name Jamie Humph sounds sissy 
188_141613_000033_000002	train-clean-360	And I know somebody else that said so too 
188_141613_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Who was it 
none	none	There was no answer WHO WAS IT demanded Pollyanna more peremptorily Dad The boy s voice was sullen
188_141613_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Your dad repeated Pollyanna in amazement 
188_141613_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 Why how could he know Jamie 
188_141613_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 He didn t Twasn t about that Jamie Twas about me The boy still spoke sullenly with his eyes turned away 
188_141613_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Yet there was a curious softness in his voice that was always noticeable whenever he spoke of his father 
none	none	YOU Yes Twas just a little while before he died 
188_141613_000041_000001	train-clean-360	We stopped most a week with a farmer 
188_141613_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Dad helped about the hayin and I did too some The farmer s wife was awful good to me and pretty quick she was callin me Jamie I don t know why but she just did 
188_141613_000041_000003	train-clean-360	And one day father heard her 
188_141613_000041_000004	train-clean-360	He got awful mad so mad that I remembered it always what he said 
188_141613_000041_000005	train-clean-360	He said Jamie wasn t no sort of a name for a boy and that no son of his should ever be called it 
188_141613_000041_000006	train-clean-360	He said twas a sissy name and he hated it 
none	none	Seems so I never saw him so mad as he was that night 
188_141613_000041_000008	train-clean-360	He wouldn t even stay to finish the work but him and me took to the road again that night 
188_141613_000041_000009	train-clean-360	I was kind of sorry cause I liked her the farmer s wife I mean 
188_141613_000041_000010	train-clean-360	She was good to me 
188_141613_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Pollyanna nodded all sympathy and interest 
188_141613_000042_000001	train-clean-360	It was not often that Jimmy said much of that mysterious past life of his before she had known him 
188_141613_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 And what happened next she prompted 
188_141613_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Pollyanna had for the moment forgotten all about the original subject of the controversy the name Jamie that was dubbed sissy 
188_141613_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The boy sighed 
188_141613_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 We just went on till we found another place 
188_141613_000045_000001	train-clean-360	And twas there dad died 
188_141613_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Then they put me in the sylum 
188_141613_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 And then you ran away and I found you that day down by missus Snow s exulted Pollyanna softly 
188_141613_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 And I ve known you ever since 
188_141613_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes and you ve known me ever since repeated Jimmy but in a far different voice Jimmy had suddenly come back to the present and to his grievance 
188_141613_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 But then I ain t JAMIE you know he finished with scornful emphasis as he turned loftily away leaving a distressed bewildered Pollyanna behind him 
none	none	Well anyway I can be glad he doesn t always act like this sighed the little girl as she mournfully watched the sturdy boyish figure with its disagreeable amazing swagger CHAPTER XV AUNT POLLY TAKES ALARM Pollyanna had been at home about a week when the letter from Della Wetherby came to missus Chilton I wish I could make you see what your little niece has done for my sister wrote Miss Wetherby but I m afraid I can t You would have to know what she was before You did see her to be sure and perhaps you saw something of the hush and gloom in which she has shrouded herself for so many years But you can have no conception of her bitterness of heart her lack of aim and interest her insistence upon eternal mourning Then came Pollyanna Probably I didn t tell you but my sister regretted her promise to take the child almost the minute it was given and she made the stern stipulation that the moment Pollyanna began to preach back she should come to me Well she hasn t preached at least my sister says she hasn t and my sister ought to know And yet well just let me tell you what I found when I went to see her yesterday Perhaps nothing else could give you a better idea of what that wonderful little Pollyanna of yours has accomplished To begin with as I approached the house I saw that nearly all the shades were up they used to be down way down to the sill The minute I stepped into the hall I heard music Parsifal The drawing rooms were open and the air was sweet with roses missus Carew and Master Jamie are in the music room said the maid And there I found them my sister and the youth she has taken into her home listening to one of those modern contrivances that can hold an entire opera company including the orchestra The boy was in a wheel chair He was pale but plainly beatifically happy My sister looked ten years younger Her usually colorless cheeks showed a faint pink and her eyes glowed and sparkled A little later after I had talked a few minutes with the boy my sister and I went up stairs to her own rooms and there she talked to me of Jamie Not of the old Jamie as she used to with tear wet eyes and hopeless sighs but of the new Jamie and there were no sighs nor tears now There was instead the eagerness of enthusiastic interest Della he s wonderful she began Everything that is best in music art and literature seems to appeal to him in a perfectly marvelous fashion only of course he needs development and training That s what I m going to see that he gets A tutor is coming to morrow Of course his language is something awful at the same time he has read so many good books that his vocabulary is quite amazing and you should hear the stories he can reel off Of course in general education he is very deficient but he s eager to learn so that will soon be remedied He loves music and I shall give him what training in that he wishes I have already put in a stock of carefully selected records I wish you could have seen his face when he first heard that Holy Grail music He knows all about King Arthur and his Round Table and he prattles of knights and lords and ladies as you and I do of the members of our own family only sometimes I don t know whether his Sir Lancelot means the ancient knight or a squirrel in the Public Garden And Della I believe he can be made to walk I m going to have doctor Ames see him anyway and And so on and on she talked while I sat amazed and tongue tied but oh so happy I tell you all this dear missus Chilton so you can see for yourself how interested she is how eagerly she is going to watch this boy s growth and development and how in spite of herself it is all going to change her attitude toward life She CAN T do what she is doing for this boy Jamie and not do for herself at the same time Never again I believe will she be the soured morose woman she was before And it s all because of Pollyanna Pollyanna Dear child and the best part of it is she is so unconscious of the whole thing I don t believe even my sister yet quite realizes what is taking place within her own heart and life and certainly Pollyanna doesn t least of all does she realize the part she played in the change And now dear missus Chilton how can I thank you I know I can t so I m not even going to try Yet in your heart I believe you know how grateful I am to both you and Pollyanna DELLA WETHERBY Well it seems to have worked a cure all right smiled doctor Chilton when his wife had finished reading the letter to him To his surprise she lifted a quick remonstrative hand Thomas don t please she begged Why Polly what s the matter Aren t you glad that that the medicine worked missus Chilton dropped despairingly back in her chair There you go again Thomas she sighed Of COURSE I m glad that this misguided woman has forsaken the error of her ways and found that she can be of use to some one And of course I m glad that Pollyanna did it But I am not glad to have that child continually spoken of as if she were a a bottle of medicine or a cure Don t you see Nonsense After all where s the harm I ve called Pollyanna a tonic ever since I knew her Harm Thomas Chilton that child is growing older every day Do you want to spoil her Thus far she has been utterly unconscious of her extraordinary power And therein lies the secret of her success The minute she CONSCIOUSLY sets herself to reform somebody you know as well as I do that she will be simply impossible Consequently Heaven forbid that she ever gets it into her head that she s anything like a cure all for poor sick suffering humanity Nonsense I wouldn t worry laughed the doctor But I do worry Thomas But Polly think of what she s done argued the doctor Think of missus Snow and John Pendleton and quantities of others why they re not the same people at all that they used to be any more than missus Carew is And Pollyanna did do it bless her heart I know she did nodded missus Polly Chilton emphatically But I don t want Pollyanna to know she did it Oh of course she knows it in a way She knows she taught them to play the glad game with her and that they are lots happier in consequence And that s all right It s a game HER game and they re playing it together To you I will admit that Pollyanna has preached to us one of the most powerful sermons I ever heard but the minute SHE knows it well I don t want her to That s all And right now let me tell you that I ve decided that I will go to Germany with you this fall At first I thought I wouldn t I didn t want to leave Pollyanna and I m not going to leave her now I m going to take her with me Take her with us Good Why not I ve got to That s all Furthermore I should be glad to plan to stay a few years just as you said you d like to I want to get Pollyanna away quite away from Beldingsville for a while I d like to keep her sweet and unspoiled if I can And she shall not get silly notions into her head if I can help myself Why Thomas Chilton do we want that child made an insufferable little prig We certainly don t laughed the doctor But for that matter I don t believe anything or anybody could make her so However this Germany idea suits me to a T You know I didn t want to come away when I did if it hadn t been for Pollyanna So the sooner we get back there the better I m satisfied And I d like to stay for a little practice as well as study Then that s settled And Aunt Polly gave a satisfied sigh CHAPTER XVI WHEN POLLYANNA WAS EXPECTED All Beldingsville was fairly aquiver with excitement Not since Pollyanna Whittier came home from the Sanatorium WALKING had there been such a chatter of talk over back yard fences and on every street corner To day too the center of interest was Pollyanna Once again Pollyanna was coming home but so different a Pollyanna and so different a homecoming Pollyanna was twenty now For six years she had spent her winters in Germany her summers leisurely traveling with doctor Chilton and his wife Only once during that time had she been in Beldingsville and then it was for but a short four weeks the summer she was sixteen Now she was coming home to stay report said she and her Aunt Polly The doctor would not be with them Six months before the town had been shocked and saddened by the news that the doctor had died suddenly Beldingsville had expected then that missus Chilton and Pollyanna would return at once to the old home But they had not come Instead had come word that the widow and her niece would remain abroad for a time The report said that in entirely new surroundings missus Chilton was trying to seek distraction and relief from her great sorrow Very soon however vague rumors and rumors not so vague began to float through the town that financially all was not well with missus Polly Chilton Certain railroad stocks in which it was known that the Harrington estate had been heavily interested wavered uncertainly then tumbled into ruin and disaster Other investments according to report were in a most precarious condition From the doctor s estate little could be expected He had not been a rich man and his expenses had been heavy for the past six years Beldingsville was not surprised therefore when not quite six months after the doctor s death word came that missus Chilton and Pollyanna were coming home Once more the old Harrington homestead so long closed and silent showed up flung windows and wide open doors Once more Nancy now missus Timothy Durgin swept and scrubbed and dusted until the old place shone in spotless order No I hain t had no instructions ter do it I hain t I hain t Nancy explained to curious friends and neighbors who halted at the gate or came more boldly up to the doorways Mother Durgin s had the key course and has come in regerler to air up and see that things was all right and Mis Chilton just wrote and said she and Miss Pollyanna was comin this week Friday and ter please see that the rooms and sheets was aired and ter leave the key under the side door mat on that day Under the mat indeed Just as if I d leave them two poor things ter come into this house alone and all forlorn like that and me only a mile away a sittin in my own parlor like as if I was a fine lady an hadn t no heart at all at all Just as if the poor things hadn t enough ter stand without that a comin into this house an the doctor gone bless his kind heart an never comin back An no money too Did ye hear about that An ain t it a shame a shame Think of Miss Polly I mean Mis Chilton bein poor My stars and stockings I can t sense it I can t I can t Perhaps to no one did Nancy speak so interestedly as she did to a tall good looking young fellow with peculiarly frank eyes and a particularly winning smile who cantered up to the side door on a mettlesome thoroughbred at ten o clock that Thursday morning At the same time to no one did she talk with so much evident embarrassment so far as the manner of address was concerned for her tongue stumbled and blundered out a Master Jimmy er mister Bean I mean mister Pendleton Master Jimmy with a nervous precipitation that sent the young man himself into a merry peal of laughter Never mind Nancy Let it go at whatever comes handiest he chuckled I ve found out what I wanted to know missus Chilton and her niece really are expected to morrow Yes sir they be sir courtesied Nancy more s the pity Not but that I shall be glad enough ter see em you understand but it s the WAY they re a comin Yes I know I understand nodded the youth gravely his eyes sweeping the fine old house before him Well I suppose that part can t be helped But I m glad you re doing just what you are doing That WILL help a whole lot he finished with a bright smile as he wheeled about and rode rapidly down the driveway Back on the steps Nancy wagged her head wisely I ain t surprised Master Jimmy she declared aloud her admiring eyes following the handsome figures of horse and man I ain t surprised that you ain t lettin no grass grow under your feet bout inquirin for Miss Pollyanna I said long ago twould come sometime an it s bound to what with your growin so handsome and tall An I hope twill I do I do It ll be just like a book what with her a findin you an gettin you into that grand home with mister Pendleton My but who d ever take you now for that little Jimmy Bean that used to be I never did see such a change in anybody I didn t I didn t she answered with one last look at the rapidly disappearing figures far down the road Something of the same thought must have been in the mind of John Pendleton some time later that same morning for from the veranda of his big gray house on Pendleton Hill John Pendleton was watching the rapid approach of that same horse and rider and in his eyes was an expression very like the one that had been in missus Nancy Durgin s On his lips too was an admiring Jove what a handsome pair as the two dashed by on the way to the stable Five minutes later the youth came around the corner of the house and slowly ascended the veranda steps Well my boy is it true Are they coming asked the man with visible eagerness Yes When To morrow The young fellow dropped himself into a chair At the crisp terseness of the answer John Pendleton frowned He threw a quick look into the young man s face For a moment he hesitated then a little abruptly he asked Why son what s the matter Matter Nothing sir Nonsense I know better You left here an hour ago so eager to be off that wild horses could not have held you Now you sit humped up in that chair and look as if wild horses couldn t drag you out of it If I didn t know better I d think you weren t glad that our friends are coming He paused evidently for a reply But he did not get it Why Jim AREN T you glad they re coming The young fellow laughed and stirred restlessly Why yes of course Humph You act like it The youth laughed again A boyish red flamed into his face Well it s only that I was thinking of Pollyanna Pollyanna Why man alive you ve done nothing but prattle of Pollyanna ever since you came home from Boston and found she was expected I thought you were dying to see Pollyanna The other leaned forward with curious intentness That s exactly it See You said it a minute ago It s just as if yesterday wild horses couldn t keep me from seeing Pollyanna and now to day when I know she s coming they couldn t drag me to see her Why JIM At the shocked incredulity on John Pendleton s face the younger man fell back in his chair with an embarrassed laugh Yes I know It sounds nutty and I don t expect I can make you understand But somehow I don t think I ever wanted Pollyanna to grow up She was such a dear just as she was I like to think of her as I saw her last her earnest freckled little face her yellow pigtails her tearful Oh yes I m glad I m going but I think I shall be a little gladder when I come back That s the last time I saw her You know we were in Egypt that time she was here four years ago I know I see exactly what you mean too I think I felt the same way till I saw her last winter in Rome The other turned eagerly Sure enough you have seen her Tell me about her A shrewd twinkle came into John Pendleton s eyes Oh but I thought you didn t want to know Pollyanna grown up With a grimace the young fellow tossed this aside Is she pretty Oh ye young men shrugged John Pendleton in mock despair Always the first question Is she pretty Well is she insisted the youth I ll let you judge for yourself If you On second thoughts though I believe I won t You might be too disappointed Pollyanna isn t pretty so far as regular features curls and dimples go In fact to my certain knowledge the great cross in Pollyanna s life thus far is that she is so sure she isn t pretty Long ago she told me that black curls were one of the things she was going to have when she got to Heaven and last year in Rome she said something else It wasn t much perhaps so far as words went but I detected the longing beneath She said she did wish that sometime some one would write a novel with a heroine who had straight hair and a freckle on her nose but that she supposed she ought to be glad girls in books didn t have to have them That sounds like the old Pollyanna Oh you ll still find her Pollyanna smiled the man quizzically Besides I think she s pretty Her eyes are lovely She is the picture of health She carries herself with all the joyous springiness of youth and her whole face lights up so wonderfully when she talks that you quite forget whether her features are regular or not Does she still play the game John Pendleton smiled fondly I imagine she plays it but she doesn t say much about it now I fancy Anyhow she didn t to me the two or three times I saw her There was a short silence then a little slowly young Pendleton said I think that was one of the things that was worrying me That game has been so much to so many people It has meant so much everywhere all through the town I couldn t bear to think of her giving it up and NOT playing it At the same time I couldn t fancy a grown up Pollyanna perpetually admonishing people to be glad for something Someway I well as I said I I just didn t want Pollyanna to grow up anyhow Well I wouldn t worry shrugged the elder man with a peculiar smile Always with Pollyanna you know it was the clearing up shower both literally and figuratively and I think you ll find she lives up to the same principle now though perhaps not quite in the same way Poor child I fear she ll need some kind of game to make existence endurable for a while at least Do you mean because missus Chilton has lost her money Are they so very poor then I suspect they are In fact they are in rather bad shape so far as money matters go as I happen to know missus Chilton s own fortune has shrunk unbelievably and poor Tom s estate is very small and hopelessly full of bad debts professional services never paid for and that never will be paid for Tom could never say no when his help was needed and all the dead beats in town knew it and imposed on him accordingly Expenses have been heavy with him lately Besides he expected great things when he should have completed this special work in Germany Naturally he supposed his wife and Pollyanna were more than amply provided for through the Harrington estate so he had no worry in that direction Hm m I see I see Too bad too bad But that isn t all It was about two months after Tom s death that I saw missus Chilton and Pollyanna in Rome and missus Chilton then was in a terrible state In addition to her sorrow she had just begun to get an inkling of the trouble with her finances and she was nearly frantic She refused to come home She declared she never wanted to see Beldingsville or anybody in it again You see she has always been a peculiarly proud woman and it was all affecting her in a rather curious way Pollyanna said that her aunt seemed possessed with the idea that Beldingsville had not approved of her marrying doctor Chilton in the first place at her age and now that he was dead she felt that they were utterly out of sympathy in any grief that she might show She resented keenly too the fact that they must now know that she was poor as well as widowed In short she had worked herself Into an utterly morbid wretched state as unreasonable as it was terrible Poor little Pollyanna It was a marvel to me how she stood it All is if missus Chilton kept it up and continues to keep it up that child will be a wreck That s why I said Pollyanna would need some kind of a game if ever anybody did The pity of it to think of that happening to Pollyanna exclaimed the young man in a voice that was not quite steady Yes and you can see all is not right by the way they are coming to day so quietly with not a word to anybody That was Polly Chilton s doings I ll warrant She didn t WANT to be met by anybody I understand she wrote to no one but her Old Tom s wife missus Durgin who had the keys Yes so Nancy told me good old soul She d got the whole house open and had contrived somehow to make it look as if it wasn t a tomb of dead hopes and lost pleasures Of course the grounds looked fairly well for Old Tom has kept them up after a fashion But it made my heart ache the whole thing There was a long silence then curtly John Pendleton suggested They ought to be met They will be met Are YOU going to the station I am Then you know what train they re coming on Oh no Neither does Nancy Then how will you manage I m going to begin in the morning and go to every train till they come laughed the young man a bit grimly Timothy s going too with the family carriage After all there aren t many trains anyway that they can come on you know Hm m I know said John Pendleton Jim I admire your nerve but not your judgment I m glad you re going to follow your nerve and not your judgment however and I wish you good luck Thank you sir smiled the young man dolefully I need em your good wishes all right all right as Nancy says CHAPTER XVII WHEN POLLYANNA CAME As the train neared Beldingsville Pollyanna watched her aunt anxiously All day missus Chilton had been growing more and more restless more and more gloomy and Pollyanna was fearful of the time when the familiar home station should be reached As Pollyanna looked at her aunt her heart ached She was thinking that she would not have believed it possible that any one could have changed and aged so greatly in six short months missus Chilton s eyes were lusterless her cheeks pallid and shrunken and her forehead crossed and recrossed by fretful lines Her mouth drooped at the corners and her hair was combed tightly back in the unbecoming fashion that had been hers when Pollyanna first had seen her years before All the softness and sweetness that seemed to have come to her with her marriage had dropped from her like a cloak leaving uppermost the old hardness and sourness that had been hers when she was Miss Polly Harrington unloved and unloving Pollyanna missus Chilton s voice was incisive Pollyanna started guiltily She had an uncomfortable feeling that her aunt might have read her thoughts Yes auntie Where is that black bag the little one Right here Well I wish you d get out my black veil We re nearly there But it s so hot and thick auntie Pollyanna I asked for that black veil If you d please learn to do what I ask without arguing about it it would be a great deal easier for me I want that veil Do you suppose I m going to give all Beldingsville a chance to see how I take it Oh auntie they d never be there in THAT spirit protested Pollyanna hurriedly rummaging in the black bag for the much wanted veil Besides there won t be anybody there anyway to meet us We didn t tell any one we were coming you know Yes I know We didn t TELL any one to meet us But we instructed missus Durgin to have the rooms aired and the key under the mat for to day Do you suppose Mary Durgin has kept that information to herself Not much Half the town knows we re coming to day and a dozen or more will happen around the station about train time I know them They want to see what Polly Harrington POOR looks like They Oh auntie auntie begged Pollyanna with tears in her eyes If I wasn t so alone If the doctor were only here and She stopped speaking and turned away her head Her mouth worked convulsively Where is that veil she choked huskily Yes dear Here it is right here comforted Pollyanna whose only aim now plainly was to get the veil into her aunt s hands with all haste And here we are now almost there Oh auntie I do wish you d had Old Tom or Timothy meet us And ride home in state as if we could AFFORD to keep such horses and carriages And when we know we shall have to sell them to morrow No I thank you Pollyanna I prefer to use the public carriage under those circumstances I know but The train came to a jolting jarring stop and only a fluttering sigh finished Pollyanna s sentence As the two women stepped to the platform missus Chilton in her black veil looked neither to the right nor the left Pollyanna however was nodding and smiling tearfully in half a dozen directions before she had taken twice as many steps Then suddenly she found herself looking into a familiar yet strangely unfamiliar face Why it isn t it IS Jimmy she beamed reaching forth a cordial hand That is I suppose I should say mister PENDLETON she corrected herself with a shy smile that said plainly Now that you ve grown so tall and fine I d like to see you try it challenged the youth with a very Jimmy like tilt to his chin He turned then to speak to missus Chilton but that lady with her head half averted was hurrying on a little in advance He turned back to Pollyanna his eyes troubled and sympathetic If you d please come this way both of you he urged hurriedly Timothy is here with the carriage Oh how good of him cried Pollyanna but with an anxious glance at the somber veiled figure ahead Timidly she touched her aunt s arm Auntie dear Timothy s here He s come with the carriage He s over this side And this is Jimmy Bean auntie You remember Jimmy Bean In her nervousness and embarrassment Pollyanna did not notice that she had given the young man the old name of his boyhood missus Chilton however evidently did notice it With palpable reluctance she turned and inclined her head ever so slightly mister Pendleton is very kind I am sure but I am sorry that he or Timothy took quite so much trouble she said frigidly No trouble no trouble at all I assure you laughed the young man trying to hide his embarrassment Now if you ll just let me have your checks so I can see to your baggage Thank you began missus Chilton but I am very sure we can But Pollyanna with a relieved little thank you had already passed over the checks and dignity demanded that missus Chilton say no more The drive home was a silent one Timothy vaguely hurt at the reception he had met with at the hands of his former mistress sat up in front stiff and straight with tense lips missus Chilton after a weary Well well child just as you please I suppose we shall have to ride home in it now had subsided into stern gloom Pollyanna however was neither stern nor tense nor gloomy With eager though tearful eyes she greeted each loved landmark as they came to it Only once did she speak and that was to say Isn t Jimmy fine How he has improved And hasn t he the nicest eyes and smile She waited hopefully but as there was no reply to this she contented herself with a cheerful Well I think he has anyhow Timothy had been both too aggrieved and too afraid to tell missus Chilton what to expect at home so the wide flung doors and flower adorned rooms with Nancy courtesying on the porch were a complete surprise to missus Chilton and Pollyanna Why Nancy how perfectly lovely cried Pollyanna springing lightly to the ground Auntie here s Nancy to welcome us And only see how charming she s made everything look Pollyanna s voice was determinedly cheerful though it shook audibly This home coming without the dear doctor whom she had loved so well was not easy for her and if hard for her she knew something of what it must be for her aunt She knew too that the one thing her aunt was dreading was a breakdown before Nancy than which nothing could be worse in her eyes Behind the heavy black veil the eyes were brimming and the lips were trembling Pollyanna knew She knew too that to hide these facts her aunt would probably seize the first opportunity for faultfinding and make her anger a cloak to hide the fact that her heart was breaking Pollyanna was not surprised therefore to hear her aunt s few cold words of greeting to Nancy followed by a sharp Of course all this was very kind Nancy but really I would have much preferred that you had not done it All the joy fled from Nancy s face She looked hurt and frightened Oh but Miss Polly I mean Mis Chilton she entreated it seemed as if I couldn t let you There there never mind Nancy interrupted missus Chilton I I don t want to talk about it And with her head proudly high she swept out of the room A minute later they heard the door of her bedroom shut up stairs Nancy turned in dismay Oh Miss Pollyanna what is it What have I done I thought she d LIKE it I meant it all right Of course you did wept Pollyanna fumbling in her bag for her handkerchief And twas lovely to have you do it too just lovely But SHE didn t like it Yes she did But she didn t want to show she liked it She was afraid if she did she d show other things and Oh Nancy Nancy I m so glad just to c cry And Pollyanna was sobbing on Nancy s shoulder There there dear so she shall so she shall soothed Nancy patting the heaving shoulders with one hand and trying with the other to make the corner of her apron serve as a handkerchief to wipe her own tears away You see I mustn t cry before HER faltered Pollyanna and it WAS hard coming here the first time you know and all And I KNEW how she was feeling Of course of course poor lamb crooned Nancy And to think the first thing I should have done was somethin ter vex her and Oh but she wasn t vexed at that corrected Pollyanna agitatedly It s just her way Nancy You see she doesn t like to show how badly she feels about about the doctor And she s so afraid she WILL show it that she she just takes anything for an excuse to to talk about She does it to me too just the same So I know all about it See Oh yes I see I do I do Nancy s lips snapped together a little severely and her sympathetic pats for the minute were even more loving if possible Poor lamb I m glad I come anyhow for your sake Yes so am I breathed Pollyanna gently drawing herself away and wiping her eyes There I feel better And I do thank you ever so much Nancy and I appreciate it Now don t let us keep you when it s time for you to go Ho I m thinkin I ll stay for a spell sniffed Nancy Stay Why Nancy I thought you were married Aren t you Timothy s wife Sure But he won t mind for you He d WANT me to stay for you Oh but Nancy we couldn t let you demurred Pollyanna We can t have anybody now you know I m going to do the work Until we know just how things are we shall live very economically Aunt Polly says Ho as if I d take money from began Nancy in bridling wrath but at the expression on the other s face she stopped and let her words dwindle off in a mumbling protest as she hurried from the room to look after her creamed chicken on the stove Not until supper was over and everything put in order did missus Timothy Durgin consent to drive away with her husband then she went with evident reluctance and with many pleadings to be allowed to come just ter help out a bit at any time After Nancy had gone Pollyanna came into the living room where missus Chilton was sitting alone her hand over her eyes Well dearie shall I light up suggested Pollyanna brightly Oh I suppose so Wasn t Nancy a dear to fix us all up so nice No answer Where in the world she found all these flowers I can t imagine She has them in every room down here and in both bedrooms too Still no answer Pollyanna gave a half stifled sigh and threw a wistful glance into her aunt s averted face After a moment she began again hopefully I saw Old Tom in the garden Poor man his rheumatism is worse than ever He was bent nearly double He inquired very particularly for you and missus Chilton turned with a sharp interruption Pollyanna what are we going to do Do Why the best we can of course dearie missus Chilton gave an impatient gesture Come come Pollyanna do be serious for once You ll find it is serious fast enough WHAT are we going to DO As you know my income has almost entirely stopped Of course some of the things are worth something I suppose but mister Hart says very few of them will pay anything at present We have something in the bank and a little coming in of course And we have this house But of what earthly use is the house We can t eat it or wear it It s too big for us the way we shall have to live and we couldn t sell it for half what it s really worth unless we HAPPENED to find just the person that wanted it Sell it Oh auntie you wouldn t this beautiful house full of lovely things I may have to Pollyanna We have to eat unfortunately I know it and I m always SO hungry mourned Pollyanna with a rueful laugh Still I suppose I ought to be glad my appetite is so good Very likely You d find something to be glad about of course But what shall we do child I do wish you d be serious for a minute A quick change came to Pollyanna s face I am serious Aunt Polly I ve been thinking I I wish I could earn some money Oh child child to think of my ever living to hear you say that moaned the woman a daughter of the Harringtons having to earn her bread Oh but that isn t the way to look at it laughed Pollyanna You ought to be glad if a daughter of the Harringtons is SMART enough to earn her bread That isn t any disgrace Aunt Polly Perhaps not but it isn t very pleasant to one s pride after the position we ve always occupied in Beldingsville Pollyanna Pollyanna did not seem to have heard Her eyes were musingly fixed on space If only I had some talent If only I could do something better than anybody else in the world she sighed at last I can sing a little play a little embroider a little and darn a little but I can t do any of them well not well enough to be paid for it I think I d like best to cook she resumed after a minute s silence and keep house You know I loved that in Germany winters when Gretchen used to bother us so much by not coming when we wanted her But I don t exactly want to go into other people s kitchens to do it As if I d let you Pollyanna shuddered missus Chilton again And of course to just work in our own kitchen here doesn t bring in anything bemoaned Pollyanna not any money I mean And it s money we need It most emphatically is sighed Aunt Polly There was a long silence broken at last by Pollyanna To think that after all you ve done for me auntie to think that now if I only could I d have such a splendid chance to help And yet I can t do it Oh why wasn t I born with something that s worth money There there child don t don t Of course if the doctor The words choked into silence Pollyanna looked up quickly and sprang to her feet Dear dear this will never do she exclaimed with a complete change of manner Don t you fret auntie What ll you wager that I don t develop the most marvelous talent going one of these days Besides I think it s real exciting all this There s so much uncertainty in it There s a lot of fun in wanting things and then watching for them to come Just living along and KNOWING you re going to have everything you want is so so humdrum you know she finished with a gay little laugh missus Chilton however did not laugh She only sighed and said Dear me Pollyanna what a child you are CHAPTER XVIII A MATTER OF ADJUSTMENT The first few days at Beldingsville were not easy either for missus Chilton or for Pollyanna They were days of adjustment and days of adjustment are seldom easy From travel and excitement it was not easy to put one s mind to the consideration of the price of butter and the delinquencies of the butcher From having all one s time for one s own it was not easy to find always the next task clamoring to be done Friends and neighbors called too and although Pollyanna welcomed them with glad cordiality missus Chilton when possible excused herself and always she said bitterly to Pollyanna Curiosity I suppose to see how Polly Harrington likes being poor Of the doctor missus Chilton seldom spoke yet Pollyanna knew very well that almost never was he absent from her thoughts and that more than half her taciturnity was but her usual cloak for a deeper emotion which she did not care to show Jimmy Pendleton Pollyanna saw several times during that first month He came first with John Pendleton for a somewhat stiff and ceremonious call not that it was either stiff or ceremonious until after Aunt Polly came into the room then it was both For some reason Aunt Polly had not excused herself on this occasion After that Jimmy had come by himself once with flowers once with a book for Aunt Polly twice with no excuse at all Pollyanna welcomed him with frank pleasure always Aunt Polly after that first time did not see him at all To the most of their friends and acquaintances Pollyanna said little about the change in their circumstances To Jimmy however she talked freely and always her constant cry was If only I could do something to bring in some money I m getting to be the most mercenary little creature you ever saw she laughed dolefully I ve got so I measure everything with a dollar bill and I actually think in quarters and dimes You see Aunt Polly does feel so poor It s a shame stormed Jimmy I know it But honestly I think she feels a little poorer than she needs to she s brooded over it so But I do wish I could help Jimmy looked down at the wistful eager face with its luminous eyes and his own eyes softened Illustration See Frontispiece Jimmy looked down at the wistful eager face What do you WANT to do if you could do it he asked Oh I want to cook and keep house smiled Pollyanna with a pensive sigh I just love to beat eggs and sugar and hear the soda gurgle its little tune in the cup of sour milk I m happy if I ve got a day s baking before me But there isn t any money in that except in somebody else s kitchen of course And I I don t exactly love it well enough for that I should say not ejaculated the young fellow Once more he glanced down at the expressive face so near him This time a queer look came to the corners of his mouth He pursed his lips then spoke a slow red mounting to his forehead Well of course you might marry Have you thought of that Miss Pollyanna Pollyanna gave a merry laugh Voice and manner were unmistakably those of a girl quite untouched by even the most far reaching of Cupid s darts Oh no I shall never marry she said blithely In the first place I m not pretty you know and in the second place I m going to live with Aunt Polly and take care of her Not pretty eh smiled Pendleton quizzically Did it ever er occur to you that there might be a difference of opinion on that Pollyanna Pollyanna shook her head There couldn t be I ve got a mirror you see she objected with a merry glance It sounded like coquetry In any other girl it would have been coquetry Pendleton decided But looking into the face before him now Pendleton knew that it was not coquetry He knew too suddenly why Pollyanna had seemed so different from any girl he had ever known Something of her old literal way of looking at things still clung to her Why aren t you pretty he asked Even as he uttered the question and sure as he was of his estimate of Pollyanna s character Pendleton quite held his breath at his temerity He could not help thinking of how quickly any other girl he knew would have resented that implied acceptance of her claim to no beauty But Pollyanna s first words showed him that even this lurking fear of his was quite groundless Why I just am not she laughed a little ruefully I wasn t made that way Maybe you don t remember but long ago when I was a little girl it always seemed to me that one of the nicest things Heaven was going to give me when I got there was black curls And is that your chief desire now N no maybe not hesitated Pollyanna But I still think I d like them Besides my eyelashes aren t long enough and my nose isn t Grecian or Roman or any of those delightfully desirable ones that belong to a type It s just NOSE And my face is too long or too short I ve forgotten which but I measured it once with one of those correct for beauty tests and it wasn t right anyhow And they said the width of the face should be equal to five eyes and the width of the eyes equal to to something else I ve forgotten that too only that mine wasn t What a lugubrious picture laughed Pendleton Then with his gaze admiringly regarding the girl s animated face and expressive eyes he asked Did you ever look in the mirror when you were talking Pollyanna Why no of course not Well you d better try it sometime What a funny idea Imagine my doing it laughed the girl What shall I say Like this Now you Pollyanna what if your eyelashes aren t long and your nose is just a nose be glad you ve got SOME eyelashes and SOME nose Pendleton joined in her laugh but an odd expression came to his face Then you still play the game he said a little diffidently Pollyanna turned soft eyes of wonder full upon him Why of course Why Jimmy I don t believe I could have lived the last six months if it hadn t been for that blessed game Her voice shook a little I haven t heard you say much about it he commented She changed color I know I think I m afraid of saying too much to outsiders who don t care you know It wouldn t sound quite the same from me now at twenty as it did when I was ten I realize that of course Folks don t like to be preached at you know she finished with a whimsical smile I know nodded the young fellow gravely But I wonder sometimes Pollyanna if you really understand yourself what that game is and what it has done for those who are playing it I know what it has done for myself Her voice was low and her eyes were turned away You see it really WORKS if you play it he mused aloud after a short silence Somebody said once that it would revolutionize the world if everybody would really play it And I believe it would Yes but some folks don t want to be revolutionized smiled Pollyanna I ran across a man in Germany last year He had lost his money and was in hard luck generally Dear dear but he was gloomy Somebody in my presence tried to cheer him up one day by saying Come come things might be worse you know Dear dear but you should have heard that man then If there is anything on earth that makes me mad clear through he snarled it is to be told that things might be worse and to be thankful for what I ve got left These people who go around with an everlasting grin on their faces caroling forth that they are thankful that they can breathe or eat or walk or lie down I have no use for I don t WANT to breathe or eat or walk or lie down if things are as they are now with me And when I m told that I ought to be thankful for some such tommyrot as that it makes me just want to go out and shoot somebody Imagine what I D have gotten if I d have introduced the glad game to that man laughed Pollyanna I don t care He needed it answered Jimmy Of course he did but he wouldn t have thanked me for giving it to him I suppose not But listen As he was under his present philosophy and scheme of living he made himself and everybody else wretched didn t he Well just suppose he was playing the game While he was trying to hunt up something to be glad about in everything that had happened to him he COULDN T be at the same time grumbling and growling about how bad things were so that much would be gained He d be a whole lot easier to live with both for himself and for his friends Meanwhile just thinking of the doughnut instead of the hole couldn t make things any worse for him and it might make things better for it wouldn t give him such a gone feeling in the pit of his stomach and his digestion would be better I tell you troubles are poor things to hug They ve got too many prickers Pollyanna smiled appreciatively That makes me think of what I told a poor old lady once She was one of my Ladies Aiders out West and was one of the kind of people that really ENJOYS being miserable and telling over her causes for unhappiness I was perhaps ten years old and was trying to teach her the game I reckon I wasn t having very good success and evidently I at last dimly realized the reason for I said to her triumphantly Well anyhow you can be glad you ve got such a lot of things to make you miserable for you love to be miserable so well Well if that wasn t a good one on her chuckled Jimmy Pollyanna raised her eyebrows I m afraid she didn t enjoy it any more than the man in Germany would have if I d told him the same thing But they ought to be told and you ought to tell Pendleton stopped short with so queer an expression on his face that Pollyanna looked at him in surprise Why Jimmy what is it Oh nothing I was only thinking he answered puckering his lips Here I am urging you to do the very thing I was afraid you WOULD do before I saw you you know That is I was afraid before I saw you that that He floundered into a helpless pause looking very red indeed Well Jimmy Pendleton bridled the girl you needn t think you can stop there sir Now just what do you mean by all that please Oh er n nothing much I m waiting murmured Pollyanna Voice and manner were calm and confident though the eyes twinkled mischievously The young fellow hesitated glanced at her smiling face and capitulated Oh well have it your own way he shrugged It s only that I was worrying a little about that game for fear you WOULD talk it just as you used to you know and But a merry peal of laughter interrupted him There what did I tell you Even you were worried it seems lest I should be at twenty just what I was at ten N no I didn t mean Pollyanna honestly I thought of course I knew But Pollyanna only put her hands to her ears and went off into another peal of laughter CHAPTER XIX TWO LETTERS It was toward the latter part of June that the letter came to Pollyanna from Della Wetherby I am writing to ask you a favor Miss Wetherby wrote I am hoping you can tell me of some quiet private family in Beldingsville that will be willing to take my sister to board for the summer There would be three of them missus Carew her secretary and her adopted son Jamie You remember Jamie don t you They do not like to go to an ordinary hotel or boarding house My sister is very tired and the doctor has advised her to go into the country for a complete rest and change He suggested Vermont or New Hampshire We immediately thought of Beldingsville and you and we wondered if you couldn t recommend just the right place to us I told Ruth I would write you They would like to go right away early in July if possible Would it be asking too much to request you to let us know as soon as you conveniently can if you do know of a place Please address me here My sister is with us here at the Sanatorium for a few weeks treatment Hoping for a favorable reply I am Most cordially yours DELLA WETHERBY For the first few minutes after the letter was finished Pollyanna sat with frowning brow mentally searching the homes of Beldingsville for a possible boarding house for her old friends Then a sudden something gave her thoughts a new turn and with a joyous exclamation she hurried to her aunt in the living room Auntie auntie she panted I ve got just the loveliest idea I told you something would happen and that I d develop that wonderful talent sometime Well I have I have right now Listen I ve had a letter from Miss Wetherby missus Carew s sister where I stayed that winter in Boston you know and they want to come into the country to board for the summer and Miss Wetherby s written to see if I didn t know a place for them They don t want a hotel or an ordinary boarding house you see And at first I didn t know of one but now I do I do Aunt Polly Just guess where tis Dear me child ejaculated missus Chilton how you do run on I should think you were a dozen years old instead of a woman grown Now what are you talking about About a boarding place for missus Carew and Jamie I ve found it babbled Pollyanna Indeed Well what of it Of what possible interest can that be to me child murmured missus Chilton drearily Because it s HERE I m going to have them here auntie Pollyanna missus Chilton was sitting erect in horror Now auntie please don t say no please don t begged Pollyanna eagerly Don t you see This is my chance the chance I ve been waiting for and it s just dropped right into my hands We can do it lovely We have plenty of room and you know I CAN cook and keep house And now there d be money in it for they d pay well I know and they d love to come I m sure There d be three of them there s a secretary with them But Pollyanna I can t Turn this house into a boarding house the Harrington homestead a common boarding house Oh Pollyanna I can t I can t But it wouldn t be a common boarding house dear Twill be an uncommon one Besides they re our friends It would be like having our friends come to see us only they d be PAYING guests so meanwhile we d be earning money money that we NEED auntie money that we need she emphasized significantly A spasm of hurt pride crossed Polly Chilton s face With a low moan she fell back in her chair But how could you do it she asked at last faintly You couldn t do the work part alone child Oh no of course not chirped Pollyanna Pollyanna was on sure ground now She knew her point was won But I could do the cooking and the overseeing and I m sure I could get one of Nancy s younger sisters to help about the rest missus Durgin would do the laundry part just as she does now But Pollyanna I m not well at all you know I m not I couldn t do much Of course not There s no reason why you should scorned Pollyanna loftily Oh auntie won t it be splendid Why it seems too good to be true money just dropped into my hands like that Dropped into your hands indeed You still have some things to learn in this world Pollyanna and one is that summer boarders don t drop money into anybody s hands without looking very sharply to it that they get ample return By the time you fetch and carry and bake and brew until you are ready to sink and by the time you nearly kill yourself trying to serve everything to order from fresh laid eggs to the weather you will believe what I tell you All right I ll remember laughed Pollyanna But I m not doing any worrying now and I m going to hurry and write Miss Wetherby at once so I can give it to Jimmy Bean to mail when he comes out this afternoon missus Chilton stirred restlessly Pollyanna I do wish you d call that young man by his proper name That Bean gives me the shivers His name is Pendleton now as I understand it So it is agreed Pollyanna but I do forget it half the time I even call him that to his face sometimes and of course that s dreadful when he really is adopted and all But you see I m so excited she finished as she danced from the room She had the letter all ready for Jimmy when he called at four o clock She was still quivering with excitement and she lost no time in telling her visitor what it was all about And I m crazy to see them besides she cried when she had told him of her plans I ve never seen either of them since that winter You know I told you didn t I tell you about Jamie Oh yes you told me There was a touch of constraint in the young man s voice Well isn t it splendid if they can come Why I don t know as I should call it exactly splendid he parried Not splendid that I ve got such a chance to help Aunt Polly out for even this little while Why Jimmy of course it s splendid Well it strikes me that it s going to be rather HARD for you bridled Jimmy with more than a shade of irritation Yes of course in some ways But I shall be so glad for the money coming in that I ll think of that all the time You see she sighed how mercenary I am Jimmy For a long minute there was no reply then a little abruptly the young man asked Let s see how old is this Jamie now Pollyanna glanced up with a merry smile Oh I remember you never did like his name Jamie she twinkled Never mind he s adopted now legally I believe and has taken the name of Carew So you can call him that But that isn t telling me how old he is reminded Jimmy stiffly Nobody knows exactly I suppose You know he couldn t tell but I imagine he s about your age I wonder how he is now I ve asked all about it in this letter anyway Oh you have Pendleton looked down at the letter in his hand and flipped it a little spitefully He was thinking that he would like to drop it to tear it up to give it to somebody to throw it away to do anything with it but mail it Jimmy knew perfectly well that he was jealous that he always had been jealous of this youth with the name so like and yet so unlike his own Not that he was in love with Pollyanna he assured himself wrathfully He was not that of course It was just that he did not care to have this strange youth with the sissy name come to Beldingsville and be always around to spoil all their good times He almost said as much to Pollyanna but something stayed the words on his lips and after a time he took his leave carrying the letter with him That Jimmy did not drop the letter tear it up give it to anybody or throw it away was evidenced a few days later for Pollyanna received a prompt and delighted reply from Miss Wetherby and when Jimmy came next time he heard it read or rather he heard part of it for Pollyanna prefaced the reading by saying Of course the first part is just where she says how glad they are to come and all that I won t read that But the rest I thought you d like to hear because you ve heard me talk so much about them Besides you ll know them yourself pretty soon of course I m depending a whole lot on you Jimmy to help me make it pleasant for them Oh are you Now don t be sarcastic just because you don t like Jamie s name reproved Pollyanna with mock severity You ll like HIM I m sure when you know him and you ll LOVE missus Carew Will I indeed retorted Jimmy huffily Well that IS a serious prospect Let us hope if I do the lady will be so gracious as to reciprocate Of course dimpled Pollyanna Now listen and I ll read to you about her This letter is from her sister Della Miss Wetherby you know at the Sanatorium All right Go ahead directed Jimmy with a somewhat too evident attempt at polite interest And Pollyanna still smiling mischievously began to read You ask me to tell you everything about everybody That is a large commission but I ll do the best I can To begin with I think you ll find my sister quite changed The new interests that have come into her life during the last six years have done wonders for her Just now she is a bit thin and tired from overwork but a good rest will soon remedy that and you ll see how young and blooming and happy she looks Please notice I said HAPPY That won t mean so much to you as it does to me of course for you were too young to realize quite how unhappy she was when you first knew her that winter in Boston Life was such a dreary hopeless thing to her then and now it is so full of interest and joy First she has Jamie and when you see them together you won t need to be told what he is to her To be sure we are no nearer knowing whether he is the REAL Jamie or not but my sister loves him like an own son now and has legally adopted him as I presume you know Then she has her girls Do you remember Sadie Dean the salesgirl Well from getting interested in her and trying to help her to a happier living my sister has broadened her efforts little by little until she has scores of girls now who regard her as their own best and particular good angel She has started a Home for Working Girls along new lines Half a dozen wealthy and influential men and women are associated with her of course but she is head and shoulders of the whole thing and never hesitates to give HERSELF to each and every one of the girls You can imagine what that means in nerve strain Her chief support and right hand man is her secretary this same Sadie Dean You ll find HER changed too yet she is the same old Sadie As for Jamie poor Jamie The great sorrow of his life is that he knows now he can never walk For a time we all had hopes He was here at the Sanatorium under doctor Ames for a year and he improved to such an extent that he can go now with crutches But the poor boy will always be a cripple so far as his feet are concerned but never as regards anything else Someway after you know Jamie you seldom think of him as a cripple his SOUL is so free I can t explain it but you ll know what I mean when you see him and he has retained to a marvelous degree his old boyish enthusiasm and joy of living There is just one thing and only one I believe that would utterly quench that bright spirit and cast him into utter despair and that is to find that he is not Jamie Kent our nephew So long has he brooded over this and so ardently has he wished it that he has come actually to believe that he IS the real Jamie but if he isn t I hope he will never find it out There that s all she says about them announced Pollyanna folding up the closely written sheets in her hands But isn t that interesting Indeed it is There was a ring of genuineness in Jimmy s voice now Jimmy was thinking suddenly of what his own good legs meant to him He even for the moment was willing that this poor crippled youth should have a PART of Pollyanna s thoughts and attentions if he were not so presuming as to claim too much of them of course By George it is tough for the poor chap and no mistake Tough You don t know anything about it Jimmy Bean choked Pollyanna but I do I couldn t walk once I KNOW Yes of course of course frowned the youth moving restively in his seat Jimmy looking into Pollyanna s sympathetic face and brimming eyes was suddenly not so sure after all that he WAS willing to have this Jamie come to town if just to THINK of him made Pollyanna look like that CHAPTER XX THE PAYING GUESTS The few intervening days before the expected arrival of those dreadful people as Aunt Polly termed her niece s paying guests were busy ones indeed for Pollyanna but they were happy ones too as Pollyanna refused to be weary or discouraged or dismayed no matter how puzzling were the daily problems she had to meet Summoning Nancy and Nancy s younger sister Betty to her aid Pollyanna systematically went through the house room by room and arranged for the comfort and convenience of her expected boarders missus Chilton could do but little to assist In the first place she was not well In the second place her mental attitude toward the whole idea was not conducive to aid or comfort for at her side stalked always the Harrington pride of name and race and on her lips was the constant moan Oh Pollyanna Pollyanna to think of the Harrington homestead ever coming to this It isn t dearie Pollyanna at last soothed laughingly It s the Carews that are COMING TO THE HARRINGTON HOMESTEAD But missus Chilton was not to be so lightly diverted and responded only with a scornful glance and a deeper sigh so Pollyanna was forced to leave her to travel alone her road of determined gloom Upon the appointed day Pollyanna with Timothy who owned the Harrington horses now went to the station to meet the afternoon train Up to this hour there had been nothing but confidence and joyous anticipation in Pollyanna s heart But with the whistle of the engine there came to her a veritable panic of doubt shyness and dismay She realized suddenly what she Pollyanna almost alone and unaided was about to do She remembered missus Carew s wealth position and fastidious tastes She recollected too that this would be a new tall young man Jamie quite unlike the boy she had known For one awful moment she thought only of getting away somewhere anywhere Timothy I I feel sick I m not well I tell em er not to come she faltered poising as if for flight Ma am exclaimed the startled Timothy One glance into Timothy s amazed face was enough Pollyanna laughed and threw back her shoulders alertly Nothing Never mind I didn t mean it of course Timothy Quick see They re almost here she panted And Pollyanna hurried forward quite herself once more She knew them at once Even had there been any doubt in her mind the crutches in the hands of the tall brown eyed young man would have piloted her straight to her goal There were a brief few minutes of eager handclasps and incoherent exclamations then somehow she found herself in the carriage with missus Carew at her side and Jamie and Sadie Dean in front She had a chance then for the first time really to see her friends and to note the changes the six years had wrought In regard to missus Carew her first feeling was one of surprise She had forgotten that missus Carew was so lovely She had forgotten that the eyelashes were so long that the eyes they shaded were so beautiful She even caught herself thinking enviously of how exactly that perfect face must tally figure by figure with that dread beauty test table But more than anything else she rejoiced in the absence of the old fretful lines of gloom and bitterness Then she turned to Jamie Here again she was surprised and for much the same reason Jamie too had grown handsome To herself Pollyanna declared that he was really distinguished looking His dark eyes rather pale face and dark waving hair she thought most attractive Then she caught a glimpse of the crutches at his side and a spasm of aching sympathy contracted her throat From Jamie Pollyanna turned to Sadie Dean Sadie so far as features went looked much as she had when Pollyanna first saw her in the Public Garden but Pollyanna did not need a second glance to know that Sadie so far as hair dress temper speech and disposition were concerned was a very different Sadie indeed Then Jamie spoke How good you were to let us come he said to Pollyanna Do you know what I thought of when you wrote that we could come Why n no of course not stammered Pollyanna Pollyanna was still seeing the crutches at Jamie s side and her throat was still tightened from that aching sympathy Well I thought of the little maid in the Public Garden with her bag of peanuts for Sir Lancelot and Lady Guinevere and I knew that you were just putting us in their places for if you had a bag of peanuts and we had none you wouldn t be happy till you d shared it with us A bag of peanuts indeed laughed Pollyanna Oh of course in this case your bag of peanuts happened to be airy country rooms and cow s milk and real eggs from a real hen s nest returned Jamie whimsically but it amounts to the same thing And maybe I d better warn you you remember how greedy Sir Lancelot was well He paused meaningly All right I ll take the risk dimpled Pollyanna thinking how glad she was that Aunt Polly was not present to hear her worst predictions so nearly fulfilled thus early Poor Sir Lancelot I wonder if anybody feeds him now or if he s there at all Well if he s there he s fed interposed missus Carew merrily This ridiculous boy still goes down there at least once a week with his pockets bulging with peanuts and I don t know what all He can be traced any time by the trail of small grains he leaves behind him and half the time when I order my cereal for breakfast it isn t forthcoming because forsooth Master Jamie has fed it to the pigeons ma am Yes but let me tell you plunged in Jamie enthusiastically And the next minute Pollyanna found herself listening with all the old fascination to a story of a couple of squirrels in a sunlit garden Later she saw what Della Wetherby had meant in her letter for when the house was reached it came as a distinct shock to her to see Jamie pick up his crutches and swing himself out of the carriage with their aid She knew then that already in ten short minutes he had made her forget that he was lame To Pollyanna s great relief that first dreaded meeting between Aunt Polly and the Carew party passed off much better than she had feared The newcomers were so frankly delighted with the old house and everything in it that it was an utter impossibility for the mistress and owner of it all to continue her stiff attitude of disapproving resignation to their presence Besides as was plainly evident before an hour had passed the personal charm and magnetism of Jamie had pierced even Aunt Polly s armor of distrust and Pollyanna knew that at least one of her own most dreaded problems was a problem no longer for already Aunt Polly was beginning to play the stately yet gracious hostess to these her guests Notwithstanding her relief at Aunt Polly s change of attitude however Pollyanna did not find that all was smooth sailing by any means There was work and plenty of it that must be done Nancy s sister Betty was pleasant and willing but she was not Nancy as Pollyanna soon found She needed training and training took time Pollyanna worried too for fear everything should not be quite right To Pollyanna those days a dusty chair was a crime and a fallen cake a tragedy Gradually however after incessant arguments and pleadings on the part of missus Carew and Jamie Pollyanna came to take her tasks more easily and to realize that the real crime and tragedy in her friends eyes was not the dusty chair nor the fallen cake but the frown of worry and anxiety on her own face Just as if it wasn t enough for you to LET us come Jamie declared without just killing yourself with work to get us something to eat Besides we ought not to eat so much anyway missus Carew laughed or else we shall get digestion as one of my girls calls it when her food disagrees with her It was wonderful after all how easily the three new members of the family fitted into the daily life Before twenty four hours had passed missus Carew had gotten missus Chilton to asking really interested questions about the new Home for Working Girls and Sadie Dean and Jamie were quarreling over the chance to help with the pea shelling or the flower picking The Carews had been at the Harrington homestead nearly a week when one evening John Pendleton and Jimmy called Pollyanna had been hoping they would come soon She had indeed urged it very strongly before the Carews came She made the introductions now with visible pride You are such good friends of mine I want you to know each other and be good friends together she explained That Jimmy and mister Pendleton should be clearly impressed with the charm and beauty of missus Carew did not surprise Pollyanna in the least but the look that came into missus Carew s face at sight of Jimmy did surprise her very much It was almost a look of recognition Why mister Pendleton haven t I met you before missus Carew cried Jimmy s frank eyes met missus Carew s gaze squarely admiringly I think not he smiled back at her I m sure I never have met you I should have remembered it if I had met YOU he bowed So unmistakable was his significant emphasis that everybody laughed and John Pendleton chuckled Well done son for a youth of your tender years I couldn t have done half so well myself missus Carew flushed slightly and joined in the laugh No but really she urged joking aside there certainly is a strangely familiar something in your face I think I must have SEEN you somewhere if I haven t actually met you And maybe you have cried Pollyanna in Boston Jimmy goes to Tech there winters you know Jimmy s going to build bridges and dams you see when he grows up I mean she finished with a merry glance at the big six foot fellow still standing before missus Carew Everybody laughed again that is everybody but Jamie and only Sadie Dean noticed that Jamie instead of laughing closed his eyes as if at the sight of something that hurt And only Sadie Dean knew how and why the subject was so quickly changed for it was Sadie herself who changed it It was Sadie too who when the opportunity came saw to it that books and flowers and beasts and birds things that Jamie knew and understood were talked about as well as dams and bridges which as Sadie knew Jamie could never build That Sadie did all this however was not realized by anybody least of all by Jamie the one who most of all was concerned When the call was over and the Pendletons had gone missus Carew referred again to the curiously haunting feeling that somewhere she had seen young Pendleton before I have I know I have somewhere she declared musingly Of course it may have been in Boston but She let the sentence remain unfinished then after a minute she added He s a fine young fellow anyway I like him I m so glad I do too nodded Pollyanna I ve always liked Jimmy You ve known him some time then queried Jamie a little wistfully Oh yes I knew him years ago when I was a little girl you know He was Jimmy Bean then Jimmy BEAN Why isn t he mister Pendleton s son asked missus Carew in surprise No only by adoption Adoption exclaimed Jamie Then HE isn t a real son any more than I am There was a curious note of almost joy in the lad s voice No mister Pendleton hasn t any children He never married He he was going to once but he he didn t Pollyanna blushed and spoke with sudden diffidence Pollyanna had never forgotten that it was her mother who in the long ago had said no to this same John Pendleton and who had thus been responsible for the man s long lonely years of bachelorhood missus Carew and Jamie however being unaware of this and seeing now only the blush on Pollyanna s cheek and the diffidence in her manner drew suddenly the same conclusion Is it possible they asked themselves that this man John Pendleton ever had a love affair with Pollyanna child that she is Naturally they did not say this aloud so naturally there was no answer possible Naturally too perhaps the thought though unspoken was still not forgotten but was tucked away in a corner of their minds for future reference if need arose CHAPTER XXI SUMMER DAYS Before the Carews came Pollyanna had told Jimmy that she was depending on him to help her entertain them Jimmy had not expressed himself then as being overwhelmingly desirous to serve her in this way but before the Carews had been in town a fortnight he had shown himself as not only willing but anxious judging by the frequency and length of his calls and the lavishness of his offers of the Pendleton horses and motor cars Between him and missus Carew there sprang up at once a warm friendship based on what seemed to be a peculiarly strong attraction for each other They walked and talked together and even made sundry plans for the Home for Working Girls to be carried out the following winter when Jimmy should be in Boston Jamie too came in for a good measure of attention nor was Sadie Dean forgotten Sadie as missus Carew plainly showed was to be regarded as if she were quite one of the family and missus Carew was careful to see that she had full share in any plans for merrymaking Nor did Jimmy always come alone with his offers for entertainment More and more frequently John Pendleton appeared with him Rides and drives and picnics were planned and carried out and long delightful afternoons were spent over books and fancy work on the Harrington veranda Pollyanna was delighted Not only were her paying guests being kept from any possibilities of ennui and homesickness but her good friends the Carews were becoming delightfully acquainted with her other good friends the Pendletons So like a mother hen with a brood of chickens she hovered over the veranda meetings and did everything in her power to keep the group together and happy Neither the Carews nor the Pendletons however were at all satisfied to have Pollyanna merely an onlooker in their pastimes and very strenuously they urged her to join them They would not take no for an answer indeed and Pollyanna very frequently found the way opened for her Just as if we were going to have you poked up in this hot kitchen frosting cake Jamie scolded one day after he had penetrated the fastnesses of her domain It is a perfectly glorious morning and we re all going over to the Gorge and take our luncheon And YOU are going with us But Jamie I can t indeed I can t refused Pollyanna Why not You won t have dinner to get for us for we sha n t be here to eat it But there s the the luncheon Wrong again We ll have the luncheon with us so you CAN T stay home to get that Now what s to hinder your going along WITH the luncheon eh Why Jamie I I can t There s the cake to frost Don t want it frosted And the dusting Don t want it dusted And the ordering to do for to morrow Give us crackers and milk We d lots rather have you and crackers and milk than a turkey dinner and not you But I can t begin to tell you the things I ve got to do to day Don t want you to begin to tell me retorted Jamie cheerfully I want you to stop telling me Come put on your bonnet I saw Betty in the dining room and she says she ll put our luncheon up Now hurry Why Jamie you ridiculous boy I can t go laughed Pollyanna holding feebly back as he tugged at her dress sleeve I can t go to that picnic with you But she went She went not only then but again and again She could not help going indeed for she found arrayed against her not only Jamie but Jimmy and mister Pendleton to say nothing of missus Carew and Sadie Dean and even Aunt Polly herself And of course I AM glad to go she would sigh happily when some dreary bit of work was taken out of her hands in spite of all protesting But surely never before were there any boarders like mine teasing for crackers and milk and cold things and never before was there a boarding mistress like me running around the country after this fashion The climax came when one day John Pendleton and Aunt Polly never ceased to exclaim because it WAS John Pendleton suggested that they all go on a two weeks camping trip to a little lake up among the mountains forty miles from Beldingsville The idea was received with enthusiastic approbation by everybody except Aunt Polly Aunt Polly said privately to Pollyanna that it was all very good and well and desirable that John Pendleton should have gotten out of the sour morose aloofness that had been his state for so many years but that it did not necessarily follow that it was equally desirable that he should be trying to turn himself into a twenty year old boy again and that was what in her opinion he seemed to be doing now Publicly she contented herself with saying coldly that SHE certainly should not go on any insane camping trip to sleep on damp ground and eat bugs and spiders under the guise of fun nor did she think it a sensible thing for anybody over forty to do If John Pendleton felt any wound from this shaft he made no sign Certainly there was no diminution of apparent interest and enthusiasm on his part and the plans for the camping expedition came on apace for it was unanimously decided that even if Aunt Polly would not go that was no reason why the rest should not And missus Carew will be all the chaperon we need anyhow Jimmy had declared airily For a week therefore little was talked of but tents food supplies cameras and fishing tackle and little was done that was not a preparation in some way for the trip And let s make it the real thing proposed Jimmy eagerly yes even to missus Chilton s bugs and spiders he added with a merry smile straight into that lady s severely disapproving eyes None of your log cabin central dining room idea for us We want real camp fires with potatoes baked in the ashes and we want to sit around and tell stories and roast corn on a stick And we want to swim and row and fish chimed in Pollyanna And She stopped suddenly her eyes on Jamie s face That is of course she corrected quickly we wouldn t want to to do those things all the time There d be a lot of QUIET things we d want to do too read and talk you know Jamie s eyes darkened His face grew a little white His lips parted but before any words came Sadie Dean was speaking Oh but on camping trips and picnics you know we EXPECT to do outdoor stunts she interposed feverishly and I m sure we WANT to Last summer we were down in Maine and you should have seen the fish mister Carew caught It was You tell it she begged turning to Jamie Jamie laughed and shook his head They d never believe it he objected a fish story like that Try us challenged Pollyanna Jamie still shook his head but the color had come back to his face and his eyes were no longer somber as if with pain Pollyanna glancing at Sadie Dean vaguely wondered why she suddenly settled back in her seat with so very evident an air of relief At last the appointed day came and the start was made in John Pendleton s big new touring car with Jimmy at the wheel A whir a throbbing rumble a chorus of good bys and they were off with one long shriek of the siren under Jimmy s mischievous fingers In after days Pollyanna often went back in her thoughts to that first night in camp The experience was so new and so wonderful in so many ways It was four o clock when their forty mile automobile journey came to an end Since half past three their big car had been ponderously picking its way over an old logging road not designed for six cylinder automobiles For the car itself and for the hand at the wheel this part of the trip was a most wearing one but for the merry passengers who had no responsibility concerning hidden holes and muddy curves it was nothing but a delight growing more poignant with every new vista through the green arches and with every echoing laugh that dodged the low hanging branches The site for the camp was one known to John Pendleton years before and he greeted it now with a satisfied delight that was not unmingled with relief Oh how perfectly lovely chorused the others Glad you like it I thought it would be about right nodded John Pendleton Still I was a little anxious after all for these places do change you know most remarkably sometimes And of course this has grown up to bushes a little but not so but what we can easily clear it Everybody fell to work then clearing the ground putting up the two little tents unloading the automobile building the camp fire and arranging the kitchen and pantry It was then that Pollyanna began especially to notice Jamie and to fear for him She realized suddenly that the hummocks and hollows and pine littered knolls were not like a carpeted floor for a pair of crutches and she saw that Jamie was realizing it too She saw also that in spite of his infirmity he was trying to take his share in the work and the sight troubled her Twice she hurried forward and intercepted him taking from his arms the box he was trying to carry Here let me take that she begged You ve done enough And the second time she added Do go and sit down somewhere to rest Jamie You look so tired If she had been watching closely she would have seen the quick color sweep to his forehead But she was not watching so she did not see it She did see however to her intense surprise Sadie Dean hurry forward a moment later her arms full of boxes and heard her cry Oh mister Carew please if you WOULD give me a lift with these The next moment Jamie once more struggling with the problem of managing a bundle of boxes and two crutches was hastening toward the tents With a quick word of protest on her tongue Pollyanna turned to Sadie Dean But the protest died unspoken for Sadie her finger to her lips was hurrying straight toward her I know you didn t think she stammered in a low voice as she reached Pollyanna s side But don t you see it HURTS him to have you think he can t do things like other folks There look See how happy he is now Pollyanna looked and she saw She saw Jamie his whole self alert deftly balance his weight on one crutch and swing his burden to the ground She saw the happy light on his face and she heard him say nonchalantly Here s another contribution from Miss Dean She asked me to bring this over Why yes I see breathed Pollyanna turning to Sadie Dean But Sadie Dean had gone Pollyanna watched Jamie a good deal after that though she was careful not to let him or any one else see that she was watching him And as she watched her heart ached Twice she saw him essay a task and fail once with a box too heavy for him to lift once with a folding table too unwieldy for him to carry with his crutches And each time she saw his quick glance about him to see if others noticed She saw too that unmistakably he was getting very tired and that his face in spite of its gay smile was looking white and drawn as if he were in pain I should think we might have known more stormed Pollyanna hotly to herself her eyes blinded with tears I should think we might have known more than to have let him come to a place like this Camping indeed and with a pair of crutches Why couldn t we have remembered before we started An hour later around the camp fire after supper Pollyanna had her answer to this question for with the glowing fire before her and the soft fragrant dark all about her she once more fell under the spell of the witchery that fell from Jamie s lips and she once more forgot Jamie s crutches CHAPTER XXII COMRADES They were a merry party the six of them and a congenial one There seemed to be no end to the new delights that came with every new day not the least of which was the new charm of companionship that seemed to be a part of this new life they were living As Jamie said one night when they were all sitting about the fire You see we seem to know each other so much better up here in the woods better in a week than we would in a year in town I know it I wonder why murmured missus Carew her eyes dreamily following the leaping blaze I think it s something in the air sighed Pollyanna happily There s something about the sky and the woods and the lake so so well there just is that s all I think you mean because the world is shut out cried Sadie Dean with a curious little break in her voice Sadie had not joined in the laugh that followed Pollyanna s limping conclusion Up here everything is so real and true that we too can be our real true selves not what the world SAYS we are because we are rich or poor or great or humble but what we really are OURSELVES Ho scoffed Jimmy airily All that sounds very fine but the real common sense reason is because we don t have any missus Tom and Dick and Harry sitting on their side porches and commenting on every time we stir and wondering among themselves where we are going why we are going there and how long we re intending to stay Oh Jimmy how you do take the poetry out of things reproached Pollyanna laughingly But that s my business flashed Jimmy How do you suppose I m going to build dams and bridges if I don t see something besides poetry in the waterfall You can t Pendleton And it s the bridge that counts every time declared Jamie in a voice that brought a sudden hush to the group about the fire It was for only a moment however for almost at once Sadie Dean broke the silence with a gay Pooh I d rather have the waterfall every time without ANY bridge around to spoil the view Everybody laughed and it was as if a tension somewhere snapped Then missus Carew rose to her feet Come come children your stern chaperon says it s bedtime And with a merry chorus of good nights the party broke up And so the days passed To Pollyanna they were wonderful days and still the most wonderful part was the charm of close companionship a companionship that while differing as to details with each one was yet delightful with all With Sadie Dean she talked of the new Home and of what a marvelous work missus Carew was doing They talked too of the old days when Sadie was selling bows behind the counter and of what missus Carew had done for her Pollyanna heard also something of the old father and mother back home and of the joy that Sadie in her new position had been able to bring into their lives And after all it s really YOU that began it you know she said one day to Pollyanna But Pollyanna only shook her head at this with an emphatic Nonsense It was all missus Carew With missus Carew herself Pollyanna talked also of the Home and of her plans for the girls And once in the hush of a twilight walk missus Carew spoke of herself and of her changed outlook on life And she like Sadie Dean said brokenly After all it s really you that began it Pollyanna But Pollyanna as in Sadie Dean s case would have none of this and she began to talk of Jamie and of what HE had done Jamie s a dear missus Carew answered affectionately And I love him like an own son He couldn t be dearer to me if he were really my sister s boy Then you don t think he is I don t know We ve never learned anything conclusive Sometimes I m sure he is Then again I doubt it I think HE really believes he is bless his heart At all events one thing is sure he has good blood in him from somewhere Jamie s no ordinary waif of the streets you know with his talents and the wonderful way he has responded to teaching and training proves it Of course nodded Pollyanna And as long as you love him so well it doesn t really matter anyway does it whether he s the real Jamie or not missus Carew hesitated Into her eyes crept the old somberness of heartache Not so far as he is concerned she sighed at last It s only that sometimes I get to thinking if he isn t our Jamie where is Jamie Kent Is he well Is he happy Has he any one to love him When I get to thinking like that Pollyanna I m nearly wild I d give everything I have in the world it seems to me to really KNOW that this boy is Jamie Kent Pollyanna used to think of this conversation sometimes in her after talks with Jamie Jamie was so sure of himself It s just somehow that I FEEL it s so he said once to Pollyanna I believe I am Jamie Kent I ve believed it quite a while I m afraid I ve believed it so long now that that I just couldn t bear it to find out I wasn t he missus Carew has done so much for me just think if after all I were only a stranger But she loves you Jamie I know she does and that would only hurt all the more don t you see because it would be hurting her SHE wants me to be the real Jamie I know she does Now if I could only DO something for her make her proud of me in some way If I could only do something to support myself even like a man But what can I do with these He spoke bitterly and laid his hand on the crutches at his side Pollyanna was shocked and distressed It was the first time she had heard Jamie speak of his infirmity since the old boyhood days Frantically she cast about in her mind for just the right thing to say but before she had even thought of anything Jamie s face had undergone a complete change But there forget it I didn t mean to say it he cried gaily And twas rank heresy to the game wasn t it I m sure I m GLAD I ve got the crutches They re a whole lot nicer than the wheel chair And the Jolly Book do you keep it now asked Pollyanna in a voice that trembled a little Sure I ve got a whole library of jolly books now he retorted They re all in leather dark red except the first one That is the same little old notebook that Jerry gave me Jerry And I ve been meaning all the time to ask for him cried Pollyanna Where is he In Boston and his vocabulary is just as picturesque as ever only he has to tone it down at times Jerry s still in the newspaper business but he s GETTING the news not selling it Reporting you know I HAVE been able to help him and mumsey And don t you suppose I was glad Mumsey s in a sanatorium for her rheumatism And is she better Very much She s coming out pretty soon and going to housekeeping with Jerry Jerry s been making up some of his lost schooling during these past few years He s let me help him but only as a loan He s been very particular to stipulate that Of course nodded Pollyanna in approval He d want it that way I m sure I should It isn t nice to be under obligations that you can t pay I know how it is That s why I so wish I could help Aunt Polly out after all she s done for me But you are helping her this summer Pollyanna lifted her eyebrows Yes I m keeping summer boarders I look it don t I she challenged with a flourish of her hands toward her surroundings Surely never was a boarding house mistress s task quite like mine And you should have heard Aunt Polly s dire predictions of what summer boarders would be she chuckled irrepressibly What was that Pollyanna shook her head decidedly Couldn t possibly tell you That s a dead secret But She stopped and sighed her face growing wistful again This isn t going to last you know It can t Summer boarders don t I ve got to do something winters I ve been thinking I believe I ll write stories Jamie turned with a start You ll what he demanded Write stories to sell you know You needn t look so surprised Lots of folks do that I knew two girls in Germany who did Did you ever try it Jamie still spoke a little queerly N no not yet admitted Pollyanna Then defensively in answer to the expression on his face she bridled I TOLD you I was keeping summer boarders now I can t do both at once Of course not She threw him a reproachful glance You don t think I can ever do it I didn t say so No but you look it I don t see why I can t It isn t like singing You don t have to have a voice for it And it isn t like an instrument that you have to learn how to play I think it is a little like that Jamie s voice was low His eyes were turned away How What do you mean Why Jamie just a pencil and paper so that isn t like learning to play the piano or violin There was a moment s silence Then came the answer still in that low diffident voice still with the eyes turned away The instrument that you play on Pollyanna will be the great heart of the world and to me that seems the most wonderful instrument of all to learn Under your touch if you are skilful it will respond with smiles or tears as you will Illustration The instrument that you play on Pollyanna will be the great heart of the world Pollyanna drew a tremulous sigh Her eyes grew wet Oh Jamie how beautifully you do put things always I never thought of it that way But it s so isn t it How I would love to do it Maybe I couldn t do all that But I ve read stories in the magazines lots of them Seems as if I could write some like those anyway I LOVE to tell stories I m always repeating those you tell and I always laugh and cry too just as I do when YOU tell them Jamie turned quickly DO they make you laugh and cry Pollyanna really There was a curious eagerness in his voice Of course they do and you know it Jamie And they used to long ago too in the Public Garden Nobody can tell stories like you Jamie YOU ought to be the one writing stories not I And say Jamie why don t you You could do it lovely I know There was no answer Jamie apparently did not hear perhaps because he called at that instant to a chipmunk that was scurrying through the bushes near by It was not always with Jamie nor yet with missus Carew and Sadie Dean that Pollyanna had delightful walks and talks however very often it was with Jimmy or John Pendleton Pollyanna was sure now that she had never before known John Pendleton The old taciturn moroseness seemed entirely gone since they came to camp He rowed and swam and fished and tramped with fully as much enthusiasm as did Jimmy himself and with almost as much vigor Around the camp fire at night he quite rivaled Jamie with his story telling of adventures both laughable and thrilling that had befallen him in his foreign travels In the Desert of Sarah Nancy used to call it laughed Pollyanna one night as she joined the rest in begging for a story Better than all this however in Pollyanna s opinion were the times when John Pendleton with her alone talked of her mother as he used to know her and love her in the days long gone That he did so talk with her was a joy to Pollyanna but a great surprise too for never in the past had John Pendleton talked so freely of the girl whom he had so loved hopelessly Perhaps John Pendleton himself felt some of the surprise for once he said to Pollyanna musingly I wonder why I m talking to you like this Oh but I love to have you breathed Pollyanna Yes I know but I wouldn t think I would do it It must be though that it s because you are so like her as I knew her You are very like your mother my dear Why I thought my mother was BEAUTIFUL cried Pollyanna in unconcealed amazement John Pendleton smiled quizzically She was my dear Pollyanna looked still more amazed Then I don t see how I CAN be like her The man laughed outright Pollyanna if some girls had said that I well never mind what I d say You little witch you poor homely little Pollyanna Pollyanna flashed a genuinely distressed reproof straight into the man s merry eyes Please mister Pendleton don t look like that and don t tease me about THAT I d so LOVE to be beautiful though of course it sounds silly to say it And I HAVE a mirror you know Then I advise you to look in it when you re talking sometime observed the man sententiously Pollyanna s eyes flew wide open Why that s just what Jimmy said she cried Did he indeed the young rascal retorted John Pendleton dryly Then with one of the curiously abrupt changes of manner peculiar to him he said very low You have your mother s eyes and smile Pollyanna and to me you are beautiful And Pollyanna her eyes blinded with sudden hot tears was silenced Dear as were these talks however they still were not quite like the talks with Jimmy to Pollyanna For that matter she and Jimmy did not need to TALK to be happy Jimmy was always so comfortable and comforting whether they talked or not did not matter Jimmy always understood There was no pulling on her heart strings for sympathy with Jimmy Jimmy was delightfully big and strong and happy Jimmy was not sorrowing for a long lost nephew nor pining for the loss of a boyhood sweetheart Jimmy did not have to swing himself painfully about on a pair of crutches all of which was so hard to see and know and think of With Jimmy one could be just glad and happy and free Jimmy was such a dear He always rested one so did Jimmy CHAPTER XXIII TIED TO TWO STICKS It was on the last day at camp that it happened To Pollyanna it seemed such a pity that it should have happened at all for it was the first cloud to bring a shadow of regret and unhappiness to her heart during the whole trip and she found herself futilely sighing I wish we d gone home day before yesterday then it wouldn t have happened But they had not gone home day before yesterday and it had happened and this was the manner of it Early in the morning of that last day they had all started on a two mile tramp to the Basin We ll have one more bang up fish dinner before we go Jimmy had said And the rest had joyfully agreed With luncheon and fishing tackle therefore they had made an early start Laughing and calling gaily to each other they followed the narrow path through the woods led by Jimmy who best knew the way At first close behind Jimmy had walked Pollyanna but gradually she had fallen back with Jamie who was last in the line Pollyanna had thought she detected on Jamie s face the expression which she had come to know was there only when he was attempting something that taxed almost to the breaking point his skill and powers of endurance She knew that nothing would so offend him as to have her openly notice this state of affairs At the same time she also knew that from her more willingly than from any one else would he accept an occasional steadying hand over a troublesome log or stone Therefore at the first opportunity to make the change without apparent design she had dropped back step by step until she had reached her goal Jamie She had been rewarded instantly in the way Jamie s face brightened and in the easy assurance with which he met and conquered a fallen tree trunk across their path under the pleasant fiction carefully fostered by Pollyanna of helping her across Once out of the woods their way led along an old stone wall for a time with wide reaches of sunny sloping pastures on each side and a more distant picturesque farmhouse It was in the adjoining pasture that Pollyanna saw the goldenrod which she immediately coveted Jamie wait I m going to get it she exclaimed eagerly It ll make such a beautiful bouquet for our picnic table And nimbly she scrambled over the high stone wall and dropped herself down on the other side It was strange how tantalizing was that goldenrod Always just ahead she saw another bunch and yet another each a little finer than the one within her reach With joyous exclamations and gay little calls back to the waiting Jamie Pollyanna looking particularly attractive in her scarlet sweater skipped from bunch to bunch adding to her store She had both hands full when there came the hideous bellow of an angry bull the agonized shout from Jamie and the sound of hoofs thundering down the hillside What happened next was never clear to her She knew she dropped her goldenrod and ran ran as she never ran before ran as she thought she never could run back toward the wall and Jamie She knew that behind her the hoof beats were gaining gaining always gaining Dimly hopelessly far ahead of her she saw Jamie s agonized face and heard his hoarse cries Then from somewhere came a new voice Jimmy s shouting a cheery call of courage Still on and on she ran blindly hearing nearer and nearer the thud of those pounding hoofs Once she stumbled and almost fell Then dizzily she righted herself and plunged forward She felt her strength quite gone when suddenly close to her she heard Jimmy s cheery call again The next minute she felt herself snatched off her feet and held close to a great throbbing something that dimly she realized was Jimmy s heart It was all a horrid blur then of cries hot panting breaths and pounding hoofs thundering nearer ever nearer Then just as she knew those hoofs to be almost upon her she felt herself flung still in Jimmy s arms sharply to one side and yet not so far but that she still could feel the hot breath of the maddened animal as he dashed by Almost at once then she found herself on the other side of the wall with Jimmy bending over her imploring her to tell him she was not dead With an hysterical laugh that was yet half a sob she struggled out of his arms and stood upon her feet Dead No indeed thanks to you Jimmy I m all right I m all right Oh how glad glad glad I was to hear your voice Oh that was splendid How did you do it she panted Pooh That was nothing I just An inarticulate choking cry brought his words to a sudden halt He turned to find Jamie face down on the ground a little distance away Pollyanna was already hurrying toward him Jamie Jamie what is the matter she cried Did you fall Are you hurt There was no answer What is it old fellow ARE you hurt demanded Jimmy Still there was no answer Then suddenly Jamie pulled himself half upright and turned They saw his face then and fell back shocked and amazed Hurt Am I hurt he choked huskily flinging out both his hands Don t you suppose it hurts to see a thing like that and not be able to do anything To be tied helpless to a pair of sticks I tell you there s no hurt in all the world to equal it But but Jamie faltered Pollyanna Don t interrupted the cripple almost harshly He had struggled to his feet now Don t say anything I didn t mean to make a scene like this he finished brokenly as he turned and swung back along the narrow path that led to the camp For a minute as if transfixed the two behind him watched him go Well by Jove breathed Jimmy then in a voice that shook a little That was tough on him And I didn t think and PRAISED you right before him half sobbed Pollyanna And his hands did you see them They were BLEEDING where the nails had cut right into the flesh she finished as she turned and stumbled blindly up the path But Pollyanna w where are you going cried Jimmy I m going to Jamie of course Do you think I d leave him like that Come we must get him to come back And Jimmy with a sigh that was not all for Jamie went CHAPTER XXIV JIMMY WAKES UP Outwardly the camping trip was pronounced a great success but inwardly Pollyanna wondered sometimes if it were all herself or if there really were a peculiar indefinable constraint in everybody with everybody else Certainly she felt it and she thought she saw evidences that the others felt it too As for the cause of it all unhesitatingly she attributed it to that last day at camp with its unfortunate trip to the Basin To be sure she and Jimmy had easily caught up with Jamie and had after considerable coaxing persuaded him to turn about and go on to the Basin with them But in spite of everybody s very evident efforts to act as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened nobody really succeeded in doing so Pollyanna Jamie and Jimmy overdid their gayety a bit perhaps and the others while not knowing exactly what had happened very evidently felt that something was not quite right though they plainly tried to hide the fact that they did feel so Naturally in this state of affairs restful happiness was out of the question Even the anticipated fish dinner was flavorless and early in the afternoon the start was made back to the camp Once home again Pollyanna had hoped that the unhappy episode of the angry bull would be forgotten But she could not forget it so in all fairness she could not blame the others if they could not Always she thought of it now when she looked at Jamie She saw again the agony on his face the crimson stain on the palms of his hands Her heart ached for him and because it did so ache his mere presence had come to be a pain to her Remorsefully she confessed to herself that she did not like to be with Jamie now nor to talk with him but that did not mean that she was not often with him She was with him indeed much oftener than before for so remorseful was she and so fearful was she that he would detect her unhappy frame of mind that she lost no opportunity of responding to his overtures of comradeship and sometimes she deliberately sought him out This last she did not often have to do however for more and more frequently these days Jamie seemed to be turning to her for companionship The reason for this Pollyanna believed was to be found in this same incident of the bull and the rescue Not that Jamie ever referred to it directly He never did that He was too even gayer than usual but Pollyanna thought she detected sometimes a bitterness underneath it all that was never there before Certainly she could not help seeing that at times he seemed almost to want to avoid the others and that he actually sighed as if with relief when he found himself alone with her She thought she knew why this was so after he said to her as he did say one day while they were watching the others play tennis You see after all Pollyanna there isn t any one who can quite understand as you can Understand Pollyanna had not known what he meant at first They had been watching the players for five minutes without a word between them Yes for you once couldn t walk yourself Oh h yes I know faltered Pollyanna and she knew that her great distress must have shown in her face for so quickly and so blithely did he change the subject after a laughing Come come Pollyanna why don t you tell me to play the game I would if I were in your place Forget it please I was a brute to make you look like that And Pollyanna smiled and said No no no indeed But she did not forget it She could not And it all made her only the more anxious to be with Jamie and help him all she could As if NOW I d ever let him see that I was ever anything but glad when he was with me she thought fervently as she hurried forward a minute later to take her turn in the game Pollyanna however was not the only one in the party who felt a new awkwardness and constraint Jimmy Pendleton felt it though he too tried not to show it Jimmy was not happy these days From a care free youth whose visions were of wonderful spans across hitherto unbridgeable chasms he has come to be an anxious eyed young man whose visions were of a feared rival bearing away the girl he loved Jimmy knew very well now that he was in love with Pollyanna He suspected that he had been in love with her for some time He stood aghast indeed to find himself so shaken and powerless before this thing that had come to him He knew that even his beloved bridges were as nothing when weighed against the smile in a girl s eyes and the word on a girl s lips He realized that the most wonderful span in the world to him would be the thing that could help him to cross the chasm of fear and doubt that he felt lay between him and Pollyanna doubt because of Pollyanna fear because of Jamie Not until he had seen Pollyanna in jeopardy that day in the pasture had he realized how empty would be the world his world without her Not until his wild dash for safety with Pollyanna in his arms had he realized how precious she was to him For a moment indeed with his arms about her and hers clinging about his neck he had felt that she was indeed his and even in that supreme moment of danger he knew the thrill of supreme bliss Then a little later he had seen Jamie s face and Jamie s hands To him they could mean but one thing Jamie too loved Pollyanna and Jamie had to stand by helpless tied to two sticks That was what he had said Jimmy believed that had he himself been obliged to stand by helpless tied to two sticks while another rescued the girl that he loved he would have looked like that Jimmy had gone back to camp that day with his thoughts in a turmoil of fear and rebellion He wondered if Pollyanna cared for Jamie that was where the fear came in But even if she did care a little must he stand aside weakly and let Jamie without a struggle make her learn to care more That was where the rebellion came in Indeed no he would not do it decided Jimmy It should be a fair fight between them Then all by himself as he was Jimmy flushed hot to the roots of his hair Would it be a fair fight Could any fight between him and Jamie be a fair fight Jimmy felt suddenly as he had felt years before when as a lad he had challenged a new boy to a fight for an apple they both claimed then at the first blow had discovered that the new boy had a crippled arm He had purposely lost then of course and had let the crippled boy win But he told himself fiercely now that this case was different It was no apple that was at stake It was his life s happiness It might even be Pollyanna s life s happiness too Perhaps she did not care for Jamie at all but would care for her old friend Jimmy if he but once showed her he wanted her to care And he would show her He would Once again Jimmy blushed hotly But he frowned too angrily if only he COULD forget how Jamie had looked when he had uttered that moaning tied to two sticks If only But what was the use It was NOT a fair fight and he knew it He knew too right there and then that his decision would be just what it afterwards proved to be he would watch and wait He would give Jamie his chance and if Pollyanna showed that she cared he would take himself off and away quite out of their lives and they should never know either of them how bitterly he was suffering He would go back to his bridges as if any bridge though it led to the moon itself could compare for a moment with Pollyanna But he would do it He must do it It was all very fine and heroic and Jimmy felt so exalted he was atingle with something that was almost happiness when he finally dropped off to sleep that night But martyrdom in theory and practice differs woefully as would be martyrs have found out from time immemorial It was all very well to decide alone and in the dark that he would give Jamie his chance but it was quite another matter really to do it when it involved nothing less than the leaving of Pollyanna and Jamie together almost every time he saw them Then too he was very much worried at Pollyanna s apparent attitude toward the lame youth It looked very much to Jimmy as if she did indeed care for him so watchful was she of his comfort so apparently eager to be with him Then as if to settle any possible doubt in Jimmy s mind there came the day when Sadie Dean had something to say on the subject They were all out in the tennis court Sadie was sitting alone when Jimmy strolled up to her You next with Pollyanna isn t it he queried She shook her head Pollyanna isn t playing any more this morning Isn t playing frowned Jimmy who had been counting on his own game with Pollyanna Why not For a brief minute Sadie Dean did not answer then with very evident difficulty she said Pollyanna told me last night that she thought we were playing tennis too much that it wasn t kind to mister Carew as long as he can t play I know but Jimmy stopped helplessly the frown plowing a deeper furrow into his forehead The next instant he fairly started with surprise at the tense something in Sadie Dean s voice as she said But he doesn t want her to stop He doesn t want any one of us to make any difference for him It s that that hurts him so She doesn t understand She doesn t understand But I do She thinks she does though Something in words or manner sent a sudden pang to Jimmy s heart He threw a sharp look into her face A question flew to his lips For a moment he held it back then trying to hide his earnestness with a bantering smile he let it come Why Miss Dean you don t mean to convey the idea that that there s any SPECIAL interest in each other between those two do you She gave him a scornful glance Where have your eyes been She worships him I mean they worship each other she corrected hastily Jimmy with an inarticulate ejaculation turned and walked away abruptly He could not trust himself to remain longer He did not wish to talk any more just then to Sadie Dean So abruptly indeed did he turn that he did not notice that Sadie Dean too turned hurriedly and busied herself looking in the grass at her feet as if she had lost something Very evidently Sadie Dean also did not wish to talk any more just then Jimmy Pendleton told himself that it was not true at all that it was all falderal what Sadie Dean had said Yet nevertheless true or not true he could not forget it It colored all his thoughts thereafter and loomed before his eyes like a shadow whenever he saw Pollyanna and Jamie together He watched their faces covertly He listened to the tones of their voices He came then in time to think it was after all true that they did worship each other and his heart in consequence grew like lead within him True to his promise to himself however he turned resolutely away The die was cast he told himself Pollyanna was not to be for him Restless days for Jimmy followed To stay away from the Harrington homestead entirely he did not dare lest his secret be suspected To be with Pollyanna at all now was torture Even to be with Sadie Dean was unpleasant for he could not forget that it was Sadie Dean who had finally opened his eyes Jamie certainly was no haven of refuge under the circumstances and that left only missus Carew missus Carew however was a host in herself and Jimmy found his only comfort these days in her society Gay or grave she always seemed to know how to fit his mood exactly and it was wonderful how much she knew about bridges the kind of bridges he was going to build She was so wise too and so sympathetic knowing always just the right word to say He even one day almost told her about The Packet but John Pendleton interrupted them at just the wrong moment so the story was not told John Pendleton was always interrupting them at just the wrong moment Jimmy thought vexedly sometimes Then when he remembered what John Pendleton had done for him he was ashamed The Packet was a thing that dated back to Jimmy s boyhood and had never been mentioned to any one save to John Pendleton and that only once at the time of his adoption The Packet was nothing but rather a large white envelope worn with time and plump with mystery behind a huge red seal It had been given him by his father and it bore the following instructions in his father s hand To my boy Jimmy Not to be opened until his thirtieth birthday except in case of his death when it shall be opened at once There were times when Jimmy speculated a good deal as to the contents of that envelope There were other times when he forgot its existence In the old days at the Orphans Home his chief terror had been that it should be discovered and taken away from him In those days he wore it always hidden in the lining of his coat Of late years at John Pendleton s suggestion it had been tucked away in the Pendleton safe For there s no knowing how valuable it may be John Pendleton had said with a smile And anyway your father evidently wanted you to have it and we wouldn t want to run the risk of losing it No I wouldn t want to lose it of course Jimmy had smiled back a little soberly But I m not counting on its being real valuable sir Poor dad didn t have anything that was very valuable about him as I remember It was this Packet that Jimmy came so near mentioning to missus Carew one day if only John Pendleton had not interrupted them Still maybe it s just as well I didn t tell her about it Jimmy reflected afterwards on his way home She might have thought dad had something in his life that wasn t quite right And I wouldn t have wanted her to think that of dad CHAPTER XXV THE GAME AND POLLYANNA Before the middle of September the Carews and Sadie Dean said good by and went back to Boston Much as she knew she would miss them Pollyanna drew an actual sigh of relief as the train bearing them away rolled out of the Beldingsville station Pollyanna would not have admitted having this feeling of relief to any one else and even to herself she apologized in her thoughts It isn t that I don t love them dearly every one of them she sighed watching the train disappear around the curve far down the track It s only that that I m so sorry for poor Jamie all the time and and I am tired I shall be glad for a while just to go back to the old quiet days with Jimmy Pollyanna however did not go back to the old quiet days with Jimmy The days that immediately followed the going of the Carews were quiet certainly but they were not passed with Jimmy Jimmy rarely came near the house now and when he did call he was not the old Jimmy that she used to know He was moody restless and silent or else very gay and talkative in a nervous fashion that was most puzzling and annoying Before long too he himself went to Boston and then of course she did not see him at all Pollyanna was surprised then to see how much she missed him Even to know that he was in town and that there was a chance that he might come over was better than the dreary emptiness of certain absence and even his puzzling moods of alternating gloominess and gayety were preferable to this utter silence of nothingness Then one day suddenly she pulled herself up with hot cheeks and shamed eyes Well Pollyanna Whittier she upbraided herself sharply one would think you were in LOVE with Jimmy Bean Pendleton Can t you think of ANYTHING but him Whereupon forthwith she bestirred herself to be very gay and lively indeed and to put this Jimmy Bean Pendleton out of her thoughts As it happened Aunt Polly though unwittingly helped her to this With the going of the Carews had gone also their chief source of immediate income and Aunt Polly was beginning to worry again audibly about the state of their finances I don t know really Pollyanna what IS going to become of us she would moan frequently Of course we are a little ahead now from this summer s work and we have a small sum from the estate right along but I never know how soon that s going to stop like all the rest If only we could do something to bring in some ready cash It was after one of these moaning lamentations one day that Pollyanna s eyes chanced to fall on a prize story contest offer It was a most alluring one The prizes were large and numerous The conditions were set forth in glowing terms To read it one would think that to win out were the easiest thing in the world It contained even a special appeal that might have been framed for Pollyanna herself This is for you you who read this it ran What if you never have written a story before That is no sign you cannot write one Try it That s all Wouldn t YOU like three thousand dollars Two thousand One thousand Five hundred or even one hundred Then why not go after it The very thing cried Pollyanna clapping her hands I m so glad I saw it And it says I can do it too I thought I could if I d just try I ll go tell auntie so she needn t worry any more Pollyanna was on her feet and half way to the door when a second thought brought her steps to a pause Come to think of it I reckon I won t after all It ll be all the nicer to surprise her and if I SHOULD get the first one Pollyanna went to sleep that night planning what she COULD do with that three thousand dollars Pollyanna began her story the next day That is she with a very important air got out a quantity of paper sharpened up half a dozen pencils and established herself at the big old fashioned Harrington desk in the living room After biting restlessly at the ends of two of her pencils she wrote down three words on the fair white page before her Then she drew a long sigh threw aside the second ruined pencil and picked up a slender green one with a beautiful point This point she eyed with a meditative frown O dear I wonder WHERE they get their titles she despaired Maybe though I ought to decide on the story first and then make a title to fit Anyhow I M going to do it And forthwith she drew a black line through the three words and poised the pencil for a fresh start The start was not made at once however Even when it was made it must have been a false one for at the end of half an hour the whole page was nothing but a jumble of scratched out lines with only a few words here and there left to tell the tale At this juncture Aunt Polly came into the room She turned tired eyes upon her niece Well Pollyanna what ARE you up to now she demanded Pollyanna laughed and colored guiltily Nothing much auntie Anyhow it doesn t look as if it were much yet she admitted with a rueful smile Besides it s a secret and I m not going to tell it yet Very well suit yourself sighed Aunt Polly But I can tell you right now that if you re trying to make anything different out of those mortgage papers mister Hart left it s useless I ve been all over them myself twice No dear it isn t the papers It s a whole heap nicer than any papers ever could be crowed Pollyanna triumphantly turning back to her work In Pollyanna s eyes suddenly had risen a glowing vision of what it might be with that three thousand dollars once hers For still another half hour Pollyanna wrote and scratched and chewed her pencils then with her courage dulled but not destroyed she gathered up her papers and pencils and left the room I reckon maybe I ll do better by myself up stairs she was thinking as she hurried through the hall I THOUGHT I ought to do it at a desk being literary work so but anyhow the desk didn t help me any this morning I ll try the window seat in my room The window seat however proved to be no more inspiring judging by the scratched and re scratched pages that fell from Pollyanna s hands and at the end of another half hour Pollyanna discovered suddenly that it was time to get dinner Well I m glad tis anyhow she sighed to herself I d a lot rather get dinner than do this Not but that I WANT to do this of course only I d no idea twas such an awful job just a story so During the following month Pollyanna worked faithfully doggedly but she soon found that just a story so was indeed no small matter to accomplish Pollyanna however was not one to set her hand to the plow and look back Besides there was that three thousand dollar prize or even any of the others if she should not happen to win the first one Of course even one hundred dollars was something So day after day she wrote and erased and rewrote until finally the story such as it was lay completed before her Then with some misgivings it must be confessed she took the manuscript to Milly Snow to be typewritten It reads all right that is it makes sense mused Pollyanna doubtfully as she hurried along toward the Snow cottage and it s a real nice story about a perfectly lovely girl But there s something somewhere that isn t quite right about it I m afraid Anyhow I don t believe I d better count too much on the first prize then I won t be too much disappointed when I get one of the littler ones Pollyanna always thought of Jimmy when she went to the Snows for it was at the side of the road near their cottage that she had first seen him as a forlorn little runaway lad from the Orphans Home years before She thought of him again to day with a little catch of her breath Then with the proud lifting of her head that always came now with the second thought of Jimmy she hurried up the Snows doorsteps and rang the bell As was usually the case the Snows had nothing but the warmest of welcomes for Pollyanna and also as usual it was not long before they were talking of the game in no home in Beldingsville was the glad game more ardently played than in the Snows Well and how are you getting along asked Pollyanna when she had finished the business part of her call Splendidly beamed Milly Snow This is the third job I ve got this week Oh Miss Pollyanna I m so glad you had me take up typewriting for you see I CAN do that right at home And it s all owing to you Nonsense disclaimed Pollyanna merrily But it is In the first place I couldn t have done it anyway if it hadn t been for the game making mother so much better you know that I had some time to myself And then at the very first you suggested typewriting and helped me to buy a machine I should like to know if that doesn t come pretty near owing it all to you But once again Pollyanna objected This time she was interrupted by missus Snow from her wheel chair by the window And so earnestly and gravely did missus Snow speak that Pollyanna in spite of herself could but hear what she had to say Listen child I don t think you know quite what you ve done But I wish you could There s a little look in your eyes my dear to day that I don t like to see there You are plagued and worried over something I know I can see it And I don t wonder your uncle s death your aunt s condition everything I won t say more about that But there s something I do want to say my dear and you must let me say it for I can t bear to see that shadow in your eyes without trying to drive it away by telling you what you ve done for me for this whole town and for countless other people everywhere missus SNOW protested Pollyanna in genuine distress Oh I mean it and I know what I m talking about nodded the invalid triumphantly To begin with look at me Didn t you find me a fretful whining creature who never by any chance wanted what she had until she found what she didn t have And didn t you open my eyes by bringing me three kinds of things so I d HAVE to have what I wanted for once Oh missus Snow was I really ever quite so impertinent as that murmured Pollyanna with a painful blush It wasn t impertinent objected missus Snow stoutly You didn t MEAN it as impertinence and that made all the difference in the world You didn t preach either my dear If you had you d never have got me to playing the game nor anybody else I fancy But you did get me to playing it and see what it s done for me and for Milly Here I am so much better that I can sit in a wheel chair and go anywhere on this floor in it That means a whole lot when it comes to waiting on yourself and giving those around you a chance to breathe meaning Milly in this case And the doctor says it s all owing to the game Then there s others quantities of others right in this town that I m hearing of all the time Nellie Mahoney broke her wrist and was so glad it wasn t her leg that she didn t mind the wrist at all Old missus Tibbits has lost her hearing but she s so glad tisn t her eyesight that she s actually happy Do you remember cross eyed Joe that they used to call Cross Joe be cause of his temper Nothing went to suit him either any more than it did me Well somebody s taught him the game they say and made a different man of him And listen dear It s not only this town but other places I had a letter yesterday from my cousin in Massachusetts and she told me all about missus Tom Payson that used to live here Do you remember them They lived on the way up Pendleton Hill Yes oh yes I remember them cried Pollyanna Well they left here that winter you were in the Sanatorium and went to Massachusetts where my sister lives She knows them well She says missus Payson told her all about you and how your glad game actually saved them from a divorce And now not only do they play it themselves but they ve got quite a lot of others playing it down there and THEY RE getting still others So you see dear there s no telling where that glad game of yours is going to stop I wanted you to know I thought it might help even you to play the game sometimes for don t think I don t understand dearie that it IS hard for you to play your own game sometimes Pollyanna rose to her feet She smiled but her eyes glistened with tears as she held out her hand in good by Thank you missus Snow she said unsteadily It IS hard sometimes and maybe I DID need a little help about my own game But anyhow now her eyes flashed with their old merriment if any time I think I can t play the game myself I can remember that I can still always be GLAD there are some folks playing it Pollyanna walked home a little soberly that afternoon Touched as she was by what missus Snow had said there was yet an undercurrent of sadness in it all She was thinking of Aunt Polly Aunt Polly who played the game now so seldom and she was wondering if she herself always played it when she might Maybe I haven t been careful always to hunt up the glad side of the things Aunt Polly says she thought with undefined guiltiness and maybe if I played the game better myself Aunt Polly would play it a little Anyhow I m going to try If I don t look out all these other people will be playing my own game better than I am myself CHAPTER XXVI JOHN PENDLETON It was just a week before Christmas that Pollyanna sent her story now neatly typewritten in for the contest The prize winners would not be announced until April the magazine notice said so Pollyanna settled herself for the long wait with characteristic philosophical patience I don t know anyhow but I m glad tis so long she told herself for all winter I can have the fun of thinking it may be the first one instead of one of the others that I ll get I might just as well think I m going to get it then if I do get it I won t have been unhappy any While if I don t get it I won t have had all these weeks of unhappiness beforehand anyway and I can be glad for one of the smaller ones then That she might not get any prize was not in Pollyanna s calculations at all The story so beautifully typed by Milly Snow looked almost as good as printed already to Pollyanna Christmas was not a happy time at the Harrington homestead that year in spite of Pollyanna s strenuous efforts to make it so Aunt Polly refused absolutely to allow any sort of celebration of the day and made her attitude so unmistakably plain that Pollyanna could not give even the simplest of presents Christmas evening John Pendleton called missus Chilton excused herself but Pollyanna utterly worn out from a long day with her aunt welcomed him joyously But even here she found a fly in the amber of her content for John Pendleton had brought with him a letter from Jimmy and the letter was full of nothing but the plans he and missus Carew were making for a wonderful Christmas celebration at the Home for Working Girls and Pollyanna ashamed though she was to own it to herself was not in a mood to hear about Christmas celebrations just then least of all Jimmy s John Pendleton however was not ready to let the subject drop even when the letter had been read Great doings those he exclaimed as he folded the letter Yes indeed fine murmured Pollyanna trying to speak with due enthusiasm And it s to night too isn t it I d like to drop in on them about now Yes murmured Pollyanna again with still more careful enthusiasm missus Carew knew what she was about when she got Jimmy to help her I fancy chuckled the man But I m wondering how Jimmy likes it playing Santa Claus to half a hundred young women at once Why he finds it delightful of course Pollyanna lifted her chin ever so slightly Maybe Still it s a little different from learning to build bridges you must confess Oh yes But I ll risk Jimmy and I ll risk wagering that those girls never had a better time than he ll give them to night too Y yes of course stammered Pollyanna trying to keep the hated tremulousness out of her voice and trying very hard NOT to compare her own dreary evening in Beldingsville with nobody but John Pendleton to that of those fifty girls in Boston with Jimmy There was a brief pause during which John Pendleton gazed dreamily at the dancing fire on the hearth She s a wonderful woman missus Carew is he said at last She is indeed This time the enthusiasm in Pollyanna s voice was all pure gold Jimmy s written me before something of what she s done for those girls went on the man still gazing into the fire In just the last letter before this he wrote a lot about it and about her He said he always admired her but never so much as now when he can see what she really is She s a dear that s what missus Carew is declared Pollyanna warmly She s a dear in every way and I love her John Pendleton stirred suddenly He turned to Pollyanna with an oddly whimsical look in his eyes I know you do my dear For that matter there may be others too that love her Pollyanna s heart skipped a beat A sudden thought came to her with stunning blinding force JIMMY Could John Pendleton be meaning that Jimmy cared THAT WAY for missus Carew You mean she faltered She could not finish With a nervous twitch peculiar to him John Pendleton got to his feet I mean the girls of course he answered lightly still with that whimsical smile Don t you suppose those fifty girls love her most to death Pollyanna said yes of course and murmured something else appropriate in answer to John Pendleton s next remark But her thoughts were in a tumult and she let the man do most of the talking for the rest of the evening Nor did John Pendleton seem averse to this Restlessly he took a turn or two about the room then sat down in his old place And when he spoke it was on his old subject missus Carew Queer about that Jamie of hers isn t it I wonder if he IS her nephew As Pollyanna did not answer the man went on after a moment s silence He s a fine fellow anyway I like him There s something fine and genuine about him She s bound up in him That s plain to be seen whether he s really her kin or not There was another pause then in a slightly altered voice John Pendleton said Still it s queer too when you come to think of it that she never married again She is certainly now a very beautiful woman Don t you think so Yes yes indeed she is plunged in Pollyanna with precipitate haste a a very beautiful woman There was a little break at the last in Pollyanna s voice Pollyanna just then had caught sight of her own face in the mirror opposite and Pollyanna to herself was never a very beautiful woman On and on rambled John Pendleton musingly contentedly his eyes on the fire Whether he was answered or not seemed not to disturb him Whether he was even listened to or not he seemed hardly to know He wanted apparently only to talk but at last he got to his feet reluctantly and said good night For a weary half hour Pollyanna had been longing for him to go that she might be alone but after he had gone she wished he were back She had found suddenly that she did not want to be alone with her thoughts It was wonderfully clear to Pollyanna now There was no doubt of it Jimmy cared for missus Carew That was why he was so moody and restless after she left That was why he had come so seldom to see her Pollyanna his old friend That was why Countless little circumstances of the past summer flocked to Pollyanna s memory now mute witnesses that would not be denied And why should he not care for her missus Carew was certainly beautiful and charming True she was older than Jimmy but young men had married women far older than she many times And if they loved each other Pollyanna cried herself to sleep that night In the morning bravely she tried to face the thing She even tried with a tearful smile to put it to the test of the glad game She was reminded then of something Nancy had said to her years before If there IS a set o folks in the world that wouldn t have no use for that ere glad game o your n it d be a pair o quarrellin lovers Not that we re quarrelling or even lovers thought Pollyanna blushingly but just the same I can be glad HE S glad and glad SHE S glad too only Even to herself Pollyanna could not finish this sentence Being so sure now that Jimmy and missus Carew cared for each other Pollyanna became peculiarly sensitive to everything that tended to strengthen that belief And being ever on the watch for it she found it as was to be expected First in missus Carew s letters I am seeing a lot of your friend young Pendleton missus Carew wrote one day and I m liking him more and more I do wish however just for curiosity s sake that I could trace to its source that elusive feeling that I ve seen him before somewhere Frequently after this she mentioned him casually and to Pollyanna in the very casualness of these references lay their sharpest sting for it showed so unmistakably that Jimmy and Jimmy s presence were now to missus Carew a matter of course From other sources too Pollyanna found fuel for the fire of her suspicions More and more frequently John Pendleton dropped in with his stories of Jimmy and of what Jimmy was doing and always here there was mention of missus Carew Poor Pollyanna wondered indeed sometimes if John Pendleton could not talk of anything but missus Carew and Jimmy so constantly was one or the other of those names on his lips There were Sadie Dean s letters too and they told of Jimmy and of what he was doing to help missus Carew Even Jamie who wrote occasionally had his mite to add for he wrote one evening It s ten o clock I m sitting here alone waiting for missus Carew to come home She and Pendleton have been to one of their usual socials down to the Home From Jimmy himself Pollyanna heard very rarely and for that she told herself mournfully that she COULD be GLAD For if he can t write about ANYTHING but missus Carew and those girls I m glad he doesn t write very often she sighed CHAPTER XXVII THE DAY POLLYANNA DID NOT PLAY And so one by one the winter days passed January and February slipped away in snow and sleet and March came in with a gale that whistled and moaned around the old house and set loose blinds to swinging and loose gates to creaking in a way that was most trying to nerves already stretched to the breaking point Pollyanna was not finding it very easy these days to play the game but she was playing it faithfully valiantly Aunt Polly was not playing it at all which certainly did not make it any the easier for Pollyanna to play it Aunt Polly was blue and discouraged She was not well too and she had plainly abandoned herself to utter gloom Pollyanna still was counting on the prize contest She had dropped from the first prize to one of the smaller ones however Pollyanna had been writing more stories and the regularity with which they came back from their pilgrimages to magazine editors was beginning to shake her faith in her success as an author Oh well I can be glad that Aunt Polly doesn t know anything about it anyway declared Pollyanna to herself bravely as she twisted in her fingers the declined with thanks slip that had just towed in one more shipwrecked story She CAN T worry about this she doesn t know about it All of Pollyanna s life these days revolved around Aunt Polly and it is doubtful if even Aunt Polly herself realized how exacting she had become and how entirely her niece was giving up her life to her It was on a particularly gloomy day in March that matters came in a way to a climax Pollyanna upon arising had looked at the sky with a sigh Aunt Polly was always more difficult on cloudy days With a gay little song however that still sounded a bit forced Pollyanna descended to the kitchen and began to prepare breakfast I reckon I ll make corn muffins she told the stove confidentially then maybe Aunt Polly won t mind other things so much Half an hour later she tapped at her aunt s door Up so soon Oh that s fine And you ve done your hair yourself I couldn t sleep I had to get up sighed Aunt Polly wearily I had to do my hair too YOU weren t here But I didn t suppose you were ready for me auntie explained Pollyanna hurriedly Never mind though You ll be glad I wasn t when you find what I ve been doing Well I sha n t not this morning frowned Aunt Polly perversely Nobody could be glad this morning Look at it rain That makes the third rainy day this week That s so but you know the sun never seems quite so perfectly lovely as it does after a lot of rain like this smiled Pollyanna deftly arranging a bit of lace and ribbon at her aunt s throat Now come Breakfast s all ready Just you wait till you see what I ve got for you Aunt Polly however was not to be diverted even by corn muffins this morning Nothing was right nothing was even endurable as she felt and Pollyanna s patience was sorely taxed before the meal was over To make matters worse the roof over the east attic window was found to be leaking and an unpleasant letter came in the mail Pollyanna true to her creed laughingly declared that for her part she was glad they had a roof to leak and that as for the letter she d been expecting it for a week anyway and she was actually glad she wouldn t have to worry any more for fear it would come It COULDN T come now because it HAD come and twas over with All this together with sundry other hindrances and annoyances delayed the usual morning work until far into the afternoon something that was always particularly displeasing to methodical Aunt Polly who ordered her own life preferably by the tick of the clock But it s half past three Pollyanna already Did you know it she fretted at last And you haven t made the beds yet No dearie but I will Don t worry But did you hear what I said Look at the clock child It s after three o clock So tis but never mind Aunt Polly We can be glad tisn t after four Aunt Polly sniffed her disdain I suppose YOU can she observed tartly Pollyanna laughed Well you see auntie clocks ARE accommodating things when you stop to think about it I found that out long ago at the Sanatorium When I was doing something that I liked and I didn t WANT the time to go fast I d just look at the hour hand and I d feel as if I had lots of time it went so slow Then other days when I had to keep something that hurt on for an hour maybe I d watch the little second hand and you see then I felt as if Old Time was just humping himself to help me out by going as fast as ever he could Now I m watching the hour hand to day cause I don t want Time to go fast See she twinkled mischievously as she hurried from the room before Aunt Polly had time to answer It was certainly a hard day and by night Pollyanna looked pale and worn out This too was a source of worriment to Aunt Polly Dear me child you look tired to death she fumed WHAT we re going to do I don t know I suppose YOU LL be sick next Nonsense auntie I m not sick a bit declared Pollyanna dropping herself with a sigh on to the couch But I AM tired My how good this couch feels I m glad I m tired after all it s so nice to rest Aunt Polly turned with an impatient gesture Glad glad glad Of course you re glad Pollyanna You re always glad for everything I never saw such a girl Oh yes I know it s the game she went on in answer to the look that came to Pollyanna s face And it s a very good game too but I think you carry it altogether too far This eternal doctrine of it might be worse has got on my nerves Pollyanna Honestly it would be a real relief if you WOULDN T be glad for something sometime Why auntie Pollyanna pulled herself half erect Well it would You just try it sometime and see But auntie I Pollyanna stopped and eyed her aunt reflectively An odd look came to her eyes a slow smile curved her lips missus Chilton who had turned back to her work paid no heed and after a minute Pollyanna lay back on the couch without finishing her sentence the curious smile still on her lips It was raining again when Pollyanna got up the next morning and a northeast wind was still whistling down the chimney Pollyanna at the window drew an involuntary sigh but almost at once her face changed Oh well I m glad She clapped her hands to her lips Dear me she chuckled softly her eyes dancing I shall forget I know I shall and that ll spoil it all I must just remember not to be glad for anything not ANYTHING to day Pollyanna did not make corn muffins that morning She started the breakfast then went to her aunt s room missus Chilton was still in bed I see it rains as usual she observed by way of greeting Yes it s horrid perfectly horrid scolded Pollyanna It s rained most every day this week too I hate such weather Aunt Polly turned with a faint surprise in her eyes but Pollyanna was looking the other way Are you going to get up now she asked a little wearily Why y yes murmured Aunt Polly still with that faint surprise in her eyes What s the matter Pollyanna Are you especially tired Yes I am tired this morning I didn t sleep well either I hate not to sleep Things always plague so in the night when you wake up I guess I know that fretted Aunt Polly I didn t sleep a wink after two o clock myself And there s that roof How are we going to have it fixed pray if it never stops raining Have you been up to empty the pans Oh yes and took up some more There s a new leak now further over A new one Why it ll all be leaking yet Pollyanna opened her lips She had almost said Well we can be glad to have it fixed all at once then when she suddenly remembered and substituted in a tired voice Very likely it will auntie It looks like it now fast enough Anyway it s made fuss enough for a whole roof already and I m sick of it With which statement Pollyanna her face carefully averted turned and trailed listlessly out of the room It s so funny and so so hard I m afraid I m making a mess of it she whispered to herself anxiously as she hurried down stairs to the kitchen Behind her Aunt Polly in the bedroom gazed after her with eyes that were again faintly puzzled Aunt Polly had occasion a good many times before six o clock that night to gaze at Pollyanna with surprised and questioning eyes Nothing was right with Pollyanna The fire would not burn the wind blew one particular blind loose three times and still a third leak was discovered in the roof The mail brought to Pollyanna a letter that made her cry though no amount of questioning on Aunt Polly s part would persuade her to tell why Even the dinner went wrong and innumerable things happened in the afternoon to call out fretful discouraged remarks Not until the day was more than half gone did a look of shrewd suspicion suddenly fight for supremacy with the puzzled questioning in Aunt Polly s eyes If Pollyanna saw this she made no sign Certainly there was no abatement in her fretfulness and discontent Long before six o clock however the suspicion in Aunt Polly s eyes became conviction and drove to ignominious defeat the puzzled questioning But curiously enough then a new look came to take its place a look that was actually a twinkle of amusement At last after a particularly doleful complaint on Pollyanna s part Aunt Polly threw up her hands with a gesture of half laughing despair That ll do that ll do child I ll give up I ll confess myself beaten at my own game You can be GLAD for that if you like she finished with a grim smile I know auntie but you said began Pollyanna demurely Yes yes but I never will again interrupted Aunt Polly with emphasis Mercy what a day this has been I never want to live through another like it She hesitated flushed a little then went on with evident difficulty Furthermore I I want you to know that that I understand I haven t played the game myself very well lately but after this I m going to to try WHERE S my handkerchief she finished sharply fumbling in the folds of her dress Pollyanna sprang to her feet and crossed instantly to her aunt s side Oh but Aunt Polly I didn t mean It was just a a joke she quavered in quick distress I never thought of your taking it THAT way Of course you didn t snapped Aunt Polly with all the asperity of a stern repressed woman who abhors scenes and sentiment and who is mortally afraid she will show that her heart has been touched Don t you suppose I know you didn t mean it that way Do you think if I thought you HAD been trying to teach me a lesson that I d I d But Pollyanna s strong young arms had her in a close embrace and she could not finish the sentence CHAPTER XXVIII JIMMY AND JAMIE Pollyanna was not the only one that was finding that winter a hard one In Boston Jimmy Pendleton in spite of his strenuous efforts to occupy his time and thoughts was discovering that nothing quite erased from his vision a certain pair of laughing blue eyes and nothing quite obliterated from his memory a certain well loved merry voice Jimmy told himself that if it were not for missus Carew and the fact that he could be of some use to her life would not be worth the living Even at missus Carew s it was not all joy for always there was Jamie and Jamie brought thoughts of Pollyanna unhappy thoughts Being thoroughly convinced that Jamie and Pollyanna cared for each other and also being equally convinced that he himself was in honor bound to step one side and give the handicapped Jamie full right of way it never occurred to him to question further Of Pollyanna he did not like to talk or to hear He knew that both Jamie and missus Carew heard from her and when they spoke of her he forced himself to listen in spite of his heartache But he always changed the subject as soon as possible and he limited his own letters to her to the briefest and most infrequent epistles possible For to Jimmy a Pollyanna that was not his was nothing but a source of pain and wretchedness and he had been so glad when the time came for him to leave Beldingsville and take up his studies again in Boston to be so near Pollyanna and yet so far from her he had found to be nothing but torture In Boston with all the feverishness of a restless mind that seeks distraction from itself he had thrown himself into the carrying out of missus Carew s plans for her beloved working girls and such time as could be spared from his own duties he had devoted to this work much to missus Carew s delight and gratitude And so for Jimmy the winter had passed and spring had come a joyous blossoming spring full of soft breezes gentle showers and tender green buds expanding into riotous bloom and fragrance To Jimmy however it was anything but a joyous spring for in his heart was still nothing but a gloomy winter of discontent If only they d settle things and announce the engagement once for all murmured Jimmy to himself more and more frequently these days If only I could know SOMETHING for sure I think I could stand it better Then one day late in April he had his wish a part of it he learned something for sure It was ten o clock on a Saturday morning and Mary at missus Carew s had ushered him into the music room with a well trained I ll tell missus Carew you re here sir She s expecting you I think In the music room Jimmy had found himself brought to a dismayed halt by the sight of Jamie at the piano his arms outflung upon the rack and his head bowed upon them Pendleton had half turned to beat a soft retreat when the man at the piano lifted his head bringing into view two flushed cheeks and a pair of fever bright eyes Why Carew stammered Pendleton aghast has anything er happened Happened Happened ejaculated the lame youth flinging out both his hands in each of which as Pendleton now saw was an open letter Everything has happened Wouldn t you think it had if all your life you d been in prison and suddenly you saw the gates flung wide open Wouldn t you think it had if all in a minute you could ask the girl you loved to be your wife Wouldn t you think it had if But listen You think I m crazy but I m not Though maybe I am after all crazy with joy I d like to tell you May I I ve got to tell somebody Pendleton lifted his head It was as if unconsciously he was bracing himself for a blow He had grown a little white but his voice was quite steady when he answered Sure you may old fellow I d be glad to hear it Carew however had scarcely waited for assent He was rushing on still a bit incoherently It s not much to you of course You have two feet and your freedom You have your ambitions and your bridges But I to me it s everything It s a chance to live a man s life and do a man s work perhaps even if it isn t dams and bridges It s something and it s something I ve proved now I CAN DO Listen In that letter there is the announcement that a little story of mine has won the first prize three thousand dollars in a contest In that other letter there a big publishing house accepts with flattering enthusiasm my first book manuscript for publication And they both came to day this morning Do you wonder I am crazy glad No No indeed I congratulate you Carew with all my heart cried Jimmy warmly Thank you and you may congratulate me Think what it means to me Think what it means if by and by I can be independent like a man Think what it means if I can some day make missus Carew proud and glad that she gave the crippled lad a place in her home and heart Think what it means for me to be able to tell the girl I love that I DO love her Yes yes indeed old boy Jimmy spoke firmly though he had grown very white now Of course maybe I ought not to do that last even now resumed Jamie a swift cloud shadowing the shining brightness of his countenance I m still tied to these He tapped the crutches by his side I can t forget of course that day in the woods last summer when I saw Pollyanna I realize that always I ll have to run the chance of seeing the girl I love in danger and not being able to rescue her Oh but Carew began the other huskily Carew lifted a peremptory hand I know what you d say But don t say it You can t understand YOU aren t tied to two sticks You did the rescuing not I It came to me then how it would be always with me and Sadie I d have to stand aside and see others SADIE cut in Jimmy sharply Yes Sadie Dean You act surprised Didn t you know Haven t you suspected how I felt toward Sadie cried Jamie Have I kept it so well to myself then I tried to but He finished with a faint smile and a half despairing gesture Well you certainly kept it all right old fellow from me anyhow cried Jimmy gayly The color had come back to Jimmy s face in a rich flood and his eyes had grown suddenly very bright indeed So it s Sadie Dean Good I congratulate you again I do I do as Nancy says Jimmy was quite babbling with joy and excitement now so great and wonderful had been the reaction within him at the discovery that it was Sadie not Pollyanna whom Jamie loved Jamie flushed and shook his head a bit sadly No congratulations yet You see I haven t spoken to her But I think she must know I supposed everybody knew Pray whom did you think it was if not Sadie Jimmy hesitated Then a little precipitately he let it out Why I d thought of Pollyanna Jamie smiled and pursed his lips Pollyanna s a charming girl and I love her but not that way any more than she does me Besides I fancy somebody else would have something to say about that eh Jimmy colored like a happy conscious boy Do you he challenged trying to make his voice properly impersonal Of course John Pendleton JOHN PENDLETON Jimmy wheeled sharply What about John Pendleton queried a new voice and missus Carew came forward with a smile Jimmy around whose ears for the second time within five minutes the world had crashed into fragments barely collected himself enough for a low word of greeting But Jamie unabashed turned with a triumphant air of assurance Nothing only I just said that I believed John Pendleton would have something to say about Pollyanna s loving anybody but him POLLYANNA JOHN PENDLETON missus Carew sat down suddenly in the chair nearest her If the two men before her had not been so deeply absorbed in their own affairs they might have noticed that the smile had vanished from missus Carew s lips and that an odd look as of almost fear had come to her eyes Certainly maintained Jamie Were you both blind last summer Wasn t he with her a lot Why I thought he was with all of us murmured missus Carew a little faintly Not as he was with Pollyanna insisted Jamie Besides have you forgotten that day when we were talking about John Pendleton s marrying and Pollyanna blushed and stammered and said finally that he HAD thought of marrying once Well I wondered then if there wasn t SOMETHING between them Don t you remember Y yes I think I do now that you speak of it murmured missus Carew again But I had forgotten it Oh but I can explain that cut in Jimmy wetting his dry lips John Pendleton DID have a love affair once but it was with Pollyanna s mother Pollyanna s mother exclaimed two voices in surprise Yes He loved her years ago but she did not care for him at all I understand She had another lover a minister and she married him instead Pollyanna s father Oh h breathed missus Carew leaning forward suddenly in her chair And is that why he s never married Yes avouched Jimmy So you see there s really nothing to that idea at all that he cares for Pollyanna It was her mother On the contrary I think it makes a whole lot to that idea declared Jamie wagging his head wisely I think it makes my case all the stronger Listen He once loved the mother He couldn t have her What more absolutely natural than that he should love the daughter now and win her Oh Jamie you incorrigible spinner of tales reproached missus Carew with a nervous laugh This is no ten penny novel It s real life She s too young for him He ought to marry a woman not a girl that is if he marries any one I mean she stammeringly corrected a sudden flood of color in her face Perhaps but what if it happens to be a GIRL that he loves argued Jamie stubbornly And really just stop to think Have we had a single letter from her that hasn t told of his being there And you KNOW how HE S always talking of Pollyanna in his letters missus Carew got suddenly to her feet Yes I know she murmured with an odd little gesture as if throwing something distasteful aside But She did not finish her sentence and a moment later she had left the room When she came back in five minutes she found much to her surprise that Jimmy had gone Why I thought he was going with us on the girls picnic she exclaimed So did I frowned Jamie But the first thing I knew he was explaining or apologizing or something about unexpectedly having to leave town and he d come to tell you he couldn t go with us Anyhow the next thing I knew he d gone You see Jamie s eyes were glowing again I don t think I knew quite what he did say anyway I had something else to think of And he jubilantly spread before her the two letters which all the time he had still kept in his hands Oh Jamie breathed missus Carew when she had read the letters through How proud I am of you Then suddenly her eyes filled with tears at the look of ineffable joy that illumined Jamie s face CHAPTER XXIX JIMMY AND JOHN It was a very determined square jawed young man that alighted at the Beldingsville station late that Saturday night And it was an even more determined square jawed young man that before ten o clock the next morning stalked through the Sunday quiet village streets and climbed the hill to the Harrington homestead Catching sight of a loved and familiar flaxen coil of hair on a well poised little head just disappearing into the summerhouse the young man ignored the conventional front steps and doorbell crossed the lawn and strode through the garden paths until he came face to face with the owner of the flaxen coil of hair Jimmy gasped Pollyanna falling back with startled eyes Why where did you come from Boston Last night I had to see you Pollyanna To see m me Pollyanna was plainly fencing for time to regain her composure Jimmy looked so big and strong and DEAR there in the door of the summerhouse that she feared her eyes had been surprised into a telltale admiration if not more Yes Pollyanna I wanted that is I thought I mean I feared Oh hang it all Pollyanna I can t beat about the bush like this I ll have to come straight to the point It s just this I stood aside before but I won t now It isn t a case any longer of fairness He isn t crippled like Jamie He s got feet and hands and a head like mine and if he wins he ll have to win in a fair fight I VE got some rights Pollyanna stared frankly Jimmy Bean Pendleton whatever in the world are you talking about she demanded The young man laughed shamefacedly No wonder you don t know It wasn t very lucid was it But I don t think I ve been really lucid myself since yesterday when I found out from Jamie himself Found out from Jamie Yes It was the prize that started it You see he d just got one and Oh I know about that interrupted Pollyanna eagerly And wasn t it splendid Just think the first one three thousand dollars I wrote him a letter last night Why when I saw his name and realized it was Jamie OUR JAMIE I was so excited I forgot all about looking for MY name and even when I couldn t find mine at all and knew that I hadn t got any I mean I was so excited and pleased for Jamie that I I forgot er everything else corrected Pollyanna throwing a dismayed glance into Jimmy s face and feverishly trying to cover up the partial admission she had made Jimmy however was too intent on his own problem to notice hers Yes yes twas fine of course I m glad he got it But Pollyanna it was what he said AFTERWARD that I mean You see until then I d thought that that he cared that you cared for each other I mean and You thought that Jamie and I cared for each other exclaimed Pollyanna into whose face now was stealing a soft shy color Why Jimmy it s Sadie Dean Twas always Sadie Dean He used to talk of her to me by the hour I think she likes him too Good I hope she does but you see I didn t know I thought twas Jamie and you And I thought that because he was was a cripple you know that it wouldn t be fair if I if I stayed around and tried to win you myself Pollyanna stooped suddenly and picked up a leaf at her feet When she rose her face was turned quite away A fellow can t can t feel square you know running a race with a chap that that s handicapped from the start So I I just stayed away and gave him his chance though it most broke my heart to do it little girl It just did Then yesterday morning I found out But I found out something else too Jamie says there is is somebody else in the case But I can t stand aside for him Pollyanna I can t even in spite of all he s done for me John Pendleton is a man and he s got two whole feet for the race He s got to take his chances If you care for him if you really care for him But Pollyanna had turned wild eyed JOHN PENDLETON Jimmy what do you mean What are you saying about John Pendleton A great joy transfigured Jimmy s face He held out both his hands Then you don t you don t I can see it in your eyes that you don t care Pollyanna shrank back She was white and trembling Jimmy what do you mean What do you mean she begged piteously I mean you don t care for Uncle John that way Don t you understand Jamie thinks you do care and that anyway he cares for you And then I began to see it that maybe he did He s always talking about you and of course there was your mother Pollyanna gave a low moan and covered her face with her hands Jimmy came close and laid a caressing arm about her shoulders but again Pollyanna shrank from him Pollyanna little girl don t You ll break my heart he begged Don t you care for me ANY Is it that and you don t want to tell me She dropped her hands and faced him Her eyes had the hunted look of some wild thing at bay Jimmy do YOU think he cares for me that way she entreated just above a whisper Jimmy gave his head an impatient shake Never mind that Pollyanna now I don t know of course How should I But dearest that isn t the question It s you If YOU don t care for him and if you ll only give me a chance half a chance to let me make you care for me He caught her hand and tried to draw her to him No no Jimmy I mustn t I can t With both her little palms she pushed him from her Pollyanna you don t mean you DO care for him Jimmy s face whitened No no indeed not that way faltered Pollyanna But don t you see if he cares for me I ll have to to learn to someway POLLYANNA Don t Don t look at me like that Jimmy You mean you d MARRY him Pollyanna Oh no I mean why er y yes I suppose so she admitted faintly Pollyanna you wouldn t You couldn t Pollyanna you you re breaking my heart Pollyanna gave a low sob Her face was in her hands again For a moment she sobbed on chokingly then with a tragic gesture she lifted her head and looked straight into Jimmy s anguished reproachful eyes I know it I know it she chattered frenziedly I m breaking mine too But I ll have to do it I d break your heart I d break mine but I d never break his Jimmy raised his head His eyes flashed a sudden fire His whole appearance underwent a swift and marvelous change With a tender triumphant cry he swept Pollyanna into his arms and held her close Now I KNOW you care for me he breathed low in her ear You said it was breaking YOUR heart too Do you think I ll give you up now to any man on earth Ah dear you little understand a love like mine if you think I d give you up now Pollyanna say you love me say it with your own dear lips For one long minute Pollyanna lay unresisting in the fiercely tender embrace that encircled her then with a sigh that was half content half renunciation she began to draw herself away Yes Jimmy I do love you Jimmy s arms tightened and would have drawn her back to him but something in the girl s face forbade I love you dearly But I couldn t ever be happy with you and feel that Jimmy don t you see dear I ll have to know that I m free first Nonsense Pollyanna Of course you re free Jimmy s eyes were mutinous again Pollyanna shook her head Not with this hanging over me Jimmy Don t you see It was mother long ago that broke his heart MY MOTHER And all these years he s lived a lonely unloved life in consequence If now he should come to me and ask me to make that up to him I d HAVE to do it Jimmy I d HAVE to I couldn t REFUSE Don t you see But Jimmy did not see he could not see He would not see though Pollyanna pleaded and argued long and tearfully But Pollyanna too was obdurate though so sweetly and heartbrokenly obdurate that Jimmy in spite of his pain and anger felt almost like turning comforter Jimmy dear said Pollyanna at last we ll have to wait That s all I can say now I hope he doesn t care and I I don t believe he does care But I ve got to KNOW I ve got to be sure We ll just have to wait a little till we find out Jimmy till we find out And to this plan Jimmy had to submit though it was with a most rebellious heart All right little girl it ll have to be as you say of course he despaired But surely never before was a man kept waiting for his answer till the girl he loved AND WHO LOVED HIM found out if the other man wanted her I know but you see dear never before had the other man WANTED her mother sighed Pollyanna her face puckered into an anxious frown Very well I ll go back to Boston of course acceded Jimmy reluctantly But you needn t think I ve given up because I haven t Nor I sha n t give up just so long as I know you really care for me my little sweetheart he finished with a look that sent her palpitatingly into retreat just out of reach of his arms CHAPTER XXX JOHN PENDLETON TURNS THE KEY Jimmy went back to Boston that night in a state that was a most tantalizing commingling of happiness hope exasperation and rebellion Behind him he left a girl who was in a scarcely less enviable frame of mind for Pollyanna tremulously happy in the wondrous thought of Jimmy s love for her was yet so despairingly terrified at the thought of the possible love of John Pendleton that there was not a thrill of joy that did not carry its pang of fear Fortunately for all concerned however this state of affairs was not of long duration for as it chanced John Pendleton in whose unwitting hands lay the key to the situation in less than a week after Jimmy s hurried visit turned that key in the lock and opened the door of doubt It was late Thursday afternoon that John Pendleton called to see Pollyanna As it happened he like Jimmy saw Pollyanna in the garden and came straight toward her Pollyanna looking into his face felt a sudden sinking of the heart It s come it s come she shivered and involuntarily she turned as if to flee Illustration Involuntarily she turned as if to flee Oh Pollyanna wait a minute please called the man hastening his steps You re just the one I wanted to see Come can t we go in here he suggested turning toward the summerhouse I want to speak to you about something Why y yes of course stammered Pollyanna with forced gayety Pollyanna knew that she was blushing and she particularly wished not to blush just then It did not help matters any either that he should have elected to go into the summerhouse for his talk The summerhouse now to Pollyanna was sacred to certain dear memories of Jimmy And to think it should be here HERE she was shuddering frantically But aloud she said still gayly It s a lovely evening isn t it There was no answer John Pendleton strode into the summerhouse and dropped himself into a rustic chair without even waiting for Pollyanna to seat herself a most unusual proceeding on the part of John Pendleton Pollyanna stealing a nervous glance at his face found it so startlingly like the old stern sour visage of her childhood s remembrance that she uttered an involuntary exclamation Still John Pendleton paid no heed Still moodily he sat wrapped in thought At last however he lifted his head and gazed somberly into Pollyanna s startled eyes Pollyanna Yes mister Pendleton Do you remember the sort of man I was when you first knew me years ago Why y yes I think so Delightfully agreeable specimen of humanity wasn t I In spite of her perturbation Pollyanna smiled faintly I I liked you sir Not until the words were uttered did Pollyanna realize just how they would sound She strove then frantically to recall or modify them and had almost added a that is I mean I liked you THEN when she stopped just in time certainly THAT would not have helped matters any She listened then fearfully for John Pendleton s next words They came almost at once I know you did bless your little heart And it was that that was the saving of me I wonder Pollyanna if I could ever make you realize just what your childish trust and liking did for me Pollyanna stammered a confused protest but he brushed it smilingly aside Oh yes it was It was you and no one else I wonder if you remember another thing too resumed the man after a moment s silence during which Pollyanna looked furtively but longingly toward the door I wonder if you remember my telling you once that nothing but a woman s hand and heart or a child s presence could make a home Pollyanna felt the blood rush to her face Y yes n no I mean yes I remember it she stuttered but I I don t think it s always so now I mean that is I m sure your home now is is lovely just as tis and But it s my home I m talking about child interrupted the man impatiently Pollyanna you know the kind of home I once hoped to have and how those hopes were dashed to the ground Don t think dear I m blaming your mother I m not She but obeyed her heart which was right and she made the wiser choice anyway as was proved by the dreary waste I ve made of life because of that disappointment After all Pollyanna isn t it strange added John Pendleton his voice growing tender that it should be the little hand of her own daughter that led me into the path of happiness at last Pollyanna moistened her lips convulsively Oh but mister Pendleton I I Once again the man brushed aside her protests with a smiling gesture Yes it was Pollyanna your little hand in the long ago you and your glad game Oh h Pollyanna relaxed visibly in her seat The terror in her eyes began slowly to recede And so all these years I ve been gradually growing into a different man Pollyanna But there s one thing I haven t changed in my dear He paused looked away then turned gravely tender eyes back to her face I still think it takes a woman s hand and heart or a child s presence to make a home Yes b but you ve g got the child s presence plunged in Pollyanna the terror coming back to her eyes There s Jimmy you know The man gave an amused laugh I know but I don t think even you would say that Jimmy is is exactly a CHILD S presence any longer he remarked N no of course not Besides Pollyanna I ve made up my mind I ve got to have the woman s hand and heart His voice dropped and trembled a little Oh h have you Pollyanna s fingers met and clutched each other in a spasmodic clasp John Pendleton however seemed neither to hear nor see He had leaped to his feet and was nervously pacing up and down the little house Pollyanna he stopped and faced her if if you were I and were going to ask the woman you loved to come and make your old gray pile of stone a home how would you go to work to do it Pollyanna half started from her chair Her eyes sought the door this time openly longingly Oh but mister Pendleton I wouldn t do it at all at all she stammered a little wildly I m sure you d be much happier as as you are The man stared in puzzled surprise then laughed grimly Upon my word Pollyanna is it quite so bad as that he asked B bad Pollyanna had the appearance of being poised for flight Yes Is that just your way of trying to soften the blow of saying that you don t think she d have me anyway Oh n no no indeed She d say yes she d HAVE to say yes you know explained Pollyanna with terrified earnestness But I ve been thinking I mean I was thinking that if if the girl didn t love you you really would be happier without her and At the look that came into John Pendleton s face Pollyanna stopped short I shouldn t want her if she didn t love me Pollyanna No I thought not too Pollyanna began to look a little less distracted Besides she doesn t happen to be a girl went on John Pendleton She s a mature woman who presumedly would know her own mind The man s voice was grave and slightly reproachful Oh h h Oh exclaimed Pollyanna the dawning happiness in her eyes leaping forth in a flash of ineffable joy and relief Then you love somebody By an almost superhuman effort Pollyanna choked off the else before it left her delighted lips Love somebody Haven t I just been telling you I did laughed John Pendleton half vexedly What I want to know is can she be made to love me That s where I was sort of of counting on your help Pollyanna You see she s a dear friend of yours Is she gurgled Pollyanna Then she ll just have to love you We ll make her Maybe she does anyway already Who is she There was a long pause before the answer came I believe after all Pollyanna I won t yes I will too It s can t you guess missus Carew Oh breathed Pollyanna with a face of unclouded joy How perfectly lovely I m so glad GLAD GLAD A long hour later Pollyanna sent Jimmy a letter It was confused and incoherent a series of half completed illogical but shyly joyous sentences out of which Jimmy gathered much a little from what was written more from what was left unwritten After all did he really need more than this Oh Jimmy he doesn t love me a bit It s some one else I mustn t tell you who it is but her name isn t Pollyanna Jimmy had just time to catch the seven o clock train for Beldingsville and he caught it CHAPTER XXXI AFTER LONG YEARS Pollyanna was so happy that night after she had sent her letter to Jimmy that she could not quite keep it to herself Always before going to bed she stepped into her aunt s room to see if anything were needed To night after the usual questions she had turned to put out the light when a sudden impulse sent her back to her aunt s bedside A little breathlessly she dropped on her knees Aunt Polly I m so happy I just had to tell some one I WANT to tell you May I Tell me Tell me what child Of course you may tell me You mean it s good news for ME Why yes dear I hope so blushed Pollyanna I hope it will make you GLAD a little for me you know Of course Jimmy will tell you himself all properly some day But I wanted to tell you first Jimmy missus Chilton s face changed perceptibly Yes when when he he asks you for me stammered Pollyanna with a radiant flood of color Oh I I m so happy I HAD to tell you Asks me for you Pollyanna missus Chilton pulled herself up in bed You don t mean to say there s anything SERIOUS between you and Jimmy Bean Pollyanna fell back in dismay Why auntie I thought you LIKED Jimmy So I do in his place But that place isn t the husband of my niece AUNT POLLY Come come child don t look so shocked This is all sheer nonsense and I m glad I ve been able to stop it before it s gone any further But Aunt Polly it HAS gone further quavered Pollyanna Why I I already have learned to lo c care for him dearly Then you ll have to unlearn it Pollyanna for never never will I give my consent to your marrying Jimmy Bean But w why auntie First and foremost because we know nothing about him Why Aunt Polly we ve always known him ever since I was a little girl Yes and what was he A rough little runaway urchin from an Orphans Home We know nothing whatever about his people and his pedigree But I m not marrying his p people and his p pedigree With an impatient groan Aunt Polly fell back on her pillow Pollyanna you re making me positively ill My heart is going like a trip hammer I sha n t sleep a wink to night CAN T you let this thing rest till morning Pollyanna was on her feet instantly her face all contrition Why yes yes indeed of course Aunt Polly And to morrow you ll feel different I m sure I m sure you will reiterated the girl her voice quivering with hope again as she turned to extinguish the light But Aunt Polly did not feel different in the morning If anything her opposition to the marriage was even more determined In vain Pollyanna pleaded and argued In vain she showed how deeply her happiness was concerned Aunt Polly was obdurate She would have none of the idea She sternly admonished Pollyanna as to the possible evils of heredity and warned her of the dangers of marrying into she knew not what sort of family She even appealed at last to her sense of duty and gratitude toward herself and reminded Pollyanna of the long years of loving care that had been hers in the home of her aunt and she begged her piteously not to break her heart by this marriage as had her mother years before by HER marriage When Jimmy himself radiant faced and glowing eyed came at ten o clock he was met by a frightened sob shaken little Pollyanna that tried ineffectually to hold him back with two trembling hands With whitening cheeks but with defiantly tender arms that held her close he demanded an explanation Pollyanna dearest what in the world is the meaning of this Oh Jimmy Jimmy why did you come why did you come I was going to write and tell you straight away moaned Pollyanna But you did write me dear I got it yesterday afternoon just in time to catch my train No no AGAIN I mean I didn t know then that I I couldn t Couldn t Pollyanna his eyes flamed into stern wrath you don t mean to tell me there s anybody ELSE S love you think you ve got to keep me waiting for he demanded holding her at arm s length No no Jimmy Don t look at me like that I can t bear it Then what is it What is it you can t do I can t marry you Pollyanna do you love me Yes Oh y yes Then you shall marry me triumphed Jimmy his arms enfolding her again No no Jimmy you don t understand It s Aunt Polly struggled Pollyanna AUNT POLLY Yes She won t let me Ho Jimmy tossed his head with a light laugh We ll fix Aunt Polly She thinks she s going to lose you but we ll just remind her that she she s going to gain a a new nephew he finished in mock importance But Pollyanna did not smile She turned her head hopelessly from side to side No no Jimmy you don t understand She she oh how can I tell you she objects to to YOU for ME Jimmy s arms relaxed a little His eyes sobered Oh well I suppose I can t blame her for that I m no wonder of course he admitted constrainedly Still he turned loving eyes upon her I d try to make you happy dear Indeed you would I know you would protested Pollyanna tearfully Then why not give me a chance to try Pollyanna even if she doesn t quite approve at first Maybe in time after we were married we could win her over Oh but I couldn t I couldn t do that moaned Pollyanna after what she s said I couldn t without her consent You see she s done so much for me and she s so dependent on me She isn t well a bit now Jimmy And really lately she s been so so loving and she s been trying so hard to to play the game you know in spite of all her troubles And she she cried Jimmy and begged me not to break her heart as as mother did long ago And and Jimmy I I just couldn t after all she s done for me There was a moment s pause then with a vivid red mounting to her forehead Pollyanna spoke again brokenly Jimmy if you if you could only tell Aunt Polly something about about your father and your people and Jimmy s arms dropped suddenly He stepped back a little The color drained from his face Is that it he asked Yes Pollyanna came nearer and touched his arm timidly Don t think It isn t for me Jimmy I don t care Besides I KNOW that your father and your people were all all fine and noble because YOU are so fine and noble But she Jimmy don t look at me like that But Jimmy with a low moan had turned quite away from her A minute later with only a few choking words which she could not understand he had left the house From the Harrington homestead Jimmy went straight home and sought out John Pendleton He found him in the great crimson hung library where some years before Pollyanna had looked fearfully about for the skeleton in John Pendleton s closet Uncle John do you remember that packet father gave me demanded Jimmy Why yes What s the matter son John Pendleton had given a start of surprise at sight of Jimmy s face That packet has got to be opened sir But the conditions I can t help it It s got to be That s all Will you do it Why y yes my boy of course if you insist but he paused helplessly Uncle John as perhaps you have guessed I love Pollyanna I asked her to be my wife and she consented The elder man made a delighted exclamation but the other did not pause or change his sternly intent expression She says now she can t marry me missus Chilton objects She objects to ME OBJECTS to YOU John Pendleton s eyes flashed angrily Yes I found out why when when Pollyanna begged if I couldn t tell her aunt something about about my father and my people Shucks I thought Polly Chilton had more sense still it s just like her after all The Harringtons have always been inordinately proud of race and family snapped John Pendleton Well could you COULD I It was on the end of my tongue to tell Pollyanna that there couldn t have been a better father than mine was then suddenly I remembered the packet and what it said And I was afraid I didn t dare say a word till I knew what was inside that packet There s something dad didn t want me to know till I was thirty years old when I would be a man grown and could stand anything See There s a secret somewhere in our lives I ve got to know that secret and I ve got to know it now But Jimmy lad don t look so tragic It may be a good secret Perhaps it ll be something you ll LIKE to know Perhaps But if it had been would he have been apt to keep it from me till I was thirty years old No Uncle John it was something he was trying to save me from till I was old enough to stand it and not flinch Understand I m not blaming dad Whatever it was it was something he couldn t help I ll warrant But WHAT it was I ve got to know Will you get it please It s in your safe you know John Pendleton rose at once I ll get it he said Three minutes later it lay in Jimmy s hand but Jimmy held it out at once I would rather you read it sir please Then tell me But Jimmy I very well With a decisive gesture John Pendleton picked up a paper cutter opened the envelope and pulled out the contents There was a package of several papers tied together and one folded sheet alone apparently a letter This John Pendleton opened and read first And as he read Jimmy tense and breathless watched his face He saw therefore the look of amazement joy and something else he could not name that leaped into John Pendleton s countenance Uncle John what is it What is it he demanded Read it for yourself answered the man thrusting the letter into Jimmy s outstretched hand And Jimmy read this The enclosed papers are the legal proof that my boy Jimmy is really James Kent son of John Kent who married Doris Wetherby daughter of William Wetherby of Boston There is also a letter in which I explain to my boy why I have kept him from his mother s family all these years If this packet is opened by him at thirty years of age he will read this letter and I hope will forgive a father who feared to lose his boy entirely so took this drastic course to keep him to himself If it is opened by strangers because of his death I request that his mother s people in Boston be notified at once and the inclosed package of papers be given intact into their hands JOHN KENT Jimmy was pale and shaken when he looked up to meet John Pendleton s eyes Am I the lost Jamie he faltered That letter says you have documents there to prove it nodded the other missus Carew s nephew Of course But why what I can t realize it There was a moment s pause before into Jimmy s face flashed a new joy Then surely now I know who I am I can tell missus Chilton SOMETHING of my people I should say you could retorted John Pendleton dryly The Boston Wetherbys can trace straight back to the crusades and I don t know but to the year one That ought to satisfy her As for your father he came of good stock too missus Carew told me though he was rather eccentric and not pleasing to the family as you know of course Yes Poor dad And what a life he must have lived with me all those years always dreading pursuit I can understand lots of things now that used to puzzle me A woman called me Jamie once Jove how angry he was I know now why he hurried me away that night without even waiting for supper Poor dad It was right after that he was taken sick He couldn t use his hands or his feet and very soon he couldn t talk straight Something ailed his speech I remember when he died he was trying to tell me something about this packet I believe now he was telling me to open it and go to my mother s people but I thought then he was just telling me to keep it safe So that s what I promised him But it didn t comfort him any It only seemed to worry him more You see I didn t understand Poor dad Suppose we take a look at these papers suggested John Pendleton Besides there s a letter from your father to you I understand Don t you want to read it Yes of course And then the young fellow laughed shamefacedly and glanced at the clock I was wondering just how soon I could go back to Pollyanna A thoughtful frown came to John Pendleton s face He glanced at Jimmy hesitated then spoke I know you want to see Pollyanna lad and I don t blame you but it strikes me that under the circumstances you should go first to missus Carew and take these He tapped the papers before him Jimmy drew his brows together and pondered All right sir I will he agreed resignedly And if you don t mind I d like to go with you further suggested John Pendleton a little diffidently I I have a little matter of my own that I d like to see your aunt about Suppose we go down today on the three o clock Good We will sir Gorry And so I m Jamie I can t grasp it yet exclaimed the young man springing to his feet and restlessly moving about the room I wonder now he stopped and colored boyishly do you think Aunt Ruth will mind very much John Pendleton shook his head A hint of the old somberness came into his eyes Hardly my boy But I m thinking of myself How about it When you re her boy where am I coming in You Do you think ANYTHING could put you one side scoffed Jimmy fervently You needn t worry about that And SHE won t mind She has Jamie you know and He stopped short a dawning dismay in his eyes By George Uncle John I forgot Jamie This is going to be tough on Jamie Yes I d thought of that Still he s legally adopted isn t he Oh yes it isn t that It s the fact that he isn t the real Jamie himself and he with his two poor useless legs Why Uncle John it ll just about kill him I ve heard him talk I know Besides Pollyanna and missus Carew both have told me how he feels how SURE he is and how happy he is Great Scott I can t take away from him this But what CAN I do I don t know my boy I don t see as there s anything you can do but what you are doing There was a long silence Jimmy had resumed his nervous pacing up and down the room Suddenly he wheeled his face alight There IS a way and I ll do it I KNOW missus Carew will agree WE WON T TELL We won t tell anybody but missus Carew herself and and Pollyanna and her aunt I ll HAVE to tell them he added defensively You certainly will my boy As for the rest John Pendleton paused doubtfully It s nobody s business But remember you are making quite a sacrifice in several ways I want you to weigh it well Weigh it I have weighed it and there s nothing in it with Jamie on the other side of the scales sir I just couldn t do it That s all I don t blame you and I think you re right declared John Pendleton heartily Furthermore I believe missus Carew will agree with you particularly as she ll KNOW now that the real Jamie is found at last You know she s always said she d seen me somewhere chuckled Jimmy Now how soon does that train go I m ready Well I m not laughed John Pendleton Luckily for me it doesn t go for some hours yet anyhow he finished as he got to his feet and left the room CHAPTER XXXII A NEW ALADDIN Whatever were John Pendleton s preparations for departure and they were both varied and hurried they were done in the open with two exceptions The exceptions were two letters one addressed to Pollyanna and one to missus Polly Chilton These letters together with careful and minute instructions were given into the hands of Susan his housekeeper to be delivered after they should be gone But of all this Jimmy knew nothing The travelers were nearing Boston when John Pendleton said to Jimmy My boy I ve got one favor to ask or rather two The first is that we say nothing to missus Carew until to morrow afternoon the other is that you allow me to go first and be your er ambassador you yourself not appearing on the scene until perhaps say four o clock Are you willing Indeed I am replied Jimmy promptly not only willing but delighted I d been wondering how I was going to break the ice and I m glad to have somebody else do it Good Then I ll try to get YOUR AUNT on the telephone to morrow morning and make my appointment True to his promise Jimmy did not appear at the Carew mansion until four o clock the next afternoon Even then he felt suddenly so embarrassed that he walked twice by the house before he summoned sufficient courage to go up the steps and ring the bell Once in missus Carew s presence however he was soon his natural self so quickly did she set him at his ease and so tactfully did she handle the situation To be sure at the very first there were a few tears and a few incoherent exclamations Even John Pendleton had to reach a hasty hand for his handkerchief But before very long a semblance of normal tranquillity was restored and only the tender glow in missus Carew s eyes and the ecstatic happiness in Jimmy s and John Pendleton s was left to mark the occasion as something out of the ordinary And I think it s so fine of you about Jamie exclaimed missus Carew after a little Indeed Jimmy I shall still call you Jimmy for obvious reasons besides I like it better for you indeed I think you re just right if you re willing to do it And I m making some sacrifice myself too she went on tearfully for I should be so proud to introduce you to the world as my nephew And indeed Aunt Ruth I At a half stifled exclamation from John Pendleton Jimmy stopped short He saw then that Jamie and Sadie Dean stood just inside the door Jamie s face was very white AUNT RUTH he exclaimed looking from one to the other with startled eyes AUNT RUTH You don t mean All the blood receded from missus Carew s face and from Jimmy s too John Pendleton however advanced jauntily Yes Jamie why not I was going to tell you soon anyway so I ll tell you now Jimmy gasped and stepped hastily forward but John Pendleton silenced him with a look Just a little while ago missus Carew made me the happiest of men by saying yes to a certain question I asked Now as Jimmy calls me Uncle John why shouldn t he begin right away to call missus Carew Aunt Ruth Oh Oh h exclaimed Jamie in plain delight while Jimmy under John Pendleton s steady gaze just managed to save the situation by not blurting out HIS surprise and pleasure Naturally too just then blushing missus Carew became the center of every one s interest and the danger point was passed Only Jimmy heard John Pendleton say low in his ear a bit later So you see you young rascal I m not going to lose you after all We shall BOTH have you now Exclamations and congratulations were still at their height when Jamie a new light in his eyes turned without warning to Sadie Dean Sadie I m going to tell them now he declared triumphantly Then with the bright color in Sadie s face telling the tender story even before Jamie s eager lips could frame the words more congratulations and exclamations were in order and everybody was laughing and shaking hands with everybody else Jimmy however very soon began to eye them all aggrievedly longingly This is all very well for YOU he complained then You each have each other But where do I come in I can just tell you though that if only a certain young lady I know were here I should have something to tell YOU perhaps Just a minute Jimmy interposed John Pendleton Let s play I was Aladdin and let me rub the lamp missus Carew have I your permission to ring for Mary Why y yes certainly murmured that lady in a puzzled surprise that found its duplicate on the faces of the others A few moments later Mary stood in the doorway Did I hear Miss Pollyanna come in a short time ago asked John Pendleton Yes sir She is here Won t you ask her to come down please
