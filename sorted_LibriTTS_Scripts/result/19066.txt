none	none	Halsey s words reassured me It s about the Grantline Moon Expedition In spite of our secrecy the news has gotten out We want to know how Can you tell us Captain Carter s huge bulk he was about as tall as I am towered over us as we sat before Halsey s desk If you lads have told anyone said anything let slip the slightest hint about it Snap smiled with relief but he turned solemn at once I haven t Not a word Nor have I I declared The Grantline Moon Expedition We had not thought of that as a reason for this summons Johnny Grantline was a close friend of ours He had organized an exploring expedition to the Moon Uninhabited with its bleak forbidding airless waterless surface the Moon even though so close to the Earth was seldom visited No regular ship ever stopped there A few exploring parties of recent years had come to grief But there was a persistent rumor that upon the Moon mineral riches of fabulous wealth were awaiting discovery The thing had already caused some interplanetary complications The aggressive Martians would be only too glad to explore the Moon But the United States of the World which came into being in twenty sixty seven definitely warned them away The Moon was Earth territory we announced and we would protect it as such There was nevertheless a realization by our government that whatever riches might be upon the Moon should be seized at once and held by some reputable Earth Company And when John Grantline applied with his father s wealth and his own scientific record of attainment the government was glad to grant him its writ The Grantline Expedition had started six months ago The Martian government had acquiesced to our ultimatum yet brigands have been known to be financed under cover of a government disavowal And so our expedition was kept secret My words need give no offence to any Martian who comes upon them I refer to the history of our Earth only The Grantline Expedition was on the Moon now No word had come from it One could not flash helios even in code without letting all the universe know that explorers were on the Moon And why they were there anyone could easily guess And now Colonel Halsey was telling us that the news was abroad Captain Carter eyed us closely his flashing eyes under the white bushy brows would pry a secret from anyone You re sure A girl of Venus perhaps with her cursed seductive lure A chance word with you lads befuddled by alcolite We assured him that we had been careful By the heavens I know that I had been Not a whisper even to Snap of the name Grantline in six months or more Captain Carter added abruptly We re insulated here Halsey

none	none	Talk as freely as you like An eavesdropping ray will never get through to us They questioned us They were satisfied at last that though the secret had escaped we had not given it away Hearing it discussed it occurred to me to wonder why Carter was concerned I was not aware that he knew of Grantline s venture I learned now the reason why the Planetara upon each of her last voyages had managed to pass fairly close to the Moon It had been arranged with Grantline that if he wanted help or had any important message he was to flash it locally to our passing ship And this Snap knew and had never mentioned it even to me Halsey was saying Well apparently we can t blame you but the secret is out Snap and I regarded each other What could anyone do What would anyone dare do Captain Carter said abruptly Look here lads this is my chance now to talk plainly to you Outside anywhere outside these walls an eavesdropping ray may be upon us You know that One may never even dare to whisper since that accursed ray was developed Snap opened his mouth to speak but decided against it My heart was pounding Captain Carter went on I know I can trust you two more than anyone under me on the Planetara What do you mean by that I demanded What He interrupted me Just what I said Halsey smiled grimly What he means Haljan is that things are not always what they seem these days One cannot always tell a friend from an enemy The Planetara is a public vessel You have how many is it Carter thirty or forty passengers this trip tonight Thirty eight said Carter There are thirty eight people listed for the flight to Ferrok Shahn tonight Halsey said slowly And some may not be what they seem He raised his thin dark hand We have information He paused I confess we know almost nothing hardly more than enough to alarm us Captain Carter interjected I want you and Dean to be on your guard Once on the Planetara it is difficult for us to talk openly but be watchful I will arrange for us to be doubly armed Vague perturbing words Halsey said They tell me George Prince is listed for the voyage I am suggesting Haljan that you keep your eye especially on him Your duties on the Planetara leave you comparatively free don t they Yes I agreed With the first and second officers on duty and the Captain aboard my routine was more or less that of an understudy I said George Prince Who is he A mechanical engineer said Halsey An underofficial of the Earth Federated Catalyst Corporation But he associates with bad companions particularly Martians I had never heard of this George Prince though I was familiar with the Federated Catalyst Corporation of course A semigovernment trust which controlled virtually the entire Earth supply of radiactum the catalyst mineral which was revolutionizing industry He was in the Automotive Department Carter put in You ve heard of the Federated Radiactum Motor We had of course It was a recent Earth discovery and invention An engine of a new type using radiactum as its fuel Snap demanded What in the stars has this got to do with Johnny Grantline Much said Halsey quietly or perhaps nothing But George Prince some years ago mixed in rather unethical transactions We had him in custody once He is known as unusually friendly with several Martians in Greater New York of bad reputation Well What you don t know Halsey said is that Grantline expects to find radiactum on the Moon We gasped Exactly said Halsey The ill fated Ballon Expedition thought they had found it on the Moon shortly after its merit was discovered A new type of ore a lode of it is there somewhere without doubt He added vehemently Do you understand now why we should be suspicious of this George Prince He has a criminal record He has a thorough technical knowledge of radium ores He associates with Martians of bad reputation A large Martian company has recently developed a radiactum engine to compete with our Earth motor There is very little radiactum available on Mars and our government will not allow our own supply to be exported What do you suppose that company on Mars would pay for a few tons of richly radioactive radiactum such as Grantline may have found on the Moon But I objected That is a reputable Martian company It s backed by the government of the Martian Union The government of Mars would not dare Of course not Captain Carter exclaimed sardonically Not openly But if Martian Brigands had a supply of radiactum I don t imagine where it came from would make much difference The Martian company would buy it and you know that as well as I do Halsey added And George Prince my agents inform me seems to know that Grantline is on the Moon Put it all together lads Little sparks show the hidden current More than that George Prince knows that we have arranged to have the Planetara stop at the Moon and bring back Grantline s ore This is your last voyage this year You ll hear from Grantline this time we re convinced He ll probably give you the signal as you pass the Moon on your way out Coming back you ll stop at the Moon and transport whatever radiactum ore Grantline has ready The Grantline Flyer is too small for ore transportation Halsey s voice turned grimly sarcastic Doesn t it seem queer that George Prince and a few of his Martian friends happen to be listed as passengers for this voyage In the silence that followed Snap and I regarded each other Halsey added abruptly We had George Prince typed that time we arrested him four years ago I ll show him to you He snapped open an alcove and said to his waiting attendant Flash on the type of George Prince Almost at once the image glowed on the grids before us He stood smiling sourly before us as he repeated the official formula My name is George Prince I was born in Greater New York twenty five years ago I gazed at this televised image of George Prince He stood somber in the black detention uniform silhouetted sharply against the regulation backdrop of vivid scarlet A dark almost femininely handsome fellow well below medium height the rod checking him showed five foot four inches Slim and slight Long wavy black hair falling about his ears A pale clean cut really handsome face almost beardless I regarded it closely A face that would have been beautiful without its masculine touch of heavy black brows and firmly set jaw His voice as he spoke was low and soft but at the end with the concluding words I am innocent it flashed into strong masculinity His eyes shaded with long girlish black lashes by chance met mine I am innocent His curving sensuous lips drew down into a grim sneer Halsey snapped a button He turned back to Snap and me as his attendant drew the curtain hiding the black grid Well there he is We have nothing tangible against him now But I ll say this he s a clever fellow one to be afraid of I would not blare it from the newscasters stadium but if he is hatching any plot he has been too clever for my agents We talked for another half hour and then Captain Carter dismissed us We left Halsey s office with Carter s final words ringing in our ears Whatever comes lads remember I trust you Snap and I decided to walk part of the way back to the ship It was barely more than a mile through this subterranean corridor to where we could get the vertical lift direct to the landing stage We started off on the lower level Once outside the insulation of Halsey s office we did not dare talk of this thing Not only electrical ears but every possible eavesdropping device might be upon us The corridor was two hundred feet or more below the ground level At this hour of the night the business section was comparatively deserted The stores and office arcades were all closed Our footfall echoed on the metal grids as we hurried along I felt depressed and oppressed As though prying eyes were upon me We walked for a time in silence each of us busy with memory of what had transpired at Halsey s office Suddenly Snap gripped me What s that Where I whispered We stopped at a corner An entryway was here Snap pulled me into it I could feel him quivering with

none	none	What is it I demanded in a whisper We re being followed Did you hear anything No Yet I thought now that I could hear something Vague footfalls A rustling And a microscopic whine as though some device were within range of us Snap was fumbling in his pocket

none	none	I ve got a pair of low scale detectors He put the little grids against his ears I could hear the sharp intake of his breath Then he seized me pulled me down to the metal floor of the entryway Back Gregg Get back I could barely hear his whisper We crouched as far back into the doorway as we could get I was armed My official permit for the carrying of the pencil heat ray allowed me always to have it with me I drew it now But there was nothing to shoot at I felt Snap clamping the grids on my ears And now I heard something An intensification of the vague footsteps I had thought I heard before There was something following us Something out in the corridor there now The corridor was dim but plainly visible and as far as I could see it was empty But there was something there Something invisible I could hear it moving Creeping toward us I pulled the grids off my ears Snap murmured You ve got a local phone Yes I ll get them to give us the street glare I pressed the danger signal giving our location to the operator In a second we got the light The street in all this neighborhood burst into a brilliant actinic glare The thing menacing us was revealed A figure in a black cloak crouching thirty feet away across the corridor Snap was unarmed but he flung his hands out menacingly The figure which may perhaps not have been aware of our city safeguard was taken wholly by surprise A human figure seven feet tall at the least and therefore I judged a Martian man The black cloak covered his head He took a step toward us hesitated and then turned in confusion Snap s shrill voice was bringing help The whine of a street guard s alarm whistle nearby sounded The figure was making off My pencil ray was in my hand and I pressed its switch The tiny heat ray stabbed through the air but I missed The figure stumbled but did not fall I saw a bare gray arm come from the cloak flung up to maintain its balance Or perhaps my pencil ray had seared his arm The gray skinned arm of a Martian Snap was shouting Give him another But the figure passed beyond the actinic glare and vanished We were detained in the turmoil of the corridor for ten minutes or more with official explanations Then a message from Halsey released us The Martian who had been following us in his invisible cloak was never caught We escaped from the crowd at last and made our way back to the Planetara where the passengers were already assembling for the outward Martian voyage II I stood on the turret balcony of the Planetara with Captain Carter and doctor Frank the ship surgeon watching the arriving passengers It was close to the zero hour the level of the stage was a turmoil of confusion The escalators with the last of the freight aboard were folded back But the stage was jammed with incoming passenger luggage the interplanetary customs and tax officials with their x ray and zed ray paraphernalia and the passengers themselves lined up for the export inspection At this height the city lights lay spread in a glare of blue and yellow beneath us The individual local planes came dropping like birds to our stage Thirty eight passengers to Mars for this voyage but that accursed desire of every friend and relative to speed the departing voyager brought a hundred or more extra people to crowd our girders and add to everybody s troubles Carter was too absorbed in his duties to stay with us long But here in the turret doctor Frank and I found ourselves at the moment with nothing much to do but watch doctor Frank was a thin dark rather smallish man of fifty trim in his blue and white uniform I knew him well we had made several flights together An American I fancy of Jewish ancestry A likable man and a skillful doctor and surgeon He and I had always been good friends Crowded he said Johnson says thirty eight I hope they re experienced travelers This pressure sickness is a rotten nuisance keeps me dashing around all night assuring frightened women they re not going to die Last voyage coming out of the Venus atmosphere He plunged into a lugubrious account of his troubles with space sick voyagers But I was in no mood to

none	none	to him My gaze was down on the spider incline up which over the bend of the ship s sleek silvery body the passengers and their friends were coming in little groups The upper deck was already jammed with them The Planetara as flyers go was not a large vessel Cylindrical of body forty feet maximum beam and two hundred and seventy five feet in length The passenger superstructure no more than a hundred feet long was set amidships A narrow deck metallically enclosed and with large bull s eye windows encircled the superstructure Some of the cabins opened directly onto the deck Others had doors to the interior corridors There were half a dozen small but luxurious public rooms The rest of the vessel was given to freight storage and the mechanism and control compartments Forward of the passenger structure the deck level continued under the cylindrical dome roof to the bow The forward watch tower observatory was here officers cabins Captain Carter s navigating rooms and doctor Frank s office Similarly under the stern dome was the stern watch tower and a series of power compartments Above the superstructure a confusion of spider bridges ladders and balconies were laced like a metal network The turret in which doctor Frank and I now stood was perched here Fifty feet away like a bird s nest Snap s instrument room stood clinging to the metal bridge The dome roof with the glassite windows rolled back now rose in a mound peak to cover the highest middle portion of the vessel Below in the main hull blue lit metal corridors ran the entire length of the ship Freight storage compartments gravity control rooms the air renewal system heater and ventilators and pressure mechanisms all were located there And the kitchens stewards compartments and the living quarters of the crew We carried a crew of sixteen this voyage exclusive of the navigating officers the purser Snap Dean and doctor Frank The passengers coming aboard seemed a fair representation of what we usually had for the outward voyage to Ferrok Shahn Most were Earth people and returning Martians doctor Frank pointed out one A huge Martian in a grey cloak A seven foot fellow His name is Set

none	none	doctor Frank remarked Ever heard of him No I said Should I Well The doctor suddenly checked himself as though he were sorry he had spoken I never heard of him I repeated slowly An awkward silence fell between us There were a few Venus passengers I saw one of them presently coming up the incline and recognized her A girl traveling alone We had brought her from Grebhar last voyage but one I remembered her An alluring sort of girl as most of them are Her name was Venza She spoke English well A singer and dancer who had been imported to Greater New York to fill some theatrical engagement She d made quite a hit on the Great White Way She came up the incline with the carrier ahead of her Gazing up she saw doctor Frank and me at the turret window smiled and waved her white arm in greeting doctor Frank laughed By the gods of the airways there s Alta Venza You saw that look Gregg That was for me not you Reasonable enough I retorted But I doubt it the Venza is nothing if not impartial I wondered what could be taking Venza now to Mars I was glad to see her She was diverting Educated Well traveled Spoke English with a colloquial theatrical manner more characteristic of Greater New York than of Venus And for all her light banter I would rather put my trust in her than any Venus girl I had ever met The hum of the departing siren was sounding Friends and relatives of the passengers were crowding the exit incline The deck was clearing I had not seen George Prince come aboard And then I thought I saw him down on the landing stage just arrived from a private tube car A small slight figure The customs men were around him I could only see his head and shoulders Pale girlishly handsome face long black hair to the base of his neck He was bare headed with the hood of his traveling cloak pushed back I stared and I saw that doctor Frank was also gazing down But neither of us spoke Then I said upon impulse Suppose we go down to the deck Doctor He acquiesced We descended to the lower room of the turret and clambered down the spider ladder to the upper deck level The head of the arriving incline was near us Preceded by two carriers who were littered with hand luggage George Prince was coming up the incline He was closer now I recognized him from the type we had seen in Halsey s office And then with a shock I saw it was not so This was a girl coming aboard An arc light over the incline showed her clearly when she was half way up A girl with her hood pushed back her face framed in thick black hair I saw now it was not a man s cut of hair but long braids coiled up under the dangling hood doctor Frank must have remarked my amazed expression Little beauty isn t she Who is she We were standing back against the wall of the superstructure A passenger was near us the Martian whom doctor Frank had called Miko He was loitering here quite evidently watching this girl come aboard But as I glanced at him he looked away and casually sauntered off The girl came up and reached the deck I am in Atwenty two she told the carrier My brother came aboard a couple of hours ago doctor Frank answered my whisper That s Anita Prince She was passing quite close to us on the deck following the carrier when she stumbled and very nearly fell I was nearest to her I leaped forward and caught her as she nearly went down With my arm about her I raised her up and set her upon her feet again She had twisted her ankle She balanced herself upon it The pain of it eased up in a moment I m all right thank you In the dimness of the blue lit deck I met her eyes I was holding her with my encircling arm She was small and soft against me Her face framed in the thick black hair smiled up at me Small oval face beautiful yet firm of chin and stamped with the mark of its own individuality No empty headed beauty this I m all right thank you very much I became conscious that I had not released her I felt her hands pushing at me And then it seemed that for an instant she yielded and was clinging And I met her startled upflung gaze Eyes like a purple night with the sheen of misty starlight in them I heard myself murmuring I beg your pardon Yes of course I released her She thanked me again and followed the carriers along the deck She was limping slightly An instant she had clung to me A brief flash of something from her eyes to mine from mine back to hers The poets write that love can be born of such a glance The first meeting across all the barriers of which love springs unsought unbidden defiant sometimes And the troubadours of old would sing A fleeting glance a touch two wildly beating hearts and love was born I think with Anita and me it must have been like that I stood gazing after her unconscious of doctor Frank who was watching me with his quizzical smile And presently no more than a quarter beyond the zero hour the Planetara got away With the dome windows battened tightly we lifted from the landing stage and soared over the glowing city The phosphorescence of the electronic tubes was like a comet s tail behind us as we slid upward III At six A M Earth Eastern time which we were still carrying Snap Dean and I were alone in his instrument room perched in the network over the Planetara s deck The bulge of the dome enclosed us it rounded like a great observatory window some twenty feet above the ceiling of this little metal cubbyhole The Planetara was still in Earth s shadow The firmament black interstellar space with its blazing white red and yellow stars lay spread around us The Moon with nearly all its disc illumined hung a great silver ball over our bow quarter Behind it to one side Mars floated like the red tip of a smoldering cigar in the blackness The Earth behind our stern was dimly redly visible a giant sphere etched with the configurations of its oceans and continents Upon one limb a touch of sunlight hung on the mountain tops with a crescent red yellow sheen And then we plunged from the cone shadow The Sun with the leaping corona burst through the blackness behind us The Earth lighted into a huge thin crescent with hooked cusps To Snap and me the glories of the heavens were too familiar to be remarked And upon this voyage particularly we were in no mood to consider them I had been in the radio room several hours When the Planetara started and my few routine duties were over I could think of nothing save Halsey s and Carter s admonition Be on your guard And particularly watch George Prince I had not seen George Prince But I had seen his sister whom Carter and Halsey had not bothered to mention My heart was still pounding with the memory doctor Frank evidently was having little trouble with pressure sick passengers The Planetara s equalizers were fairly efficient Prowling through the silent metal lounges and passages I went to the door of Atwenty two It was on the deck level in a tiny transverse passage just off the main lounging room Its name grid glowed with the letters Anita Prince I stood in my short white trousers and white silk shirt like a cabin steward staring Anita Prince I had never heard the name until this night But there was magic music in it now as I murmured it She was here doubtless asleep behind this small metal door It seemed as though that little oval grid were the gateway to a fairyland of my dreams I turned away Thought of the Grantline Moon Expedition stabbed at me George Prince Anita s brother he whom I had been warned to watch This renegade associate of dubious Martians plotting God knows what I saw upon the adjoining door Atwenty George Prince I listened In the humming stillness of the ship s interior there was no sound from these cabins Atwenty was without windows I knew But Anita s room had a window and a door which gave upon the deck I went through the lounge out its arch and walked the deck length The deck door and window of Atwenty two were closed and dark The deck was dim with white starlight from the side ports Chairs were here but they were all empty From the bow windows of the arching dome a flood of moonlight threw long slanting shadows down the deck At the corner where the superstructure ended I thought I saw a figure lurking as though watching me I went that way but it vanished I turned the corner went the width of the ship to the other side There was no one in sight save the observer on his spider bridge high in the bow network and the second officer on duty on the turret balcony almost directly over me As I stood and listened I suddenly heard footsteps From the direction of the bow a figure came Purser Johnson He greeted me Cooling off Gregg Yes I said He passed me and went into the smoking room door nearby I stood a moment at one of the deck windows gazing at the stars and for no reason at all I realized I was tense Johnson was a great one for his regular sleep it was wholly unlike him to be roaming about the ship at such an hour Had he been watching me I told myself it was nonsense I was suspicious of everyone everything this voyage I heard another step Captain Carter appeared from his chart room which stood in the center of the narrowing open deck space near the bow I joined him at once Who was that he half whispered Johnson Oh yes He fumbled in his uniform his gaze swept the moonlit deck Gregg take this He handed me a small metal box I stuffed it at once into my shirt An insulator he added swiftly Snap is in his office Take it to him Gregg Stay with him you ll have a measure of security and you can help him to make the photographs He was barely whispering I won t be with you no use making it look as though we were doing anything unusual If your graphs show anything or if Snap picks up any message bring it to me He added aloud Well it will be cool enough presently Gregg He sauntered away toward his chart room By heavens what a relief Snap murmured as the current went on We had wired his cubby with the insulator within its barrage we could at least talk with a degree of freedom You ve seen George Prince Gregg No He s assigned Atwenty But I saw his sister Snap no one ever mentioned Snap had heard of her but he hadn t known that she was listed for this voyage A real beauty so I ve heard Accursed shame for a decent girl to have a brother like that I could agree with him there It was now six A M Snap had been busy all night with routine cosmos radios from the Earth following our departure He had a pile of them beside him Nothing queer looking I suggested No Not a thing We were at this time no more than sixty five thousand miles from the Moon s surface The Planetara presently would swing upon her direct course for Mars There was nothing which could cause passenger comment in this close passing of the Moon normally we used the satellite s attraction to give us additional starting speed It was now or never that a message would come from Grantline He was supposed to be upon the Earthward side of the Moon While Snap had rushed through with his routine I searched the Moon s surface with our glass But there was nothing Copernicus and Kepler lay in full sunlight The heights of the lunar mountains the depths of the barren empty seas were etched black and white clear and clean Grim forbidding desolation this unchanging Moon In romance moonlight may shimmer and sparkle to light a lover s smile but the reality of the Moon is cold and bleak There was nothing to show my prying eyes where the intrepid Grantline might be Nothing at all Snap And Snap s instruments attuned for an hour now to pick up the faintest signal were motionless If he has concentrated any appreciable amount of ore said Snap We should get an impulse from its rays But our receiving shield was dark untouched Our mirror grid gave the magnified images the spectro with its wave length selection pictured the mountain levels and slowly descended into the deepest seas There was nothing Yet in those Moon caverns a million million recesses amid the crags of that tumbled barren surface the pin point of movement which might have been Grantline s expedition could so easily be hiding Could he have the ore insulated fearing its rays would betray its presence to hostile watchers Or might disaster have come to him He might not be on this hemisphere of the Moon at all My imagination sharpened by fancy of a lurking menace which seemed everywhere about the Planetara this voyage ran rife with fears for Johnny Grantline He had promised to communicate this voyage It was now or perhaps never Six thirty came and passed We were well beyond the Earth s shadow now The firmament blazed with its vivid glories the Sun behind us was a ball of yellow red leaping flames The Earth hung a huge dull red half sphere We were within forty thousand miles of the Moon A giant white ball all of its disc visible to the naked eye It poised over the bow and presently as the Planetara swung upon its course for Mars it shifted sidewise The light of it glared white and dazzling in our windows Snap with his habitual red celluloid eyeshade shoved high on his forehead worked over our instruments Gregg The receiving shield was glowing a trifle Rays were bombarding it It glowed gleamed phosphorescent and the audible recorder began sounding its tiny tinkling murmurs Gamma rays Snap sprang to the dials The direction and strength were soon obvious A richly radioactive ore body was concentrated upon this hemisphere of the Moon It was unmistakable He s got it Gregg He s The tiny grids began quivering Snap exclaimed triumphantly Here he comes By God the message at last Snap decoded it Success Stop for ore on your return voyage Will give you our location later Success beyond wildest hopes Snap murmured That s all He s got the ore We were sitting in darkness and abruptly I became aware that across our open window where the insulation barrage was flung the air was faintly hissing An interference there I saw a tiny swirl of purple sparks Someone some hostile ray from the deck beneath us or from the spider bridge that led to our little room someone out there was trying to pry in Snap impulsively reached for the absorbers to let in the outside light But I checked him Wait I cut off our barrage opened our door and stepped to the narrow metal bridge You stay there Snap I whispered Then I added aloud Well Snap I m going to bed Glad you ve cleaned up that batch of work I banged the door upon him The lacework of metal bridges seemed empty I gazed up to the dome and forward and aft Twenty feet beneath me was the metal roof of the cabin superstructure Below it both sides of the deck showed All patched with moonlight No one visible down there I descended a ladder The deck was empty But in the silence something was moving Footsteps moving away from me down the deck I followed and suddenly I was running Chasing something I could hear but could not see It turned into the smoking room I burst in And a real sound smothered the phantom Johnson the purser was sitting here alone in the dimness He was smoking I noticed that his cigar held a long frail ash It could not have been him I was chasing He was sitting there quite calmly A thick necked heavy fellow easily out of breath But he was breathing calmly now He sat up in amazement at my wild eyed appearance and the ash jarred from his cigar Gregg What in the devil I tried to grin I m on my way to bed worked all night helping Snap I went past him out the door into the main corridor It was the only way the invisible prowler could have gone But I was too late now I could hear nothing I dashed forward into the main lounge It was empty dim and silent a silence broken presently by a faint click a stateroom door hastily closing I swung and found myself in a tiny transverse passage The twin doors of Atwenty and Atwenty two were before me The invisible eavesdropper had gone into one of these rooms I listened at each of the panels but there was only silence within The interior of the ship was suddenly singing with the steward s siren the call to awaken the passengers

none	none	You seem to feel it was George Prince I told him I was convinced the prowler went into Atwenty When I mentioned the purser who seemed to have been watching me earlier in the night and again was sitting in the smoking room when the eavesdropper fled past Carter looked startled
2436_2476_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Johnson is all right Gregg 
2436_2476_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 Does he know anything about this Grantline affair 
none	none	No no said Carter hastily You haven t mentioned it have you Of course I haven t But why didn t Johnson hear that eavesdropper And what was he doing there anyway at that hour of the morning 
2436_2476_000013_000000	train-clean-100	The Captain ignored my questions 
none	none	I m going to have that Prince suite searched we can t be too careful 
2436_2476_000013_000002	train-clean-100	Go to bed Gregg you need rest 
2436_2476_000014_000000	train-clean-100	I went to my cabin 
2436_2476_000014_000001	train-clean-100	It was located aft on the stern deck near the stern watch tower 
none	none	A small metal room with a chair a desk and a bunk I made sure no one was in it I sealed the lattice grill and the door set the alarm trigger against any opening of them and went to bed The siren for the midday meal awakened me 
2436_2476_000015_000001	train-clean-100	I had slept heavily 
none	none	I felt refreshed I found the passengers already assembled at my table when I arrived in the dining salon It was a low vaulted metal room with blue and yellow tube lights At its sides the oval windows showed the deck with its ports on the dome side through which a vista of the starry firmament was visible 
2436_2476_000016_000003	train-clean-100	We were well on our course to Mars 
2436_2476_000016_000004	train-clean-100	The Moon had dwindled to a pin point of light beside the crescent Earth 
none	none	And behind them our Sun blazed visually the largest orb in the heavens It was some sixty eight million miles from the Earth to Mars A flight ordinarily of some ten days There were five tables in the dining salon each with eight seats Snap and I had one of the tables 
2436_2476_000017_000001	train-clean-100	We sat at the ends with the passengers on each of the sides 
none	none	Snap was in his seat when I arrived He eyed me down the length of the table In a gay mood he introduced me to the three men already seated This is our third officer Gregg Haljan 
2436_2476_000019_000001	train-clean-100	Big handsome fellow isn t he 
2436_2476_000019_000002	train-clean-100	And as pleasant as he is good looking 
none	none	Gregg this is Sero Ob Hahn I met the keen somber gaze of a Venus man of middle age A small slim graceful man with sleek black hair 
2436_2476_000020_000002	train-clean-100	His pointed face accentuated by the pointed beard was pallid 
none	none	He wore a white and purple robe upon his breast was a huge platinum ornament a device like a star and cross entwined
2436_2476_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 I am happy to meet you sir His voice was soft and deep 
none	none	Ob Hahn I repeated I should have heard of you no doubt but 
2436_2476_000023_000000	train-clean-100	A smile plucked at his thin gray lips 
none	none	That is an error of mine not yours My mission is that all the universe shall hear of me He s preaching the religion of the Venus mystics Snap explained And this enlightened gentleman said Ob Hahn ironically nodding to the man has just termed it fetishism 
2436_2476_000025_000001	train-clean-100	The ignorance 
none	none	Oh I say protested the man at Ob Hahn s side I mean you seem to think I meant something offensive 
2436_2476_000026_000002	train-clean-100	And as a matter of fact 
none	none	We ve an argument Gregg laughed Snap
2436_2476_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 This is Sir Arthur Coniston an English gentleman lecturer and sky trotter that is he will be a sky trotter he tells us he plans a number of voyages 
none	none	The tall Englishman in his white linen suit bowed acknowledgement My compliments
2436_2476_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 mister 
none	none	Haljan I hope you have no strong religious convictions else we will make your table here very miserable The third passenger had evidently kept out of the argument 
2436_2476_000029_000001	train-clean-100	Snap introduced him as Rance Rankin 
2436_2476_000029_000002	train-clean-100	An American a quiet blond fellow of thirty five or forty 
2436_2476_000030_000000	train-clean-100	I ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on 
none	none	Won t make me miserable said Snap
2436_2476_000031_000001	train-clean-100	 I love an argument 
none	none	You said Sir Arthur
2436_2476_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 I mean to say I think I said too much 
2436_2476_000032_000001	train-clean-100	mister Rankin you are more diplomatic 
2436_2476_000033_000000	train-clean-100	Rankin laughed 
none	none	I am a magician he said to me
2436_2476_000033_000002	train-clean-100	 A theatrical entertainer 
none	none	I deal in tricks how to fool an audience His keen amused gaze was on Ob Hahn This gentleman from Venus and I have too much in common to argue
2436_2476_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 A nasty one the Englishman exclaimed 
2436_2476_000034_000001	train-clean-100	 By Jove 
none	none	Really mister Rankin you re a bit too cruel I could see we were doomed to have turbulent meals this voyage I like to eat in quiet arguing passengers always annoy me 
2436_2476_000035_000002	train-clean-100	There were still three seats vacant at our table I wondered who would occupy them 
2436_2476_000035_000003	train-clean-100	I soon learned the answer for one seat at least 
2436_2476_000035_000004	train-clean-100	Rankin said calmly 
none	none	Where is the little Venus girl this meal His glance went to the empty seat at my right hand
2436_2476_000036_000001	train-clean-100	 The Venza isn t that her name 
none	none	She and I are destined for the same theater in Ferrok Shahn So Venza was to sit beside me 
2436_2476_000037_000001	train-clean-100	It was good news 
none	none	Ten days of a religious argument three times a day would be intolerable But the cheerful Venza would help She never eats the midday meal said Snap
2436_2476_000038_000001	train-clean-100	 She s on the deck having orange juice 
none	none	I guess it s the old gag about diet eh My attention wandered about the salon Most of the seats were occupied 
2436_2476_000039_000002	train-clean-100	At the Captain s table I saw the objects of my search George Prince and his sister one on each side of the Captain 
none	none	I saw George Prince in the life now as a man who looked hardly twenty five He was at this moment evidently in a gay mood His clean cut handsome profile with its poetic dark curls was turned toward me There seemed little of the villain about him And I saw Anita Prince now as a dark haired black eyed little beauty in feature resembling her brother very strongly She presently finished her meal She rose with him after her 
2436_2476_000040_000003	train-clean-100	She was dressed in Earth fashion white blouse and dark jacket wide knee length trousers of gray with a red sash her only touch of color 
2436_2476_000040_000004	train-clean-100	She went past me flashed me a smile 
none	none	My heart was pounding 
2436_2476_000041_000001	train-clean-100	I answered her greeting and met George Prince s casual gaze 
none	none	He too smiled as though to signify that his sister had told him of the service I had done her Or was his smile an ironical memory of how he had eluded me this morning when I chased him I gazed after his small white suited figure as he followed Anita from the salon And thinking of her I prayed that Carter and Halsey might be wrong Whatever plotting against the Grantline Expedition might be going on I hoped that George Prince was innocent of it Yet I knew in my heart it was a futile hope Prince had been the eavesdropper outside the radio room I could not doubt it But that his sister must be ignorant of what he was doing I was sure My attention was brought suddenly back to the reality of our table I heard Ob Hahn s silky voice We passed quite close to the Moon last night mister Dean Yes said Snap
2436_2476_000044_000001	train-clean-100	 We did didn t we 
none	none	Always do it s a technical problem of the exigencies of interstellar navigation 
2436_2476_000044_000003	train-clean-100	Explain it to them Gregg 
none	none	You re an expert I waved it away with a laugh There was a brief silence I could not help noticing Sir Arthur Coniston s queer look and I have never seen so keen a glance as Rance Rankin shot at me Were all three people aware of Grantline s treasure on the Moon It suddenly seemed so I wished fervently at that instant that the ten days of this voyage were over Captain Carter was right Coming back we should have a cordon of Interplanetary Police aboard Sir Arthur broke the awkward silence Magnificent sight the Moon from so close though I was too much afraid of pressure sickness to be up to see it I had nearly finished my hasty meal when another incident shocked me The two other passengers at our table came in and took their seats A Martian girl and man The girl had the seat at my left with the man beside her All Martians are tall The girl was about my own height That is six feet two inches The man was seven feet or more Both wore the Martian outer robe The girl flung hers back Her limbs were encased in pseudomail She looked as all Martians like to look a very warlike Amazon But she was a pretty girl She smiled at me with a keen eyed direct gaze mister Dean said at breakfast that you were big and handsome You are 
2436_2476_000049_000000	train-clean-100	They were brother and sister these Martians 
none	none	Snap introduced them as Set Miko and Setta Moa the Martian equivalent of mister and Miss This Miko was from our Earth standards a tremendous brawny giant Not spindly like most Martians this fellow for all his seven feet in height was almost heavy set He wore a plaited leather jerkin beneath his robe and knee pants of leather out of which his lower legs showed as gray hairy pillars of strength He had come into the salon with a swagger his sword ornament clanking A pleasant voyage so far he said to me as he started his meal His voice had the heavy throaty rasp characteristic of the Martian He spoke perfect English both Martians and Venus people are by heritage extraordinary linguists Miko and his sister Moa had a touch of Martian accent worn almost away by living for some years in Greater New York The shock to me came within a few minutes Miko absorbed in attacking his meal inadvertently pushed back his robe to bare his forearm An instant only then it dropped to his wrist But in that instant I had seen upon the gray flesh a thin sear turned red A very recent burn as though a pencil ray of heat had caught his arm My mind flung back Only last night in the city corridor Snap and I had been followed by a Martian I had shot at him with a heat ray I thought I had hit him on the arm Was this the mysterious Martian who had followed us from Halsey s office V Shortly after that midday meal I encountered Venza sitting on the starlit deck I had been in the bow observatory taken my routine castings of our position and worked them out I was I think of the Planetara s officers the most expert handler of the mathematical calculators The locating of our position and charting the trajectory of our course was under ordinary circumstances about all I had to do And it took only a few minutes every twelve hours I had a moment with Carter in the isolation of his chart room This voyage 
2436_2477_000003_000001	train-clean-100	Gregg I m getting like you too fanciful 
none	none	We ve a normal group of passengers apparently but I don t like the look of any of them That Ob Hahn at your table Snaky looking fellow I commented He and the Englishman are great on arguments Did you have Princes cabin searched My breath hung on his answer Yes Nothing unusual among his things We searched both his room and his sister s I did not follow that up Instead I told him about the burn on Miko s thick arm He stared I wish we were at Ferrok Shahn Gregg tonight when the passengers are asleep come here to me Snap will be here and doctor Frank We can trust him He knows about about the Grantline treasure Yes And so do Balch and Blackstone Balch and Blackstone were our first and second officers We ll all meet here Gregg say about the zero hour We must take some precautions Then he dismissed me I found Venza seated alone in a starlit corner of the secluded deck A porthole with the black heavens and the blazing stars was before her There was an empty seat nearby She greeted me with the Venus form of jocular intimate greeting Hola lo Gregg Sit here with me I have been wondering when you would come after me I sat down beside her Why are you going to Mars Venza I m glad to see you Many thanks But I am glad to see you Gregg So handsome a man 
2436_2477_000017_000003	train-clean-100	Do you know from Venus to Earth and I have no doubt on all of Mars no man will please me more 
none	none	Glib tongue I laughed Born to flatter the male every girl of your world And I added seriously You don t answer my question What takes you to Mars
2436_2477_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Contract 
2436_2477_000019_000001	train-clean-100	By the stars what else 
2436_2477_000019_000002	train-clean-100	Of course a chance to make a voyage with you 
none	none	Don t be silly Venza I enjoyed her I gazed at her small slim figure reclining in the deck chair Her long gray robe parted by design I have no doubt to display her shapely satin sheathed legs Her black hair was coiled in a heavy knot at the back of her neck her carmine lips were parted with a mocking alluring smile The exotic perfume of her enveloped me She glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes Be serious I added I am serious 
2436_2477_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Sober 
none	none	Intoxicated by you but sober I said What sort of a contract A theater in Ferrok Shahn 
2436_2477_000026_000001	train-clean-100	Good money Gregg 
none	none	I ll be there a year She sat up to face me There s a fellow here on the Planetara Rance Rankin he calls himself 
2436_2477_000026_000004	train-clean-100	At our table a big good looking blond American 
none	none	He says he is a magician Ever hear of him
2436_2477_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 That s what he told me 
none	none	No I never heard of him Nor did I And I thought I had heard of everyone of importance He is listed for the same theater I am 
2436_2477_000028_000002	train-clean-100	Nice sort of fellow She paused then added If he s a professional entertainer I m a motor oiler 
none	none	It startled me
2436_2477_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 Why do you say that 
none	none	Instinctively my gaze swept the deck An Earth woman and child and a small Venus man were in sight but not within earshot
2436_2477_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Why do you look so furtive she retorted 
none	none	Gregg there s something strange about this voyage I m no fool nor you so you must know it as well as I do Rance Rankin I prompted 
2436_2477_000033_000000	train-clean-100	She leaned closer toward me 
none	none	He could fool you But not me I ve known too many magicians She grinned I challenged him to trick me You should have seen him evading Do you know Ob Hahn I interrupted She shook her head Never heard of him But he told me plenty at breakfast 
2436_2477_000035_000003	train-clean-100	By Satan what a flow of words that devil driver can muster 
none	none	He and the Englishman don t mesh very well do they She stared at me I had not answered her grin my mind was too busy with queer fancies Halsey s words Things are not always what they seem Were these passengers masqueraders Were they put here by George Prince And then I thought of Miko the Martian and the burn upon his arm
2436_2477_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Come back Gregg 
none	none	Don t go wandering off like that She dropped her voice to a whisper I ll be serious I want to know what in hell is going on aboard this ship I m a woman and I m curious You tell me What do you mean I parried I mean a lot of things What we ve just been talking about And what was the excitement you were in just before breakfast this morning Excitement Gregg you may trust me For the first time she was wholly serious Her gaze made sure no one was within hearing She put her hand on my arm I could barely hear her whisper I know they might have a ray upon us I ll be careful They Anyone Something s going on You know it You are in it I saw you this morning Gregg 
2436_2477_000043_000005	train-clean-100	Wild eyed chasing a phantom 
none	none	You And I heard the phantom A man s footsteps A magnetic deflecting invisible cloak You couldn t fool an audience with that it s too commonplace If Rance Rankin tried I gripped her Don t ramble Venza You saw me Yes My stateroom door was open I was sitting with a cigarette I saw the purser in the smoking room He was visible from Wait 
2436_2477_000048_000001	train-clean-100	Venza that prowler went through the smoking room 
none	none	I know he did I could hear him Did the purser hear him Of course 
2436_2477_000051_000001	train-clean-100	The purser looked up followed the sound with his gaze 
none	none	I thought that was queer He never made a move And then you came along and he acted innocent Why 
2436_2477_000051_000006	train-clean-100	What s going on that s what I want to know 
none	none	I held my breath Venza where did the prowler run to Can you She whispered calmly Into Atwenty I saw the door open and close I even thought I could see his blurred outline She added Why should George Prince be sneaking around with you after him 
2436_2477_000053_000003	train-clean-100	And the purser acting innocent 
none	none	And who is this George Prince anyway The huge Martian Miko with his sister Moa came strolling along the deck They nodded as they passed us I whispered I can t explain anything now But you re right Venza there is something going on Listen Whatever you learn whatever you encounter which looks unusual will you tell me I well I do trust you Really I do but the whole thing isn t mine to tell The somber pools of her eyes were shining You are very lovable Gregg I won t question you She was trembling with excitement Whatever it is I want to be in on it Here s something I can tell you now We ve two high class gold leaf gamblers aboard Do you know that Who are they Shac and Dud Ardley Every detective in Greater New York knows them They had a wonderful game with that Englishman Sir Arthur this morning Stripped him of half a pound of eight inch leaves a neat little stack 
2436_2477_000058_000003	train-clean-100	A crooked game of course 
none	none	Those fellows are more nimble fingered than Rance Rankin ever dared to be I sat staring at her She was a mine of information this girl And Gregg I tried my charms on Shac and Dud Nice men but dumb Whatever s going on they re not in it 
2436_2477_000060_000002	train-clean-100	They wanted to know what kind of a ship this was 
none	none	Why Because Shac has a cute little eavesdropping microphone of his own He had it working last night He overheard George Prince and that giant Miko arguing about the Moon 
2436_2477_000061_000000	train-clean-100	I gasped Venza 
2436_2477_000061_000001	train-clean-100	Softer 
none	none	Against all propriety of this public deck she pretended to drape herself upon me Her hair smothered my face as her lips almost touched my ear Something about treasure on the Moon Shac couldn t understand what And they mentioned you Then the purser joined them Her whispered words tumbled over one another A hundred pounds of gold leaf that s the purser s price He s with them whatever it is He promised to do something or other for them She stopped Well I prompted That s all Shac s current was interrupted Tell him to try it again Venza 
2436_2477_000066_000001	train-clean-100	I ll talk with him 
none	none	No I d better let him alone Can you get him to keep his mouth shut I think he might do anything I told him He s a man Find out what you can She drew away from me abruptly There s Anita and George Prince 
2436_2477_000070_000000	train-clean-100	They came to the corner of the deck but turned back 
2436_2477_000070_000001	train-clean-100	Venza caught my look 
none	none	And understood it You do love Anita Prince Gregg Venza was smiling I wish you I wish some man handsome as you would gaze after me like that She turned solemn You may be interested to know she loves you I could see it I knew it when I mentioned you to her this morning Me 
2436_2477_000072_000001	train-clean-100	Why we ve hardly spoken 
none	none	Is it necessary I never heard that it was I could not see Venza s face she stood up suddenly And when I rose beside her she whispered We should not be seen talking so long I ll find out what I can I stared after her slight robed figure as she turned into the lounge archway and vanished VI Captain Carter was grim So they ve bought him off have they Go bring him in here Gregg We ll have it out with him now Snap doctor Frank Balch our first officer and I were in the Captain s chart room It was four P M Earth time We were sixteen hours upon our voyage I found Johnson in his office in the lounge Captain wants to see you Close up He closed his window upon an American woman passenger who was demanding the details of Martian currency and followed me forward What is it Gregg I don t know Captain Carter banged the slide upon us The chart room was insulated The hum of the current was obvious Johnson noticed it He stared at the hostile faces of the surgeon and Balch And he tried to bluster What s this Something wrong Carter wasted no words We have information Johnson that there s some undercover plot aboard I want to know what it is Suppose you tell us The purser looked blank What do you mean We ve gamblers aboard if that s To hell with that growled Balch You had a secret interview with that Martian Set Miko and with George Prince Johnson scowled from under his heavy brows and then raised them in surprise Did I You mean changing their money I don t like your tone Balch I m not your under officer But you re under me roared the Captain By God I m master here Well I m not disputing that said the purser mildly This fellow We re in no mood for argument doctor Frank cut in Clouding the issue I won t let it be clouded the Captain exclaimed I had never seen Carter so choleric He added Johnson you ve been acting suspiciously I don t give a damn whether I ve proof of it or not Did you or did you not meet George Prince and that Martian last night No I did not And I don t mind telling you Captain Carter that your tone also is offensive Is it Carter seized him They were both big men Johnson s heavy face went purplish red Take your hands They were struggling Carter s hands were fumbling at the purser s pockets I leaped flung an arm around Johnson s neck pinning him Easy there We ve got you Johnson Snap tried to help me Go on Bang him on the head Gregg Now s your chance We searched him A heat ray cylinder that was legitimate But we found a small battery and eavesdropping device similar to the one Venza had mentioned that Shac the gambler was carrying What are you doing with that the Captain demanded None of your business Is it criminal Carter I ll have the line officials dismiss you for this Take your hands off me all of you Look at this exclaimed doctor Frank From Johnson s breast pocket the surgeon drew a folded document It was a scale drawing of the Planetara interior corridors the lower control rooms and mechanisms It was always kept in Johnson s safe And with it another document the ship s clearance papers the secret code passwords for this voyage to be used if we should be challenged by any Interplanetary Police ship Snap gasped My God that was in my radio room strong box I m the only one on this vessel except the Captain who s entitled to know those passwords Out of the silence Balch demanded Well what about it Johnson The purser was still defiant I won t answer your questions Balch At the proper time I ll explain Gregg Haljan you re choking me I eased up But I shook him You d better talk He was exasperatingly silent Enough exploded Carter He can explain when we get to port Meanwhile I ll put him where he ll do no more harm Gregg lock him in the cage We ignored his violent protestations The cage in the old days of sea vessels on Earth they called it the brig was the ship s jail A steel lined windowless room located under the deck in the peak of the bow I dragged the struggling Johnson there with the amazed watcher looking down from the observatory window at our lunging starlit forms Shut up Johnson If you know what s good for you He was making a fearful commotion Behind us where the deck narrowed at the superstructure half a dozen passengers were gazing in surprise I ll have you thrown out of the service Gregg Haljan I shut him up finally And flung him down the ladder into the cage and sealed the deck trap door upon him I was headed back for the chart room when from the observatory came the lookout s voice An asteroid Haljan Officer Blackstone wants you I hurried to the turret bridge An asteroid was in sight We had nearly attained our maximum speed now An asteroid was approaching so dangerously close that our trajectory would have to be altered I heard Blackstone s signals ringing in the control rooms and met Carter as he ran to the bridge with me That scoundrel We ll get more out of him Gregg By God I ll put the chemicals on him torture him illegal or not We had no time for further discussion The asteroid was rapidly approaching Already under the glass it was a magnificent sight I had never seen this tiny world before asteroids are not numerous between the Earth and Mars or in toward Venus At a speed of nearly a hundred miles a second the asteroid swept into view With the naked eye at first it was a tiny speck of star dust unnoticeable in the gem strewn black velvet of space A speck Then a gleaming dot silver white with the light of our Sun upon it I stood with Carter and Blackstone on the turret bridge It was obvious that unless we altered our course the asteroid would pass too close for safety Already we were feeling its attraction from the control rooms came the report that our trajectory was disturbed by this new mass so near Better make your calculations now Gregg Blackstone urged I cast up the rough elements from the observational instruments in the turret When I had us upon our new course with the attractive and repulsive plates in the Planetara s hull set in their altered combinations I went to the bridge again The asteroid hung over our bow quarter No more than twenty or thirty thousand miles away A giant ball now filling all that quadrant of the heavens The configurations of its mountains its land and water areas were plainly visible Perfectly habitable Blackstone said But I ve searched all over the hemisphere with the glass No sign of human life certainly nothing civilized nothing in the fashion of cities A fair little world by the look of it A tiny globe come from the region beyond Neptune We swept past the asteroid The passengers were all gathered to view the passing little world I saw not far from me Anita standing with her brother and the giant figure of Miko with them Half an hour since this wandering little world had showed itself it swiftly passed began to dwindle behind us A huge half moon A thinner smaller quadrant A tiny crescent like a silver barpin to adorn some lady s breast And then it was a dot a point of light indistinguishable among the myriad others hovering in this great black void The incident of the passing of the asteroid was over I turned from the deck window My heart leaped The moment for which all day I had been subconsciously longing was at hand Anita was sitting in a deck chair momentarily alone Her gaze was on me as I glanced her way and she smiled an invitation for me to join her VII But Miss Prince why are you and your brother going to Ferrok Shahn His business Even as I voiced it I hated myself for such a question So nimble in the humble mind that mingled with my rhapsodies of love was my need for information of George Prince Oh she said This is pleasure not business for George It seemed to me that a shadow crossed her face But it was gone in an instant and she smiled We have always wanted to travel We are alone in the world you know our parents died when we were children I filled in her pause You will like Mars So many interesting things to see She nodded Yes I understand so Our Earth is so much the same all over cast all in one mould But a hundred or more years ago it was not Miss Prince I have read how the picturesque Orient differing from well Greater New York or London for instance Transportation did that she interrupted eagerly Made everything the same the people all look alike dress alike We discussed it She had an 
2436_2481_000047_000001	train-clean-100	alert 
none	none	eager mind childlike with its curiosity yet strangely matured And her manner was naively earnest Yet this was no clinging vine this Anita Prince There was a firmness a hint of masculine strength in her chin and in her manner If I were a man what wonders I could achieve in this marvelous age Her sense of humor made her laugh at herself Easy for a girl to say that she added You have greater wonders to achieve Miss Prince I said impulsively Yes What are they She had a very frank and level gaze devoid of coquetry My heart was pounding The wonders of the next generation A little son cast in your own gentle image What madness this clumsy brash talk I choked it off But she took no offense The dark rose petals of her cheeks were mantled deeper red but she laughed That is true She turned abruptly serious I should not laugh The wonders of the next generation conquering humans marching on Her voice trailed away My hand went to her arm Strange tingling something which poets call love It burned and surged through my trembling fingers into the flesh of her forearm The starlight glowed in her eyes She seemed to be gazing not at the silver lit deck but away into distant reaches of the future Our moment Just a breathless moment given us as we sat there with my hand burning her arm as though we both might be seeing ourselves joined in a new individual a little son cast in his mother s gentle image and with the strength of his father Our moment and then it was over A step sounded I sat back The giant gray figure of Miko came past his great cloak swaying with his clanking sword ornament beneath it His bullet head with its close clipped hair was hatless He gazed at us swaggering past and turned the deck corner Our moment was gone Anita said conventionally It has been pleasant to talk with you mister Haljan But we ll have many more I said Ten days You think we ll reach Ferrok Shahn on schedule Yes I think so As I was saying Miss Prince you ll enjoy Mars A strange aggressively forward looking people An oppression seemed on her She stirred in her chair Yes they are she said vaguely My brother and I know many Martians in Greater New York She checked herself abruptly Was she sorry she had said that It seemed so Miko was coming back He stopped this time Your brother would see you Anita He sent me to bring you to his room The glance he shot me had a touch of insolence I stood up and he towered a head over me Anita said Oh yes I ll come I bowed I will see you again Miss Prince I thank you for a pleasant half hour The Martian led her away Her little figure was like a child with a giant It seemed as they passed the length of the deck with me staring after them that he took her arm roughly And that she shrank from him in fear And they did not go inside As though to show me that he had merely taken her from me he stopped at a distant deck window and stood talking to her Once he picked her up as one would pick up a child to show it some distant object through the window Was Anita afraid of this Martian s wooing Yet was held to him by some power he might have over her brother The vagrant thought struck me VIII The rest of that afternoon and evening were a blank confusion to me Anita s words the touch of my hand on her arm that vast realm of what might be for us like the glimpse of a magic land of happiness which I had seen in her eyes and perhaps she had seen in mine all this surged within me After wandering about the ship I had a brief consultation with Captain Carter He was genuinely apprehensive now The Planetara carried only a half dozen of the heat ray projectors no long range weapons a few side arms and some old fashioned practically antiquated weapons of explosives plus hand projectors with the new Benson curve light The weapons were all in Carter s chart room save the few we officers always carried Carter was afraid but of what he was not sure He had not thought that our plan to stop at the Moon could affect this outward voyage He had thought that any danger would occur on the way back and then the Planetara would have been adequately guarded and manned with police soldiers But now we were practically defenseless I had a moment with Venza but she had nothing new to communicate And for half an hour I chatted with George Prince He seemed a gay pleasant young man I could almost have fancied I liked him Or was it because he was Anita s brother He told me how he looked forward to traveling with her on Mars No he had never been there before he said He had a measure of Anita s earnest naive personality Or was he a very clever scoundrel with irony lurking in his soft voice and a chuckle that could so befool me Well talk again Haljan You interest me I ve enjoyed it He sauntered away from me joining the saturnine Ob Hahn with whom presently I heard him discussing religion The arrest of Johnson had caused considerable discussion among the passengers A few had seen me drag him forward to the cage The incident had been the subject of discussion all afternoon Captain Carter had posted a notice to the effect that Johnson s accounts had been found in serious error and that doctor Frank for this voyage would act in his stead It was near midnight when Snap and I closed and sealed the radio room and started for the chart room where we were to meet with Captain Carter and the other officers The passengers had nearly all retired A game was in progress in the smoking room but the deck was almost deserted Snap and I were passing along one of the interior corridors The stateroom doors were all closed The metal grid of the floor echoed our footsteps Snap was in advance of me His body suddenly rose in the air He went like a balloon to the ceiling struck it gently and all in a heap came floating down and landed on the floor What in the infernal He was laughing as he picked himself up But it was a brief laugh We knew what had happened the artificial gravity controls in the base of the ship which by magnetic force gave us normality aboard were being tampered with For just this instant this particular small section of this corridor had been cut off The slight bulk of the Planetara floating in space had no appreciable gravity pull on Snap s body and the impulse of his step as he came to the unmagnetized area of the corridor had thrown him to the ceiling The area was normal now Snap and I tested it gingerly He gripped me That never went wrong by accident Gregg Someone We rushed to the nearest descending ladder In the deserted lower room the bank of dials stood neglected A score of dials and switches were here governing the magnetism of different areas of the ship There should have been a night operator but he was gone Than we saw him lying nearby sprawled face down on the floor In the silence and dim lurid glow of the fluorescent tubes we stood holding our breaths peering and listening No one here The guard was not

none	none	He lay unconscious from a blow on the head A brawny fellow We had him revived in a few moments A broadcast flash of the call buzz brought doctor Frank from the chart room What s the matter Someone was here I said hastily experimenting with the magnetic switches Evidently unfamiliar with them pulling one or another to test their workings and so see their reactions on the dials We told him what had happened to Snap in the corridor the guard here was no worse off for the episode save a lump on the head by an invisible assailant We left him nursing his head sitting belligerent at his post alert to any danger and armed now with my heat ray cylinder Strange doings this voyage he told us All the crew knows it I ll stick it out now but when we get back home I m done with this star travelin I belong on the sea anyway We hurried back to the upper level We would indeed have to plan something at this chart room conference This was the first tangible attack our adversaries had made We were on the passenger deck headed for the chart room when all three of us stopped short frozen with horror Through the silent passenger quarters a scream rang out A girl s shuddering gasping scream Terror in it Horror Or a scream of agony In the silence of the dully vibrating ship it was utterly horrible It lasted an instant a single long scream then was abruptly stilled And with blood pounding my temples and rushing like ice through my veins I recognized it Anita IX Good God what was that doctor Frank s face had gone white Snap stood like a statue of horror The deck here was patched as always with silver radiance from the deck ports 
2436_2481_000000_000001	train-clean-100	The empty deck chairs stood about 
2436_2481_000000_000002	train-clean-100	The scream was stilled but now we heard a commotion inside the rasp of opening cabin doors questions from frightened passengers 
none	none	I found my voice Anita Anita Prince
2436_2481_000002_000000	train-clean-100	 Come on shouted Snap 
2436_2481_000002_000001	train-clean-100	 In her stateroom Atwenty two 
none	none	He was dashing for the lounge archway 
2436_2481_000003_000000	train-clean-100	doctor Frank and I followed 
none	none	I realized that we passed the deck door and window of Atwenty two But they were dark and evidently sealed on the inside The dim lounge was in a turmoil passengers standing at their cabin doors 
2436_2481_000004_000000	train-clean-100	I shouted Go back to your rooms 
2436_2481_000004_000001	train-clean-100	We want order here keep back 
none	none	We came to the twin doors of Atwenty two and Atwenty 
2436_2481_000005_000001	train-clean-100	Both were closed 
2436_2481_000005_000002	train-clean-100	doctor Frank was in advance of Snap and me now 
none	none	He paused at the sound of Captain Carter s voice behind us
2436_2481_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Was it from in there 
none	none	Wait a moment 
2436_2481_000007_000000	train-clean-100	Carter dashed up 
2436_2481_000007_000001	train-clean-100	He had a large heat ray projector in his hand 
2436_2481_000007_000002	train-clean-100	He shoved us aside 
2436_2481_000007_000003	train-clean-100	 Let me in first 
2436_2481_000007_000004	train-clean-100	Is the door sealed 
2436_2481_000007_000005	train-clean-100	Gregg keep those passengers back 
2436_2481_000008_000000	train-clean-100	The door was not sealed 
2436_2481_000008_000001	train-clean-100	Carter burst into the room 
2436_2481_000008_000002	train-clean-100	I heard him gasp Good God 
2436_2481_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Snap and I shoved back three or four passengers 
none	none	And in that instant doctor Frank had been in the room and out again
2436_2481_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 There s been an accident 
2436_2481_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Get back Gregg 
2436_2481_000010_000002	train-clean-100	Snap help me keep the crowd away He shoved me forcibly 
2436_2481_000011_000000	train-clean-100	From within Carter was shouting Keep them out 
2436_2481_000011_000001	train-clean-100	Where are you Frank 
2436_2481_000011_000002	train-clean-100	Come back here 
2436_2481_000011_000003	train-clean-100	Send a flash for Balch 
2436_2481_000012_000000	train-clean-100	doctor Frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon Snap and me 
none	none	I was unarmed 
2436_2481_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Weapon in hand Snap forced the panic stricken passengers back to their rooms 
none	none	Snap reassured them glibly but he knew no more about the facts than I Moa with a nightrobe drawn tight around her thin tall figure edged up to me What has happened Set Haljan 
2436_2481_000015_000000	train-clean-100	I gazed around for her brother Miko but did not see him 
none	none	An accident I said shortly Go back to your room 
2436_2481_000016_000002	train-clean-100	Captain s orders 
none	none	She eyed me and then retreated 
2436_2481_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Snap was threatening everybody with his cylinder 
2436_2481_000017_000002	train-clean-100	Balch dashed up 
none	none	What in hell 
2436_2481_000017_000004	train-clean-100	Where is Carter 
2436_2481_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 In there I pounded on Atwenty two 
2436_2481_000018_000001	train-clean-100	It opened cautiously 
2436_2481_000018_000002	train-clean-100	I could see only Carter but I heard the murmuring voice of doctor Frank through the interior connecting door to Atwenty 
2436_2481_000019_000000	train-clean-100	The Captain rasped Get out Haljan 
2436_2481_000019_000001	train-clean-100	Oh is that you Balch 
2436_2481_000019_000002	train-clean-100	Come in He admitted the older officer and slammed the door upon me again And immediately reopened it 
2436_2481_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Gregg keep the passengers quieted 
2436_2481_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Tell them everything s all right Miss Prince got frightened that s all 
4598_2503_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Then go 
2436_2481_000020_000002	train-clean-100	Then go to the turret 
2436_2481_000020_000003	train-clean-100	Tell Blackstone what s happened 
2436_2481_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 But I don t know what s happened 
2436_2481_000022_000000	train-clean-100	Carter was grim and white 
none	none	He whispered I think it may turn out to be murder Gregg No not dead yet 
2436_2481_000022_000003	train-clean-100	doctor Frank is trying don t stand there like an ass man 
2436_2481_000022_000004	train-clean-100	Get to the turret 
2436_2481_000022_000005	train-clean-100	Verify our trajectory no wait 
2436_2481_000023_000000	train-clean-100	The Captain was almost incoherent 
2436_2481_000023_000001	train-clean-100	 Wait a minute 
2436_2481_000023_000002	train-clean-100	I don t mean that Tell Snap to watch his radio room 
2436_2481_000023_000003	train-clean-100	Arm yourselves and guard our weapons 
2436_2481_000024_000000	train-clean-100	I stammered If if she dies will you flash us word 
none	none	He stared at me strangely
2436_2481_000025_000001	train-clean-100	 I ll be there presently Gregg 
2436_2481_000026_000000	train-clean-100	He slammed the door upon me 
none	none	I followed his orders but it was like a dream of horror 
2436_2481_000027_000001	train-clean-100	The turmoil of the ship gradually quieted 
none	none	Snap went to the radio room Blackstone and I sat in the tiny chart room how much time passed I do not know I was confused 
2436_2481_000027_000003	train-clean-100	Anita hurt 
2436_2481_000027_000004	train-clean-100	She might die murdered 
none	none	But why By whom Had George Prince been in his own room when the attack came I thought now I recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in there with doctor Frank 
2436_2481_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Where was Miko 
none	none	It stabbed at me I had not seen him among the passengers in the lounge 
2436_2481_000029_000000	train-clean-100	Carter came into the chart room 
none	none	Gregg you get to bed 
2436_2481_000029_000002	train-clean-100	You look like a ghost 
none	none	But She s not dead She may live 
2436_2481_000031_000002	train-clean-100	doctor Frank and her brother are with her 
2436_2481_000031_000003	train-clean-100	They re doing all they can He told us what had happened 
none	none	Anita and George Prince had both been asleep each in his respective room Someone unknown had opened Anita s corridor door
2436_2481_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Wasn t it sealed 
none	none	Yes But the intruder opened it
2436_2481_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 Burst it 
none	none	I didn t think it was broken It wasn t broken 
2436_2481_000035_000001	train-clean-100	The assailant opened it somehow and assaulted Miss Prince shot her in the chest with a heat ray 
none	none	Her left lung Shot her Yes 
2436_2481_000037_000001	train-clean-100	But she did not see who did it 
2436_2481_000037_000002	train-clean-100	Nor did Prince 
none	none	Her scream awakened him but the intruder evidently fled out the corridor door of Atwenty two the way he entered I stood weak and shaken at the chart room entrance Anita dying perhaps and all my dreams were fading into a memory of what might have been I was glad enough to get away I would lie down for an hour and then go to Anita s stateroom I d demand that doctor Frank let me see her I went to the stern deck where my cubby was located My mind was confused but some instinct within me made me verify the seals of my door and window They were intact 
2436_2481_000040_000003	train-clean-100	I entered cautiously switched on the dimmer of the tube lights and searched the room 
2436_2481_000040_000004	train-clean-100	It had only a bunk my tiny desk a chair and clothes robe 
none	none	There was no evidence of any intruder here I set my door and window alarm Then I audiphoned to the radio room Snap Yes I told him about Anita 
2436_2481_000043_000001	train-clean-100	Carter cut in on us from the chart room 
2436_2481_000043_000002	train-clean-100	 Stop that you fools 
none	none	We cut off Fully dressed I flung myself on my bed Anita might die I must have fallen into a tortured sleep I was awakened by the sound of my alarm buzzer 
2436_2481_000045_000001	train-clean-100	Someone was tampering with my door 
none	none	Then the buzzer ceased the marauder outside must have found a way of silencing it 
2436_2481_000045_000003	train-clean-100	But it had done its work awakened me 
none	none	I had switched off the light my cubby was Stygian black A heat cylinder was in the bunk bracket over my head 
2436_2481_000046_000002	train-clean-100	I searched for it pried it loose softly 
none	none	I was fully awake Alert I could hear a faint sizzling someone outside trying to unseal the door 
2436_2481_000047_000003	train-clean-100	In the darkness cylinder in hand I crept softly from the bunk 
2436_2481_000047_000004	train-clean-100	Crouched at the door 
none	none	This time I would capture or kill this night prowler The sizzling was faintly audible My door seal was breaking 
2436_2481_000048_000002	train-clean-100	Upon impulse I reached for the door jerked it open 
2436_2481_000049_000000	train-clean-100	No one there 
none	none	The starlit segment of deck was empty But I leaped and struck a solid body crouching in the doorway 
2436_2481_000049_000003	train-clean-100	A giant man 
none	none	Miko 
2436_2481_000050_000000	train-clean-100	His electronized metallic robe burned my hands 
2436_2481_000050_000001	train-clean-100	I lunged against him I was almost as surprised as he 
none	none	I shot but the stab of heat evidently missed him 
2436_2481_000050_000003	train-clean-100	The shock of my encounter short circuited his robe he materialized in the starlight 
2436_2481_000050_000004	train-clean-100	A brief savage encounter 
none	none	He struck the weapon from my hand 
2436_2481_000050_000006	train-clean-100	He had dropped his hydrogen torch and tried to grip me 
none	none	But I twisted away from his hold
2436_2481_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 So it s you 
2436_2481_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 Quiet Gregg Haljan 
2436_2481_000052_000001	train-clean-100	I only want to talk 
none	none	Without warning a stab of radiance shot from a weapon in his hand 
2436_2481_000053_000001	train-clean-100	It caught me 
none	none	Ran like ice through my veins Seized and numbed my limbs 
2436_2481_000054_000000	train-clean-100	I fell helpless to the deck 
none	none	Nerves and muscles paralyzed My tongue was thick and inert I could not speak nor move But I could see Miko bending over me and hear him I don t want to kill you Haljan We need you He gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms carried me swiftly across the deserted deck Snap s radio room in the network under the dome was diagonally overhead 
2436_2481_000057_000001	train-clean-100	A white actinic light shot from it caught us bathed us Snap had been awake had heard the commotion of our encounter 
2436_2481_000058_000000	train-clean-100	His voice rang shrilly Stop 
2436_2481_000058_000001	train-clean-100	I ll shoot His warning siren rang out to alert the ship 
2436_2481_000058_000002	train-clean-100	His spotlight clung to us 
2436_2481_000059_000000	train-clean-100	Miko ran with me a few steps 
2436_2481_000059_000001	train-clean-100	Then he cursed and dropped me fled away 
2436_2481_000059_000002	train-clean-100	I fell like a sack of carbide to the deck 
none	none	My senses faded into blackness
2436_2481_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 He s all right now 
2436_2481_000061_000000	train-clean-100	I was in the chart room with Captain Carter Snap and doctor Frank bending over me 
none	none	The surgeon said
2436_2481_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 Can you speak now Gregg 
2436_2481_000063_000000	train-clean-100	I tried it 
none	none	My tongue was thick but it moved Yes I was soon revived 
2436_2481_000063_000003	train-clean-100	I sat up with doctor Frank vigorously rubbing me 
2436_2481_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 I m all right I told them what had happened 
none	none	Captain Carter said Yes we know that And it was Miko also who killed Anita Prince She told us before she died
2436_2481_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Died I leaped to my feet 
none	none	She died Yes Gregg An hour ago Miko got into her stateroom and tried to force his love upon her 
2436_2481_000067_000003	train-clean-100	She repulsed him 
none	none	He killed her 
2436_2481_000068_000000	train-clean-100	It struck me blank 
none	none	And then with a rush came the thought He says Miko killed her 
2436_2481_000069_000000	train-clean-100	I heard myself stammering Why why we must get him I gathered my wits a surge of hate swept me a wild desire for vengeance 
2436_2481_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Why by God where is he 
2436_2481_000070_000001	train-clean-100	Why don t you go get him 
none	none	I ll get him I ll kill him
2436_2481_000071_000000	train-clean-100	 Easy Gregg doctor Frank gripped me 
2436_2481_000072_000000	train-clean-100	The Captain said gently 
none	none	We know how you feel Gregg She told us before she died

none	none	We ll explain later They sat me down calming me Anita dead The door of the shining garden was closed A brief glimpse given to me and to her of what might have been And now she was dead X I had not been able at first to understand why Captain Carter wanted Miko left at liberty Within me there was that cry of vengeance as though to strike Miko down would somehow lessen my own grief Whatever Carter s purpose Snap had not known it But Balch and doctor Frank were in the Captain s confidence all three of them working on some plan of action It was obvious that at least two of our passengers were plotting with Miko and George Prince trying on this voyage to learn what they could about Grantline s activities on the Moon scheming doubtless to seize the treasure when the Planetara stopped at the Moon on the return voyage I thought I could name those masquerading passengers Ob Hahn supposedly a Venus mystic And Rance Rankin who called himself an American magician Those two Snap and I agreed seemed most suspicious And there was the purser I sat for a time on the deck outside the chart room with Snap Then Carter summoned us back and we sat listening while he Balch and doctor Frank went on with their conference Listening to them I could not but agree that our best plan was to secure evidence which would incriminate all who were concerned in the plot Miko we were convinced had been the Martian who followed Snap and me from Halsey s office in Greater New York George Prince had doubtless been the invisible eavesdropper outside the radio room He knew and had told the others that Grantline had found that priceless metal on the Moon and that the Planetara would stop there on the way home But we could not incarcerate George Prince for being an eavesdropper Nor had we the faintest possible evidence against Ob Hahn or Rankin And even the purser would probably be released by the Interplanetary Court of Ferrok Shahn when it heard our evidence There was only Miko We could arrest him for the murder of Anita But if we did that now the others would be put on their guard It was Carter s idea to let Miko remain at liberty for a time and see if we could identify and incriminate his fellows The murder of Anita obviously had nothing to do with any plot against Grantline Moon treasure Why exclaimed Balch there might be probably are huge Martian interests concerned in this thing These men aboard are only emissaries making this voyage to learn what they can When they get to Ferrok Shahn they ll make their report and then we ll have a real danger on our hands Why an outlaw ship could be launched from Ferrok Shahn that would beat us back to the Moon and Grantline is entirely without warning of any danger It seemed obvious Unscrupulous criminals in Ferrok Shahn would be dangerous indeed once these details of Grantline were given them So now it was decided that in the remaining nine days of our outward voyage we would attempt to secure enough evidence to arrest all these plotters I ll have them all in the cage when we land declared Carter grimly They ll make no report to their principals Ah the futile plans of men Yet at the time we thought it practical We were all doubly armed now Bullet projectors and heat ray cylinders And we had several eavesdropping microphones which we planned to use whenever occasion offered Only twenty eight hours of this eventful voyage had passed The Planetara was some six million miles from the Earth it blazed behind us a tremendous giant The body of Anita was being made ready for burial George Prince was still in his stateroom Glutz effeminate little hairdresser who waxed rich acting as beauty doctor for the women passengers and who in his youth had been an undertaker had gone with doctor Frank to prepare the body Gruesome details I tried not to think of them I sat numbed in the chart room An astronomical burial there was little precedent for it I dragged myself to the stern deck where at five A M the ceremony took place We were a solemn little group gathered there in the checkered starlight with the great vault of the heavens around us A dismantled electronic projector necessary when a long range gun was mounted had been rigged up in one of the deck ports They brought out the body I stood apart gazing reluctantly at the small bundle wrapped like a mummy in a dark metallic screen cloth A patch of black silk rested over her face Four cabin stewards carried her and beside her walked George Prince A long black robe covered him but his head was bare And suddenly he reminded me of the ancient play character of Hamlet His black wavy hair his finely chiseled pallid face set now in a stern patrician cast And staring I realized that however much of the villain this man might be at this instant walking beside the body of his dead sister he was stricken with grief He loved that sister with whom he had lived since childhood and to see him now no one could doubt it The little procession stopped in a patch of starlight by the port They rested the body on a bank of chairs The black robed chaplain roused from his bed and still trembling from excitement of this sudden inexplicable death on board said a brief solemn little prayer An appeal That the Almighty Ruler of all these blazing worlds might guard the soul of this gentle girl whose mortal remains were now to be returned to Him Ah if ever God seemed hovering close it was now at this instant on this starlit deck floating in the black void of space Then Carter for just a moment removed the black shroud from her face I saw her brother gaze silently saw him stoop and implant a kiss and turn away I did not want to look but I found myself moving slowly forward She lay so beautiful Her face white and calm and peaceful in death My sight blurred Easy Gregg Snap was whispering to me He had his arm around me Come on away They tied the shroud over her face I did not see them as they put the body in the tube sent it through the exhaust chamber and dropped it But a moment later I saw it a small black oblong bundle hovering beside us It was perhaps a hundred feet away circling us Held by the Planetara s bulk it had momentarily become our satellite It swung around us like a moon Gruesome satellite by nature s laws forever to follow us Then from another tube at the bow Blackstone operated a small zed company ray projector Its dull light caught the floating bundle neutralizing its metallic wrappings It swung off at a tangent Speeding Falling free in the dome of the heavens A rotating black oblong But in a moment distance dwindled it to a speck A dull silver dot with the sunlight on it A speck of human Earth dust falling free It vanished Anita gone XI I turned from the deck Miko was near me So he had dared show himself here among us But I realized he could not be aware we knew he was the murderer George Prince had been asleep had not seen Miko with Anita Miko with impulsive rage had shot the girl and escaped No doubt now he was cursing himself for having done it And he could very well assume that Anita had died without regaining consciousness to tell who had killed her He gazed at me now I thought for an instant he was coming over to talk with me Though he probably considered he was not suspected of the murder of Anita he realized of course that his attack on me was known He must have wondered what action would be taken But he did not approach me He moved away and went inside Moa had been near him and as though by prearrangement with him she now accosted me I want to speak to you Set Haljan Go ahead I felt an instinctive aversion to this Martian girl Yet she was not unattractive Over six feet tall straight and slim Sleek blond hair Rather a handsome face not gray like the burly Miko but pink and white stern lipped but feminine too She was smiling gravely now Her blue eyes regarded me keenly She said gently A sad occurrence Gregg Haljan And mysterious I would not question you Is that all you have to say I demanded No You are a handsome man Gregg attractive to women to any Martian woman She said it impulsively Admiration for me was on her face in her eyes a man cannot miss it Thank you I mean I would be your friend My brother Miko is so sorry about what happened between you and him this morning He only wanted to talk to you and he came to your cubby door With a torch to break its seal I interjected She waved that away He was afraid you would not admit him He told you he would not harm you And so he struck me with one of your Martian paralyzing rays He is sorry She seemed gauging me trying no doubt to find out what reprisal would be taken against her brother I felt sure that Moa was as active as a man in any plan that was under way to capture the Grantline treasure Miko with his ungovernable temper was doing things that put their plans in jeopardy I demanded What did your brother want to talk to me about Me she said surprisingly I sent him A Martian girl goes after what she wants Did you know that She swung on her heel and left me I puzzled over it Was that why Miko struck me down and was carrying me off I did not think so I could not believe that all these incidents were so unrelated to what I knew was the main undercurrent They wanted me had tried to capture me for something else doctor Frank found me mooning alone Go to bed Gregg You look awful I don t want to go to bed Where s Snap I don t know He was here a little while ago I had not seen him since the burial of Anita The Captain wants him he said Within an hour the morning siren would arouse the passengers I was seated in a secluded corner of the deck when George Prince came along He went past me a slight somber dark robed figure He had on high thick boots A hood was over his head but as he saw me he pushed it back and dropped down beside me For a moment he did not speak His face showed pallid in the dim starlight She said you loved her His soft voice was throaty with emotion Yes I said it almost against my will There seemed a bond springing between this bereaved brother and me He added so softly I could barely hear him That makes you I think almost my friend And you thought you were my enemy I held my answer An incautious tongue running under emotion is a dangerous thing And I was sure of nothing He went on Almost my friend Because we both loved her and she loved us both He was hardly more than whispering And there is aboard one whom we both hate Miko It burst from me Yes But do not say it Another silence fell between us He brushed back the black curls from his forehead Have you an eavesdropping microphone Haljan I hesitated Yes I was thinking He leaned closer If in half an hour you could use it upon Miko s cabin I would rather tell you than anyone else The cabin will be insulated but I shall find a way of cutting off that insulation so that you can hear So George Prince had turned with us The shock of his sister s death himself allied with her murderer had been too much for him He was with us Yet his help must be given secretly Miko would kill him instantly if it became known He had been watchful of the deck He stood up now I think that is all As he turned away I murmured But I do thank you The name Set Miko glowed upon the door It was in a transverse corridor similar to Atwenty two The corridor was forward of the lounge it opened off the small circular library The library was unoccupied and unlighted dim with only the reflected lights from the nearby passages I crouched behind a cylinder case The door of Miko s room was in sight I waited perhaps five minutes No one entered Then I realized that doubtless the conspirators were already there I set my tiny eavesdropper on the library floor beside me connected its little battery focused its projector Was Miko s room insulated I could not tell There was a small ventilating grid above the door Across its opening if the room was insulated a blue sheen of radiance would be showing And there would be a faint hum But from this distance I could not see or hear such details and I was afraid to approach closer Once in the transverse corridor I would have no place to hide no way of escape If anyone approached Miko s door I would be trapped I threw the current into my apparatus I prayed if it met interference that the slight sound would pass unnoticed George Prince had said that he would make opportunity to disconnect the room s insulation He had evidently done so I picked up the interior sounds at once my headphone vibrated with them And with trembling fingers on the little dial between my knees as I crouched in the darkness behind the cylinder case I synchronized Johnson is a fool It was Miko s voice We must have the passwords He got them from the radio room A man s voice I puzzled over it at first then recognized it Rance Rankin Miko said He is a fool Walking around this ship as though with letters blazoned on his forehead Watch me I need watching Hah No wonder they apprehended him Rankin s voice said He would have turned the papers over to us I would not blame him too much What harm Oh I ll release him Miko declared What harm That braying ass did us plenty of harm He has lost the passwords Better he had left them in the radio room Moa was in the room Her voice said We ve got to have them The Planetara upon such an important voyage as this might be watched No doubt it is Rankin said quietly We ought to have the passwords When we are in control of this ship It sent a shiver through me Were they planning to try and seize the Planetara Now It seemed so Johnson undoubtedly memorized them Moa was saying When we get him out Hahn is to do that at the signal Miko added George could do it better perhaps And then I heard George Prince for the first time I ll try No need Miko said unexpectedly I could not see what had happened A look perhaps which Prince could not avoid giving this man he had come to hate Miko doubtless saw it and the Martian s hot anger leaped Rankin said hurriedly Stop that And Moa Let him alone you fool Sit down I could hear the sound of a scuffle A blow a cry half suppressed from George Prince Then Miko I will not hurt him Craven coward Look at him Hating me frightened I could fancy George Prince sitting there with murder in his heart and Miko taunting him Hates me now because I shot his sister Moa Hush I will not Why should I not say it I will tell you something else George Prince It was not Anita I shot at but you I meant nothing for her but love If you had not interfered This was different from what we had figured George Prince had come in from his own room had tried to rescue his sister and in the scuffle Anita had taken the shot instead of George I did not even know I had hit her Miko was saying Not until I heard she was dead He added sardonically I hoped it was you I had hit George And I will tell you this you hate me no more than I hate you If it were not for your knowledge of ores Is this to be a personal wrangle Rankin interrupted I thought we were here to plan It is planned Miko said shortly I give orders I do not plan I am waiting now for the moment He checked himself Moa said Does Rankin understand that no harm is to come to Gregg Haljan Yes Rankin said And Dean We need them of course But you cannot make Dean send messages if he refuses nor make Haljan navigate I know enough to check on them Miko said grimly They will not fool me And they will obey me have no fear A little touch of sulphuric His laugh was gruesome It makes the most stubborn very willing I wish said Moa we had Haljan safely hidden If he is hurt killed So that was why Miko had tried to capture me To keep me safe so that I might navigate the ship It occurred to me that I should get Carter at once A plot to seize the Planetara but when I froze with startled horror The diaphragms at my ears rang with Miko s words I have set the time for now two minutes It seemed to startle Rankin and George Prince as much as it did me Both exclaimed No No Why not Everyone is at his post Prince repeated No And Rankin But can we trust them The stewards the crew Eight of them are our own men You didn t know that Rankin They ve been aboard the Planetara for several voyages Oh this is no quickly planned affair even though we let you in on it so recently You and Johnson By God There was a commotion in the stateroom I crouched tense Miko had discovered that his insulation had been cut off He had evidently leaped to his feet I heard a chair overturn And the Martian s roar It s off Did you do that Prince By God if I thought My apparatus went suddenly dead as Miko flung on his insulation I lost my wits in the confusion I should have instantly taken off my vibrations There was interference it showed in the dark space of the ventilator grid over Miko s doorway a snapping in the air there a swirl of sparks I heard with my unaided ears Miko s roar over his insulation By God they re listening The scream of hand sirens sounded from his stateroom It rang over the ship His signal I heard it answered from some distant point And then a shot a commotion in the lower corridors The attack upon the Planetara had begun I was on my feet The shouts of startled passengers sounded a turmoil beginning everywhere I stood momentarily transfixed The door of Miko s stateroom burst open He stood there with Rankin Moa and George Prince crowding him He saw me You Gregg Haljan He came leaping at me XII I was taken wholly by surprise There was an instant when I stood numbed fumbling for a weapon at my belt undecided whether to run or stand my ground Miko was no more than twenty feet from me He checked his forward rush The light from an overhead tube was on him I saw in his hand the cylinder projector of his paralyzing ray I plucked my heat cylinder from my belt and fired without taking aim My tiny heat beam flashed I must have grazed Miko s hand His roar of anger and pain rang out over the turmoil He dropped his weapon then stooped to pick it up But Moa forestalled him She leaped and seized it Careful Fool you promised not to harm him A confusion of swift action Rankin had turned and darted away I saw George Prince stumbling half in front of the struggling Miko and Moa And I heard footsteps beside me A hand gripped me jerked at me Over the turmoil Prince s voice sounded Gregg Haljan I recall that I had the impression that Prince was frightened he had half fallen in front of Miko And there was Miko s voice Let go of me It was Balch gripping me Gregg This way run
4598_2503_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Get out of here 
none	none	He ll kill you with that ray Miko s ray flashed but George Prince had knocked his arm I did not dare fire again Prince was in the way Balch who was unarmed shoved me violently back Gregg The chart room I turned and ran with Balch after me Prince had fallen or been felled by Miko A flash followed me from Miko s weapon but again it missed He did not pursue me Instead he ran the other way through the portside door of the library Balch and I found ourselves in the library Shouting frightened passengers were everywhere The place was in wild confusion the whole ship ringing now with shouts To the chart room Gregg I called to the passengers Go back to your rooms I followed Balch We ran through the archway to the deck In the starlight I saw figures scurrying aft but none were near us The deck forward was dim with heavy shadows The oval windows and door of the chart room were blue yellow from the tube lights inside No one seemed on the deck there And then as we approached I saw further forward in the bow the trap door to the cage standing open Johnson had been released From one of the chart room windows a heat ray sizzled It barely missed us Balch shouted Carter don t The Captain called Oh you Balch and Haljan He came out on the deck as we rushed up His left arm was dangling limp God this He got no further From the turret overhead a tiny search beam came down and disclosed us Blackstone was supposed to be on duty up there with a course master at the controls But glancing up I saw illumined by the turret lights the figure of Ob Hahn in his purple white robe and Johnson the purser And on the turret balcony two fallen men Blackstone and the course master Johnson was training the spotlight on us And Hahn fired a Martian ray It struck Balch beside me He dropped Carter was shouting Inside Gregg Get inside I stopped to raise up Balch Another beam came down A heat ray this time It caught the fallen Balch full on the chest piercing him through The smell of his burning flesh rose to sicken me He was dead I dropped his body Carter shoved me into the chart room In the small steel lined room Carter and I slid the door closed We were alone here The thing had come so quickly it had taken Captain Carter like us all wholly unawares We had anticipated spying eavesdroppers but not this open brigandage No more than a minute or two had passed since Miko s siren in his stateroom had given the signal for attack Carter had been in the chart room Blackstone was in the turret At the outbreak of confusion Carter dashed out to see Hahn releasing Johnson from the cage From the forward chart room window now I could see where Hahn with a torch had broken the cage seal The torch lay on the deck There had been an exchange of shots Carter s arm was paralyzed Johnson and Hahn had escaped Carter was as confused as I There had simultaneously been an encounter up in the turret Blackstone and the course master were killed The lookout had been shot from his post in the forward observatory The body dangled now twisted half in and half out the window We could see several of Miko s men erstwhile members of our crew and steward corps scurrying from the turret along the upper bridge toward the dark and silent radio room Snap was up there But was he The radio room glowed suddenly with dim light but there was no evidence of a fight there The fighting seemed mostly below the deck down in the hull corridors A blended horror of sounds came up to us Screams shouts and the hissing and snapping of ray weapons Our crew such of them as were loyal were making a stand below But it was brief Within a minute it died away The passengers amidships in the superstructure were still shouting Then above them Miko s roar sounded Be quiet Go in your rooms you will not be harmed The brigands in these few minutes were in control of the ship All but this little chart room where with most of the ship s weapons Carter and I were entrenched God Gregg that this should come upon us Carter was fumbling with the chart room weapons Here Gregg Help me What have you got Heat ray That s all I had ready It struck me then as I helped him make the connections that Carter in this crisis was at best an inefficient commander His red face had gone splotchy purple his hands were trembling Skilled as Captain of a peaceful liner he was at a loss now But I could not blame him It is easy to say we might have taken warning done this or that and come triumphant through the attack But only the fool looks backward and says I would have done better I tried to summon my wits The ship was lost to us unless Carter and I could do something Our futile weapons They were all here four or five heat ray hand projectors that could send a pencil ray a hundred feet or so I shot one diagonally up at the turret where Johnson was leering down at our rear window but he saw my gesture and dropped back out of sight The heat beam flashed harmlessly up and struck the turret room Then across the turret window came a sheen of radiance an electrobarrage And behind it Hahn s suave evil face appeared He shouted down We have orders to spare you Gregg Haljan or you would have been killed long ago My answering shot hit his barrage with a shower of sparks behind which he stood unmoved Carter handed me another weapon Gregg try this I leveled the old explosive projector Carter crouched beside me But before I could press the trigger from somewhere down the starlit deck an electro beam hit me The little rifle exploded broke its breech I sank back to the floor tingling from the shock of the hostile current My hands were blackened from the exploded powder Carter seized me No use Hurt No The stars through the dome windows were swinging A long swing the shadows and patterns on the starlit deck were all shifting The Planetara was turning The heavens revolved in a great round sweep of movement then settled as we took our new course Hahn at the turret controls had swung us The Earth and the Sun showed over our bow quarter The sunlight mingled red yellow with the brilliant starlight Hahn s signals were sounding I heard them answered from the mechanism rooms down below Brigands there in full control The gravity plates were being set to the new positions We were on our new course Headed a point or two off the Earthline Not headed for the Moon I wondered Carter and I were planning nothing What was there to plan We were under observation A Martian paralyzing ray or an electronic beam far more deadly than our own puny weapons would have struck us the instant we tried to leave the chart room My thoughts were interrupted by a shout from down the deck At a corner of the cabin superstructure some fifty feet from our windows the figure of Miko appeared A radiance barrage hung about him like a shimmering mantle His voice sounded Gregg Haljan do you yield Carter leaped up from where he and I were crouching Against all reason of safety he leaned from the low window waving his hamlike fist Yield No I am in command here you pirate Brigand murderer I dragged him back sharply For God s sake He was spluttering and over it Miko s sardonic laugh sounded Shall we argue about it I stood up What do you want to say Miko Behind him the tall thin figure of his sister showed She was plucking at him He turned violently I won t harm him Gregg Haljan is this a truce You will not shoot He was shielding Moa No I called For a moment no A truce What is it you want to say I could hear the babble of passengers who were herded in the cabin with brigands guarding them George Prince bare headed but shrouded in his cloak showed in a patch of light behind Moa He looked my way and then retreated Miko called You must yield We want you Haljan No doubt I jeered Alive It is easy to kill you I could not doubt that Carter and I were little more than rats in a trap But Miko wanted to take me alive that was not so simple He added persuasively We want you to navigate us Will you No Will you help us Captain Carter Tell your cub this Haljan to yield Carter roared Get back from there There is no truce I shoved aside his leveled projector Wait a minute Miko Navigate where That is our business When you come out here I will give you the course I realized that all this parley was a ruse of Miko s to take me alive He had made a gesture Hahn watching him from the turret window doubtless flashed a signal down to the hull corridors The magnetizer control under the chart room was altered our artificial gravity cut off I felt the sudden lightness I gripped the window casement and clung Carter was startled into incautious movement It flung him out into the room his arms and legs flailing And across the chart room in the opposite window I felt rather than saw the shape of something A figure almost invisible but not quite was trying to climb in I flung the empty rifle I was holding It hit something solid in the window In a flare of sparks a blackhooded figure materialized A man climbing in His weapon spat There was a tiny electronic flash deadly silent The intruder had shot at Carter struck him Carter gave one queer scream He had floated to the floor his convulsive movement when he was hit hurled him to the ceiling His body struck twitched bounced back and sank inert on the floor grid almost at my feet I clung to the casement Across the room of the weightless room the hooded intruder was also clinging His hood fell back It was Johnson Killed him the bully Now for you mister Third Officer Haljan But he did not dare fire at me Miko had forbidden it I saw him reach under his robe doubtless for a low powered paralyzing ray But he never got it out I had no weapon within reach I leaned into the room still holding the casement and doubled my legs under me I kicked out from the window The force catapulted me across the space across the room like a volplane I struck the purser We gripped Our locked struggling bodies bounced out into the room We struck the floor surged up like balloons to the ceiling struck it with a flailing arm or leg and floated back Grotesque abnormal combat Like fighting in weightless water Johnson clutched his weapon but I twisted his wrist held his arm outstretched so that he could not aim it I was aware of Miko s voice shouting on the deck outside Johnson s left hand was gouging at my face his fingers digging at my eyes We lunged down I twisted his wrists He dropped the weapon and it sank away I tried to reach it but could not Then I had him by the throat I was stronger than he and more agile I tried choking him I had his thick bull neck within my fingers He kicked scrambled tore and gouged at me Tried to shout but it ended in a gurgle And then as he felt his breath stopped his hands came up in an effort to tear mine loose We sank again to the floor We were momentarily upright I felt my feet touch I bent my knees We sank further And then I kicked violently upward Our locked bodies shot to the ceiling Johnson s head was above me It struck the steel roof of the chart room A violent blow I felt him go suddenly limp 
4598_2503_000040_000000	train-clean-360	I cast him off 
none	none	and doubling my body I kicked at the ceiling It sent me diagonally downward to the window where I clung And I saw Miko standing on the deck with a weapon leveled at me XIII Haljan Yield or I ll fire Moa give me the smaller one He had in his hand too large a projector Its ray would kill me If he wanted to take me alive he would not fire I chanced it No I tried to draw myself beneath the window An automatic projector was on the floor where Carter had dropped it I pulled myself down Miko did not fire I reached the weapon The bodies of the Captain and Johnson had drifted together on the floor in the center of the room I hitched myself back to the window With upraised weapon I gazed cautiously out Miko had disappeared The deck within my line of vision was empty But was it Something told me to beware I clung to the casement ready upon the instant to shove myself down There was a movement in a shadow along the deck Then a figure rose up Don t fire Haljan The sharp command half appeal stopped the pressure of my finger It was the tall lanky Englishman Sir Arthur Coniston he as called himself So he too was one of Miko s band The light through a dome window fell full on him If you fire Haljan and kill me Miko will kill you then surely From where he had been crouching he could not command my window But now upon the heels of his placating words he abruptly shot The low powered ray had it struck would have felled me without killing me But it went over my head as I dropped Its aura made my senses reel Coniston shouted Haljan I did not answer I wonder if he would dare approach to see if I had been hit A minute passed Then another I thought I heard Miko s voice on the deck outside But it was an aerial microscopic whisper close beside me We see you Haljan You must yield Their eavesdropping vibrations with audible projection were upon me I retorted loudly Come and get me You cannot take me alive I do protest if this action of mine in the chart room may seem bravado I had no wish to die There was within me a very healthy desire for life But I felt by holding out that some chance might come wherewith I might turn events against these brigands Yet reason told me it was hopeless Our loyal members of the crew were killed no doubt Captain Carter and Balch were dead The lookouts and course masters also And Blackstone There remained only doctor Frank and Snap Their fate I did not yet know And there was George Prince He perhaps would help me if he could But at best he was a dubious ally You are very foolish Haljan murmured Miko s voice And then I heard Coniston See here why would not a hundred pounds of gold leaf tempt you The code words which were taken from Johnson I mean to say why not tell us where they are So that was one of the brigands new difficulties Snap had taken the code word sheet that time we sealed the purser in the cage I said You ll never find them And when a police ship sights us what will you do then The chances of a police ship were slight indeed but the brigands evidently did not know that I wondered again what had become of Snap Was he captured or still holding them off I was watching my windows for at any moment under the cover of talk I might be assailed Gravity came suddenly to the room Miko s voice said We mean well by you Haljan There is your normality Join us We need you to chart our course And a hundred pounds of gold leaf urged Coniston Or more Why this treasure I could hear an oath from Miko And then his ironic voice We will not bother you Haljan There is no hurry You will be hungry in good time And sleepy Then we will come and get you And a little acid will help you to think differently about us His vibrations died away The pull of gravity in the room was normal I was alone in the dim silence with the bodies of Carter and Johnson huddled on the grid I bent to examine them Both were dead My isolation was not ruse this time The outlaws made no further attack Half an hour passed The deck outside what I could see of it was vacant Balch lay dead close outside the chart room door The bodies of Blackstone and the course master had been removed from the turret window As a forward lookout one of Miko s men was on duty in the nearby tower Hahn was at the turret s controls The ship was under orderly handling heading back upon a new course For the Earth The Moon It did not seem so I found in the chart room a Benson curve light projector which poor Captain Carter had nearly assembled I worked on it trained it through my rear window along the empty deck bent it into the lounge archway Upon my grid the image of the lounge interior presently focused The passengers in the lounge were huddled in a group Disheveled frightened with Moa standing watching them Stewards were serving them with a meal Upon a bench bodies were lying Some were dead I saw Rance Rankin Others were evidently only injured doctor Frank was moving among them attending them Venza was there unharmed And I saw the gamblers Shac and Dud sitting white faced whispering together And Glutz s little beribboned becurled figure on a stool George Prince was there standing against the wall shrouded in his mourning cloak watching the scene with alert roving eyes And by the opposite doorway the huge towering figure of Miko stood on guard But Snap was missing A brief glimpse Miko saw my Benson light I could have equipped a heat ray and fired along the curved Benson light into that lounge But Miko gave me no time He slid the lounge door closed and Moa leaped to close the one on my side My grid showed only the blank deck and door Another interval I had made plans Futile plans I could get into the turret perhaps and kill Hahn I had the invisible cloak which Johnson was wearing I took it from his body Its mechanism could be repaired Why with it I could creep about the ship kill these brigands one by one perhaps George Prince would be with me The brigands who had been posing as the stewards and crew members were unable to navigate they would obey my orders There were only Miko Coniston and Hahn to kill From my window I could gaze up to the radio room And now abruptly I heard Snap s voice No I tell you no And Miko Very well then We ll try this So Snap was captured but not killed Relief swept me He was in the radio room and Miko was with him But my relief was short lived After a brief interval there came a moan from Snap It floated down the silence overhead and made me shudder My Benson beam shot into the radio room It showed me Snap lying there on the floor He was bound with wire His torso had been stripped His livid face was ghastly plain in my light Miko was bending over him Miko with a heat cylinder no longer than a finger Its needle beam played upon Snap s naked chest I could see the gruesome little trail of smoke rising and as Snap twisted and jerked there on his flesh was the red and blistered trail of the violet ray Now will you tell No Miko laughed No Then I shall write my name a little deeper A black sear now a trail etched in the quivering flesh Oh Snap s face went white as chalk as he pressed his lips together Or a little acid This fire writing does not really hurt Tell me what you did with those code words No In his absorption Miko did not notice my light Nor did I have the wit to try and fire along it I was trembling Snap under torture As the beam went deeper Snap suddenly screamed But he ended No I will send no message for you It had been only a moment In the chart room window beside me again a figure appeared No image A solid living person undisguised by any cloak of invisibility George Prince had chanced my fire and crept upon me Haljan Don t attack me I dropped my light connections As impulsively I stood up I saw through the window the figure of Coniston on the deck watching the result of Prince s venture Haljan yield Prince no more than whispered it He stood outside on the deck the low window casement touched his waist He leaned over it He s torturing Snap Call out that you will yield The thought had already been in my mind Another scream from Snap filled me with horror I shouted Miko Stop I rushed to the window and Prince gripped me Louder I called louder Miko Stop My upflung voice mingled with Snap s agony of protest Then Miko heard me His head and shoulders showed up there at the radio room oval You Haljan Prince shouted I have made him yield He will obey you if you stop that torture I think that poor Snap must have fainted He was silent I called Stop I will do what you command Miko jeered That is good A bargain if you and Dean obey me Disarm him Prince and bring him out Miko moved back into the radio room On the deck Coniston was advancing but cautiously mistrustful of me Gregg George Prince flung a leg over the casement and leaped lightly into the dim chart room His small slender figure stood beside me clung to me A moment while we stood there together No ray was upon us Coniston could not see us nor could he hear our whispers Gregg A different voice its throaty husky quality gone A soft pleading Gregg Gregg don t you know me Gregg dear Why what was this Not George Prince A masquerader yet so like George Prince Gregg don t you know me Clinging to me A soft touch upon my arm Fingers clinging A surge of warm tingling current was flowing between us My sweep of instant thoughts A speck of human Earth dust falling free That was George Prince who had been killed George Prince s body disguised by the scheming Carter and doctor Frank buried in the guise of his sister And this black robed figure who was trying to help me Anita Anita darling Gregg dear one Anita My arms went around her my lips pressed hers and felt her tremulous eager answer The form of Coniston showed at our window She cast me off She said with her throaty swagger of amused masculinity I have him Sir Arthur He will obey us I sensed her warning glance She shoved me toward the window She said ironically Have no fear Haljan You will not be tortured you and Dean if you obey our commands Coniston gripped me You fool You caused us a lot of trouble Move along there He jerked me roughly through the window Marched me the length of the deck out to the stern space opened the door of my cubby flung me in and sealed the door upon me Miko will come presently I stood in the darkness of my tiny room listening to his retreating footsteps But my mind was not upon him All the universe in that instant had changed for me Anita was alive XIV The giant Miko stood confronting me He slid my cubby door closed behind him He stood with his head towering close against my ceiling His cloak was discarded In his leather clothes and with his clanking sword ornament his aspect carried the swagger of a brigand of old He was bare headed the light from one of my tubes fell upon his grinning leering gray face So Gregg Haljan You have come to your senses at last You do not wish me to write my name on your chest I would not have done that to Dean he forced me Sit back I had been on my bunk I sank back at the gesture of his huge hairy arm His forearm was bare now the sear of a burn on it was plain to be seen He remarked my gaze True You did that Haljan in Greater New York But I bear you no malice I want to talk to you now He cast about for a seat and took the little stool which stood by my desk His hand held a small cylinder of the Martian paralyzing ray He rested it beside him on the desk Now we can talk I remained silent Alert Yet my thoughts were whirling Anita was alive Masquerading as her brother And with the joy of it came a shudder Above everything Miko must not know A great adventure we are upon Haljan My thoughts came back Miko was talking with an assumption of friendly comradeship All is well and we need you as I have said before I am no fool I have been aware of everything that went on aboard this ship You of all the officers are most clever at the routine mathematics Is that so Perhaps You are modest He fumbled at a pocket of his jacket produced a scroll sheaf I recognized it Blackstone s figures The calculation Blackstone made of the asteroid we had passed I am interested in these Miko went on I want you to verify them And this He held up another scroll This is the calculation of our present position and our course Hahn claims he is a navigator We have set the ship s gravity plates see like this He handed me the scrolls He watched me keenly as I glanced over them Well I said You are sparing of words Haljan By the devils of the airways I could make you talk But I want to be friendly I handed him back the scrolls I stood up I was almost within reach of his weapon but with a sweep of his great arm he knocked me back to my bunk You dare Then he smiled Let us not come to blows In truth physical violence could get me nothing I would have to try guile And I saw now that his face was flushed and his eyes unnaturally bright He had been drinking alcolite not enough to befuddle him but enough to make him triumphantly talkative Hahn may not be much of a mathematician I suggested But there is your Sir Arthur Coniston I managed a sarcastic grin Is that his name Almost Haljan will you verify these figures Yes But why Where are we going He laughed You are afraid I will not tell you Why should I This great adventure of mine is progressing perfectly A tremendous stake Haljan A hundred million dollars in gold leaf There will be fabulous riches for all of us But where are we going To that asteroid he said I must get rid of these passengers I am no murderer With a half dozen killings in the recent fight this was hardly convincing But he was obviously wholly serious He seemed to read my thoughts I kill only when necessary We will land upon the asteroid A perfect place to maroon the passengers Is it not so I will give them the necessities of life They will be able to signal And in a month or so when we are perfectly safe and finished with our adventure a police ship no doubt will rescue them And then from the asteroid I suggested we are going To the Moon Haljan What a clever guesser you are Coniston and Hahn are calculating our course But I have no great confidence in them And so I want you You have me Yes I have you I would have killed you long ago I am an impulsive fellow but my sister restrained me He gazed at me slyly Moa seems strangely to like you Haljan Thanks I said I m flattered She still hopes I may really win you to join us he went on Gold leaf is a wonderful thing there would be plenty for you in this affair And to be rich and have the love of a woman like Moa He paused I was trying cautiously to gauge him to get from him all the information I could I said with another smile That is premature to talk of Moa I will help you chart your course But this venture as you call it is dangerous A police ship There are not many he declared The chances of our encountering one are very slim He grinned at me You know that as well as I do And we now have those code passwords I forced Dean to tell me where he had hidden them If we should be challenged our password answer will relieve suspicion The Planetara I objected being overdue at Ferrok Shahn will cause alarm You ll have a covey of patrol ships after you That will be two weeks from now he smiled I have a ship of my own in Ferrok Shahn It lies there waiting now manned and armed I am hoping that with Dean s help we may be able to flash them a signal It will join us on the Moon Fear not for the danger Haljan I have great interests allied with me in this thing Plenty of money We have planned carefully He was idly fingering his cylinder he gazed at me as I sat docile on my bunk Did you think George Prince was a leader of this A mere boy I engaged him a year ago his knowledge of science is valuable to us My heart was pounding but I strove not to show it He went on calmly I told you I am impulsive Half a dozen times I have nearly killed George Prince and he knows it He frowned I wish I had killed him instead of his sister That was an error There was a note of real concern in his voice He added That is done nothing can change it George Prince is helpful to me Your friend Dean is another I had trouble with him but he is docile now I said abruptly I don t know whether your promise means anything or not Miko But Prince said you would use no more torture I won t Not if you and Dean obey me You tell Dean I have agreed to that You say he gave you the code words he took from Johnson Yes There was a fool for you That Johnson You blame me Haljan for the death of Carter You need not Johnson offered to try and capture you take you both alive He killed Carter because he was angry with him A stupid vengeful fool He is dead and I m glad of it My mind was on Miko s plans I ventured This treasure on the Moon did you say it was on the Moon Don t play the fool he retorted I know as much about Grantline as you do That s very little Perhaps Perhaps you know more Miko The Moon is a big place Where for instance is Grantline located I held my breath Would he tell me that A score of questions vague plans were in my mind How skilled at mathematics were these brigands Miko Coniston Hahn could I fool them If I could learn Grantline s location on the Moon and keep the Planetara away from it A pretended error of charting Time lost and perhaps Snap could find an opportunity to signal Earth get help Miko answered my question as bluntly as I asked it I don t know where Grantline is located But we will find out He will not suspect the Planetara so when we get close to the Moon we will signal and ask him We can trick him into telling us You think I do not know what is on your mind Haljan There is a secret code of signals arranged between Dean and Grantline I have forced Dean to confess it Without torture Prince helped me in that He persuaded Dean not to defy me A very persuasive fellow George Prince More diplomatic than I am I give him credit for that I strove to hold my voice calm If I should join you Miko my word if I ever gave it you would find dependable I would say George Prince is very valuable to us You should rein your temper He is half your size you might some time without intention do him injury He laughed Moa says so But have no fear I was thinking I persisted I d like to have a talk with George Prince Ah my pounding tumultuous heart But I was smiling calmly And I tried to put into my voice a shrewd note of cupidity I really know very little about this treasure Miko If there were a million or two of gold leaf in it for me Perhaps there would be Suppose you let me have a talk with Prince I have some scientific knowledge myself about the powers of this catalyst Prince s knowledge and mine we might be able to come to a calculation on the value of Grantline s treasure You don t know You are only assuming I paused after this glib outburst Whatever may have been in Miko s mind I cannot say But abruptly he stood up I had left my bunk but he waved me back Sit down I am not like Moa I would not trust you just because you protested you would be loyal He picked up his cylinder We will talk again He gestured to the scrolls he had left upon my desk Work on those I will judge you by the results He was no fool this brigand leader Yes I agreed You want a true course to the asteroid Yes And by the gods I warn you I can check up on you I said meekly Very well But you ask Prince if he wants my calculations on Grantline s possibilities I shot Miko a foxy look as he stood by the door I added You think you are clever There is plenty you don t know Our first night out from Earth Grantline s signals didn t it ever occur to you that I might have some figures on his treasure It startled him Where are they I tapped my forehead You don t suppose I was foolish enough to record them You ask Prince if he wants to talk to me A hundred million or two hundred million it would make a big difference Miko I will think about it He backed out and sealed the door upon me But Anita did not come I verified Hahn s figures which were very nearly correct I charted a course for the asteroid it was almost the one which had been set Coniston came for my results I say we are not so bad as navigators are we I think we re jolly good considering our inexperience Not bad at all eh No I did not think it wise to ask him about Prince Are you hungry Haljan Yes A steward came with a meal The saturnine Hahn stood at my door with a weapon upon me while I ate They were taking no chances and they were wise not to The day passed Day and night all the same of aspect here in the starry vault of space But with the ship s routine it was day And then another time of sleep I slept fitfully worrying trying to plan Within a few hours we would be nearing the asteroid The time of sleep was nearly passed My chronometer marked five A M original Earth starting time The seal of my cubby door hissed The door slowly opened Anita She stood there with her cloak around her A distance away on the shadowed deck Coniston was loitering Anita I whispered it Gregg dear She turned and gestured to the watching brigand I will not be long Coniston She came in and half closed the door upon us leaving it open enough so that we could make sure that Coniston did not advance I stepped back where he could not see us Anita She flung herself into my opened arms XV A moment when beyond the thought of the nearby brigand or the possibility of an eavesdropping ray trained now upon my cubby a moment while Anita and I held each other and whispered those things which could mean nothing to the world but which were all the world to us Then it was she whose wits brought us back from the shining fairyland of our love into the sinister reality of the Planetara Gregg if they are listening I pushed her away This brave little masquerader Not for my life or for all the lives on the ship would I consciously have endangered her But Grantline s findings I said aloud In his message see here Prince Coniston was too far away on the deck to hear us Anita went to my door again and waved at him reassuringly I put my ear to the door opening and listened at the space across the grid of the ventilator over my bunk The hum of a vibration would have been audible at those two points But there was nothing It s all right I whispered and she clung to me so small beside me With the black robe thrown aside it seemed that I could not miss the curves of her woman s figure A dangerous game she was playing Her hair had been cut short to the base of her neck in the fashion of her dead brother Her eyelashes had been clipped the line of her brows altered And now in the light of my tube as it shone upon her earnest face I could remark other changes Glutz the little beauty specialist was in this secret With plastic skill he had altered the set of her jaw put masculinity here She was whispering It was was poor George whom Miko shot I had now the true version of what had occurred Miko had been forcing his wooing upon Anita George Prince was a weakling whose only good quality was his love for his sister Some years ago he had fallen into evil ways Been arrested and then been discharged from his position with the Federated Corporation He had taken up with evil companions in Greater New York Mostly Martians And Miko had met him His technical knowledge his training with the Federated Corporation made him valuable to Miko s enterprise And so Prince had joined the brigands Of all this Anita had been unaware She had never liked Miko Feared him But it seemed that the Martian had some hold upon her brother which puzzled and frightened Anita Then Miko had fallen in love with her George had not liked it And that night on the Planetara Miko had come and knocked upon Anita s door and incautiously she had opened it He forced himself in And when she repulsed him struggled with him George had been awakened She was whispering to me now My room was dark We were all three struggling George was holding me the shot came and I screamed And Miko had fled not knowing whom his shot had hit in the darkness And when George died Captain Carter wanted me to impersonate him We planned it with doctor Frank to try and learn what Miko and the others were doing because I didn t know that poor George had fallen into such evil ways She whispered But I love you Gregg I want to be the first to say it I love you I love you We had the sanity to try and plan Anita tell Miko we discussed the multiple powers of the catalyst Discussed how carefully it would have to be transported how to gauge its worth You ll have to be careful clever Don t say too much Tell him we estimate the value at about a hundred and thirty millions I repeated what Miko had told me of his plans She knew all that And Snap knew it She had a few moments alone with Snap and gave me now a message from him We ll pull out of this Gregg With Snap she had worked out a plan There were Snap and I and Shac and Dud Ardley upon whom we could doubtless depend And doctor Frank Against us were Miko and his sister and Coniston and Hahn Of course there were the members of the crew But we were numerically the stronger when it came to true leadership Unarmed and guarded now But if we could break loose recapture the ship I sat listening to Anita s eager whispers It seemed feasible Miko did not altogether trust George Prince Anita was now unarmed But I can make opportunity I can get one of their ray cylinders and an invisible cloak equipment That cloak that had been hidden in Miko s room when Carter searched for it in Atwenty was now in the chart room by Johnson s body It had been repaired now Anita thought she could get possession of it We worked out the details of the plan Anita would arm herself and come and release me Together with a paralyzing ray we could creep about the ship overcome these brigands one by one There were so few of the leaders With them felled and with us in control of the turret and the radio room we could force the crew to stay at their posts There were Anita said no navigators among Miko s crew They would not dare oppose us But it should be done at once Anita In a few hours we will be at the asteroid Yes I will go now and try to get the weapons Where is Snap Still in the radio room One of the crew guards him Coniston was roaming the ship He was still loitering on the deck watching my door Hahn was in the turret The morning watch of the crew were at their posts in the hull corridors The stewards were preparing a morning meal There were nine members of subordinates altogether Anita had calculated Six of them were in Miko s pay The other three our own men who had not been killed in the fighting had joined the brigands And doctor Frank Anita He was in the lounge All the passengers were herded there with Miko and Moa alternating on guard I will arrange it with Venza Anita whispered swiftly She will tell the others doctor Frank knows about it now He thinks it can be done The possibility of it swept me anew The brigands were of necessity scattered singly about the ship One by one creeping under cover of an invisible cloak I could fell them and replace them without alarming others My thoughts leaped to it We would strike down the guard in the radio room Release Snap At the turret we could assail Hahn and replace him with Snap Coniston s voice outside broke in upon us Prince He was coming forward Anita stood in the doorway I have the figures Coniston By God this Haljan is with us And clever We think it will total a hundred and thirty millions What a stake She whispered Gregg dear I ll be back soon We can do it be ready Anita be careful of yourself If they should suspect you I ll be careful In an hour Gregg or less I ll come back All right Coniston Where is Miko I want to see him Stay where you are Haljan In good time Miko will trust you with your liberty You ll be rich like all of us Never fear She swaggered out upon the deck waved at the brigand and banged my cubby door in my face I sat upon my bunk Waiting Would she come back Would she be successful XVI 
5181-2488-0000	train-other-500	She came I suppose it was no more than an hour It seemed an eternity of apprehension There was the slight hissing of the seal of my door The panel slid I had leaped from my bunk where in the darkness I was lying tense Prince
5181-2488-0001	train-other-500	I did not dare say Anita Gregg Her voice My gaze swept the deck as the panel opened Neither Coniston nor anyone else was in sight save Anita s dark robed figure which came into my room You got it
5181-2488-0002	train-other-500	I asked in a low whisper I held her for an instant kissed her But she pushed me away with quick hands She was breathless Yes I have it Give us a little light we must hurry In the blue dimness I saw that she was holding one of the Martian cylinders The smaller size
5181-2488-0003	train-other-500	it would paralyze but not kill Only one Anita Yes
none	none	 And this The invisible cloak 
5181-2488-0004	train-other-500	We laid it on my grid and I adjusted its mechanism I donned it and drew its hood and threw on its current All right Anita Yes Can you see me No
none	none	 She had stepped back a foot or two Not from here But you must let no one approach too close 
5181-2488-0005	train-other-500	Then she came forward put out her hand fumbled until she found me It was our plan to have me follow her out Anyone observing us
none	none	 would see only the robed figure of the supposed George Prince 
5181-2488-0006	train-other-500	and I would escape unnoticed The situation about the ship was almost unchanged Anita had secured the weapon and the cloak and slipped away to my cubby without being observed You re sure of that I think so Gregg I was careful
5181-2488-0007	train-other-500	Moa was now in the lounge guarding the passengers Hahn was asleep in the chart room Coniston was in the turret Coniston would be off duty presently Anita said with Hahn taking his place
5181-2488-0008	train-other-500	There were lookouts in the forward and stern watch towers and a guard upon Snap in the radio room Is he inside the room Anita Snap Yes No the guard The guard was sitting on the spider bridge at the door This was unfortunate
5181-2488-0009	train-other-500	That guard could see all the deck clearly
none	none	 He might be suspicious of George Prince wandering around it would be difficult to get near enough to assail him 
5181-2488-0010	train-other-500	This cylinder I knew had an effective range of only some twenty feet Coniston is the sharpest Gregg He will be the hardest to get near
none	none	 Where is Miko 
5181-2488-0011	train-other-500	The brigand leader had gone below a few moments ago
none	none	 down into the hull corridor 
5181-2488-0012	train-other-500	Anita had seized the opportunity to come to me We can attack Hahn in the chart room first I whispered And get the other weapons Are they still there Yes But the forward deck is very bright Gregg We were approaching the asteroid
5181-2488-0013	train-other-500	Already its light like a brilliant moon was brightening the forward deck space It made me realize how much haste was necessary
none	none	 We decided to go down into the hull corridors Locate Miko Fell him 
5181-2488-0014	train-other-500	and hide him His nonappearance back on deck would very soon throw the others into confusion especially now with our impending landing upon the asteroid And under cover of this confusion we would try to release Snap We were ready
5181-2488-0015	train-other-500	Anita slid my door open She stepped through with me soundlessly scurrying after her The empty silent deck was alternately dark with shadow patches and bright with blobs of starlight
none	none	 A sheen of the Sun s corona was mingled with it and from forward 
5181-2488-0016	train-other-500	came the radiance of the asteroid s mellow silver glow Anita turned to seal my door within my faintly humming cloak I stood beside her Was I invisible in this light Almost directly over us close under the dome
5181-2488-0017	train-other-500	the lookout sat in his little tower He gazed down at Anita Amidships high over the cabin superstructure the radio room hung dark and silent The guard on its bridge was visible He too looked down A tense instant
5181-2488-0018	train-other-500	Then I breathed again There was no alarm The two guards answered Anita s gesture Anita said aloud into my empty cubby
none	none	 Miko will come for you presently Haljan 
5181-2488-0019	train-other-500	He told me that he wants you at the turret controls to land us on the asteroid She finished sealing my door and turned away started forward along the deck I followed My steps were soundless in my elastic bottomed shoes Anita swaggered with a noisy tread
5181-2488-0020	train-other-500	Near the door of the smoking room a small incline passage led downward We went into it The passage was dimly blue lit We descended its length came to the main corridor which ran the length of the hull
5181-2488-0021	train-other-500	A vaulted metal passage with doors to the control rooms opening from it Dim lights showed at intervals The humming of the ship was more apparent here It drowned the light humming of my cloak I crept after Anita my hand under the cloak
5181-2488-0022	train-other-500	clutched the ray weapon A steward passed us I shrank aside to avoid him Anita spoke to him
none	none	 Where is Miko Ellis 
5181-2488-0023	train-other-500	In the ventilator room Miss Prince There was difficulty with the air renewal Anita nodded and moved on
none	none	 I could have felled that steward as he passed me Oh if I only had 
5181-2488-0024	train-other-500	how different things might have been But it seemed needless I let him go and he turned into a nearby door which led to the galley Anita moved forward If we could come upon Miko alone Abruptly she turned and whispered Gregg if other men are with him
5181-2488-0025	train-other-500	I ll draw him away You watch your chance What little things can overthrow one s careful plans Anita had not realized how close to her I was following And her turning so unexpectedly caused me to collide with her sharply Oh She exclaimed it involuntarily
5181-2488-0026	train-other-500	Her outflung hand had unwittingly gripped my wrist caught the electrode there The touch burned her and short circuited my robe There was a hiss My current burned out the tiny fuses My invisibility was gone I stood a tall blackhooded figure
5181-2488-0027	train-other-500	revealed to the gaze of anyone who might be near The futile plans of humans We had planned so carefully Our calculations our hopes of what we could do came clattering now in a sudden wreckage around us Anita Run
5181-2488-0028	train-other-500	If I were seen with her then her own disguise would probably be discovered That above everything would be disaster Anita get away from me I must try it alone I could hide somewhere repair the cloak perhaps Or since now I was armed
none	none	 why could not I boldly start an assault Gregg we must get you back to your cubby 
5181-2488-0029	train-other-500	She was clinging to me in panic No You run Get away from me Don t you understand George Prince has no business here with me They ll kill you Gregg let s get back to the deck I pushed at her both of us in confusion From behind me there came a shout
none	none	 That accursed steward 
5181-2488-0030	train-other-500	He had returned to investigate perhaps what George Prince was doing in this corridor He heard our voices His shout in the silence of the ship sounded horribly loud The white cloaked shape of him was in the nearby doorway He stood stricken with surprise at seeing me
5181-2488-0031	train-other-500	And then turned to run I fired my paralyzing cylinder through my cloak Got him He fell I shoved Anita violently Run Tell Miko to come tell him you heard a shout He won t suspect you But Gregg You mustn t be found out
5181-2488-0032	train-other-500	You re our only hope Anita I ll hide fix the cloak or get back to my cubby We ll try again It decided her She scurried down the corridor I whirled the other way The steward s shout might not have been heard Then realization flashed to me
5181-2488-0033	train-other-500	That steward would be revived He was one of Miko s men He would be revived and tell what he had seen and heard Anita s disguise would be revealed A cold blooded killing I do protest went against me But it was necessary
5181-2488-0034	train-other-500	I flung myself upon him I beat his skull with the metal of my cylinder I stood up My hood had fallen back from my head
none	none	 I wiped my bloody hands on my useless cloak I had smashed the cylinder 
5181-2488-0035	train-other-500	Haljan Anita s voice A sharp note of horror and warning I became aware that in the corridor forty feet down its dim length
none	none	 Miko had appeared with Anita behind him 
5181-2488-0036	train-other-500	His bullet projector was leveled It spat at me
none	none	 But Anita had pulled at his arm The explosive report 
5181-2488-0037	train-other-500	was sharply deafening in the confined space of the corridor With a spurt of flame the leaden pellet struck over my head against the vaulted ceiling
none	none	 Miko was struggling with Anita Prince you idiot Miko it s Haljan Don t kill him 
5181-2488-0038	train-other-500	The turmoil brought members of the crew From the shadowed oval near me they came running I flung the useless cylinder at them But I was trapped in the narrow passage I might have fought my way out
none	none	 Or Miko might have shot me But there was the danger that in her horror 
5181-2488-0039	train-other-500	Anita would betray herself I backed against the wall Don t kill me
none	none	 See I will not fight 
5181-2488-0040	train-other-500	I flung up my arms And the crew emboldened and courageous under Miko s gaze leaped on me and bore me down
none	none	 The futile plans of humans Anita and I had planned so carefully And in a few brief minutes of action it had come only to this XVII 
5181-2489-0000	train-other-500	So Gregg Haljan you are not as loyal as you pretend
none	none	 Miko was livid with suppressed anger 
5181-2489-0001	train-other-500	They had stripped the cloak from me and flung me back in my cubby
none	none	 Miko was now confronting me at the door Moa stood watching 
5181-2489-0002	train-other-500	And Anita was behind her I sat outwardly defiant and sullen on my bunk But I was tense and alert
none	none	 fearful still of what Anita s emotion might betray her into doing 
5181-2489-0003	train-other-500	Not so loyal Miko repeated And a fool How did he get out of here Prince you came in here My heart was wildly thumping But Anita retorted with a touch of spirit I came to tell him what you commanded
5181-2489-0004	train-other-500	To check Hahn s latest figures and to be ready to take the controls when we approached the asteroid Well how did he get out How should I know she parried Little actress Her spirit helped to allay my fear She held her cloak close around her in the fashion
5181-2489-0005	train-other-500	they had come to expect from the George Prince who had just buried his sister How should I know Miko I sealed his door But did you Of course he did Moa put in Ask your lookouts Anita said They saw me I waved to them just as I sealed the door
5181-2489-0006	train-other-500	I ventured I have been taught to open doors I managed a sly lugubrious smile I shall not try it again Miko Nothing had been said about my killing of the steward I thanked my constellations now that he was dead I shall not try it again
5181-2489-0007	train-other-500	I repeated A glance passed between Miko and his sister Miko said abruptly You seem to realize it is not my purpose to kill you And you presume upon it I shall not again I eyed Moa
5181-2489-0008	train-other-500	She was gazing at me steadily She said Leave me with him Miko She smiled Gregg Haljan we are no more than twenty thousand miles from the asteroid now The calculations for retarding are now in operation
none	none	 It was what had taken Miko below 
5181-2489-0009	train-other-500	that and trouble with the ventilating system which was soon rectified But the retarding of the ship s velocity when nearing a destination required accurate manipulation These brigands were fearful of their own skill That was obvious It gave me confidence I was really needed
5181-2489-0010	train-other-500	They would not harm me Except for Miko s impulsive temper I was in no danger from them not now certainly Moa was saying I think I may make you understand Gregg We have tremendous riches within our grasp I know it I said
none	none	 with sudden thought But there are many with whom to divide this treasure 
5181-2489-0011	train-other-500	Miko caught my intended implication
none	none	 By the infernal this fellow may have thought he could seize this treasure for himself 
5181-2489-0012	train-other-500	Because he is a navigator Moa said vehemently
none	none	 Do not be an idiot Gregg You could not do it 
5181-2489-0013	train-other-500	There will be fighting with Grantline My purpose was accomplished They seemed to see me a willing outlaw like themselves As though it were a bond between us
none	none	 Leave me with him said Moa Miko acquiesced For a few minutes only 
5181-2489-0014	train-other-500	He proffered a heat ray cylinder but she refused it I am not afraid of him Miko swung on me Within an hour we will be nearing the atmosphere Will you take the controls Yes He set his heavy jaw His eyes bored into me
5181-2489-0015	train-other-500	You re a strange fellow Haljan I can t make you out
none	none	 I am not angry now 
5181-2489-0016	train-other-500	Do you think when I am deadly serious that I mean what I say His calm words set a sudden chill over me I checked my smile Yes I said Well then I will tell you this
5181-2489-0017	train-other-500	not for all of Prince s well meaning interference or Moa s liking for you or my own need of your skill will I tolerate more trouble from you The next time
none	none	 I will kill you Do you 
5181-2489-0018	train-other-500	believe me Yes That is all I want to say You kill my men and my sister says I must not hurt you I am not a child to be ruled by a woman He held his huge fist before my face With these fingers
none	none	 I will twist your neck Do you believe it 
5181-2489-0019	train-other-500	Yes I did indeed He swung on his heel Moa wants to try and put sense in your head I hope she does it Bring him to the lounge when you have finished Come Prince Hahn will need us He chuckled grimly Hahn seems to fear
5181-2489-0020	train-other-500	we will plunge into this asteroid like a wild comet gone suddenly tangent Anita moved aside to let him through the door I caught a glimpse of her set white face as she followed him down the deck
none	none	 Then Moa s bulk 
5181-2489-0021	train-other-500	blocked the doorway She faced me Sit where you are Gregg She turned and closed the door upon us I am not afraid of you Should I be No She came and sat down beside me If you should attempt to leave this room
none	none	 the stern lookout has orders to bore you through 
5181-2489-0022	train-other-500	I have no intention of leaving this room I retorted I do not want to commit suicide I thought you did You seem minded in such a fashion
none	none	 Gregg why are you so heedless 
5181-2489-0023	train-other-500	I said carefully This treasure you are many who will divide it You have all these men on the Planetara And in Ferrok Shahn others I paused Would she tell me Could I make her talk of that other brigand ship which Miko had said was waiting on Mars
5181-2489-0024	train-other-500	I wondered if he had been able to signal it The distance from here to Mars was great yet upon other voyages Snap s signals had gotten through My heart sank at the thought Our situation here was desperate enough
none	none	 The passengers soon would be cast upon the asteroid 
5181-2489-0025	train-other-500	there would be left only Snap Anita and myself We might recapture the ship but I doubted it now My thoughts were turning to our arrival on the Moon
none	none	 We three might perhaps be able to thwart the attack upon Grantline hold the brigands off until help from the Earth might come 
5181-2489-0026	train-other-500	But with another brigand ship fully manned and armed coming from Mars the condition would be immeasurably worse Grantline had some twenty men and his camp I knew would be reasonably fortified I knew too
5181-2489-0027	train-other-500	that Johnny Grantline would fight to his last man Moa was saying I would like to tell you our plans Gregg Her gaze was on my face Keen eyes but they were luminous now an emotion in them sweeping her But outwardly she was calm
5181-2489-0028	train-other-500	Well why don t you tell me I said If I am to help Gregg I want you with us
none	none	 Don t you understand And we are not many really 
5181-2489-0029	train-other-500	My brother and I are guiding this affair With your help I would feel differently The ship at Ferrok Shahn My fears were realized She said I think our signals reached it Dean tried and Coniston was checking him You think the ship is coming Yes Where will it join us
5181-2489-0030	train-other-500	At the Moon We will be there in thirty hours Your figures gave that did they not Yes I said And the other ship how fast is it Quite fast In eight days perhaps nine it will reach the Moon She seemed willing enough to talk There was indeed no reason why she shouldn t
none	none	 I could not she naturally felt 
5181-2489-0031	train-other-500	turn the knowledge to account Certainly my position seemed desperately helpless Manned I prompted About forty men And armed Long range projectors You ask very avid questions Gregg Why should I not Don t you suppose I m interested
5181-2489-0032	train-other-500	I touched her Moa did it ever occur to you
none	none	 if once you and Miko trusted me which you don t 
5181-2489-0033	train-other-500	I might show more interest in joining you The look on her face emboldened me
none	none	 Did you ever think of that Moa 
5181-2489-0034	train-other-500	And some arrangement for my share of this treasure
none	none	 I am not like Johnson to be hired for a hundred pounds of gold leaf 
5181-2489-0035	train-other-500	Gregg I will see that you get your share Riches for you and me I was thinking Moa when we land at the Moon tomorrow where is our equipment The Moon with its lack of atmosphere needed special equipment I had never heard Captain Carter mention
5181-2489-0036	train-other-500	what apparatus the Planetara was carrying Moa laughed We have located air suits and helmets a variety of suitable apparatus Gregg But we were not foolish enough to leave Greater New York on this voyage without our own apparatus My brother and Coniston and Prince all of us
5181-2489-0037	train-other-500	snipped crates of freight consigned to Ferrok Shahn and Rankin had special baggage marked theatrical apparatus I understood it now These brigands had boarded the Planetara with their own Moon equipment disguised as freight and personal baggage
none	none	 Shipped in bond to be inspected by the tax officials of Mars It is on board now We will open it when we leave the asteroid Gregg 
5181-2489-0038	train-other-500	We are well equipped She bent toward me And suddenly her long lean fingers were gripping my shoulders Gregg look at me I gazed into her eyes There was passion there and her voice was intense Gregg I told you once a Martian girl goes after what she wants
5181-2489-0039	train-other-500	It is you I want Not for me to play upon a woman s emotions Moa you flatter me I love you She held me off gazing at me Gregg I must have smiled Abruptly she released me So you think it amusing No But
5181-2489-0040	train-other-500	on Earth We are not on Earth Nor am I of the Earth She was gauging me keenly No note of pleading was in her voice a stern authority and the passion was swinging to anger I am like my brother I do not understand you Gregg Haljan Perhaps
none	none	 you think you are clever Perhaps There was a moment of silence 
5181-2489-0041	train-other-500	Gregg I said I loved you Have you no answer No
none	none	 In truth I did not know what sort of answer it would be best to make 
5181-2489-0042	train-other-500	Whatever she must have read in my eyes it stirred her to fury Her fingers with the strength of a man in them dug into my shoulders Her gaze searched me You think you love someone else Is that it That was horribly startling
5181-2489-0043	train-other-500	but she did not mean it just that way She amended with caustic venom That little Anita Prince
none	none	 You thought you loved her Was that it No 
5181-2489-0044	train-other-500	But I hardly deceived her Sacred to her memory Her ratlike little face soft voice like a purring sniveling cat Is that what you re remembering Gregg Haljan I tried to laugh What nonsense Is it
none	none	 Then why are you cold under my touch 
5181-2489-0045	train-other-500	Am I a girl descended from the Martian flame workers impotent to awaken a man A woman scorned In all the universe there could be no more dangerous an enemy An incredible venom shot from her eyes That miserable mouselike creature
5181-2489-0046	train-other-500	Well for her that my brother killed her It struck me cold If Anita were unmasked beyond all the menace of Miko s wooing I knew that the venom of Moa s jealousy was a greater danger
none	none	 I said sharply Don t be simple Moa I shook off her grip You imagine too much 
5181-2489-0047	train-other-500	You forget that I am a man of Earth and you a girl of Mars Is that reason why we should not love No But our instincts are different Men of Earth are born to the chase I was smiling With thought of Anita s danger I could find it readily in my heart to dupe this Amazon
5181-2489-0048	train-other-500	Give me time Moa You
none	none	 attract me You lie Do you think so I gripped her arm with all the power of my fingers 
5181-2489-0049	train-other-500	It must have hurt her but she gave no sign her gaze clung to me steadily I don t know what to think Gregg Haljan I held my grip Think what you like Men of Earth have been known to kill the thing they love You want me to fear you Perhaps
5181-2489-0050	train-other-500	She smiled scornfully That is absurd I released her
none	none	 I said earnestly I want you to realize 
5181-2489-0051	train-other-500	that if you treat me fairly I can be of great advantage to this venture There will be fighting I am fearless Her venomous expression was softening I think that is true Gregg And you need my navigating skill Even now I should be in the turret I stood up
none	none	 I half expected she would stop me but she did not 
5181-2489-0052	train-other-500	I added Shall we go She stood beside me Her height brought her face level with mine I think you will cause no more trouble Gregg Of course not I am not wholly witless You have been
none	none	 Well that is over 
5181-2489-0053	train-other-500	I hesitated Then I added A man of Earth does not yield to love while there is work to do This treasure I think that of everything I said this last most convinced her She interrupted That I understand Her eyes were smoldering
5181-2489-0054	train-other-500	When it is over when we are rich then I will claim you Gregg She turned from me Are you ready Yes No I must get that sheet of Hahn s last figures Are they checked Yes I picked the sheet up from my desk
none	none	 Hahn is fairly accurate Moa 
5181-2489-0055	train-other-500	A fool nevertheless An apprehensive fool
none	none	 A comradeship seemed coming between us 
5181-2489-0056	train-other-500	It was my purpose to establish it Are we going to maroon doctor Frank with the passengers I asked Yes But he may be of use to us Moa shook her head decisively My brother has decided not
none	none	 We will be well rid of doctor Frank Are you ready Gregg Yes She opened the door Her gesture reassured the lookout who was alertly watching the stern watchtower I stepped out and followed her forward along the deck which now was bright with the radiance of the nearby asteroid XVIII A fair little world I had thought so before and I thought so now as I gazed at the asteroid hanging so close before our bow 
5181-2490-0000	train-other-500	A huge thin crescent with the Sun off to one side behind it A silver crescent tinged with red From this near vantage point all of the little globe s disc was visible The seas lay in gray patches The convexity of the disc was sharply defined
5181-2490-0001	train-other-500	So small a world Fair and beautiful shrouded with clouded areas
none	none	 Where is Miko 
5181-2490-0002	train-other-500	In the lounge Gregg Can we stop there Moa turned into the lounge archway Strange tense scene I saw Anita at once Her robed figure lurked in an inconspicuous corner her eyes were upon me as Moa and I entered
5181-2490-0003	train-other-500	but she did not move The thirty odd passengers were huddled in a group Solemn white faced men frightened women Some of them were sobbing One Earth woman a young widow sat holding her little girl and wailing with uncontrolled hysteria
5181-2490-0004	train-other-500	The child knew me As I appeared now with my gold laced white coat over my shoulders the little girl seemed to see in my uniform a mark of authority She left her mother and ran to me You please will you help us
none	none	 My Moms is crying 
5181-2490-0005	train-other-500	I sent her gently back But there came upon me then a compassion for these innocent passengers fated to have embarked on this ill fated voyage Herded here in this cabin with brigands like pirates of old guarding them
5181-2490-0006	train-other-500	Waiting now to be marooned on an uninhabited asteroid roaming in space A sense of responsibility swept me
none	none	 I swung upon Miko He stood with a nonchalant grace 
5181-2490-0007	train-other-500	lounging against the wall with a cylinder dangling in his hand He anticipated me and was the first to speak So Haljan
none	none	 she put some sense into your head 
5181-2490-0008	train-other-500	No more trouble Then get into the turret Moa stay there with him Send Hahn here Where is that ass Coniston We will be in the atmosphere shortly I said
none	none	 No more trouble from me Miko But these 
5181-2490-0009	train-other-500	passengers what preparation are you making for them on the asteroid He stared in surprise Then he laughed I am no murderer The crew is preparing food all we can spare And tools
none	none	 They can build themselves shelter they will be picked up in a few weeks 
5181-2490-0010	train-other-500	doctor Frank was here I caught his gaze but he did not speak On the lounge couches there still lay the five bodies Rankin who had been killed by Blackstone in the fight a man passenger killed a woman and a man wounded as well
5181-2490-0011	train-other-500	Miko added doctor Frank will take his medical supplies and will care for the wounded There are other bodies among the crew
none	none	 His gesture was deprecating 
5181-2490-0012	train-other-500	I have not buried them We will put them ashore easier that way
none	none	 The passengers were all eying me I said 
5181-2490-0013	train-other-500	You have nothing to fear I will guarantee you the best equipment we can spare
none	none	 I turned to Miko 
5181-2490-0014	train-other-500	You will give them apparatus with which to signal Yes Get to the turret I turned away with Moa after me Again the little girl ran forward Come speak to my Moms she is crying
none	none	 It was across the cabin from Miko Coniston had appeared from the deck it created a slight diversion He joined Miko 
5181-2490-0015	train-other-500	Wait I said to Moa She is afraid of you This is humanity I pushed Moa back I followed the child
none	none	 I had seen that Venza was sitting with the child s weeping mother 
5181-2490-0016	train-other-500	This was a ruse to get a word with me I stood before the terrified woman while the child clung to my legs I said gently
none	none	 Don t be so frightened 
5181-2490-0017	train-other-500	doctor Frank will take care of you There is no danger
none	none	 you will be safer on the asteroid than here on the ship 
5181-2490-0018	train-other-500	I leaned down and touched her shoulder There is no danger I was between Venza and the open cabin Venza whispered swiftly
none	none	 When we are landing Gregg 
5181-2490-0019	train-other-500	I want you to make a commotion anything just as the women go ashore Why Of course you will have food missus Francis Never mind details An instant just confusion Go Gregg don t speak now I raised the child You take care of Mother I kissed her
5181-2490-0020	train-other-500	From across the cabin Miko s sardonic voice made me turn Touching sentimentality Haljan Get to your post in the turret His rasping note of annoyance brooked no delay I set the child down I said
none	none	 I will land us in an hour 
5181-2490-0021	train-other-500	Depend on it Hahn was at the controls when Moa and I reached the turret You will land us safely Haljan he demanded anxiously I pushed him away Miko wants you in the lounge You take command here Yes
5181-2490-0022	train-other-500	I am no more anxious for a crash than you are Hahn He sighed with relief That is true of course I am no expert at atmospheric entry Have no fear
none	none	 Sit down Moa 
5181-2490-0023	train-other-500	I waved to the lookout in the forward watch tower and got his routine gesture I rang the corridor bells and the normal signals came promptly back I turned to Hahn Get along won t you
none	none	 Tell Miko that things are all right here 
5181-2490-0024	train-other-500	Hahn s small dark figure lithe as a leopard in his tight fitting trousers and jacket with his robe now discarded went swiftly down the spider incline and across the deck Moa where is Snap By the infernal if he has been injured
5181-2490-0025	train-other-500	Up on the radio room bridge the brigand guard still sat Then I saw that Snap was out there sitting with him I waved from the turret window and Snap s cheery gesture answered me His voice carried down through the silver moonlight Land us safely Gregg
5181-2490-0026	train-other-500	These weird amateur navigators Within the hour I had us dropping into the asteroid s atmosphere The ship heated steadily The pressure went up It kept me busy with the instruments and the calculations But my signals were always promptly answered from below
5181-2490-0027	train-other-500	The brigand crew did its part efficiently At a hundred and fifty thousand feet I shifted the gravity plates to the landing combinations and started the electronic engines All safe Gregg Moa sat at my elbow her eyes
none	none	 with what seem a glow of admiration in them followed my busy routine activities Yes The crew works well The electronic streams 
5181-2490-0028	train-other-500	flowed out like a rocket tail behind us The Planetara caught their impetus In the rarefied air our bow lifted slightly like a ship riding a gentle ground swell At a hundred thousand feet we sailed gently forward hull down to the asteroid s surface
5181-2490-0029	train-other-500	cruising to seek a landing space A little sea was now beneath us A shadowed sea deep purple in the night down there Occasional verdurous islands showed with the lines of white surf marking them Beyond the sea a curving coastline was visible
5181-2490-0030	train-other-500	Rocky headlines behind which mountain foothills rose in serrated verdurous ranks The sunlight edged the distant mountains and presently this rapidly turning little world brought the sunlight forward It was day beneath us We slid
5181-2490-0031	train-other-500	gently downward Thirty thousand feet now above a sparkling blue ocean The coastline was just ahead green with a lush tropical vegetation Giant trees huge leaved Long dangling vines air plants
5181-2490-0032	train-other-500	with giant pods and vivid orchidlike blossoms I sat at the turret window staring through my glasses A fair little world yet obviously uninhabited
none	none	 I could fancy that all this was newly sprung vegetation 
5181-2490-0033	train-other-500	This asteroid had whirled in from the cold of the interplanetary space
none	none	 far outside our solar system 
5181-2490-0034	train-other-500	A few years ago as time might be measured astronomically it was no more than yesterday this fair landscape was congealed white and bleak with a sweep of glacial ice But the seeds of life miraculously were here The miracle of life
5181-2490-0035	train-other-500	Under the warming germinating sunlight the verdure had sprung Can you find landing space Gregg
none	none	 Moa s question brought back my wandering fancies 
5181-2490-0036	train-other-500	I saw an upland glade a level spread of ferns with the forest banked around it A cliff height nearby frowning down at the sea Yes I can land us there I showed her through the glasses
5181-2490-0037	train-other-500	I rang the sirens and we spiraled descending further The mountain tops were now close beneath us Clouds were overhead white masses with blue sky behind them A day of brilliant sunlight But soon with our forward cruising it was night
5181-2490-0038	train-other-500	The sunlight dropped beneath the sharply convex horizon the sea and the land went purple A night of brilliant stars the Earth was a blazing blue red point of light The heavens visibly were revolving in an hour or so
5181-2490-0039	train-other-500	it would be daylight again On the forward deck now Coniston had appeared commanding half a dozen of the crew They were carrying up caskets of food and the equipment
none	none	 which was to be given the marooned passengers 
5181-2490-0040	train-other-500	And making ready the disembarking incline loosening the seals of the side dome windows
none	none	 Sternward on the deck by the lounge oval I could see Miko standing 
5181-2490-0041	train-other-500	And occasionally the roar of his voice at the passengers sounded
none	none	 My vagrant thoughts flung back into Earth s history Like this ancient travelers of the surface of the sea were herded by pirates to walk the plank or be put ashore 
5181-2490-0042	train-other-500	marooned upon some fair desert island of the tropic Spanish main Hahn came mounting our turret incline All is well Gregg Haljan Get to your work Moa told him sharply He retreated
5181-2490-0043	train-other-500	joining the bustle and confusion which now was beginning on the deck It struck me could I turn that confusion to account Would it be possible now at the last moment to attack these brigands Snap still sat outside the radio room doorway
5181-2490-0044	train-other-500	But his guard was alert with upraised projector And that guard I saw in his position commanded all the deck And I saw too
none	none	 as the passengers now were herded in a line from the lounge oval that Miko had roped and bound all of the men 
5181-2490-0045	train-other-500	a clanking chain connected them They came like a line of convicts marching forward and stopped on the open deck near the base of the turret doctor Frank s grim face gazed up at me
none	none	 Miko ordered the women and children in a group beside the chained men 
5181-2490-0046	train-other-500	His words to them reached me You are in no danger When we land be careful You will find gravity very different this is a very small world I flung on the landing lights the deck glowed with the blue radiance
5181-2490-0047	train-other-500	the searchbeams shot down beside our hull We hung now a thousand feet above the forest glade I cut off the electronic streams We poised with the gravity plates set at normal
none	none	 and only a gentle night breeze to give us a slight side drift This I could control with the lateral propeller rudders For all my busy landing routine my mind was on other things 
5181-2490-0048	train-other-500	Venza s swift words back there in the lounge I was to create a commotion while the passengers were landing Why Had she and doctor Frank some last minute desperate purposes I determined I would do what she said Shout or mis order the lights That would be easy
none	none	 I was glad it was night I had indeed calculated our descent so that the landing would be in darkness 
5181-2490-0049	train-other-500	But to what purpose These brigands were very alert There was nothing I could think of to do which would avail us anything more than a probable swift death under Miko s anger
none	none	 Well done Gregg said Moa I cut off the last of the propellers With scarcely a perceptible jar the Planetara grounded rose like a feather and settled to rest in the glade The deep purple night with stars overhead was around us I hissed out our interior air through the dome and hull ports and admitted the night air of the asteroid My calculations of necessity mere mathematical approximations proved fairly accurate In temperature and pressure there was no radical change as the dome windows slid back We had landed Whatever Venza s purpose her moment was at hand I was tense But I was aware also that beside me Moa was very alert I had thought her unarmed She was not She sat back from me in her hand was a long thin knife blade She murmured tensely You have done your part Gregg Well and skillfully done Now we will sit here quietly and watch them land Snap s guard was standing keenly watching The lookouts in the forward and stern towers were also armed I could see them both gazing keenly down at the confusion of the blue lit deck The incline went over the hull side and touched the ground Enough Miko roared The men first Hahn move the women back Coniston pile those caskets to the side Get out of the way Prince Anita was down there I saw her at the edge of the group of women Venza was near her Miko shoved her Get out of the way Prince You can help Coniston Have the things ready to throw off Five of the steward crew were at the head of the incline Miko shouted up at me Haljan hold our shipboard gravity normal Yes The line of men were first to descend doctor Frank led them He flashed a look of farewell up at me and Snap as he went down the incline with the chained men passengers after him Motley procession Twenty odd disheveled half clothed men of these worlds The changing lightening gravity on the incline caught them doctor Frank bounded up to the rail under the impetus of his step caught and held himself Drew himself back The line swayed In the dim blue lit glare it seemed unreal crazy A grotesque dream of men descending a plank They reached the forest glade Stood swaying afraid at first to move The purple night crowded them they stood gazing at this strange world their new prison Now the women Miko was shoving the women to the head of the incline I could feel Moa s gaze upon me Her knife gleamed in the turret light She murmured again In a few moments you can bring us away Gregg I felt like an actor awaiting his cue in the wings of some turgid drama the plot of which he did not know Venza was near the head of the incline Some of the women and children were on it A woman screamed Her child had slipped from her hand bounded up over the rail and fallen Hardly fallen floated down to the ground with flailing arms and legs landing in the dark ferns unharmed Its terrified wail came up There was a confusion on the incline Venza still on the deck seemed to send a look of appeal to the turret My cue I slid my hand to the light switchboard It was near my knees I pulled a switch The blue lit deck beneath the turret went dark I recall an instant of horrible tense silence and in the gloom beside me I was aware of Moa moving I felt a thrill of instinctive fear would she plunge that knife into me The silence of the darkened deck was broken with a confusion of sounds A babble of voices a woman passenger s scream shuffling feet and above it all Miko s roar Stand quiet Everyone No movement On the descending incline there was chaos The disembarking women were clinging to the gang rail some of them had evidently surged forward and fallen Down on the ground in the purple shadowed starlight I could vaguely see the chained line of men They too were in confusion trying to shove themselves toward the fallen women Miko roared Light those tubes Gregg Haljan By the Almighty Moa are you up there What is wrong The light tubes Dark drama of unknown plot I wondered if I should try and leave the turret Where was Anita She had been down there on the deck when I flung out the lights I think twenty seconds would have covered it all I had not moved I thought Is Snap concerned with this Moa s knife could have stabbed me I felt her lunge against me And suddenly I was gripping her twisting her wrist But she flung the knife away Her strength was almost the equal of my own Her hand went for my throat and with the other hand she was fumbling The deck abruptly sprang into light again Moa had found the switch and threw it back She fought me as I tried to reach the switch I saw down on the deck Miko was gazing up at us Moa panted Gregg stop If he sees you doing this he ll kill you The scene down there was almost unchanged I had answered my cue To what purpose I saw Anita near Miko The last of the women were on the plank I had stopped struggling with Moa She sat back panting And then she called Sorry Miko It will not happen again Miko was in a towering rage But he was too busy to bother with me his anger swung on those nearest him He shoved the last of the women violently at the incline She bounded over Her body with the gravity pull of only a few Earth pounds sailed in an arc and dropped near the swaying line of men Miko swung back Get out of my way A sweep of his huge arm knocked Anita sidewise Prince damn you help me with those boxes The frightened stewards were lifting the boxes square metal storage chests each as long as a man packed with food tools and equipment Here get out of my way All of you My breath came again Anita nimbly retreated before Miko s angry rush He dashed at the stewards Three of them held a box He took it from them raised it at the top of the incline poised it over his head an instant with his massive arms like gray pillars beneath it and flung it The box catapulted dropped and then passing the Planetara s gravity area it sailed in a long flat arc over the forest glade and crashed into the purple underbrush Give me another The stewards pushed another at him Like an angry Titan he flung it And another One by one the chests sailed out and crashed There is your food Go pick it up Haljan make ready to ring us away On the deck lay the dead body of Rance Rankin which the stewards had carried out Miko seized it flung it There Go to your last resting place And the other bodies Balch Blackstone Captain Carter Johnson Miko flung them all And the course masters and those of our crew who had been killed The passengers were all on the ground now It was dim down there I tried to distinguish Venza but could not I could see doctor Frank s figure at the end of the chained line of men The passengers were gazing in horror at the bodies hurtling over them Ready Haljan Moa prompted me Tell him yes I called Yes Had Venza failed in her unknown purpose It seemed so On the radio room bridge Snap and his guard stood like silent statues in the blue lit gloom The disembarkation was over Close the ports Miko commanded The incline came folding up with a clatter The port and dome windows slid closed Moa hissed against my ear If you want life Gregg Haljan you will start your duties Venza had failed Whatever it was it had come to nothing Down in the purple forest disconnected now from the ship the last of our friends stood marooned I could distinguish them through the blur of the closed dome only a swaying huddled group was visible But my fancy pictured this last sight of them doctor Frank Venza Shac and Dud Ardley They were gone There were left only Snap Anita and myself I was mechanically ringing us away I heard my sirens sounding down below with the answering clangs here in the turret The Planetara s respiratory controls started the pressure equalizers began operating and the gravity plates began shifting into lifting combinations The ship was hissing and quivering with it combined with the grating of the last of the dome ports And Miko s command Lift Haljan Hahn had been mingling with the confusion of the deck though I had hardly noticed him Coniston had remained below with the crew answering my signals Hahn stood now with Miko gazing down through a deck window Anita was alone at another Lift Haljan I lifted up gently bow first with a repulsion of the bow plates And started the central electronic engine Its thrust from the stern moved us diagonally over the purple forest trees The glade slid downward and away I caught a last vague glimpse of the huddled group of marooned passengers staring up at us Left to their fate alone on this deserted world With the three engines going we slid smoothly upward The forest dropped a purple spread of treetops edged with starlight and Earthlight The sharply curving horizon seemed to follow us upward I swung on all the power We mounted at a forty degree angle slowly circling with a bank of clouds over us to the side and the shining little sea beneath Very good Gregg In the turret light Moa s eyes blazed at me I do not know what you meant by darkening the deck lights Her fingers dug at my shoulders I will tell my brother it was an error I said An error yes I didn t know what it was But you have me to deal with now You understand I will tell my brother so You said On Earth a man may kill the thing he loves A woman of Mars may do that Beware of me Gregg Haljan Her passion filled eyes bored into me Love Hate The venom of a woman scorned a mingling of turgid emotions I twisted back from her grip and ignored her She sat back silently watching my busy activities the calculations of the shifting conditions of gravity pressures temperatures a checking of the instruments on the board before me Mechanical routine My mind went to Venza back there on the asteroid The wandering little world was already shrinking to a convex surface beneath us Venza with her last unknown play gone to failure Had I missed my cue Whatever my part it seemed now that I must have horribly misacted it The crescent Earth was presently swinging over our bow We rocketed out of the asteroid s shadow The glowing flaming Sun appeared making a crescent of the Earth With the glass I could see our tiny Moon visually seeming to hug the limb of its parent Earth We were on our course to the Moon My mind flung ahead Grantline with his treasure unsuspecting this brigand ship And suddenly beyond all thought of Grantline there came to me a fear for Anita In God s truth I had been so far a very stumbling inept champion doomed to failure with everything I tried Why had I not contrived to have Anita desert at the asteroid Would it not have been far better for her there taking her chance for rescue with doctor Frank Venza and the others But no I had like a fool never thought of that Had let her remain here on board at the mercy of these outlaws And I swore now that beyond everything I would protect her Futile oath If I could have seen ahead a few hours But I sensed the catastrophe There was a shudder within me as I sat in that turret docilely guiding us out through the asteroid s atmosphere heading us upon our course for the Moon XIX Try again By the infernal Snap Dean if you do anything to balk us you die Miko scanned the apparatus with keen eyes How much technical knowledge of signaling instruments did this brigand leader have I was tense and cold with apprehension as I sat in a corner of the radio room watching Snap Could Miko be fooled Snap I knew was trying to fool him The Moon spread close beneath us My log chart computed up to thirty minutes past showed us barely some thirty thousand miles over the Moon s surface A silver quadrant The sunset caught the Lunar mountains flung slanting shadows over the Lunar plains All the disc was plainly visible The mellow Earthlight glowed serene and pale to illumine the Lunar night The Planetara was bathed in silver A brilliant silver glare swept the forward deck clean white and splashed with black shadows We had partly circled the Moon so as now to approach it from the Earthward side Miko for a time had been at my side in the turret I had not seen Coniston or Hahn of recent hours I had slept awakened refreshed and had a meal Coniston and Hahn remained below one or other of them always with the crew to execute my sirened orders Then Coniston came to take my place in the turret and I went with Miko to the radio room You are skillful Haljan A measure of grim approval was in his voice You evidently have no wish to try and fool me in this navigation I had not indeed It is delicate work at best coping with the intricacies of celestial mechanics upon a semicircular trajectory with retarding velocity and with a makeshift crew we could easily have come upon real difficulty We hung at last hull down facing the Earthward hemisphere of the Lunar disc The giant ball of the Earth lay behind and above us the Sun over our stern quarter With forward velocity almost checked we poised and Snap began his signals to the unsuspecting Grantline My work momentarily was over I sat watching the radio room Moa was here close beside me I felt always her watchful gaze so that even the play of my emotions needed reining Miko worked with Snap Anita too was here To Miko and Moa it was the somber taciturn George Prince shrouded always in his black mourning cloak disinclined to talk sitting alone brooding and sullen This is how they thought of Anita Miko repeated By the infernal if you try to fool me Snap Dean The small metal room with its grid floor and low arched ceiling glared with moonlight through its window The moving figures of Snap and Miko were aped by the grotesque misshapen shadows of them on the walls Miko gigantic a great menacing ogre Snap small and alert a trim pale figure in his tight fitting white trousers broad flowing belt and white shirt open at the throat His face was pale and drawn from lack of sleep and the torture to which Miko had subjected him earlier on the voyage But he grinned at the brigand s words and pushed his straggling hair closer under the red eyeshade The room over long periods was deadly silent with Miko and Snap bending watchfully at the crowded banks of instruments A silence in which my own pounding heart seemed to echo I did not dare look at Anita nor she at me Snap was trying to signal Earth not the Moon His main grids were set in the reverse The infra red waves flung from the bow window were of a frequency which Snap and I believed that Grantline could not pick up And over against the wall close beside me and seemingly ignored by Snap there was a tiny ultra violet sender Its faint hum and the quivering of its mirrors had so far passed unnoticed Would some Earth station pick it up I prayed so There was a thumbnail mirror here which would bring an answer Would some Earth telescope be able to see us I doubted it The pinpoint of the Planetara s infinitesimal bulk would be beyond vision Long silences broken only by the faint hiss and murmur of Snap s instruments Shall I try the graphs Miko Yes I helped him with the spectro At every level the plates showed us nothing save the scarred and pitted Moon surface We worked for an hour There was nothing Bleak cold night on the Moon here beneath us A touch of fading sunlight upon the Apennines Up near the South Pole Tycho with its radiating open rills stood like a grim dark maw Miko bent over a plate Something here Is there An abnormality upon the frowning ragged cliffs of Tycho We thought so But then it seemed not Another hour No signal came from Earth If Snap s calls were getting through we had no evidence of it Abruptly Miko strode at me from across the room I went cold and tense Moa shifted alert to my every movement But Miko was not interested in me A sweep of his clenched fist knocked the ultra violet sender and its coils and mirrors in a tinkling crash to the grid at my feet We don t need that whatever it is He rubbed his knuckles where the violet waves had tinged them and turned grimly back to Snap Where are your ray mirrors If the treasure lies exposed This Martian s knowledge was far greater than we believed He grinned sardonically at Anita If our treasure is here on this hemisphere Prince we should pick up its rays Don t you think so Or is Grantline too cautious to leave it exposed Anita spoke in a careful throaty drawl The rays came through enough when we passed here on the way out You should know grinned Miko An expert eavesdropper Prince I will say that for you Come Dean try something else By God if Grantline does not signal us I will be likely to blame you my patience is shortening Shall we go closer Haljan I don t think it would help I said He nodded Perhaps not Are we checked Yes We were poised very nearly motionless If you wish an advance I can ring it But we need a surface destination now True Haljan He stood thinking Would a zed ray penetrate those crater cliffs Tycho for instance at this angle It might Snap agreed You think he may be on the northern inner Tycho He may be anywhere said Miko shortly If you think that Snap persisted suppose we swing the Planetara over the South Pole Tycho viewed from there And take another quarter day of time Miko sneered Flash on your zed ray help him hook it up Haljan I moved to the lens box of the spectroheliograph It seemed that Snap was very strangely reluctant Was it because he knew that the Grantline camp lay concealed on the north inner wall of Tycho s giant ring I thought so But Snap flashed a queer look at Anita She did not see it but I did And I could not understand it My accursed witless incapacity If only I had taken warning Here commanded Miko A score of graphs with the zed ray I tell you I will comb this surface if we have to stay here until our ship comes from Ferrok Shahn to join us The Martian brigands were coming Miko s signals had been answered In ten days the other brigand ship adequately manned and armed would be here Snap helped me connect the zed ray He did not dare even to whisper to me with Moa hovering always so close And for all Miko s sardonic smiling we knew that he would tolerate nothing from us now He was fully armed and so was Moa I recall that several times Snap endeavored to touch me significantly Oh if only I had taken warning We finished our connecting The dull gray point of zed ray gleamed through the prisms to mingle with the moonlight entering the main lens I stood with the shutter trip The same interval Snap Yes Beside me I was aware of a faint reflection of the zed ray a gray cathedral shaft crossing the room and falling upon the opposite wall An unreality there as the zed ray faintly strove to penetrate the metal room side I said Shall I make the exposure Snap nodded But that graph was never made An exclamation from Moa made us all turn The gamma mirrors were quivering Grantline had picked our signals With what was undoubtedly an intensified receiving equipment which Snap had not thought Grantline able to use he had caught our faint zed rays which Snap was sending only to deceive Miko And Grantline had recognized the Planetara and had released his occulting screens surrounding the ore And upon their heels came Grantline s message Not in the secret system he had arranged with Snap but unsuspectingly in open code I could read the swinging mirror and so could Miko And Miko decoded it triumphantly aloud Surprised but pleased your return Approach Mid Northern Hemisphere region of Archimedes forty thousand off nearest Apennine range The message broke off But even its importance was overshadowed Miko stood in the center of the radio room triumphantly reading the little indicator Its beam swung on the scale which chanced to be almost directly over Anita s head I saw Miko s expression change A look of surprise amazement came over him Why He gasped He stood staring Almost stupidly staring for an instant And as I regarded him with fascinated horror there came upon his heavy gray face a look of dawning comprehension And I heard Snap s startled intake of breath He moved to the spectro where the zed ray connections were still humming But with a leap Miko flung him away Off with you Moa watch him Haljan don t move Again Miko stood staring I saw now that he was staring at Anita Why George Prince How strange you look Anita did not move She was stricken with horror she shrank back against the wall huddled in her cloak Miko s sardonic voice came again How strange you look Prince He took a step forward He was grim and calm Horribly calm Deliberate Gloating like a great gray monster in human form toying with a fascinated imprisoned bird Move just a little Prince Let the zed ray light fall more fully Anita s head was bare That pale Hamlet like face Dear God the zed ray light lay gray and penetrating upon it Miko took another step Peering Grinning How amazing George Prince Why I can hardly believe it Moa was armed with an electronic cylinder now For all her amazement what turgid emotions sweeping her I can only guess she never took her eyes from Snap and me Back Don t move either of you she hissed at us Then Miko leaped at Anita like a giant gray leopard pouncing Away with that cloak Prince I stood cold and numbed And realization came at last The faint zed light had fallen by chance upon Anita s face Penetrating the flesh exposed faintly glowing the bone line of her jaw Unmasked the art of Glutz Miko seized her wrists drew her forward beyond the shaft of zed light into the brilliant light of the Moon And ripped her cloak from her The gentle curves of her woman s figure were so unmistakable And as Miko gazed at them all his calm triumph swept away Why Anita I heard Moa mutter So that is it A venomous flashing look a shaft from me to Anita and back again So that is it Why Anita Miko s great arms gathered her up as though she were a child So I have you back From the dead delivered back to me Gregg Snap s warning and his grip on my shoulders brought me a measure of sanity I had tensed to spring I stood quivering and Moa thrust her weapon against my face The grids were swaying again with a message from Grantline But it was ignored In the glare of moonlight by the forward window Miko held Anita his great hands pawing her with triumphant possessive caresses So little Anita you are given back to me XX Moonlight upon Earth so gently shines to make romantic a lover s smile But the reality of the Lunar night is cold beyond human belief Cold and darkly silent Grim desolation Awesome Majestic A frowning majesty that even to the most intrepid human beholder is inconceivably forbidding And there were humans here now On this tumbled plain between Archimedes and the mountains one small crater amid the million of its fellows was distinguished this night by the presence of humans The Grantline camp It huddled in the deepest purple shadows on the side of a bowl like pit a crudely circular orifice with a scant two miles across its rippling rim There was faint light here to mark the presence of the living intruders The blue glow radiance of Morrell tube lights under a spread of glassite The Grantline camp stood midway up one of the inner cliff walls of the little crater The broken rock strewn floor two miles wide lay five hundred feet below the camp Behind it the jagged precipitous cliff rose another five hundred to the heights of the upper rim A broad level shelf hung midway up the cliff and upon it Grantline had built his little group of glassite dome shelters Viewed from above there was the darkly purple crater floor the upflung circular rim where the Earthlight tinged the spires and crags with yellow sheen and on the shelf like a huddled group of birds nests Grantline s domes hung and gazed down upon the inner valley The air here on the Moon surface was negligible a scant one five thousandth of the atmospheric pressure at the sea level on Earth But within the glassite shelter a normal Earth pressure must be maintained Rigidly braced double walls to withstand the explosive tendency with no external pressure to counteract it A tremendous necessity for mechanical equipment had burdened Grantline s small ship to capacity The chemistry of manufactured air the pressure equalizers renewers respirators the lighting and temperature maintenance of a space flyer was here There was this main Grantline building stretched low and rectangular along the front edge of the ledge Within it were living rooms mess hall and kitchen Fifty feet behind it connected by a narrow passage of glassite was a similar though smaller structure The mechanical control rooms with their humming vibrating mechanisms were here And an instrument room with signaling apparatus senders receivers mirror grids and audiphones of several varieties And an electro telescope small but modern with dome overhead like a little Earth observatory From this instrument building beside the connecting pedestrian passage wire cables for light and air tubes and strings and bundles of instrument wires ran to the main structure gray snakes upon the porous gray Lunar rock The third building seemed a lean to banked against the cliff wall a slanting shed wall of glassite fifty feet high and two hundred in length Under it for months Grantline s bores had dug into the cliff Braced tunnels were here penetrating back and downward into the vein of rock The work was over The borers had been dismantled and packed away At one end of the cliff the mining equipment lay piled in a litter There was a heap of discarded ore where Grantline had carted and dumped it after his first crude refining process had yielded it as waste The ore slag lay like gray powder flakes strewn down the cliff Trucks and ore carts along the ledge stood discarded mute evidence of the weeks and months of work these helmeted miners had undergone struggling upon this airless frowning world But now all that was finished The catalytic ore was sufficiently concentrated It lay this treasure in a seventy foot pile behind the glassite lean to with a cage of wires over it and an insulation barrage hiding its presence The ore shelter was dark the other two buildings were lighted And there were small lights mounted at intervals about the camp and along the edge of the ledge A spider ladder with tiny platforms some twenty feet one above the other hung precariously to the cliff face It descended the five hundred feet to the crater floor and behind the camp it mounted the jagged cliff face to the upper rim height where a small observatory platform was placed Such was the outer aspect of the Grantline Treasure Camp near the beginning of this Lunar night when unknown to Grantline and his men the Planetara with its brigands was approaching The night was perhaps a sixth advanced Full night No breath of cloud to mar the brilliant starry heavens The quadrant Earth hung poised like a giant mellow moon over Grantline s crater A bright Earth yet no air was here on this Lunar surface to spread its light Only a glow mingling with the spots of blue tube light on the poles along the cliff and the radiance from the lighted buildings No evidence of movement showed about the silent camp Then a pressure door in an end of the main building opened its tiny series of locks A bent figure came out The lock closed The figure straightened and gazed about the camp Grotesque bloated semblance of a man Helmeted with rounded dome hood suggestion of an ancient sea diver yet goggled and trunked like a gas masked fighter of the twentieth century He stopped presently and disconnected metal weights which were upon his shoes Then he stood erect again and with giant strides bounded along the cliff Fantastic figure in the blue lit gloom A child s dream of crags and rocks and strange lights with a single monstrous figure in seven league boots He went the length of the ledge with his twenty foot strides inspected the lights and made adjustments Came back and climbed with agile bounding leaps up the spider ladder to the dome of the crater top A light flashed on up there Then it was extinguished The goggled bloated figure came leaping down after a moment Grantline s exterior watchman making his rounds He came back to the main building Fastened the weights on his shoes Signaled The lock opened The figure went inside It was early evening After the dinner hour and before the time of sleep according to the camp routine Grantline was maintaining Nine P M of Earth Eastern American time recorded now upon his Earth chronometer In the living room of the main building Johnny Grantline sat with a dozen of his men dispersed about the room whiling away as best they could the lonesome hours All as usual This cursed Moon When I get home if I ever do Say your say Wilks But you ll spend your share of the gold leaf and thank your constellations that you had your chance to make it Let him alone Come on Wilks take a hand here This game is not any good with three The man who had been outside flung his hissing helmet recklessly to the floor and unsealed his suit Here get me out of this No I won t play I can t play your cursed game with nothing at stake A laugh went up at the sharp look Johnny Grantline flung from where he sat reading in a corner of the room Commander s orders No gambling gold leafers tolerated here Play the game Wilks Grantline said quietly We all know it s infernal this doing nothing He s been struck by Earthlight another man laughed Commander I told you not to let that guy Wilks out at night A rough but good natured lot of men Jolly and raucous by nature in their leisure hours But there was too much leisure here now Their mirth had a hollow sound In older times explorers of the frozen Polar zones had to cope with inactivity loneliness and despair But at least they were on their native world The grimness of the Moon was eating into the courage of Grantline s men An unreality here A weirdness These fantastic crags The deadly silence The nights almost two weeks of Earth time in length congealed by the deadly frigidity of space The days of black sky blazing stars and flaming Sun with no atmosphere to diffuse the Sun s heat radiating so swiftly from the naked Lunar surface that the outer temperature still was cold And day and night always the beloved Earth disc hanging poised up near the zenith From thinnest crescent to full Earth then back to crescent All so abnormal irrational disturbing to human senses With the mining work over an irritability grew upon Grantline s men And perhaps since the human mind is so wonderful elusive a thing there lay upon these men an indefinable sense of disaster Johnny Grantline felt it He thought about it now as he sat in the room corner watching Wilks being forced into the plaget game and he found the premonition strong within him Unreasonably ominous depression Barring the accident which had disabled his little spaceship when they reached this small crater hole his expedition had gone well His instruments and the information he had from the former explorers had enabled him to pick up the catalyst vein with only one month of search The vein had now been exhausted but the treasure was here enough to supply every need on his Earth Nothing was left but to wait for the Planetara The men were talking of that now She ought to be well midway from Ferrok Shahn by now When do you figure she ll be back here and signal us Twenty days Give her another five now to Mars and five in port That s ten We ll pick her signals in three weeks mark me Three weeks Just give me three weeks of reasonable sunrise and sunset This cursed Moon You mean Williams next daylight Ha He s inventing a Lunar language You ll be a Moon man yet Olaf Swenson the big blond fellow from the Scandia fiords came and flung himself down beside Grantline Ay tank they bane without enough to do Commander Three weeks isn t very long Ole No Maybe not From across the room somebody was saying If the Comet hadn t smashed on us damn me but I d ask the Commander to let some of us take her back Shut up Billy She is smashed You all agreed to things as they are Johnny said shortly We all took the same chances voluntarily A dynamic little fellow this Johnny Grantline Short of temper sometimes but always just and a perfect leader of men In stature he was almost as small as Snap But he was thick set with a smooth shaven keen eyed square jawed face and a shock of brown tousled hair A man of thirty five though the decision of his manner the quiet dominance of his voice made him seem older He stood up now surveying the blue lit glassite room with its low ceiling close overhead He was bow legged in movement he seemed to roll with a stiff legged gait like some sea captains of former days on the deck of his swaying ship Odd looking figure Heavy flannel shirt and trousers boots heavily weighted and bulky metal loaded belt strapped about his waist He grinned at Swenson When the time comes to divide this treasure everyone will be happy Ole The treasure was estimated to be the equivalent of ninety millions in gold leaf A hundred and ten millions in the gross as it now stood with twenty millions to be deducted by the Federated Refiners for reducing it to the standard purity for commercial use Ninety millions with only a million and a half to come off for expedition expenses and the Planetara s share another million A nice little stake Grantline strode across the room with his rolling gait Cheer up boys Who s winning there I say you fellows An audiphone buzzer interrupted him a call from the duty man in the instrument room of the nearby building Grantline clicked the receiver The room fell into silence Any call was unusual nothing ever happened here in the camp The duty man s voice sounded over the room Signals coming Not clear Will you come over Commander Signals It was never Grantline s way to enforce needless discipline He offered no objection when every man in the camp rushed through the connecting passages They crowded the instrument room where the tense duty man sat bending over his radio receivers The mirrors were swaying The duty man looked up and met Grantline s gaze I ran it up to the highest intensity Commander We ought to get it Low scale Peter Yes Weakest infra red I m bringing it up even though it uses too much of our power Get it said Grantline shortly I got one slight television swing a minute ago then it faded I think it s the Planetara Planetara The crowding group of men chorused How could it be the Planetara But it was The call came in presently Unmistakably the Planetara turned back now from her course to Ferrok Shahn How far away Peter The duty man consulted the needles of his dial scale Close Very weak infra red But close Around thirty thousand miles maybe It s Snap Dean calling The Planetara here within thirty thousand miles Excitement and pleasure swept the room The Planetara had for so long been awaited eagerly The excitement communicated to Grantline It was unlike him to be incautious yet now with no thought save that some unforeseen and pleasing circumstance had brought the Planetara ahead of time incautious Grantline certainly was Raise the barrage I ll go My suit is here A willing volunteer rushed out to the shed Can you send Peter Grantline demanded Yes With more power Use it Johnny dictated the message of his location which we received In his incautious excitement he ignored the secret code An interval passed No message had come from us just Snap s routine signal in the weak infra red which we hoped Grantline would not get The men crowding Grantline s instrument room waited in tense silence Then Grantline tried the television again Its current weakened the lights with the drain upon the distributors and cooled the room with a sudden deadly chill as the Erentz insulating system slowed down The duty man looked frightened You ll bulge out our walls Commander The internal pressure We ll chance it They picked up the image of the Planetara It shone clear on the grid the segment of star field with a tiny cigar shaped blob Clear enough to be unmistakable The Planetara Here now over the Moon almost directly overhead poised at what the altimeter scale showed to be a fraction under thirty thousand miles The men gazed in awed silence The Planetara coming But the altimeter needle was motionless The Planetara was hanging poised A sudden gasp went about the room The men stood with whitening faces gazing at the Planetara s image And at the altimeter s needle It was moving now The Planetara was descending But not with an orderly swoop The grid showed the ship clearly The bow tilted up then dipped down But then in a moment it swung up again The ship turned partly over Righted itself Then swayed again drunkenly The watching men were stricken in horrified silence The Planetara s image momentarily horribly grew larger Swaying Then turning completely over rotating slowly end over end The Planetara out of control was falling XXI On the Planetara in the radio room Snap and I stood with Moa s weapon upon us Miko held Anita Triumphant possessive Then as she struggled a gentleness came to this strange Martian giant Perhaps he really loved her Looking back on it I sometimes think so Anita do not fear me He held her away from him I would not harm you I want your love Irony came to him And I thought I had killed you But it was only your brother He partly turned I was aware of how alert was his attention He grinned Hold them Moa Don t let them do anything foolish So little Anita you were masquerading to spy on me That was wrong of you Anita had not spoken She held herself tensely away from Miko She had flashed me a look just one What horrible mischance to have brought on this catastrophe The completion of Grantline s message had come unnoticed by us all We remained tense Look Grantline again Snap said abruptly But the mirrors were steadying We had no recording mechanism the rest of the message was lost No further message came There was an interval while Miko waited He held Anita in the hollow of his great arm Quiet little bird Do not fear me I have work to do Anita this is our great adventure We will be rich you and I All the luxuries these worlds can offer all for us when this is over Careful Moa This Haljan has no wit Well could he say it I who had been so witless as to let this come upon us Moa s weapon prodded me Her voice hissed at me with all the venom of a reptile enraged So that was your game Gregg Haljan And I was so graceless as to admit love for you Snap murmured in my ear Don t move Gregg She s reckless She heard it She whirled on him We have lost George Prince it seems Well we will survive without his scientific knowledge And you Dean and this Haljan mark me I will kill you both if you cause trouble Miko was gloating Don t kill them yet Moa What was it Grantline said Near the crater of Archimedes Ring us down Haljan We ll land He signaled the turret gave Coniston the Grantline message and audiphoned it below to Hahn The news spread about the ship The bandits were jubilant We ll land now Haljan Come Anita and I will go with you to the turret I found my voice To what destination Near Archimedes The Apennine side Keep well away from the Grantline camp We will probably sight it as we descend There was no trajectory needed We were almost over Archimedes now I could drop us with a visible instrumental course My mind was whirling with a confusion of thoughts What could we do I met Snap s gaze Ring us down Gregg he said quietly I nodded I pushed Moa s weapon away You don t need that We went to the turret Moa watched me and Snap a grim cold Amazon She avoided looking at Anita whom Miko helped down the ladders with a strange mixture of courtierlike grace and amused irony Coniston stared at Anita I say not George Prince The girl No time for explanations Miko commanded It s the girl masquerading as her brother Get below Coniston Haljan takes us down The astounded Englishman continued to gaze at Anita But he said I mean to say where to on the Moon Not to encounter Grantline at once Miko Our equipment is not ready Of course not We will land well away The reluctant Coniston left us I took the controls Miko still holding Anita as though she were a child sat beside me We will watch him Anita A skilled fellow at this sort of work I rang my signals for the shifting of the gravity plates The answer should have come from below within a second or two But it did not Miko regarded me with his great bushy eyebrows upraised Ring again Haljan I duplicated No answer The silence was ominous Miko muttered That accursed Hahn Ring again I sent the imperative emergency demand No answer A second or two Then all of us in the turret were startled Transfixed From below came a sudden hiss It sounded in the turret it came from the shifting room call grid The hissing of the pneumatic valves of the plate shifters in the lower control room The valves were opening the plates automatically shifting into neutral and disconnecting An instant of startled silence Miko may have realized the significance of what had happened Certainly Snap and I did The hissing ceased I gripped the emergency plate shifter switch which hung over my head Its disc was dead The plates were dead in neutral in the position they were placed only in port And their shifting mechanisms were imperative I was on my feet We re in neutral The Moon disc moved visibly as the Planetara lurched The vault of the heavens was slowly swinging Miko ripped out a heavy oath Haljan What is this The heavens turned with a giant swoop The Moon was over us It swung in a dizzying arc Overhead then back past our stern under us then appearing over our bow The Planetara had turned over Upending Rotating end over end For a moment I think all of us in the turret stood and clung The Moon disc the Earth Sun and all the stars were swinging past our windows So horribly dizzying The Planetara seemed lurching and tumbling But it was an optical effect only I stared with grim determination at my feet The turret seemed to steady Then I looked again That horrible swoop of all the heavens And the Moon as it went past seemed expanded We were falling Out of control with the Moon gravity pulling us down That accursed Hahn A moment only had passed My fancy that the Moon disc was enlarged was merely the horror of my imagination We had not fallen far enough for that But we were falling Unless I could do something we would crash upon the Lunar surface Anita killed in this turret the end of everything every hope Action came to me I gasped Miko you stay here The controls are dead You stay here and hold Anita I ignored Moa s weapon Snap thrust her away We re falling you fool let us alone Miko gasped Can you check us What happened I don t know I stood clinging This dizzying whirl From the audiphone grid Coniston s voice sounded I say Haljan something s wrong Hahn doesn t signal The lookout in the forward tower was clinging to our window On the deck below our turret a member of the crew appeared stood lurching for a moment then shouted and ran swaying aimless From the lower hull corridors our grids sounded with the tramping of running steps Panic among the crew was spreading over the ship A chaos below deck I pulled at the emergency switch again Dead Snap we must get down The signals Coniston s voice came like a scream from the grid Hahn is dead The controls are broken I shouted Miko hold Anita Come on Snap We clung to the ladders Snap was behind me Careful Gregg Good God This dizzying whirl I tried not to look The deck under me was now a blurred kaleidoscope of swinging patches of moonlight and shadow We reached the deck It seemed that from the turret Anita s voice followed us Be careful Once inside the ship our senses steadied With the rotating reeling heavens shut out there were only the shouts and tramping steps of the panic stricken crew to mark that there was anything amiss That and a pseudo sensation of lurching caused by the pulsing of gravity a pull when the Moon was beneath our hull to combine its forces with our magnetizers a lightening when it was overhead A throbbing pendulum lurch We ran down to the corridor incline A white faced member of the crew came running up What s happened Haljan What s happened We re falling I gripped him Get below Come with us But he jerked away from me Falling A steward came running Falling My God Snap swung at them Get ahead of us The manual controls our only chance we need all you men at the compressor pumps But it was instinct to try and get on deck as though here below we were rats caught in a trap The men tore away from us and ran Their shouts of panic resounded through the dim blue lit corridors Coniston came lurching from the control room I say falling Haljan my God look Hahn was sprawled at the gravity plate switchboard Sprawled head down Dead Killed Or a suicide I bent over him His hands gripped the main switch He had ripped it loose And his left hand had reached and broken the fragile line of tubes that intensified the current of the pneumatic plate shifters A suicide With his last frenzy determined to kill us all Why Then I saw that Hahn had been killed Not a suicide In his hand he gripped a small segment of black fabric a piece torn from an invisible cloak Snap was rigging the hand compressors If he could get the pressure back in the tanks I swung on Coniston You armed Yes He was white faced and confused but not in a panic He showed me his heat ray cylinder What do you want me to do Round up the crew Get all you can Bring them here to man the pumps He dashed away Snap called after him Kill them if they argue Miko s voice sounded from the turret call grid Falling Haljan you can see it now Check us Desperate moments Or was it an hour Coniston brought the men He stood over them with menacing weapon We had all the pumps going The pressure rose a little in the tanks Enough to shift a bow plate I tried it The plate slowly clicked into a new combination A gravity repulsion just in the bow tip I signaled Miko Have we stopped swinging No But slower I could feel it that lurch of the gravity But not steady now A limp The tendency of our bow was to stay up More pressure Snap One of the crew rebelled tried to bolt from the room Coniston shot him down I shifted another bow plate Then two in the stern The stern plates seemed to move more readily than the others Run all the stern plates Snap advised I tried it The lurching stopped Miko called We re bow down Falling But not falling free The Moon gravity pull on us was more than half neutralized I ll go up Snap and try the engines You don t mind staying down here Executing my signals You idiot He gripped my shoulders His eyes were gleaming his face haggard but his pale lips twitched with a smile Maybe it s good bye Gregg We ll fall fighting Yes Fighting Coniston you keep the pressure up With the broken tubes it took nearly all the pressure to maintain the few plates I had shifted One slipped back to neutral Then the pumps gained on it and it shifted again I dashed up to the deck Oh the Moon was so close now So horribly close The deck shadows were still Through the forward bow windows the Moon surface glared up at us Those last horrible minutes were a blur And there was always Anita s face She left Miko Faced with death he sat clinging Moa too sat apart staring And Anita crept to me Gregg dear one The end I tried the electronic engines from the stern setting them in reverse The streams of their light glowed from the stern forward along our hull and flared down from our bow toward the Lunar surface But no atmosphere was here to give resistance Perhaps the electronic streams checked our fall a little The pumps gave us pressure just in the last minutes to slide a few of the hull plates But our bow stayed down We slid like a spent rocket falling I recall the horror of that expanding Lunar surface The maw of Archimedes yawning A blob Widening to a great pit Then I saw it was to one side rushing upward Gregg dear one good bye Her gentle arms about me The end of everything for us I recall murmuring Not falling free Anita Some hull plates are set My dials showed another plate shifting checking us a little further Good old Snap I calculated the next best plate to shift I tried it Slid it over Then everything faded but the feeling of Anita s arms around me Gregg dear one The end of everything for us There was an up rush of gray black rock XXII I opened my eyes to a dark blur of confusion My shoulder hurt a pain shooting through it Something lay like a weight on me I could not seem to move my left arm Then I moved it and it hurt I was lying twisted I sat up And with a rush memory came The crash was over I was not dead Anita She was lying beside me There was a little light here in the silent blur a soft mellow Earthlight filtering in the window The weight on me was Anita She lay sprawled her head and shoulders half way across my lap Not dead Thank God not dead She moved Her arms went around me and I lifted her The Earthlight glowed on her pale face It s past Anita We ve struck and we re still alive I held her as though all of life s turgid dangers were powerless to touch us But in the silence my floating senses were brought back to reality by a faint sound forcing itself upon me A little hiss The faintest murmuring breath like a hiss Escaping air I cast off Anita s clinging arms Anita this is madness For minutes we must have been lying there in the heaven of our embrace But air was escaping The Planetara s dome was broken and our precious air was hissing out Full reality came to me I was not seriously injured I found I could move freely I could stand A twisted shoulder a limp left arm but they were better in a moment And Anita did not seem to be hurt Blood was upon her But not her own Beside Anita stretched face down on the turret grid was the giant figure of Miko The blood lay in a small pool against his face A widening pool Moa was here I thought her body twitched then was still This soundless wreckage In the dim glow of the wrecked turret with its two motionless broken human figures it seemed as though Anita and I were ghouls prowling I saw that the turret had fallen over to the Planetara s deck It lay dashed against the dome side The deck was aslant A litter of wreckage A broken human figure showed one of the crew who at the last must have come running up The forward observation tower was down on the chart room roof in its metal tangle I thought I could see the legs of the tower lookout So this was the end of the brigands adventure The Planetara s last voyage How small and futile are humans struggles Miko s daring enterprise so villainous brought all in a few moments to this silent tragedy The Planetara had fallen thirty thousand miles But why What had happened to Hahn And where was Coniston down in this broken hull And Snap I thought suddenly of Snap I clutched at my wandering wits This inactivity was death The escaping air hissed in my ears Our precious air escaping away into the vacant desolation of the Lunar emptiness Through one of the twisted slanting dome windows a rocky spire was visible The Planetara lay bow down wedged in a jagged cradle of Lunar rock A miracle that the hull and dome had held together Anita we must get out of here Their helmets are in the forward storage room Gregg She was staring at the fallen Miko and Moa She shuddered and turned away and gripped me In the forward storage room by the port of the emergency exit If only the exit locks would operate We must find Snap and get out of here Good old Snap Would we find him lying dead We climbed from the slanting fallen turret over the wreckage of the littered deck It was not difficult A lightness was upon us The Planetara s gravity magnetizers were dead this was only the light Moon gravity pulling us Careful Anita Don t jump too freely We leaped along the deck The hiss of the escaping pressure was like a clanging gong of warning to tell us to hurry The hiss of death so close Snap I murmured
4598_2503_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Gregg 
none	none	I pray we may find him alive With a fifteen foot leap we cleared a pile of broken deck chairs A man lay groaning near them I went back with a rush Not Snap A steward He had been a brigand but he was a steward to me now Get up This is Haljan Hurry we must get out of here The air is escaping But he sank back and lay still No time to find if I could help him there was Anita and Snap to save We found a broken entrance to one of the descending passages I flung the debris aside and cleared it Like a giant of strength with only this Moon gravity holding me I raised a broken segment of superstructure and heaved it back Anita and I dropped ourselves down the sloping passage The interior of the wrecked ship was silent and dim An occasional passage light was still burning The passage and all the rooms lay askew Wreckage everywhere but the double dome and hull shell had withstood the shock Then I realized that the Erentz system was slowing down Our heat like our air was escaping radiating away a deadly chill settling on everything The silence and the deadly chill of death would soon be here in these wrecked corridors The end of the Planetara We prowled like ghouls We did not see Coniston Snap had been by the shifter pumps We found him in the oval doorway He lay sprawled Dead No he moved He sat up before we could get to him He seemed confused but his senses clarified with the movement of our figures over him Gregg Why Anita Snap You re all right We struck the air is escaping He pushed me away He tried to stand I m all right I was up a minute ago Gregg it s getting cold Where is she I had her here she wasn t killed I spoke to her Irrational Snap I held him Shook him Snap old fellow He said normally Easy Gregg I m all right Anita gripped him Who Snap She there she is Another figure was here On the grid floor by the door oval A figure partly shrouded in a broken invisible cloak and hook An invisible cloak I saw a white face with opened eyes regarding me Venza I bent down You Venza here Why how my thoughts swept on Venza here dying Her eyes closed But she murmured to Anita Where is he I want him I murmured impulsively Here I am Venza dear Gently as one would speak with gentle sympathy to humor the dying Here I am Venza But it was only the confusion of the shock upon her And it was upon us all She pushed at Anita I want him She saw me this whimsical Venus girl Even here as we gathered all of us blurred by shock confused in the dim wrecked ship with the chill of death coming even here she could jest Her pale lips smiled You Gregg I m not hurt I don t think I m hurt She managed to get herself up on one elbow Did you think I wanted you with my dying breath What conceit Not you Handsome Haljan I was calling Snap He was down to her We re all right Venza It s over We must get out of the ship The air is escaping We gathered in the oval doorway We fought the confusion of panic The exit port is this way Or was it I answered Snap Yes I think so The ship suddenly seemed a stranger to me So cold So vibrationless Broken lights These slanting wrecked corridors With the ventilating fans stilled the air was turning fetid Chilling And thinning with escaping pressure rarefying so that I could feel the grasp of it in my lungs and the pin pricks in my cheeks We started off Four of us still alive in this silent ship of death My blurred thoughts tried to cope with it all Venza here I remembered how she had bade me create a diversion when the women passengers were landing on the asteroid She had carried out her purpose In the confusion she had not gone ashore A stowaway here She had secured the cloak Prowling to try and help us she had come upon Hahn Had seized his ray cylinder and struck him down and been herself knocked unconscious by his dying lunge which also had broken the tubes and wrecked the Planetara And Venza unconscious had been lying here with the mechanism of her cloak still operating so that we did not see her when we came and found why Hahn did not answer my signals It s here Gregg Snap and I lifted the pile of Moon equipment to which she referred We located four suits and helmets and the mechanisms to operate them More are in the chart room Anita said But we needed no others I robed Anita and showed her the mechanisms Snap was helping Venza We were all stiff from the cold but within the suits and their pulsing currents the blessed warmth came again The helmets had ports through which food and drink could be taken I stood with my helmet ready Anita Venza and Snap were bloated and grotesque beside me We had found food and water here assembled in portable cases which the brigands had prepared Snap lifted them and signaled to me he was ready My helmet shut out all sounds save my own breathing my pounding heart and the murmur of the mechanism The warmth and pure air were good We reached the hull port locks They operated We went through in the light of the headlamps over our foreheads I closed the locks after us an instinct to keep the air in the ship for the other trapped humans lying in there We slid down the sloping side of the Planetara We were unweighted irrationally agile with this slight gravity I fell a dozen feet and landed with barely a jar We were out on the Lunar surface A great sloping ramp of crags stretched down before us Gray black rock tinged with Earthlight The Earth hung amid the stars in the blackness overhead like a huge section of a glowing yellow ball This grim desolate silent landscape Beyond the ramp fifty feet below us a tumbled naked plain stretched away into blurred distance But I could see mountains off there Behind us the towering frowning rampart wall of Archimedes loomed against the sky I had turned to look back at the Planetara She lay broken wedged between spires of upstanding rock A few of her lights still gleamed The end of the Planetara The three grotesque figures of Anita Venza and Snap had started off Hunchback figures with the tanks mounted on their shoulders I bounded and caught them I touched Snap We made audiphone contact Which way do you think I demanded I think this way down the ramp Away from Archimedes toward the mountains It shouldn t be too far You run with Venza I ll hold Anita He nodded But we must keep together Gregg We could soon run freely Down the ramp out over the tumbled plain Bounding grotesque leaping strides The girls were more agile more skillful They were soon leading us The Earth shadows of their figures leaped beside them The Planetara faded into the distance behind us Archimedes stood back there Ahead the mountains came closer An hour perhaps I lost track of time Occasionally we stopped to rest Were we going toward the Grantline camp Would they see our tiny waving headlights Another interval Then far ahead of us on the ragged plain lights showed Moving tiny spots of light Headlights on helmeted figures We ran monstrously leaping A group of figures were off there Grantline s party Snap gripped me Grantline We re safe Gregg Safe He took his bulb light from his helmet we stood in a group while he waved it A semaphore signal Grantline And the answer came Yes You Dean Their personal code No doubt of this it was Grantline who had seen the Planetara fall and had come to help us I stood then with my hand holding Anita And I whispered It s Grantline We re safe Anita my darling Death had been so close Those horrible last minutes on the Planetara had shocked us marked us We stood trembling And Grantline and his men came bounding up weird inflated figures A helmeted figure touched me I saw through the helmetpane the visage of a stern faced square jawed young man Grantline Johnny Grantline Yes said his voice at my ear grid I m Grantline You re Haljan Gregg Haljan They crowded around us Gripped us to hear our explanations Brigands It was amazing to Johnny Grantline But the menace was over now over as soon as Grantline realized its existence We stood for a brief time discussing it Then I drew apart leaving Snap with Grantline And Anita joined me I held her arm so that we had audiphone contact Anita mine Gregg dear one Murmured nothings which mean so much to lovers As we stood in the fantastic gloom of Lunar desolation with the blessed Earthlight on us I sent up a prayer of thankfulness Not that the enormous treasure was saved Not that the attack upon Grantline had been averted But only that Anita was given back to me In moments of greatest emotion the human mind individualizes To me there was only Anita Life is very strange The gate to the shining garden of our love seemed swinging wide to let us in Yet I recall that a vague fear still lay on me A premonition I felt a touch on my arm A bloated helmet visor was thrust near my own I saw Snap s face peering at me Grantline thinks we should return to the Planetara Might find some of them alive Grantline touched me It s only human Yes I said We went back Some ten of us a line of grotesque figures bounding with slow easy strides over the jagged rock strewn plain Our lights danced before us The Planetara came at last into view My ship Again that pang swept me as I saw her This her last resting place She lay here in her open tomb shattered broken unbreathing The lights on her were extinguished The Erentz system had ceased to pulse the heart of the dying ship for a while beating faintly but now at rest We left the two girls with some of Grantline s men at the admission port Snap Grantline and I with three others went inside There still seemed to be air but not enough so that we dared remove our helmets It was dark inside the wrecked ship The corridors were black The hull control rooms were dimly with Earthlight straggling through the windows This littered tomb Cold and silent with death We stumbled over a fallen figure A member of the crew Grantline straightened from examining it Dead he said Earthlight fell on the horrible face Puffed flesh bloated red from the blood which had oozed from its pores in the thinning air I looked away We prowled further Hahn lay dead in the pump room The body of Coniston should have been near here We did not see it We climbed up to the slanting littered deck The air up here had all almost hissed away Again Grantline touched me That the turret No wonder he asked me The wreckage was all so formless Yes We climbed after Snap into the broken turret room We passed the body of that steward who just at the end had appealed to me and I had left dying The legs of the forward lookout still poked grotesquely up from the wreckage of the observatory tower where it lay smashed down against the roof of the chart room We shoved ourselves into the turret What was this No bodies here The giant Miko was gone The pool of blood lay congealed into a frozen dark splotch on the metal grid And Moa was gone They had not been dead Had dragged themselves out of here fighting desperately for life We would find them somewhere around here But we did not Nor Coniston I recalled what Anita had said other suits and helmets had been here in the nearby chart room The brigands had taken them and food and water doubtless and escaped from the ship following us through the lower admission ports only a few minutes after we were gone We made careful search of the entire ship Eight of the bodies which should have been here were missing Miko Moa Coniston and five of the crew We did not find them outside They were hiding near here no doubt more willing to take their chances than to yield to us now But how in all this Lunar desolation could we hope to locate them No use said Grantline Let them go If they want death well they deserve it But we were saved Then as I stood there realization leaped at me Saved Were we not indeed fatuous fools In all these emotion swept moments since we had encountered Grantline memory of that brigand ship coming from Mars had never once occurred to Snap and me I told Grantline now He stared at me What I told him again It would be here in eight days Fully manned and armed But Haljan we have almost no weapons All my Comet s space was taken with equipment and the mechanisms for my camp I can t signal Earth I was depending on the Planetara It surged upon us The brigand menace past We were blindly congratulating ourselves on our safety But it would be eight days or more before in distant Ferrok Shahn the nonarrival of the Planetara would cause any real comment No one was searching for us no one was worried over us No wonder the crafty Miko was willing to take his chances out here in the Lunar wilds His ship his reinforcements his weapons were coming rapidly And we were helpless Almost unarmed Marooned here on the Moon XXIII Try it again Snap urged Good God Johnny we ve got to raise some Earth station Chance it Use the power run it up full Chance it We were gathered in Grantline s instrument room The duty man with blanched grim face sat at his senders The Grantline crew shoved close around us There were very few observers in the high powered Earth stations who knew that an exploring party was on the Moon Perhaps none of them The Government officials who had sanctioned the expedition and Halsey and his confreres in the Detective Bureau were not anticipating trouble at this point The Planetara was supposed to be well on her course to Ferrok Shahn It was when she was due to return that Halsey would be alert Grantline used his power far beyond the limits of safety He cut down the lights the telescope intensifiers and television were completely disconnected the ventilators were momentarily stilled so that the air here in the little room crowded with men rapidly grew fetid All to save power pressure that the vital Erentz system might survive Even so it was strained to the danger point Our heat was radiating away the deadly chill of space crept in Again ordered Grantline The duty man flung on the power in rhythmic pulses In the silence the tubes hissed The light sprang through the banks of rotating prisms intensified up the scale until with a vague almost invisible beam it left the last swaying mirror and leaped through our overhead dome and into space Enough said Grantline Switch it off We ll let it go at that for now It seemed that every man in the room had been holding his breath in the chill darkness The lights came on again the Erentz motors accelerated to normal The strain on the walls eased up and the room began warming Had the Earth caught our signal We did not want to waste the power to find out Our receivers were disconnected If an answering signal came we could not know it One of the men said Let s assume they read us He laughed but it was a high pitched tense laugh We don t dare even use the telescope or television Or electron radio Our rescue ship might be right overhead visible to the naked eye before we see it Three days more that s what I ll give it But the three days passed and no rescue ship came The Earth was almost at the full We tried signaling again Perhaps it got through we did not know But our power was weaker now The wall of one of the rooms sprang a leak and the men were hours repairing it I did not say so but never once did I feel that our signals were read on Earth Those cursed clouds The Earth almost everywhere seemed to have poor visibility Four of our eight days of grace were all too soon passed The brigand ship must be half way here by now They were busy days for us If we could have captured Miko and his band our danger would have been less imminent With the treasure insulated and our camp in darkness the arriving brigand ship might never find us But Miko knew our location he would signal his oncoming ship when it was close and lead it to us During those three days and the days which followed them Grantline sent out searching parties But it was unavailing Miko Moa and Coniston with their five underlings could not be found We had at first hoped that the brigands might have perished But that was soon dispelled I went about the third day with the party that was sent to the Planetara We wanted to salvage some of its equipment its unbroken power units And Snap and I had worked out an idea which we thought might be of service We needed some of the Planetara s smaller gravity plate sections Those in Grantline s wrecked little Comet had stood so long that their radiations had gone dead But the Planetara s were still working Our hope that Miko might have perished was dashed He too had returned to the Planetara The evidence was clear before us The vessel was stripped of all its power units save those which were dead and useless The last of the food and water stores were taken The weapons in the chart room the

none	none	projectors and heat rays had vanished Other days passed Earth reached the full and was waning The fourteen day Lunar night was in its last half No rescue ship came from Earth We had ceased our efforts to signal for we needed all our power to maintain ourselves The camp would be in a state of siege before long That was the best we could hope for We had a few short range weapons such as Bensons heat rays and projectors A few hundred feet of effective range was the most any of them could obtain The heat rays in giant form one of the most deadly weapons on Earth were only slowly efficacious on the airless Moon Striking an intensely cold surface their warming radiations were slow to act Even in a blasting heat beam a man in his Erentz helmet suit could withstand the ray for several minutes We were however well equipped with explosives Grantline had brought a large supply for his mining operations and much of it was still unused We had also an ample stock of oxygen fuses and a variety of oxygen light flares in small fragile glass globes It was to use these explosives against the brigands that Snap and I were working out our scheme with the gravity plates The brigand ship would come with giant projectors and some thirty men If we could hold out against them for a time the fact that the Planetara was missing would bring us help from Earth Another day A tenseness was upon all of us despite the absorption of our feverish activities To conserve power the camp was almost dark we lived in dim chill rooms with just a few weak spots of light outside to mark the watchmen on their rounds We did not use the telescope but there was scarcely an hour when one or the other of the men was not sitting on a cross piece up in the dome of the little instrument room casting a tense searching gaze through his glasses into the black starry firmament A ship might appear at any time now a rescue ship from Earth or the brigands from Mars Anita and Venza through these days could aid us very little save by their cheering words They moved about the rooms trying to inspire us so that all the men when they might have been humanly sullen and cursing their fate were turned to grim activity or grim laughter making a joke of the coming siege The morale of the camp now was perfect An improvement indeed over the inactivity of their former peaceful weeks Grantline mentioned it to me Well put up a good fight Haljan These fellows from Mars will know they ve had a task before they ever sail off with the treasure I had many moments alone with Anita I need not mention them It seemed that our love was crossed by the stars with an adverse fate dooming it And Snap and Venza must have felt the same Among the men we were always quietly grimly active But alone I came upon Snap once with his arms around the little Venus girl I heard him say Accursed luck That you and I should find each other too late Venza We could have a lot of fun in Greater New York together Snap we will As I turned away I murmured And pray God so will Anita and I The girls slept together in a small room of the main building Often during the time of sleep when the camp was stilled except for the night watch Snap and I would sit in the corridor near the girls door talking of that time when we would all be back on our blessed Earth Our eight days of grace were passed The brigand ship was due now tomorrow or the next day I recall that night my sleep was fitfully uneasy Snap and I had a cubby together We talked and made futile plans I went to sleep but awakened after a few hours Impending disaster lay heavily upon me But there was nothing abnormal nor unusual in that Snap was asleep I was restless but I did not have the heart to awaken him He needed what little repose he could get I dressed left our cubby and wandered out into the corridor of the main building It was cold in the corridor and gloomy with the weak blue light An interior watchman passed me All as usual Haljan Nothing in sight No They re watching I went through the connecting corridor to the adjacent building In the instrument room several of the men were gathered scanning the vault overhead Nothing Haljan I stayed with them awhile then wandered away An outside man met me near the admission lock chambers of the main building The duty man here sat at his controls raising the air pressure in the locks through which the outside watchman was coming The relief sat here in his bloated suit with his helmet on his knees It was Wilks Nothing yet Haljan I m going up to the peak of the crater to see if anything is in sight I wish that damnable brigand ship would come and get it over with Instinctively we all spoke in half whispers the tenseness bearing in on us The outside man was white and grim but he grinned at Wilks He tried the familiar jest Don t let the Earthlight get you Wilks went out through the ports a process of no more than a minute I wandered away again through the corridors I suppose it was half an hour later that I chanced to be gazing through a corridor window The lights along the rocky cliff were tiny blue spots The head of the stairway leading down to the abyss of the crater floor was visible The bloated figure of Wilks was just coming up I watched him for a moment making his rounds He did not stop to inspect the lights That was routine I thought it odd that he passed them Another minute passed The figure of Wilks went with slow bounds over toward the back of the ledge where the glassite shelter housed the treasure It was all dark off there Wilks went into the gloom but before I lost sight of him he came back As though he had changed his mind he headed for the foot of the staircase which led up the cliff to where at the peak of the little crater five hundred feet above us the narrow observatory was perched He climbed with easy bounds the light on his helmet bobbing in the gloom I stood watching I could not tell why there seemed to be something queer about Wilks actions But I was struck with it nevertheless I watched him disappear over the summit Another minute went by Wilks did not reappear I thought I could make out his light on the platform up there Then abruptly a tiny white beam was waving from the observatory platform It flashed once or twice then was extinguished And now I saw Wilks plainly standing in the Earthlight gazing down Queer actions Had the Earthlight touched him Or was that a local signal call which he sent out Why should Wilks be signaling What was he doing with a hand helio Our watchmen I knew had no reason to carry one And to whom could Wilks be signaling To whom across this Lunar desolation The answer stabbed at me to Miko s band I waited less than a moment No further light Wilks was still up there I went back to the lock entrance Spare helmets and suits were here beside the keeper He gazed at me inquiringly I m going out Franck Just for a minute It struck me that perhaps I was a meddlesome fool Wilks of all of Grantline s men was I knew most in his commander s trust The signal could have been some part of this night s ordinary routine for all I knew I was hastily donning an Erentz suit I added Let me out I just got the idea Wilks is acting strangely I laughed Maybe the Earthlight has touched him With my helmet on I went through the locks Once outside with the outer panel closed behind me I dropped the weights from my belt and shoes and extinguished my helmet light Wilks was still up there Apparently he had not moved I bounded off across the ledge to the foot of the ascending stairs Did Wilks see me coming I could not tell As I approached the stairs the platform was cut off from my line of vision I mounted with bounding leaps In my flexible gloved hand I carried my only weapon a small projector with firing caps for use in this outside near vacuum I held the weapon behind me I would talk to Wilks first I went slowly up the last hundred feet Was Wilks still up there The summit was bathed in Earthlight The little metal observatory platform came into view above my head Wilks was not there Then I saw him standing on the rocks nearby motionless But in a moment 
4598_2503_000035_000000	train-clean-360	he saw me coming 
none	none	I waved my left hand with a gesture of greeting It seemed to me that he started made as though to leap away and then changed his mind I sailed from the head of the staircase with a twenty foot leap and landed lightly beside him I gripped his arm for audiphone contact Wilks Through my visor his face was visible I saw him and he saw me And I heard his voice You Haljan How nice It was not Wilks but the brigand Coniston XXIV The duty man at the exit locks stood at his window and watched me curiously He saw me go up the spider stairs He could see the figure he thought was Wilks standing at the top He saw me join Wilks saw us locked together in combat For a brief instant the duty man stood amazed There were two fantastic figures fighting at the very brink of the cliff They were small dwarfed by distance alternately dim and bright as they swayed in and out of the shadows The duty man could not tell one from the other To him it was Haljan and Wilks fighting to the death The duty man sprang into action An interior siren call was on the instrument panel near him He rang it frantically The men came rushing to him Grantline among them What s this Good God Franck They had seen the silent deadly combat up there on the cliff Grantline stood stricken with amazement That s Wilks And Haljan the duty man gasped He went out something wrong with Wilks actions The interior of the camp was in a turmoil The men awakened from sleep ran out into the corridors shouting questions An attack Is it an attack The brigands But it was Wilks and Haljan in a fight up there on the cliff The men crowded at the bull s eye windows And over all the confusion the alarm siren with no one thinking to shut it off was screaming Grantline momentarily stricken stood gazing One of the figures broke away from the other bounded up to the summit from the stair platform to which they had both fallen The other followed They locked together swaying at the brink For an instant it seemed that they would go over then they surged back momentarily out of sight Grantline found his wits Stop them I ll go out and stop them What fools He was hastily donning one of the Erentz suits Cut off that siren Within a minute Grantline was ready The duty man called from the window Still at it the fools By the infernal they ll kill themselves Franck let me out I ll go with you Commander But the volunteer was not equipped Grantline would not wait The duty man turned to his panel The volunteer shoved a weapon at Grantline Grantline jammed on his helmet took the weapon He moved the few steps into the air chamber which was the first of the three pressure locks Its interior door panel swung open for him But the door did not close after him Cursing the man s slowness he waited a few seconds Then he turned to the corridor The duty man came running Grantline took off his helmet What in hell Broken Dead What Smashed from outside gasped the duty man Look there my tubes The control tubes of the ports had flashed into a short circuit and burned out The admission ports would not open And the pressure controls smashed Broken from outside There was no way now of getting through the pressure locks The doors the entire pressure lock system was dead Had it been tampered with from outside As if to answer Grantline s question there came a chorus of shouts from the men at the corridor windows Commander By God look A figure was outside close to the building Clothed in suit and helmet it stood bloated and gigantic It had evidently been lurking at the port entrance had ripped out the wires there It moved past the windows saw the staring faces of the men and made off with giant bounds Grantline reached the window in time to see it vanish around the building corner It was a giant figure larger than an Earth man A Martian Up on the summit of the crater the two small figures were still fighting All this turmoil had taken no more than a minute or two A lurking Martian outside The brigand Miko More than ever Grantline was determined to get out He shouted to his men to don some of the other suits and called for some of the hand projectors But he could not get out through these main admission ports He could have forced the panels open perhaps but with the pressure changing mechanism broken it would merely let the air out of the corridor A rush of air probably uncontrollable How serious the damage was no one could tell as yet It would perhaps take hours to repair it Grantline was shouting Get those weapons That s a Martian outside The brigand leader probably Get into your suits anyone who wants to go with me We ll go by the manual emergency exit But the prowling Martian had found it Within a minute Grantline was there It was a smaller two lock gateway of manual control so that the person going out could operate it himself It was in a corridor at the other end of the main building But Grantline was too late The lever would not open the panels Had someone gone out this way and broken the mechanisms after him A traitor in the camp Or had someone come in from outside Or had the skulking Martian outside broken this lock as he had broken the other The questions surged on Grantline His men crowded around him The news spread The camp was a prison No one could get out And outside the skulking Martian had disappeared But Wilks and Haljan were still fighting Grantline could see the two figures up on the observatory platform They bounded apart then together again Crazily swaying bouncing striking the rail They went together in a great leap off the platform onto the rocks and rolled in a bright patch of Earthlight First one on top then the other They rolled unheeding to the brink Here beyond the midway ledge which held the camp it was a sheer drop of a thousand feet on down to the crater floor The figures were rolling then one shook himself loose rose up seized the other and with desperate strength shoved him The victorious figure drew back to safety The other fell hurtling down into the shadows past the camp level down out of sight in the darkness of the crater floor Snap who was in the group near Grantline at the window gasped God Was that Gregg who fell No one could say No one answered Outside on the camp ledge another helmeted figure now became visible It was not far from the main building when Grantline first noticed it It was running fast bounding toward the spider staircase It began mounting And now still another figure became visible the giant Martian again He appeared from around the corner of the main Grantline building He evidently saw the winner of the combat on the cliff who now was standing in the Earthlight gazing down And he saw too no doubt the second figure mounting the stairs He stood quite near the window through which Grantline and his men were gazing with his back to the building looking up to the summit Then he ran with tremendous leaps toward the ascending staircase Was it Haljan standing up there on the summit Who was it climbing the stairs And was the third figure Miko Grantline s mind framed the questions But his attention was torn from them and torn even from the swift silent drama outside The corridor was ringing with shouts We re imprisoned Can t get out Was Haljan killed The brigands are outside And then an interior audiphone blared a calling for Grantline Someone in the instrument room of the adjoining building was talking Commander I tried the telescope to see who got killed But he did not say who got killed for he had greater news Commander The brigand ship Miko s reinforcements had come XXV Not Wilks but Coniston His drawling British voice You Gregg Haljan How nice His voice broke off as he jerked his arm from me My hand with the projector came up but with a sweeping blow he struck my wrist The weapon dropped to the rocks I fought instinctively those first moments my mind was whirling with the shock of surprise This was not Wilks but the brigand Coniston It was an eerie combat We swayed shoving kicking wrestling His hold around my middle shut off the Erentz circulation the warning buzz rang in my ears to mingle with the rasp of his curses I flung him off and my Erentz motors recovered He staggered away but in a great leap came at me again I was taller heavier and far stronger than Coniston But I found him crafty and where I was awkward in handling my lightness he seemed more skillfully agile I became aware that we were on the twenty foot square grid of the observatory platform It had a low metal railing We surged against it I caught a dizzying glimpse of the abyss Then it receded as we bounced the other way And then we fell to the grid His helmet bashed against mine striking as though butting with the side of his head to puncture my visor panel His gloved fingers were clutching at my throat As we regained our feet I flung him off and bounded like a diver head first into him He went backward but skillfully kept his feet under him gripped me again and shoved me I was tottering at the head of the staircase falling But I clutched at him We fell some twenty or thirty feet to be next lower spider landing The impact must have dazed us both I recall my vague idea that we must have fallen down the cliff My air shut off then it came again The roaring in my ears was stilled my head cleared and I found that we were on the landing fighting He presently broke away from me bounded to the summit with me after him In the close confines of the suit I was bathed in sweat and gasping I had no thought to increase the oxygen control I could not find it or it would not operate I realized that I was fighting sluggishly almost aimlessly But so was Coniston It seemed dreamlike A phantasmagoria of blows and staggering steps A nightmare with only the horrible vision of this goggled helmet always before my eyes It seemed that we were rolling on the ground back on the summit The unshadowed Earthlight was clear and bright The abyss was beside me Coniston rolling was now on top now under me trying to shove me over the brink It was all like a dream as though I were asleep dreaming that I did not have enough air I strove to keep my senses He was struggling to roll me over the brink God that would not do But I was so tired One cannot fight without oxygen I suddenly knew that I had shaken him off and gained my feet He rose swaying He was as tired confused as nearly asphyxiated as I The brink of the abyss was behind us I lunged desperately shoving avoiding his clutch He went over and fell soundlessly his body whirling end over end down into the shadows far below I drew back My senses faded as I sank panting to the rocks But with inactivity my heart quieted My respiration slowed The Erentz circulation gained on my poisoned air It purified That blessed oxygen My head cleared Strength came I felt better Coniston had fallen to his death I was victor I went to the brink cautiously for I was still dizzy I could see far down there on the crater floor a little patch of Earthlight in which a mashed human figure was lying I staggered back again A moment or two must have passed while I stood there on the summit with my senses clearing and my strength renewed as the blood stream cleared in my veins I was victor Coniston was dead I saw now down on the lower staircase below the camp ledge another goggled figure lying huddled That was Wilks no doubt Coniston had probably caught him there surprised him killed him My attention as I stood gazing went down to the camp buildings Another figure was outside It bounded along the ledge reached the foot of the stairs at the top of which I was standing With agile leaps it came mounting at me Another brigand Miko No it was not large enough to be Miko I was still confused I thought of Hahn But that was absurd Hahn was in the wreck of the Planetara One of the stewards then The figure came up the staircase recklessly to assail me I took a step backward bracing myself to receive this new antagonist And then I looked further down and saw Miko Unquestionably he for there was no mistaking his giant figure He was down on the camp ledge running toward the foot of the stairs I thought of my revolver I turned to try and find it I was aware that the first of my assailants was at the stairhead I swung back to see what this oncoming brigand was doing He was on the summit with a sailing leap he launched for me I could have bounded away but with a last look to locate the revolver I braced myself for the shock The figure hit me It was small and light in my clutching arms I recall I saw that Miko was halfway up the stairs I gripped my assailant The audiphone contact brought a voice Gregg is it you It was Anita XXVI Gregg you re safe She had heard the camp corridors resounding with the shouts that Wilks and Haljan were fighting She had come upon a suit and helmet by the manual emergency lock had run out through the lock confused with her only idea to stop Wilks and me from fighting Then she had seen one of us killed Impulsively barely knowing what she was doing she mounted the stairs frantic to find if I were alive Anita Miko was coming fast She had not seen him for she had no thought of brigands only the belief that either Wilks or I had been killed But now as we stood together on the rocks near the observatory platform I could see the towering figure of Miko nearing the top of the stairs Anita that s Miko We must run Then I saw my projector It lay in a bowl like depression quite near us I jumped for it And as I tore loose from Anita she leaped down after me It was a broken bowl in the rocks some six feet deep It was open on the side facing the stairs a narrow ravinelike gully full of gray broken tumbled rock masses The little gully was littered with crags and boulders But I could see out through it Miko had come to the head of the stairs He stopped there his great figure etched sharply by the Earthlight I think he must have known that Coniston was the one who had fallen over the cliff as my helmet and Coniston s were different enough for him to recognize which was which He did not know who I was but he did know me for an enemy He stood now at the summit peering to see where we had gone He was no more than fifty feet from us Anita lie down I pulled her down on the rocks I took aim with my projector But I had forgotten our helmet lights Miko must have seen them just as I pulled the trigger He jumped sidewise and dropped but I could see him moving in the shadows to where a jutting rock gave him shelter I fired missing him again I had stood up to take aim Anita pulled me sharply down beside her Gregg he s armed It was his turn to fire It came the familiar vague flash of the paralyzing ray It spat its tint of color on the rocks near us but did not reach us A moment later Miko bounded to another rock Time passed only a few seconds I could not see Miko momentarily Perhaps he was crouching perhaps he had moved away again He was or had been on slightly higher ground than the bottom of our bowl It was dim down here where we were lying but I feared that any moment Miko might appear and strike at us His ray at any short range would penetrate our visor panes even though our suits might temporarily resist it Anita it s too dangerous here Had I been alone I might perhaps have leapt up to lure Miko But with Anita I did not dare chance it We ve got to get back to camp I told her Perhaps he has gone But he had not We saw him again out in a distant patch of Earthlight He was further from us than before but on still higher ground We had extinguished our small helmet lights But he knew we were here and possibly he could see us His projector flashed again He was a hundred feet or more away now and his weapon was of no longer range than mine I did not answer his fire for I could not hope to hit him at such a distance and the flash of my weapon would help him to locate us I murmured to Anita We must get away Yet how did I dare take Anita from these concealing shadows Miko could reach us so easily as we bounded away in plain view in the Earthlight of the open summit We were caught at bay in this little bowl The camp was not visible from here But out through the broken gully a white beam of light suddenly came up from below Haljan It spelled the signal It was coming from the Grantline instrument room I knew I could answer it with my helmet light but I did not dare Try it urged Anita We crouched where we thought we might be safe from Miko s fire My little light beam shot up from the bowl It was undoubtedly visible to the camp Yes I am Haljan Send us help I did not mention Anita Miko doubtless could read these signals They answered Cannot I lost the rest of it There came a flash from Miko s weapon It gave us confidence he was unable to reach us at this distance The Grantline beam repeated Cannot come out Ports broken You cannot get in Stay where you are for an hour or two We may be able to repair ports I extinguished my light What use was it to tell Grantline anything further Besides my light was endangering us But the Grantline beam spelled another message Brigand ship is coming It will be here before we can get out to you No lights We will try and hide our location And the signal beam brought a last appeal Miko and his men will divulge where we are unless you can stop them The beam vanished The lights of the Grantline camp made a faint glow that showed above the crater edge The glow died as the camp now was plunged into darkness XXVII We crouched in the shadows the Earthlight filtering down to us The skulking figure of Miko had vanished but I was sure he was out there somewhere on the crags lurking maneuvering to where he could strike us with his ray Anita s metal gloved hand was on my arm in my ear diaphragm her voice sounded eager What was the signal Gregg I told her everything Oh Gregg The Martian ship coming Her mind clung to that as the most important thing But not so myself To me there was only the realization that Anita was caught out here almost at the mercy of Miko s ray Grantline s men could not get out to help us nor could I get Anita into the camp She added Where do you suppose the ship is Twenty or thirty thousand miles up probably The stars and the Earth were visible over us Somewhere up there disclosed by Grantline s instruments but not yet discernible to the naked eye Miko s reinforcements were hovering We lay for a moment in silence It was horribly nerve straining Miko could be creeping up on us Would he dare chance my sudden fire Creeping or would he make a swift unexpected rush The feeling that he was upon us abruptly swept me I jumped to my feet against Anita s effort to hold me Where was he now Was my imagination playing me tricks I sank back That ship should be here in a few hours I told her what Grantline s signal had suggested the ship was hovering overhead It must be fairly close for Grantline s telescope had revealed its identity as an outlaw flyer unmarked by any of the standard code identification lights It was doubtless too far away as yet to have located the whereabouts of Grantline s camp The Martian brigands knew that we were in the vicinity of Archimedes but no more than that Searching this glowing Moon surface our tiny local semaphore beams would certainly pass unnoticed But as the brigand ship approached now dropping close to Archimedes as it probably would our danger was that Miko and his men would then signal it join it and reveal the camp s location And the brigand attack would be upon us I told this now to Anita The signal from Grantline said Unless you can stop them It was an appeal to me But how could I stop them What could I do alone out here with Anita to cope with this enemy Anita made no comment I added That ship will land near Archimedes within an hour or two If Grantline can repair the ports and I can get you inside Again she made no comment Then suddenly she gripped me Gregg look there Out through the gully break in our bowl the figure of Miko showed He was running But not at us Circling the summit leaping to keep himself behind the upstanding crags He passed the head of the staircase he did not descend it but headed off along the summit of the crater rim I stood up to watch him Where s he going I let Anita stand up beside me cautiously at first for it occurred to me it might be a ruse to cover some other of Miko s men who might be lurking near But the summit seemed clear The figure of Miko was a thousand feet away now We could see the tiny blob of it bobbing over the rocks Then it plunged down not into the crater valley but out toward the open Moon surface Miko had abandoned his attack on us The reason seemed plain He had come here from his encampment with Coniston ahead to lure and kill Wilks When this was done Coniston had flashed his signal to Miko who was hiding nearby It was not like the brigand leader to remain in the background Miko was no coward But Coniston could impersonate Wilks whereas Miko s giant stature at once would reveal his identity Miko had been engaged in smashing the ports He had looked up and seen me kill Coniston He had come to assail me And then he had read Grantline s message to me It was his first knowledge that his ship was at hand With the camp exits inoperative Grantline and his men were imprisoned Miko had made an effort to kill me He did not know my companion was Anita But the effort was taking too long with his ship at hand it was Miko s best move to return to his own camp rejoin his men and await their opportunity to signal the ship At least so I reasoned it Anita and I stood alone What could we do We went to the brink of the cliff The unlighted Grantline buildings showed vaguely in the Earthlight I said We ll go down I ll leave you there You can wait at the port They ll repair it soon And what will you do Gregg I did not intend to tell her Hurry Anita Gregg let me go with you She jerked away from me and bounded back up the stairs I caught her on the summit Anita I m going with you You re going to stay here I m not This exasperating controversy Anita please I ll be safer with you than waiting here Gregg And she added Besides I won t stay and you can t make me We ran along the crater top At its distant edge the lower plain spread before us Far down and far away on the distant broken surface the leaping figure of Miko showed He plunged down the broken outer slope reached the level Soon as we ran the little Grantline crater faded behind us Anita ran more skillfully than I Ten minutes or so passed We had seen Miko and the direction he was taking but down here on the plain we could no longer see him It struck me that our chase was purposeless and dangerous Suppose Miko were to see us following him Suppose he stopped and lay in ambush to fire at us as we came leaping heedlessly by Anita wait I drew her down amid a group of tumbled boulders And then abruptly she clung to me Gregg I know what we can do Gregg don t tell me you won t let me try it I listened to her plan Incredible Incredibly dangerous Yet as I pondered it the very daring of the scheme seemed the measure of its possible success The brigands would never imagine we could be so rash But Anita Gregg you re stupid It was her turn to be exasperated But I was in no mood for daring My mind was obsessed with Anita s safety I had been planning that we might see the glow of Miko s encampment and decide on some course of action But Gregg the safety of the treasure of all the Grantline men To the infernal with that It s you your safety My safety then If you put me in the camp and the brigands attack it and I am killed what then But this plan of mine if we can do it Gregg will mean safety in the end for all of us And it seemed possible We crouched discussing it So daring a thing The brigand ship would come down near Archimedes That was fifty miles from Grantline The brigands from Mars would not have seen the dark Grantline buildings hidden in the little crater pit They would wait for Miko and his men to make their whereabouts known Miko s encampment was ahead of us now undoubtedly We had been following him toward the Mare Imbrium Or at least we hoped so He would signal his ship But Anita and I closer to it would also signal it and posing as brigands would join it Remember Gregg I remain Anita Prince George s sister Her voice trembled as she mentioned her dead brother They know that George was in Miko s pay and I as his sister will help to convince them This daring scheme If we could join the ship we might be able to persuade its leader that Miko s distant signals were merely a ruse of Grantline to lure the brigands in that direction A long range projector from the ship would kill Miko and his men as they came forward to join it And then we would falsely direct the brigands lead them away from Grantline and the treasure Gregg we must try it Heaven help me I yielded to her persuasion We turned at right angles and ran toward where the distant frowning walls of Archimedes loomed against the starlit sky XXVIII 
5009-2500-0000	train-other-500	The broken shaggy ramparts of the giant crater rose above us We toiled upward out of the foothills clinging now to the crags and pitted terraces of the main ascent An hour had passed since we turned from the borders of Mare Imbrium
5009-2500-0001	train-other-500	Or was it two hours I could not tell I only know that we ran with desperate frantic haste Anita would not admit that she was tired She was more skillful than I in this leaping over the broken rock masses
5009-2500-0002	train-other-500	Yet I felt that her slight strength must give out It seemed miles up the undulating slopes of the foothills with the black and white ramparts of the crater close before us And then the main ascent
5009-2500-0003	train-other-500	There were places where like smooth black frozen ice the walls rose sheer We avoided them toiling aside plunging into gullies crossing pits where sometimes perforce we went downwards and then up again
5009-2500-0004	train-other-500	Or sometimes we stood hot and breathless upon ledges recovering our strength selecting the best route upward In tumbled mass of rock honeycombed everywhere with caves and passages leading into impenetrable darkness
none	none	 there were pits into which we might so easily have fallen ravines to span sometimes with a leap sometimes by a long and arduous detour Endless climb We came to the ledge with the plains of the Mare Imbrium stretching out beneath us 
5009-2500-0005	train-other-500	We might have been upon this main ascent for an hour the plains were far down the broken surface down there smoothed now by the perspective of height And yet still above us the brooding circular wall went up into the sky
5009-2500-0006	train-other-500	Ten thousand feet above us You re tired Anita We d better stay here No If we could only get to the top the ship may land on the other side they would see us There was as yet no sign of the brigand ship
5009-2500-0007	train-other-500	With every stop for rest we searched the starry vault The Earth hung over us flattened beyond the full
none	none	 The stars blazed to mingle with the Earthlight and illumine these massive crags 
5009-2500-0008	train-other-500	of the Archimedes walls But no speck appeared to tell us that the ship was up there We were on the curving side of the Archimedes wall which fronted the Mare Imbrium to the north The plains lay Like a great frozen sea
5009-2500-0009	train-other-500	congealed ripples shining in the light of the Earth with dark patches to mark the hollows Somewhere down there six or eight thousand feet below us now Miko s encampment lay concealed We searched for lights of it but could see none
none	none	 Had Miko rejoined his party 
5009-2500-0010	train-other-500	left his camp and come here like ourselves to climb Archimedes Or was our assumption wholly wrong perhaps the brigand ship would not land near here at all
none	none	 Sweeping around from the Mare Imbrium 
5009-2500-0011	train-other-500	the plains were less smooth The little crater which concealed the Grantline camp was off in the crater scarred region beyond which the distant Apennines raised their terraced walls There was nothing to mark it from here
none	none	 Gregg do you see anything up there 
5009-2500-0012	train-other-500	She added There seems to be a blur Her sight sharper than mine had picked it out The descending brigand ship A faintest tiny blur against the stars a few of them occulted
5009-2500-0013	train-other-500	as though an invisible shadow were upon them A growing shadow materializing into a blur a blob a shape faintly defined Then sharper until we were sure of what we saw It was the brigand ship
5009-2500-0014	train-other-500	It was dropping slowly silently down We crouched on the little ledge A cave mouth was behind us A gully was beside us a break in the ledge and at our feet the sheer wall dropped
5009-2500-0015	train-other-500	We had extinguished our lights We crouched silently gazing up into the stars The ship when we first distinguished it was centered over Archimedes We thought for a while that it might descend into the crater But it did not
none	none	 it came sailing forward I whispered into the audiphone It s coming over the crater Her hand pressed my arm in answer I recalled that when from the Planetara 
5009-2500-0016	train-other-500	Miko had forced Snap to signal this brigand band on Mars Miko s only information as to the whereabouts of the Grantline camp was that it lay between Archimedes and the Apennines The brigands now were following that information
5009-2500-0017	train-other-500	A tense interval passed We could see the ship plainly above us now a gray black shape among the stars up beyond the shaggy towering crater rim The vessel came upon a level keel hull down Slowly circling
5009-2500-0018	train-other-500	looking for Miko s signal no doubt or for possible lights from Grantline s camp They might also be picking a landing place We saw it soon as a cylindrical cigarlike shape rather smaller than the Planetara but similar of design
5009-2500-0019	train-other-500	It bore lights now The ports of its hull were tiny rows of illumination and the glow of light under its rounding upper dome was faintly visible A bandit ship no doubt of that Its identification keel plate was empty of official pass code lights
5009-2500-0020	train-other-500	These brigands had not attempted to secure official sailing lights when leaving Ferrok Shahn It was unmistakably an outlaw ship And here upon the deserted Moon there was no need for secrecy Its lights were openly displayed
none	none	 that Miko might see it 
5009-2500-0021	train-other-500	and join it It went slowly past us only a few thousand feet higher than our level We could see the whole outline of its pointed cylinder hull with the rounded dome on top And under the dome was its open deck with a little cabin superstructure in the center
5009-2500-0022	train-other-500	I thought for a moment that by some unfortunate chance it might land quite near us But it went past And then I saw that it was heading for a level plateaulike surface a few miles further on It dropped cautiously floating down
none	none	 There was still no sign of Miko 
5009-2500-0023	train-other-500	But I realized that haste was necessary We must be the first to join the brigand ship I lifted Anita to her feet I don t think we should signal from here
none	none	 No Miko might see it 
5009-2500-0024	train-other-500	We could not tell where he was Down on the plains perhaps Or up here somewhere in these miles of towering rocks Are you ready Anita Yes Gregg
5009-2500-0025	train-other-500	I stared through the visors at her white solemn face Yes I m ready she repeated Her hand pressure seemed to me suddenly like a farewell We were plunging rashly into what was destined to mean our death
5009-2500-0026	train-other-500	Was this a farewell An instinct told me not to do this thing Why in a few hours I could have Anita back to the comparative safety of the Grantline camp The exit ports would doubtless be repaired by now
5009-2500-0027	train-other-500	I could get her inside She had bounded away from me leaped down some thirty feet into the broken gully to cross it and then up on the other side I stood for an instant watching her fantastic shape with the great rounded goggled trunked helmet
5009-2500-0028	train-other-500	and the lump on her shoulders which held the little Erentz motors Then I hurried after her It did not take us long two or three miles of circling along the giant wall The ship lay only a few hundred feet above our level
none	none	 We stood at last on a buttelike pinnacle 
5009-2500-0029	train-other-500	The lights of the ship were close over us And there were moving lights up there tiny moving spots on the adjacent rocks The brigands had come out prowling about to investigate their location
none	none	 No signal yet from Miko But it might come at any moment 
5009-2500-0030	train-other-500	I ll flash now I whispered Yes
none	none	 The brigands had probably not yet seen us 
5009-2500-0031	train-other-500	I took the lamp from my helmet My hand was trembling Suppose my signal were answered by a shot A flash from some giant projector mounted on the ship Anita crouched behind a rock as she had promised
5009-2500-0032	train-other-500	I stood with my torch and flung its switch My puny light beam shot up I waved it touched the ship with its faint glowing circle of illumination They saw me There was a sudden movement among the lights up there I semaphored
none	none	 I am from Miko 
5009-2500-0033	train-other-500	Do not fire I used open universal code In Martian first and then in English There was no answer but no attack I tried again This is Haljan one of the Planetara
5009-2500-0034	train-other-500	George Prince s sister is with me
none	none	 There has been disaster to Miko 
5009-2500-0035	train-other-500	A small light beam came down from the brink of the overhead cliff beside the ship Continue I went steadily on Disaster the Planetara is wrecked
5009-2500-0036	train-other-500	All killed but me and Prince s sister We want to join you I flashed off my light The answer came Where is the Grantline Camp
none	none	 Near here The Mare Imbrium 
5009-2500-0037	train-other-500	As though to answer my lie from down on the Earthlit plains some ten miles or so from the crater base a tiny signal light shot up Anita saw it and gripped me There is Miko s light
5009-2500-0038	train-other-500	It spelled in Martian Come down Land
none	none	 Mare Imbrium 
5009-2500-0039	train-other-500	Miko had seen the signaling up here and had joined it He repeated Land Mare Imbrium I flashed a protest up to the ship Beware That is Grantline Trickery
5009-2500-0040	train-other-500	From the ship the summons came Come up We had won this first encounter Miko must have realized his disadvantage His distant light went out Come Anita
5009-2500-0041	train-other-500	There was no retreat now But again I seemed to feel in the pressure of her hand that vague farewell Her voice whispered We must do our best act our best to be convincing
5009-2500-0042	train-other-500	In the white glow of a searchbeam we climbed the crags reached the broad upper ledge Helmeted figures rushed at us searched us for weapons seized our helmet lights The evil face of a giant Martian peered at me through the visors
5009-2500-0043	train-other-500	Two other monstrous towering figures seized Anita We were shoved toward the port locks at the base of the ship s hull Above the hull bulge I could see the grids of projectors mounted on the dome side
5009-2500-0044	train-other-500	and the figures of men standing on the deck peering down at us We went through the admission locks into a hull corridor
none	none	 up an incline passage and reached the lighted deck The Martian brigands crowded around us XXIX Anita s words echoed in my memory We must do our best to be convincing It was not her ability that I doubted as much as my own She had played the part of George Prince cleverly unmasked only by an evil chance I steeled myself to face the searching glances of the brigands as they shoved around us This was a desperate game into which we had plunged For all our acting how easy it would be for some small chance thing abruptly to undo us I realized it and now as I gazed into the peering faces of these men from Mars I cursed myself for the witless rashness which had brought Anita into this The brigands some ten or fifteen of them here on deck stood in a ring around us They were all big men nearly of a seven foot average dressed in leather jerkins and short leather breeches with bare knees and flaring leather boots Piratical swaggering fellows knife blades mingled with small hand projectors fastened to their belts Gray heavy faces some with scraggly unshaven beards They plucked at us jabbering in Martian One of them seemed the leader I said sharply Are you the commander here You speak the Earth English
4598_2503_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes he said 
none	none	readily I am commander here He spoke English with the same freedom and accent as Miko Is this George Prince s sister Yes Her name is Anita Prince Tell your men to take their hands off her He waved his men away They all seemed more interested in Anita than in me He added I am Set Potan He addressed Anita George Prince s sister You are called Anita I have heard of you I knew your brother indeed you look very much like him He swept his plumed hat to the grid with a swaggering gesture of homage A courtierlike fellow this debonair as a Venus cavalier He accepted us I realized that Anita s presence was extremely valuable in making us convincing Yet there was about this Potan as with Miko a disturbing suggestion of irony I could not make him out I decided that we had fooled him Then I remarked the steely glitter of his eyes as he turned to me You were an officer of the Planetara The insignia of my rank was visible on my white jacket collar which showed beneath the Erentz suit now that my helmet was off Yes I was supposed to be But a year ago I embarked upon this adventure with Miko He was leading us to his cabin The Planetara wrecked Miko dead And Hahn and Coniston George Prince too We are the only survivors While we divested ourselves of the Erentz suits at his command I told him briefly of the Planetara s fall All had been killed on board save Anita and me We had escaped awaited his coming The treasure was here we had located the Grantline camp and were ready to lead him to it Did he believe me He listened quietly He seemed not shocked at the death of his comrades Nor yet pleased merely imperturbable I added with a sly sidelong glance There were too many of us on the Planetara The purser had joined us and many of the crew And there was Miko s sister the Setta Moa too many The treasure divides better among less An amused smile played on his thin gray lips But he nodded The fear which had leaped at me was allayed by his next words True enough Haljan He was a domineering fellow Miko A third of it all was for him alone But now The third would go to this sub leader Potan The implication was obvious I said Before we go any further I can trust you for my share Of course I figured that my very boldness in bargaining so prematurely would convince him I insisted Miss Prince will have her brother s share Clever Anita She put in swiftly Oh I give no information until you promise We know the location of the Grantline camp its weapons its defences the amount and location of the treasure I warn you if you do not play us fair He laughed heartily He seemed to like us He spread his huge legs as he lounged in his settle and drank of the bowl which one of his men set before him Little tigress Fear me not I play fair He pushed two of the bowls across the table Drink Haljan All is well with us and I am glad to know it Miss Prince drink my health as your leader I waved it away from Anita We need all our wits your strong Martian drinks are dangerous Look here I ll tell you just how the situation stands I plunged into a glib account of our supposed wanderings to find the Grantline camp its location off the Mare Imbrium hidden in a cavern there Potan with the drink and under the gaze of Anita s eyes was in high good humor He laughed when I told him that we had dared to invade the Grantline camp had smashed its exit ports had even gotten up to have a look where the treasure was piled Well done Haljan You re a fellow to my liking But his gaze was on Anita You dress like a man or a charming boy She still wore the dark clothes of her brother She said I am used to action Man s garb pleases me You shall treat me like a man and give me my share of gold leaf He had already demanded the reason for the signal from the Mare Imbrium Miko s signal It had not come again though any moment I feared it I told him that Grantline doubtless had repaired his damaged ports and sallied out to assail me in reprisal And seeing the brigand ship landing on Archimedes had tried to lure him into a trap I wondered if my explanation was convincing it did not sound so But he was flushed now with drink and Anita added Grantline knows the territory near his camp very well But he is equipped only for short range fighting I took it up It s like this Potan if he could get you to land unsuspectingly near his cavern I pictured how Grantline might have figured on a sudden surprise attack upon the ship It was his only chance to catch it unprepared We were all three in friendly intimate mood now Potan said We ll land down there right enough But I need a few hours for my assembling He will not dare advance I said Anita put in smiling He knows by now that we have unmasked his lure Haljan and I joining you that silenced him His light went out very promptly didn t it She flashed me a side gaze Were we acting convincingly But if Miko started up his signals again they might so quickly betray us Anita s thoughts were upon that for she added Grantline will not dare show his light If he does Set Potan we can blast him from here with a ray Can t we Yes Potan agreed If he comes within ten miles I have one powerful enough We are assembling it now And we have thirty men Anita persisted When we sail down to attack him it should not be difficult to kill all the Grantline party By heaven Haljan this girl of yours is small but very bloodthirsty And I m glad Miko is dead Anita added I explained That accursed Miko murdered her brother Acting And never once did we dare relax If only Miko s signals would hold off and give us time We may have talked for half an hour We were in a small steel lined cubby located in the forward deck of the ship The dome was over it I could see from where I sat at the table that there was a forward observatory tower under the dome quite near here The ship was laid out in rather similar fashion to the Planetara though considerably smaller Potan had dismissed his men from the cubby so as to be alone with us Out on the deck I could see them dragging apparatus about bringing the mechanisms of giant projectors up from below and beginning to assemble them Occasionally some of the men would come to our cubby windows to peer in curiously My mind was roaming as I talked For all my manner of casualness I knew that haste was necessary Whatever Anita and I were to do must be quickly done But to win this fellow s utter confidence first was necessary so that we might have the freedom of the ship might move about unnoticed unwatched I was horribly tense inside Through the dome windows across the deck from the cubby the rocks of the Lunar landscape were visible I could see the brink of this ledge upon which the ship lay the descending crags down the precipitous wall of Archimedes to the Earthlit plains far below Miko Moa and a few of the Planetara s crew were down there somewhere Anita and I had a fairly definite plan We were now in Potan s confidence this interview at an end I felt that our status among the brigands would be established We would be free to move about the ship join in its activities It ought to be possible to locate the signal room get friendly with the operator there Perhaps we could find a secret opportunity to flash a signal to Earth This ship I was confident would have the power for a long range signal if not of too sustained a length It would be a desperate thing to attempt but our whole procedure was desperate Anita could lure the duty man from the signal room I might send a single flash or two that would reach the Earth Just a distress signal signed Grantline If I could do that and not get caught Anita was engaging Potan in talking of his plans The brigand leader was boasting of them of his well equipped ship the daring of his men And questioning her about the size of the treasure My thoughts were free to roam While we were making friends with this brigand the longest range electronic projector was being assembled Miko then could flash his signal and be damned to him I would be on the deck with that projector Its operator and I would turn it upon Miko one flash of it and he and his little band would be wiped out But there was our escape to be thought of We could not remain very long with these brigands We could tell them that the Grantline camp was on the Mare Imbrium It would delay them for a time but our lie would soon be discovered We must escape from them get away and back to Grantline With Miko dead a distress signal to Earth and Potan in ignorance of Grantline s location the treasure would be safe until help arrived from Earth By the infernal little Anita you look like a dove but you re a tigress A comrade after my own heart bloodthirsty as a fire worshipper Her laugh rang out to mingle with his Oh no Set Potan I am treasure thirsty We ll get the treasure Never fear little Anita With you to lead us I m sure we will A man entered the cubby Potan looked frowningly around What is it Argle The fellow answered in Martian leered at Anita and withdrew Potan stood up I noticed that he was unsteady with the drink They want me with the work at the projectors Go ahead I said He nodded We were comrades now Amuse yourself Haljan Or come out on deck if you wish I will tell my men you are one of us And tell them to keep their hands off Miss Prince He stared at me I had not thought of that a woman among so many men His own gaze at Anita was as offensive as any of his men could have given He said Have no fear little tigress Anita laughed I m afraid of nothing But when he had lurched from the cabin she touched me Smiled with her mannish swagger for fear we were still observed and murmured Oh Gregg I am afraid We stayed in the cubby a few moments whispering and planning You think the signal room is in the tower Gregg This tower outside our window here Yes I think so Shall we go out and see Yes Keep near me always Oh Gregg I will We deposited our Erentz suits carefully in a corner of the cubby We might need them so suddenly Then we swaggered out to join the brigands working on the deck XXX The deck glowed lurid in the queer blue greenish glare of Martian electro fuse lights It was in a bustle of ordered activity Some twenty of the crew were scattered about working in little groups Apparatus was being brought up from below to be assembled There was a pile of Erentz suits and helmets of Martian pattern but still very similar to those with which Grantline s expedition was equipped There were giant projectors of several kinds some familiar to me others of a fashion I had never seen before It seemed there were six or eight of them still dismantled with a litter of their attendant batteries and coils and tube amplifiers They were to be mounted here on the deck I surmised I saw in the dome side one or two of them already rolled into position Anita and I stood outside Potan s cubby gazing around us curiously The men looked at us but none of them spoke Let s watch from here a moment I whispered She nodded standing with her hand on my arm I felt that we were very small here in the midst of these seven foot Martian men I was all in white the costume used in the warm interior of Grantline s camp Bareheaded white silk Planetara uniform jacket broad belt and tight laced trousers Anita was a slim black figure beside me somber as Hamlet with her pale boyish face and wavy black hair The gravity being maintained here on the ship we had found to be stronger than that of the Moon and rather more like Mars There are the heat rays Gregg A pile of them was visible down the deck length And I saw caskets of fragile glass globes bombs of different styles hand projectors of the paralyzing ray search beams of several varieties the Benson curve light and a few side arms of ancient Earth design swords and dirks and small bullet projectors There seemed to be some mining equipment also Far along the deck beyond the central cabin in the open space of the stern steel rails were stacked half a dozen tiny wheeled ore carts a tiny motor engine for hauling them and what looked as though it might be the dismembered sections of an ore chute The whole deck was presently strewn with this mass of equipment Potan moved about directing the different groups of workers The news had spread that we knew the location of the treasure The brigands were jubilant In a few hours the ship s armament would be ready and it would advance I saw many glances cast out the dome side windows toward the distant plains of the Mare Imbrium The brigands believed that the Grantline camp lay in that direction Anita whispered Which is their giant electronic projector Gregg I could see it amidships of the deck It was already in place Potan was there now superintending the men who were connecting it The most powerful weapon on the ship It had Potan said an effective range of some ten miles I wondered what it would do to a Grantline building The Erentz double walls would withstand it for a time I was sure But it would blast an Erentz fabric suit no doubt of that Like a lightning bolt it would kill its flashing free stream of electrons shocking the heart bringing instant death I whispered We must smash that before we leave But first turn it on Miko if he signals now I was tensely watchful for that signal The electronic projector obviously was not ready But when it was connected I must be near it to persuade its duty man to fire it on Miko With this done we would have more time to plan our other tasks I did not think Potan would be ready for his attack before another time of sleep here in the ship s routine Things would be quieter then I would watch my chance to send a signal to Earth and then we would escape With my thoughts roving we had been standing quietly at the cubby door for about fifteen minutes My hand in my side pouch clutched the little bullet projector The brigands had taken it from me and given it to Potan He had placed it on the settle with my Erentz suit and when we gained his confidence he had forgotten it and left it there I had it now and the feel of its cool sleek handle gave me a measure of comfort Things could go wrong so easily But if they did I was determined to sell my life as dearly as possible And a vague thought was in my mind I must not use the last bullet That would be for Anita That electronic projector is remote controlled Look Anita that s the signal room over us The giant projector will be aimed and fired from up there A thirty foot skeleton tower stood on the deck near us with a spiral ladder leading up to a small square steel cubby at the top Through the cubby window I could see instrument panels A single Martian was up there he had called down to Potan concerning the electronic projector The roof of this little tower room was close under the dome a space of no more than four feet A pressure lock exit in the dome was up there with a few steps leading up to it from the roof of the tower signal room We could escape that way perhaps In the event of dire necessity it might be possible But only as a desperate resort for it would put us on the top of the glassite dome with a sheer hundred feet or more down its sleek bulging exterior side and down the outside bulge of the ship s hull to the rocks below There might be a spider ladder outside leading downward but I saw no evidence of it If Anita and I were forced to escape that way I wondered how we could manage a hundred foot jump to the rocks and land safely Even with the slight gravity of the Moon it would be a dangerous fall You are Gregg Haljan I stared as one of the brigands coming up behind addressed me Yes Commander Potan tells me you were chief navigator of the Planetara Yes You shall pilot us when we advance upon the Grantline camp I am control commander here Brotow my name He smiled A giant fellow but spindly He spoke good English He seemed anxious to be friendly We are glad to have you and George Prince s sister with us He shot Anita an admiring glance I will show you our controls Haljan All right I said Whatever I can do to help But not now It will be some hours before we are ready I nodded and he wandered away Anita whispered Did he mean that signal room up in the tower Oh Gregg maybe it s only the control room Suppose we go up and see Miko s signals might start any minute And the electronic projector seemed about ready It was time for me to act But a reluctant instinct was upon me Our Erentz suits were close behind us in Potan s cubby I hated to leave them If anything happened and we had to make a sudden dash there would be no time to garb ourselves in the suits To adjust the helmets would be bad enough I whispered swiftly We must get into our suits find some pretext I drew her back through the cubby doorway where we would be more secluded Anita listen I ve been a fool not to plan our escape more carefully We re in too great a danger here Suddenly it seemed to me that we were in desperate plight Was it premonition Anita listen if anything happens and we have to make a dash Up through that dome lock Gregg It s a manual control you can see the levers Yes It s a manual But once up there how would we get down She was far calmer than I There may be an outside ladder Gregg I don t think so I haven t seen it Then we can get out the way they brought us in The hull port it s a manual too Yes I think I can find our way down through the hull corridors There are guards outside on the rocks We had seen them through the dome windows But there were not many only two or three I was armed and a surprise rush would do the trick We donned our Erentz suits What will we do with the helmets demanded Anita Leave them here No take them with us I m not going to get separated from them We ll look strange going up to that signal room equipped like this I can t help it Anita We ll explain it somehow She stood before me a queer looking little figure in the now deflated bagging suit with her slim neck and head protruding above it Carry your helmet Anita Ill take mine We could adjust the helmets and start the motors all within a few seconds I m ready
4598_2503_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 Gregg Come 
none	none	on then Let me go first I had the bullet projector in an outer pouch of the suit where I could instantly reach it This was more rational we had a fighting chance now The fear which had swept me began to recede We ll climb the tower to the signal room I whispered Do it boldly We stepped from the cubby Potan was not in sight perhaps he was on the further deck beyond the central cabin structure On the deck we were immediately accosted This was different our appearance in the Erentz suits Where are you going This fellow spoke in Martian I answered in English Up there He stood before us towering over me I saw a group of nearby workers stop to regard us In a moment we would be causing a commotion and it was the last thing I desired I said in Martian Commander Potan told me what I wish I can do From the dome we look around to see where is the Grantline camp from here I am pilot of this ship to go there The man who had called himself Brotow passed near us I appealed to him We put on our suits After our experience we feel safer that way If I m to pilot the ship He hesitated his glance sweeping the deck as though to ask Potan Someone said in Martian The Commander is down in the stern storeroom It decided Brotow He waved away the Martian who had stopped me Let them pass Anita and I gave him our most friendly smiles Thanks He bowed to Anita with a sweeping gesture I will show you over the control room presently His gaze went to the peak of the bow The little hooded cubby there was the control room then Satisfaction swept me Then above us in the tower must surely be the signal room Would Brotow follow us up I hoped not I wanted to be alone with the duty man up there giving me a chance to get at the projector controls if Miko s signal should come I drew Anita past Brotow who had stood aside Thanks I repeated We won t be long We mounted the little ladder XXXI Hurry Anita I feared that Potan might come up from the hull at any moment and stop us The duty man over us gazed down his huge head and shoulders blocking the small signal room window Brotow called up in Martian telling him to let us come 
4598_2503_000003_000003	train-clean-360	He scowled but when we reached the trap in the room floor grid we found him standing aside to admit us 
4598_2503_000004_000000	train-clean-360	I flung a swift glance around 
4598_2503_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It was a metallic cubby not much over fifteen feet square with an eight foot arched ceiling 
4598_2503_000004_000002	train-clean-360	There were instrument panels 
4598_2503_000004_000003	train-clean-360	The range finder for the giant projector was here its telescope with the trajectory apparatus and the firing switch were unmistakable 
4598_2503_000004_000004	train-clean-360	And the signaling apparatus was here 
none	none	Not a Martian set but a fully powerful Botz ultra violet sender with its attendant receiving mirrors The Planetara had used the Botz system so I was thoroughly familiar with it 
4598_2503_000005_000000	train-clean-360	I saw too what seemed to be weapons a row of small fragile glass globes hanging on clips along the wall bombs each the size of a man s fist 
4598_2503_000005_000001	train-clean-360	And a broad belt with bombs in its padded compartments 
none	none	My heart was pounding as my first quick glance took in these details I saw also that the room had four small oval window openings They were breast high above the floor from the deck below I knew that the angle of vision was such that the men down there could not see into this room except to glimpse its upper portion near the ceiling And the helio set was banked on a low table near the floor In a corner of the room a small ladder led through a ceiling trap to the cubby roof 
4598_2503_000007_000001	train-clean-360	This upper trap was open 
4598_2503_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Four feet above the room s roof was the arch of the dome with the entrance to the exit lock directly above us 
none	none	The weapons and the belt of bombs were near the ascending ladder evidently placed here as equipment for use from the top of the dome I turned to the solitary duty man 
4598_2503_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I must gain his confidence at once Anita had laid her helmet aside 
4598_2503_000008_000002	train-clean-360	She spoke first 
none	none	We were with Set Miko she said smilingly in the wreck of the Planetara 
4598_2503_000009_000001	train-clean-360	You heard of it 
4598_2503_000009_000002	train-clean-360	We know where the treasure is 
none	none	This duty man was a full seven feet tall and the most heavy set Martian I had ever seen 
4598_2503_000010_000001	train-clean-360	A tremendous beetle browed scowling fellow He stood with hands on his hips his leather garbed legs spread wide and as I confronted him I felt like a child 
none	none	He was silent glaring down at me as I drew his attention from Anita
4598_2503_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 You speak English I asked 
4598_2503_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 We are not skilled with Martian 
none	none	I wondered if at the next time of sleep this fellow would be on duty here 
4598_2503_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I hoped not it would not be easy to trick him and find an opportunity to flash a signal 
4598_2503_000013_000002	train-clean-360	But that task was some hours away as yet I would worry about it when the time came 
none	none	Just now I was concerned with Miko and his little band who at any moment might arrive in sight 
4598_2503_000013_000004	train-clean-360	If we could persuade this duty man to turn the projector on them 
none	none	He answered me in ready English You are the man Gregg Haljan 
4598_2503_000015_000001	train-clean-360	And this is the sister of George Prince what do you want up here 
4598_2503_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I am a navigator 
none	none	Brotow wants me to pilot the ship when we advance to attack Grantline
4598_2503_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 This is not the control room 
none	none	No I know it isn t I put my helmet carefully on the floor beside Anita s I straightened to find the brigand gazing at her 
4598_2503_000019_000002	train-clean-360	He did not speak he was still scowling 
none	none	But in the dim blue glow of the cubby I caught the look in his eyes I said hastily Grantline knows your ship has landed here on Archimedes His camp is off there on the Mare Imbrium 
4598_2503_000020_000002	train-clean-360	He sent up a signal you saw it didn t you just before Miss Prince and I came aboard 
4598_2503_000020_000003	train-clean-360	He was trying to pretend he was your Earth party Miko and Coniston 
none	none	Why 
4598_2503_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The fellow turned his scowl on me but Anita brought his gaze back to her 
4598_2503_000022_000001	train-clean-360	She put in quickly 
none	none	Grantline as brother always said has no great cunning I believe now he plans to creep up on us unawares by pretending that he is Miko If he does that I said we will turn this electronic projector on him and his party and annihilate them 
4598_2503_000024_000001	train-clean-360	You have its firing mechanism here 
none	none	Who told you so he shot at me 
4598_2503_000026_000000	train-clean-360	I gestured 
4598_2503_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 I see it here 
4598_2503_000026_000002	train-clean-360	It s obvious I m skilled at trajectory firing 
none	none	If Grantline appears down there now I ll help you
4598_2503_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it connected Anita demanded boldly 
none	none	Yes he said You have on your Erentz suits are you going to the dome roof Then go 
4598_2503_000029_000000	train-clean-360	But that was what we did not want to do 
none	none	Anita s glance seemed to tell me to let her handle this I turned toward one of the cubby windows 
4598_2503_000030_000000	train-clean-360	She said sweetly Are you in charge of this room 
4598_2503_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Show me how the projector is operated 
none	none	I know it will be invincible against the Grantline camp 
4598_2503_000031_000000	train-clean-360	I had my back to them for a moment 
none	none	Through the breast high oval I could see down across the deck space and out through the side dome windows 
4598_2503_000031_000002	train-clean-360	And my heart suddenly leaped into my throat 
4598_2503_000031_000003	train-clean-360	It seemed that down there in the Earthlit shadows where the spreading base of the giant crater joined the plains a light was bobbing 
4598_2503_000031_000004	train-clean-360	I gazed stricken 
4598_2503_000031_000005	train-clean-360	Miko s lights 
none	none	Was he advancing preparing to signal 
4598_2503_000031_000007	train-clean-360	I tried to gauge the distance it was not over two miles from here 
none	none	Or was it not a light at all 
4598_2503_000032_000001	train-clean-360	With the naked eye I could not be sure Perhaps there was a telescope finder here in the cubby 
none	none	I was subconsciously aware of the voices of Anita and the duty man behind me Then abruptly I heard Anita s low cry I whirled around The giant Martian had gathered her into his huge arms his heavy jowled gray face with a leering grin close to hers He saw me coming 
4598_2503_000035_000001	train-clean-360	He held her with one arm his other flung at me caught me knocked me backward 
none	none	He rasped Get out of here 
4598_2503_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Go up to the dome 
none	none	Anita was silently struggling with her little hands at his thick throat His blow flung me against a settle But I held my feet I was partly behind him I leaped again and as he tried to disengage himself from Anita to front me her clutching fingers impeded him My projector was in my hand But in that second as I leaped I had the sense to realize I should not fire it because its noise would alarm the ship 
4598_2503_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I grasped its barrel reached upward and struck with its heavy metal butt 
none	none	The blow caught the Martian on the skull and simultaneously my body struck him 
4598_2503_000039_000000	train-clean-360	We went down together falling partly upon Anita 
none	none	But the giant had not cried out and as I gripped him now I felt his body go limp 
4598_2503_000039_000002	train-clean-360	I lay panting 
none	none	Anita squirmed silently from under us 
4598_2503_000039_000004	train-clean-360	Blood from the giant s head was welling out hot and sticky against my face as I lay sprawled on him 
none	none	I cast him off 
4598_2503_000040_000001	train-clean-360	He was dead his fragile Martian skull split open by my blow 
4598_2503_000041_000000	train-clean-360	There had been no alarm 
none	none	The slight noise we made had not been heard down on the busy deck 
4598_2503_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Anita and I crouched by the floor 
none	none	From the deck all this part of the room could not be seen Dead Oh Gregg 
4598_2503_000044_000000	train-clean-360	It forced our hand 
none	none	I could not wait now for Miko to come But I could flash the Earth signal now and then we would have to make our run to escape Then I remembered that light down by the base I kept Anita out of sight down on the floor and went cautiously to a window The deck was in turmoil with brigands moving about excitedly Not because of what had happened in our tower signal room they were unaware of that Miko s signals were showing I could see them now plainly down at the crater base A group of hand lights and small waving helio beam 
4598_2503_000047_000000	train-clean-360	And they were being answered from the ship 
none	none	Potan was on the deck a babble of voices above which his rose with roars of command At one of the dome windows a brigand with a hand searchbeam was sending its answering light And I saw that Potan was working over a deck telescope finder It had all come so suddenly that I was stunned But I did not wait to read the signals I swung back at Anita who stared helplessly at me It s Miko 
4598_2503_000049_000001	train-clean-360	And they are answering him 
4598_2503_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Get your helmet I ll try firing the projector 
none	none	Or would I instead try and send a brief flash signal to Earth 
4598_2503_000050_000001	train-clean-360	There would be no time to do both we must escape out of here 
none	none	The route up through the dome was the only feasible one now This range mechanism of the projector was reasonably familiar and I felt that I could operate it The range finder and the switch were on a ledge at one of the windows 
4598_2503_000051_000002	train-clean-360	I rushed to it 
none	none	As I swung the telescope training it down on Miko s lights I could see the huge projector on the deck swinging similarly Its movement surprised the men who were attending it 
4598_2503_000051_000005	train-clean-360	One of them called up to me but I ignored him 
4598_2503_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Then Potan looked up and saw me 
4598_2503_000052_000001	train-clean-360	He shouted in Martian at the duty man whom he doubtless thought was behind me Be ready 
4598_2503_000052_000002	train-clean-360	We may fire on them 
4598_2503_000052_000003	train-clean-360	I ll give you the word 
4598_2503_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The signals were proceeding 
4598_2503_000053_000001	train-clean-360	It had only been a moment 
none	none	I caught something like Haljan is imposter 
4598_2503_000054_000000	train-clean-360	I was aiming the projector 
none	none	I was aware of Anita at my elbow 
4598_2503_000054_000002	train-clean-360	I pushed her back 
4598_2503_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Put on your helmet 
none	none	I had the range I flung the firing switch 
4598_2503_000057_000000	train-clean-360	At the deck window the giant projector spat its deadly electronic stream 
none	none	The men down there leaped away from it in surprise 
4598_2503_000057_000002	train-clean-360	I heard Potan s voice his shout of protest and anger 
4598_2503_000058_000000	train-clean-360	But down in the Earth glow at the crater base Miko s lights had not vanished 
4598_2503_000058_000001	train-clean-360	I had missed 
4598_2503_000058_000002	train-clean-360	An error in the range 
4598_2503_000058_000003	train-clean-360	Abruptly I knew it was not that 
4598_2503_000058_000004	train-clean-360	Miko s lights were still there 
4598_2503_000058_000005	train-clean-360	His signals still coming And I noticed now a faint distortion about them the glow of his little group of hand lights faintly distorted and vaguely shot with a greenish cast 
none	none	Benson curve lights My thoughts whirled in the few seconds while I stood there at the tower window Miko had feared he might be summarily fired on 
4598_2503_000059_000002	train-clean-360	He had gone back to his camp equipped all his lights with the Benson curve He was somewhere at the crater base now 
none	none	But not where I thought I saw him The Benson curve light changed the path of the light rays traveling from him to me I could not even approximate his true position 
4598_2503_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Anita was plucking at me 
none	none	Gregg come
4598_2503_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t hit him I gasped 
4598_2503_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Should I try the flash signal to Earth 
4598_2503_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Did we dare linger here 
4598_2503_000062_000002	train-clean-360	I stood another few seconds at the window 
none	none	I saw Potan down in the confusion of the deck training a telescope He had shouted up violently at his duty man here not to fire again And now he let out a roar I can see them It s Miko 
4598_2503_000063_000003	train-clean-360	By the Almighty his giant stature Brotow look 
none	none	That s not an Earth man He flung aside his telescope finder
4598_2503_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 Disconnect that projector 
4598_2503_000064_000002	train-clean-360	It s Miko down there 
4598_2503_000064_000003	train-clean-360	This Haljan is a trickster 
4598_2503_000064_000004	train-clean-360	Where is he Braile Braile you accursed fool 
4598_2503_000064_000005	train-clean-360	Are Haljan and the girl up there with you 
4598_2503_000065_000000	train-clean-360	But the duty man lay in his blood at our feet 
4598_2503_000066_000000	train-clean-360	I had dropped back from the window 
none	none	Anita and I crouched for an instant in confusion fumbling with our helmets 
4598_2503_000067_000000	train-clean-360	The ship rang with the alarm 
none	none	And amid the turmoil we could hear the shouts of the infuriated brigands swarming up the tower ladder after us XXXII I was only inactive a moment I had thought Anita would have on her helmet But she was reluctant or confused Anita we ve got to get out of here Up through the overhead locks to the dome Yes She fumbled with her helmet The climbing men on the ladder were audible They were already nearing the top The trap door was closed Anita and I were crouching on it There was a thick metal bar set in a depressed groove for the grid I slid it in place it would seal the trap for a short time A degree of confidence came to me We had a few moments before there could be any hand to hand conflict The giant electronic projector would eventually be used against Grantline it was the brigands most powerful weapon Its controls were here by Heaven I would smash them That at least I could do I jumped for the window Miko s signals had stopped but I caught a glimpse of his distant moving curve lights A flash came up at me as in the window I became visible to the brigands on the ship s deck It was a small hand projector hastily fired for it went wide of the window It was followed by a rain of small beams but I was warned and dropped my head beneath the sill The rays flashed dangerously upward through the oval opening hissed against our vaulted roof The air snapped and tingled with a shower of blue red sparks and the acrid odor of the released gases settled down upon us The trajectory controls of the projector were beside me I seized them ripped and tore at them There was a roar down on the deck The projector had exploded A man s agonizing scream split the confusion of sounds It silenced the brigands on the deck Under our floor grid those on the ladder had been pounding at the trap door They stopped evidently to see what had happened The bombardment of our windows stopped momentarily I cautiously peered out the window again In the wreck of the projector three men were lying One of them was screaming horribly The dome side was damaged Potan and other men were frantically investigating to see if the ship s air was hissing out A triumph swept over me They had not found me so meek and inoffensive as they might have thought Anita clutched me She still had not donned her helmet Put on your helmet But Gregg Put it on I I don t want to put it on until you put yours on I ve smashed the projector We ve stopped them coming up for a while But they were still on the ladder under our floor They heard our voices they began thumping again Then pounding They seemed now to have heavy implements They rammed against the trap The floor seemed holding The square of metal grid trembled yielded a little But it was good for a few minutes longer I called down The first one who comes through will be shot My words mingled with their oaths There was a moment s pause then the ramming went on The dying man on the deck was still screaming I whispered I ll try an Earth signal She nodded Pale tense but calm Yes Gregg And I was thinking It won t take a minute Have your helmet ready I was thinking She hurried across the room I swung on the Botz signaling apparatus It was connected Within a moment I had it humming The fluorescent tubes lighted with their lurid glare they painted purple the body of the giant duty man who lay sprawled at my feet I drew on all the ship s power The tube lights in the room quivered and went dim I would have to hurry Potan could shut this off from the main hull control room I could see through the room s upper trap the primary sending mirror mounted in the peak of the dome It was quivering radiant with its light energy I sent the flash The flattened past full Earth was up there I knew that the Western Hemisphere faced the Moon at this hour I flashed in English with the open Universal Earth code Help Grantline And again Help Archimedes region near Apennines Attacked by brigands Send help at once Grantline If only it would be received I flung off the current Anita stood watching me intently Gregg look I saw that she had taken some of the glass globe bombs which lay by the foot of the ascending ladder Gregg I threw some of them At the window we gazed down The globes she flung had shattered on the deck They were darkness bombs Through the blackness of the deck the shouts of the brigands came up They were stumbling about But the ramming of our trap went on and I saw that it was beginning to yield We ve got to go Anita From out of the darkness which hung like a shroud over the deck an occasional flash came up unaimed wide of our windows But the darkness was dissipating I could see now the dim glow of the deck lights blurred as through a heavy fog I dropped another of the bombs Put on your helmet Yes yes I will You put yours on We had them adjusted in a moment Our Erentz motors were pumping I gripped her Put out your helmet light She extinguished it I handed her my projector Hold it a moment I m going to take that belt of bombs The trap door was all but broken under the ramming blows of the men I leaped over the body of the dead duty man seized the belt of bombs and strapped it around my waist Give me the projector She handed it to me The trap door burst upward A man s head and shoulders appeared I fired a bullet into him the leaden pellet singing down through the yellow powder flash that spat from the projector s muzzle The brigand screamed and dropped back out of sight There was confusion at the ladder top I flung a bomb at the broken trap A tiny heat ray came wavering up through the opening but went wide of us The instrument room was in darkness I clung to Anita Hold on to my hand You go first here is the ladder We found it in the blackness mounted it and went through the cubby s roof trap I took another look and dropped another bomb beside us The four foot space up here between the cubby roof and the overhead dome went black We were momentarily concealed Anita located the manual levers of the lock entrance Here Gregg I shoved at them Fear leaped in me that they would not operate But they swung The tiny port opened wide to receive us We clambered into the small air chamber the door slid closed just as a flash from below struck at it The brigands had seen our cloud of darkness and were firing up through it In a moment we were out on the dome top A sleek rounded spread of glassite with broad aluminite girders There were cross ribs which gave us a footing and occasionally projections streamline fin tips the casings of the upper rudder shafts and the upstanding stubby funnels into which helicopters were folded We moved along the central footpath and crouched by a six foot casing The stars and the glowing Earth were over us The curving dome top a hundred feet or so in length and bulging thirty feet wide beneath us glistened in the Earthlight It was a sheer drop and down these curving sides past the ship s hull a hundred feet to the rocks on which the vessel rested The towering wall of Archimedes was beside us and beyond the brink of the ledge the thousands of feet down to the plains I saw the lights of Miko s band down there He had stopped signaling His little lights were spread out bobbing as he and his men advanced up the crater s foothills coming to join the ship I had an instant s glimpse Anita and I could not stay here The brigands would follow us up in a moment I saw no exterior ladder We would have to take our chances and jump There were brigands down there on the rocks I saw three or four helmeted figures and they saw us A bullet whizzed by us and then came the flash of a hand ray I touched Anita Can you make the leap Anita dear Again it seemed that this must be farewell Gregg dear one we ve got to do it Those waiting figures would pounce on us Anita lie here a moment I jumped up and ran twenty feet toward the bow then back toward the stern flinging down the last of my bombs The darkness was like a cloud down there enveloping the outer brigands But up there we were above it etched by the starlight and Earthglow I came back to Anita We ll have to chance it now Gregg Good bye dear I ll jump first down this side you follow To leap into that black patch with the rocks under it Gregg She was trying to tell me to look overhead She gestured Gregg see I saw it out over the plains a little speck amid the stars A moving speck coming toward us Gregg what is it I gazed held my breath A moving speck out there A blob now And then I realized it was not a large object far away but small and already very close only a few hundred feet off dropping toward the top of our dome A narrow flat ten foot object like a wingless volplane There were no lights on it but in the Earthlight I could see two crouching helmeted figures riding it Anita Don t you remember I was swept with dawning comprehension Back in the Grantline camp Snap and I had discussed how to use the Planetara s gravity plates We had gone to the wreck and secured them had rigged this little volplane flyer The brigands on the rocks saw it now A flash went up at it One of the figures crouching on it opened a flexible fabric like a wing over its side I saw another flash from below harmlessly striking the insulated shield I gasped to Anita Light your helmet It s from Grantline Let them see us I stood erect The little flying platform went over us fifty feet up circling dropping to the dome top I waved my helmet light The exit lock from below up which we had come was near us The advancing brigands were already in it I had forgotten to demolish the manuals And I saw that the darkness down on the rocks was almost gone now dissipating in the airless night The brigands down there began firing up at us It was a confusion of flashing lights I clutched at Anita Come this way run The platform barely missed our heads It sailed lengthwise of the dome top and crashed silently on the central runway near the stern tip Anita and I ran to it The two helmeted figures seized us shoved us prone on the metal platform It was barely four feet wide a low railing handles with which to cling and a tiny hooded cubby in front Gregg You Snap It was Snap and Venza She seized Anita held her crouching in place Snap flung himself face down at the controls The brigands were out on the dome now I took a last shot as we lifted My bullet punctured one of them he slid fell scrambling off the rounded dome and dropped out of sight Light rays and silent flashes seemed to envelope us Venza held the side shields higher We tilted swayed crazily and then steadied The ship s dome dropped away beneath us The rocks of the open ledge were beneath us Then the abyss with the moving climbing specks of Miko s lights far down I saw over the side shield the already distant brigand ship resting on the ledge with the massive Archimedes wall behind it A confusion back there of futile flashing rays It all faded into a remote glow as we sailed smoothly up into the starlight and away heading for the Grantline camp XXXIII Wake up Gregg They re coming I forced myself to consciousness Coming I leaped from my bunk followed Snap with a rush into the corridor We had returned safely to the Grantline camp Anita and I found ourselves exhausted from lack of sleep our arduous climb of Archimedes and that tense time on the brigand ship On the flight back Snap had explained how the landing of the ship on Archimedes was observed through the Grantline telescope They had read with amazement my signals to the brigands Snap had rushed to completion the first of our flying platforms Then he had seen Miko s signals from the crater base seen the lights and the fight to capture Anita and me and had come to rescue us Back at the camp we were given food and Grantline forced me to try to sleep They ll be on us in a few hours Gregg Miko wall have joined them by now He ll lead them to us You must rest for we need everyone at his best And surprisingly in the midst of the camp s turmoil of last minute activities I slept soundly until Snap called me telling me the ship was coming The corridor echoed with the tramp of Grantline s busy crew But there was no confusion a grim calmness had settled on everyone Anita and Venza rushed up to join us It s in sight There was no need of going to the instrument room From the windows fronting the brink of the cliff the brigand ship was plainly visible It came sailing from Archimedes a dark shape blurring the stars All its lights were extinguished save a single white search beam in the bow peak slanting diagonally down The beam presently caught our group of buildings its glare shone in the windows as it clung for a moment I could envisage the triumphant curiosity of Potan and his men up there gazing along the beam We had dimmed the lights to conserve our power and to enable the Erentz motors to run at full capacity Our buildings would have to withstand the brigands rays which soon would be upon us Outside on our dim Earthlit cliff the tiny lights showed where our few guards were lurking As I stood at the window watching the incoming ship Grantline s voice sounded Call in those men Ring the call lights Franck The siren buzzed over the camp s interior the warning call lights on the roof brought in the outer guards They came running to the admission ports which had been repaired after Miko disabled them The guards came in We dimmed our lights further The treasure sheds were black against the cliff behind us No need for guards there we reasoned the brigands would not attempt to move it until our buildings were captured But if they should try it we were prepared to defend it In the dim light we crouched A silence was upon us save for the clanging in the workshop down the corridor Most of us wore our Erentz suits with helmets ready though I am sure there was not a man of us but who prayed he might not have to go out At many of the windows our weakest points to withstand the rays insulated fabric sheets were hung like curtains The brigand ship slowly advanced It was soon over the opposite rim of our little crater Its searchbeam swung about the rim and down the valley My thoughts ran like a turgid stream as I stood tensely watching Four hours ago I had sent that flash signal to Earth If it was received a patrol ship could come to our rescue and arrive here in another eight hours or perhaps even less Ah that if If the signal was received If the patrol ship were immediately available If it started at once Eight hours at the very least I tried to assure myself that we could hold out that long The brigand ship crossed the opposite crater rim It dropped lower It seemed poised over the crater valley almost at our own level and less than two miles from us Its searchbeam vanished For a moment it hung a sleek cylindrical silver shape gleaming in the Earthlight Snap looked at me and murmured It s descending It slowly settled cautiously picked its landing place amid the crags and pits of the tumbled scarred valley floor It came to rest a vague menacing silver shape lurking in the lower shadows close at the foot of the inner opposite crater wall A few moments of tense waiting passed Soon tiny lights were moving down there some out on the rocks near the ship others up under its deck dome A stab of searchlight shot across the valley swung along our ledge and clung with its glaring ten foot circle to the front of our main building Then a ray flashed The assault had begun XXXIV It seemed with that first shot from the enemy that a great relief came to us an apprehension fallen away We had anticipated this moment for so long dreaded it I think all our men felt it A shout went up Harmless It was not that But our building withstood it better than I had feared It was a flash from a large electronic projector mounted on the deck of the brigand ship It stabbed up from the shadows across the valley at the foot of the opposite crater wall a beam of vaguely fluorescent light Simultaneously the searchlight vanished The stream of electrons caught the front face of our main building in a six foot circle It held a few seconds vanished then stabbed again and still again Three bolts A total I suppose of nine or ten seconds I was standing with Grantline at a front window We had rigged an oblong of insulated fabric like a curtain we stood peering holding the curtain cautiously aside The ray struck some twenty feet away from us Harmless The men shouted it with derision But Grantline swung on them Don t get that idea An interior signal panel was beside Grantline He called the duty men in the instrument room It s over What are your readings The bombarding electrons had passed through the outer shell of the building s double wall and been absorbed in the rarefied magnetized aircurrent of the Erentz circulation Like poison in a man s veins reaching his heart the free alien electrons had disturbed the motors They accelerated then retarded Pulsed unevenly and drew added power from the reserve tanks But they had normalized at once when the shot was past The duty man s voice sounded from the grid in answer to Grantline s question Five degrees colder in your building Can t you feel it The disturbed weakened Erentz system had allowed the outer cold to radiate through a trifle The walls had had a trifle extra explosive pressure from the air A strain but that was all It s probably their most powerful single weapon Gregg said Grantline I nodded Yes I think so I had smashed the real giant with its ten mile range The ship was only two miles from us but it seemed as though this projector were exerted to its distance limit I had noticed on the deck only one of this type The others paralyzing rays and heat rays were less deadly Grantline commented We can withstand a lot of that bombardment If we stay inside That ray striking a man outside would penetrate his Erentz suit within a few seconds we could not doubt We had however no intention of going out unless for dire necessity Even so said Grantline a hand shield would hold it off for a certain length of time We had an opportunity a moment later to test our insulated shields The bolt came again It darted along the front face of the building caught our window and clung The double window shelves were our weakest points The sheet of flashing Erentz current was transparent we could see through it as though it were glass It moved faster but was thinner at the windows than the walls We feared the bombarding electrons might cross it penetrate the inner shell and like a lightning bolt enter the room We dropped the curtain corner The radiance of the bolt was dimly visible A few seconds then it vanished again and behind the shield we had not felt a tingle Harmless But our power had been drained nearly an aeron to neutralize the shock to the Erentz current Grantline said If they kept that up it would be a question of whose power supply would last longer And it would not be ours You saw our lights fade when the bolt was striking But the brigands did not know we were short of power And to fire the projector with a continuous bolt would in thirty minutes perhaps have exhausted their own power reserve I won t answer them Grantline declared Our game is to sit defensive Conserve everything Let them make the leading moves We waited half an hour but no other shot came The valley floor was patched with Earthlight and shadow We could see the vague outline of the brigand ship backed up at the foot of the opposite crater wall The form of its dome over the illuminated deck was visible and the line of its tiny hull ovals On the rocks near the ship helmet lights of prowling brigands occasionally showed Whatever activity was going on down there we could not see with the naked eye Grantline did not use our telescope at first To connect it even for local range drew on our precious ammunition of power Some of the men urged that we search the sky with the telescope Was our rescue ship from Earth coming But Grantline refused We were in no trouble yet And every delay was to our advantage Commander where shall I put these helmets A man came wheeling a pile of helmets on a small truck At the manual port in the other building Our weapons and outside equipment were massed at the main exit locks of the large building But we might want to go out through smaller locks too Grantline sent helmets there suits were not needed as most of us were garbed in them now Snap was still in the workshop I went there during this first half hour of the attack Ten of our men were busy there with the little flying platforms and the fabric shields How goes it Snap Almost all ready He had six of the platforms including the one we had already used and more than a dozen hand shields At a squeeze all of us could ride on these six little vehicles We might have to ride them We planned that in event of disaster to the buildings we could at least escape in this fashion Food supplies and water were now being placed at the ports Depressing preparations Our buildings uninhabitable a rush out and away abandoning the treasure Grantline had never mentioned such a contingency but I noticed nevertheless that preparations were being made Snap s voice was raised over the clang of the workmen bolting the gravity plates of the last platform Only that one projector Gregg They gave us four blasts but just the one projector Their strongest He grinned He wore no Erentz suit as yet He stood in torn grimy work trousers and a bedraggled shirt with the inevitable red eyeshade holding back his unruly hair Around his waist was the weighted belt and there were weights on his shoes for gravity stability Didn t hurt us much No When I get the tube panels in this thing I ll be finished It ll take another half hour Then I ll join you Where are you stationed I shrugged I was at a front window with Johnny Nothing to do as yet Snap went back to his work Well the longer they delay the better for us If only your signal got through Gregg we ll have a rescue ship here in a few hours more Ah that if I turned away Can t help you Snap No Take those shields he added to one of the men Take them where To Grantline He ll tell you where to put them The shields were wheeled away on a little cart I followed it Grantline sent it to the back exit No other move from them yet Johnny No All quiet Snap s almost finished The brigands presently made another play A giant heat ray beam came across the valley It clung to our front wall for nearly a minute Grantline got the report from the instrument room He laughed That helped rather than hurt us Heated the outer wall Franck took advantage of it and eased up the motors We wondered if Miko knew that Doubtless he did for the heat ray was not used again Then came a zed ray I stood at the window watching it faint sheen of beam in the dimness it crept with sinister deliberation along our front wall clung momentarily to our shielded windows and pried with its revealing glow into Snap s workshop Looking us over Grantline commented I hope they like what they see I knew that he did not feel the bravado that was in his tone We had nothing but small hand weapons heat rays electronic projectors and bullet projectors All for very short range fighting If Miko had not known that before he could at least make a good guess at it after the careful zed ray inspection With his ship down there two miles away we were powerless to reach him It seemed that Miko was now testing all his mechanisms A light flare went up from the dome peak of the ship It rose in a slow arc over the valley and burst For a few seconds the two mile circle of crags was brilliantly illumined I stared but I had to shield my eyes against the dazzling actinic glare and I could see nothing Was Miko making a zed ray photograph of our interiors We had no way of knowing He was testing his short range projectors now With my eyes again accustomed to the normal Earthlight in the valley I could see the stabs of electronic beams the Martian paralyzing rays and heat beams They darted out like flashing swords from the rocks near the ship Then the whole ship and the crater wall behind it seemed to shift sidewise as a Benson curve light spread its glow about the ship with a projector curve beam coming up and touching the window through which I was peering Haljan come look at these damn girls Commander shall I stop them They ll kill themselves or kill us or smash something We followed the man into the building s broad central corridor Anita and Venza were riding a midget platform Anita in her boyish black garb Venza with a flowing white Venus robe They lay on the tiny six foot long oblong of metal one manipulating its side shields the other at the controls As we arrived the platform came sliding down the narrow confines of the corridor lurching barely missing a door projection Up to the low vaulted ceiling then down to the floor It sailed over our heads rising over us as we ducked Anita waved her hand Grantline gasped By the infernal I shouted Anita stop But they only waved at us skimming down the length of the corridor seeming to avoid a smash a dozen times by the smallest margin of chance stopping miraculously at the further end hanging poised in mid air wheeling coming back undulating up and down Grantline clung to me By the gods of the airways In spite of my astonished horror I could not but share Grantline s admiration Three or four other men were watching The girls were amazingly skillful no doubt of that There was not a man among us who could have handled that gravity platform indoors not one who would have had the brash temerity to try it The platform landed with the grace of a humming bird at our feet the girls dexterously balancing so that it came to rest swiftly without the least bump I confronted them Anita what are you doing She stood up flushed and smiling Practicing What for Venza s roguish eyes twinkled at me Her hands went to her slim hips with a gesture of defiance She asked Are you speaking for yourself or the Commander I ignored her What for Because we re good at it Anita retorted Better than any of you men If you should need us we re ready We won t I said shortly But if you should Venza put in If Snap and I hadn t come for you you wouldn t be here Gregg Haljan I didn t notice you were so horrified to see me holding that shield up over you It silenced me She added Commander let us alone We won t smash anything Grantline laughed I hope you won t A warning call took us back to the front window The brigands searchlight was again being used It swept slowly along the length of the cliff Its circle went down the cliff steps to the valley floor and came sweeping up again Then it went up to the observatory platform at the summit above us then over to the ore sheds We had no men outside if that was what the brigands wanted to determine The searchbeam presently vanished It was replaced immediately by a zed ray which darted at once to our treasure sheds and clung That stung Grantline into his first action We flung our own zed ray down across the valley It reached the brigand ship and the blurred interior of the cabins Try the searchbeam Franck The zed ray went off We gazed down our searchlight which clung to the dome of the distant enemy vessel We could see movement there The telescope Grantline ordered The dynamos hummed The telescope finder glowed and clarified On the deck of the ship we saw the brigands working with the assembling of tiny ore carts A deck landing port was open The ore carts were being carried out through a port lock and down a landing incline And on the rock outside we saw several of the carts tiny rail sections and the section of an ore chute Miko was unloading his mining apparatus He was making ready to come up for the treasure The discovery startling as it was nevertheless was far overshadowed by an imperative danger alarm from our main building Brigands were outside on our ledge Miko s searchbeam sweeping the ledge a moment before had carefully avoided revealing them It had been done just for that purpose no doubt to make us feel sure the ledge was unoccupied and thus to guard against our own light making the search But there was a brigand group close outside our walls By the merest chance the radiating glow from our searchray had shown the helmeted figures scurrying for shelter Grantline leaped to his feet We rushed from the rear port exit which was nearest us The giant bloated figures had been seen running along the outside of the connecting corridor in this direction But before we ever got there a new alarm came A brigand was crouching at a front corner of the main building His hydrogen heat torch had already opened a rift in the wall XXXV In with you ordered Grantline Get your helmets on How many Six Enough get back there Williams you were last The lock won t hold any more I was one of the six who jammed into the manual exit lock We went through it in a moment we were outside It was less than three minutes since the prowling brigand had been seen Grantline touched me just as we emerged Don t wait for orders Get him That fellow with the torch Yes I m with you We went out with a rush We had already discarded our shoe and belt weights I leaped regardless of my companions The scurrying Martians had disappeared Through my visor bull s eye I could see only the Earthlit rocky surface of the ledge Beside me stretched the dark wall of our building I bounded toward the front The brigand with the torch had been at the front corner I could not see him from here he had been crouching just around the angle I had a tiny bullet projector the best weapon for short range outdoors I was aware of Grantline close behind me It took only a few of my giant leaps I handed at the corner recovered my balance and whirled around to the front The Martian was here a giant misshapen lump as he crouched His torch was a little stab of blue in the deep shadow enveloping him Intent upon his work he did not see me Perhaps he thought his fellow men had broken our exits by now I landed like a leopard upon his back and fired my weapon muzzle ramming him His torch fell hissing with a silent rain of blue fire upon the rocks As my grip upon him made audiphone contact his agonized scream rattled the diaphragms of my ear grids with horrible deafening intensity He lay writhing under me then was still His scream choked into silence His suit deflated within my encircling grip He was dead my leaden steel tipped pellet had punctured the double surface of his Erentz fabric penetrated his chest Grantline had leaped landing beside me Dead Yes I climbed from the inert body The torch had hissed itself out Grantline swung to our building corner and I leaned down with him to examine it The torch had fused and scarred the wall burned almost through A pressure rift had opened We could see it a curving gash in the metal wall plate like a crack in a glass window pane I went cold This was serious damage The rarefied Erentz air would seep out It was leaking now we could see the magnetic radiance of it all up the length of the ten foot crack The leak would change the pressure of the Erentz system constantly lower it demanding steady renewal The Erentz motors would overheat some might go bad from the strain Grantline stood gripping me Damn bad Yes Can t we repair it Johnny No Would have to take that whole plaster section out shut off the Erentz plant and exhaust the interior air of all this bulkhead Day s job maybe more And the crack would get worse I knew It would gradually spread and widen The Erentz circulation would fail All our power would be drained struggling to maintain it This brigand who had unwittingly committed suicide by his daring act had accomplished more than he had perhaps realized I could envisage our weapons useless from the lack of power The air in our buildings turned fetid and frigid ourselves forced to the helmets A rush out to abandon the camp and escape The building exploding scattering into a litter on the ledge like a child s broken toy The treasure abandoned with the brigands coming up and loading it on their ship Our defeat In a few hours now or minutes This crack could slowly widen or it could break suddenly at any time Disaster come now so abruptly upon us at the very start of the brigand attack Grantline s voice in my audiphone broke my despairing thoughts Bad Come on Gregg Nothing to do here We were aware that our other four men had run along the building s other side They emerged now with the running brigands in front of them rushing out toward the stairs on the ledge Three giant Martian figures in flight with our four men chasing A brigand fell to the rocks by the brink of the ledge The others reached the descending staircase tumbled down it with reckless leaps Our men turned back Before we could join them the enemy ship down in the valley sent up a cautious searchbeam which located its returning men Then the beam swung up to the ledge landing upon us We stood confused blinded by the brilliant glare Grantline stumbled against me Run Gregg They ll be firing at us We dashed away Our companions joined us rushing back for the port I saw it open reinforcements coming out to help us half a dozen figures carrying a ten foot insulated shield They could barely get it through the port The Martian searchray vanished Then almost instantly the electronic ray came with its deadly stab Missed us at first as we ran for the shield carrying it back to the port hiding behind it The ray stabbed once or twice more Whether Miko s instruments showed him how badly damaged our front wall was we never knew But I think that he realized His searchbeam clung to it and his zed ray pried into our interiors The brigand ship was active now We were desperate we used our telescope freely for observation Miko s ore carts and mining apparatus were unloaded on the rocks The rail sections were being carried a mile out nearly to the center of the valley A subsidiary camp was being established there only a mile from the base of our cliff but still far beyond reach of our weapons We could see the brigand lights down there Then the ore chute sections were brought over We could see Miko s men carrying some of the giant projectors mounting them in the new position Power tanks and cables Light flare catapults small mechanical cannons for throwing illuminating bombs The enemy searchlight constantly raked our vicinity Occasionally the giant electronic projector flung out its bolt as though warning us not to dare leave our buildings Half an hour went by Our situation was even worse than Miko could know The Erentz motors were running hot our power draining the crack widening When it would break we could not tell but the danger was like a sword over us An anxious thirty minutes for us this second interlude Grantline called a meeting of all our little force with every man having his say Inactivity was no longer a feasible policy We recklessly used our power to search the sky Our rescue ship might be up there but we could not see it with our now disabled instruments No signals came We could not or at least did not receive them They wouldn t signal Grantline protested They d know the Martians would be more likely to get the signal than us Of what use to warn Miko But he did not dare wait for a rescue ship that might or might not be coming Miko was playing the waiting game now making ready for a quick loading of the ore when we were forced to abandon our buildings The brigand ship suddenly moved its position It rose up in a low flat arc came forward and settled in the center of the valley where the carts and rail sections were piled and the outside projectors newly mounted on the rocks The brigands now began laying the rails from the ship toward the base of our cliff The chute would bring the ore down from the ledge and the carts would take it to the ship The laying of the rails was done under cover of occasional stabs from the electronic projector And then we discovered that Miko had made still another move The brigand rays fired from the depth of the valley could strike our front building but could not reach all our ledge And from the ship s newer and nearer position this disadvantage to us was intensified Then abruptly we realized that under cover of darkness bombs an electronic projector and searchray had been carried to the top of the crater rim diagonally across and only half a mile from us Their beams shot down raking all our vicinity from this new angle I was on the little flying platform which sallied out as a test to attack these isolated projectors Snap and I and one other volunteer went He and I held the shield Snap handled the controls Our exit port was on the lee side of the building from the hostile searchbeam We got out unobserved and sailed upward but soon a light from the ship caught us And the projector bolts came up Our sortie only lasted a few minutes To me it was a confusion of crossing beams with the stars overhead the swaying little platform under me and the shield tingling in my hands when the blasts struck us Moments of blurred terror The voice of the man beside me sounded in my ears Now Haljan give them one We were up over the peak of the rim with the hostile projectors under us I gauged our movement and dropped an explosive powder bomb It missed It flared with a puff on the rocks twenty feet from where the two projectors were mounted I saw that two helmeted figures were down there They tried to swing their grids upward but could not get them vertical to reach us The ship was firing at us but it was far away And Grantline s searchbeam was going full power clinging to the ship to dazzle them Snap circled them As we came back I dropped another bomb Its silent puff seemed littered with flying fragments of the two projectors and the bodies of the men We swiftly flew back to our base It decided Grantline For an hour past Snap and I had been urging our plan to use the gravity platforms To remain inactive was sure defeat now Even if our buildings did not explode if we thought to huddle in them helmeted in the failing air then Miko could readily ignore us and proceed with his loading of the treasure under our helpless gaze He could do that now with safety if we refused to accept the challenge for we could not fire through the windows and must go out to meet this threat To remain defensive would end inevitably in our defeat We all knew it now The waiting game was Miko s not ours The success of our attack upon the distant isolated projectors heartened us Yet it was a desperate offensive upon which we decided We prepared our little expedition at the larger of the exit ports Miko s zed ray was watching all our interior movements We made a brave show of activity in our workshop with abandoned ore carts which were stored there We got them out started to recondition them It seemed to fool Miko His zed ray clung to the workshop watching us And at the distant port we gathered the platforms shields helmets bombs and a few hand projectors There were six platforms three of us upon each It left four people to remain indoors I need not describe the emotion with which Snap and I listened to Venza and Anita pleading to be allowed to accompany us They urged it upon Grantline and we took no part It was too important a decision The treasure the life or death of all these men hung now upon the fate of our venture Snap and I could not intrude our personal feelings And the girls won Both were undeniably more skillful at handling the midget platforms than any of us men Two of the six platforms could be guided by them That was a third of our little force And of what use to go out and be defeated leaving the girls here to meet death almost immediately afterward We gathered at the port A last minute change made Grantline order six of his men to remain to guard the buildings The instruments the Erentz system all the appliances had to be attended It left four platforms each with three men Grantline at the controls of one of them And upon two of the others Venza rode with Snap and I with Anita We crouched in the shadows outside the port So small an army sallying out to bomb this enemy vessel or be killed in the attempt Only sixteen of us And thirty or so brigands well armed I envisioned then this tiny Moon crater the scene of this battle we were waging Struggling humans desperately trying to kill Anita drew me down on the platform Ready Gregg The others were rising We lifted moved slowly out and away from the protective shadows of the building XXXVI Grantline led us We held about level Five hundred feet beneath us the brigand ship lay cradled on the rocks When it was still a mile away from us I could see all its outline fairly clearly in the dimness Its tiny hull windows were dark but the blurred shape of the hull was visible and above it the rounded cap of dome with a dim radiance beneath it We followed Grantline s platform It was rising drawing the others after it like a tail I touched Anita where she lay beside me with her head half in the small hooded control bank Going too high She nodded but followed the line nevertheless It was Grantline s command I lay crouched holding the inner tips of the flexible side shields The bottom of the platform was covered with the insulated fabric There were two side shields They extended upward some two feet flexible so that I could hold them out to see over them or draw them up and in to cover us They afforded a measure of protection against the hostile rays though just how much we were not sure With the platform level a bolt from beneath could not harm us unless it continued for a considerable time But the platform except upon direct flight was seldom level for it was a frail unstable little vehicle To handle it was more than a question of the controls We balanced and helped to guide it with the movement of our bodies shifting our weight sidewise or back or forward to make it dip as the controls altered the gravity pull in its tiny plate sections Like a bird wheeling soaring swooping To me it was a precarious business But now we were in straight flight diagonally upward The outline of the brigand ship came directly under us I crouched tense breathless every moment it seemed that the brigands must discover us and loose their bolts They may have seen us for some moments before they fired I peered over the side shield down at our mark then up ahead to get Grantline s firing signal It seemed long delayed An added glow down there must have warned Grantline that a shot was coming from there The tiny red light flared bright on his platform I turned on our Benson curve light radiance We had been dark but a soft glow now enveloped us Its sheen went down to the ship to reveal us But its curving path showed us falsely placed I saw the little line of platforms ahead of us They seemed to move suddenly sidewise It was everyone for himself now none of us could tell where the other platforms actually were placed or headed Anita swooped us sharply down to avoid a possible collision Gregg Yes I m aiming I was making ready to drop the small explosive globe bomb Our search light ray at the camp answering Grantline s signal shot down and bathed the enemy ship in a white glare revealing it for our aim Simultaneously the brigand bolts came up at us I held my bomb out over the shield calculating the angle to throw it down The brigand rays flashed around me They were horribly close Miko had understood our sudden visible shift and aimed not where we appeared to be but approximately where we had been before I dropped my bomb hastily at the glowing white ship The touch of a hostile ray would have exploded it in my hand I saw others dropping also from our nearby platforms The explosions from them merged in a confusion of the white glare and a cloud of black mist as the brigands out on the rocks used their darkness bombs We swept past in a blur of leaping hostile beams Silent battle of lights Darkness bombs down at the ship struggling to bar our camp searchray The Benson radiance rays from our passing platforms curving down to mingle with the confusion The electronic rays sending up their bolts Our platforms dropped some ten dynamitrine bombs in that first passage over the ship As we sped by I dimmed the Benson radiance I peered We had not hit the ship Or if we had the damage was inconclusive But on the rocks I could see a pile of ore carts scattered broken wreckage in which the litter of two or three projectors seemed strewn And the gruesome deflated forms of several helmeted figures Others seemed to be running scattering hiding in the rocks and pit holes Twenty brigands at least were outside the ship Some were running over toward the base of our camp ledge The darkness bombs were spreading like a curtain over the valley floor but it seemed that some of the figures were dragging their projectors away We sailed off toward the opposite crater rim I remember passing over the broken wreckage of Grantline s little spaceship the Comet Miko s bolts momentarily had vanished We had hit some of his outside projectors the others were abandoned or being dragged to safer positions After a mile we wheeled and went back I suddenly realized that only four platforms were in the re formed line ahead of us One was missing I saw it now wavering down close over the ship A bolt leaped up diagonally from a distant angle on the rocks and caught the disabled platform It fell whirling glowing red disappeared into the blur of darkness like a bit of heated metal plunged into water One out of six of our platforms already lost Three men of our small force gone But Grantline led us desperately back Anita caught his signal to break our line The five platforms scattered dipping and wheeling like frightened birds blurring shapes shifting unnaturally in flight as the Benson curve lights were altered Anita now took our platform in a long swoop downward Her tense murmured voice sounded in my ears Hold off I ll take us low A melee Passing platform shapes The darting bolts crossing like ancient rapiers Falling blue points of fuse lights as we threw our bombs Down in a swoop Then rising Away and then back This silent warfare of lights It seemed that around me must be bursting a pandemonium of sound Yet there was none Silent blurred melee infinitely frightening A bolt struck us clung for an instant but we weathered it The light was blinding Through my gloves I could feel the tingle of the over charged shield as it caught and absorbed the hostile bombardment Under me the platform seemed heated My little Erentz motors ran with ragged pulse I got too much oxygen I was dully smothering Then the bolt was gone I found us soaring upward horribly tilted I shifted over Anita Anita dear are you all right Yes Gregg All right The melee went on The brigand ship and all its vicinity were enveloped in dark mist now a turgid sable curtain made more dense by the dissipating heavy fumes of our exploding bombs which settled low over the ship and the rocks nearby The searchlight from our camp strove futilely to penetrate the cloud Our platforms were separated One went by high over us I saw another dart close beneath my shield God Anita Too close I didn t see it Almost a collision Gregg haven t we broken the ship s dome yet It seemed not I had dropped nearly all my bombs This could not go on much longer Had it been only about five minutes Only that Reason told me so yet it seemed an eternity of horror Another swoop My last bomb Anita had brought us into position to fling it But I could not A bolt stabbed up from the gloom and caught us We huddled pulling the shields up and over us Blurred darkness again Too much to the side now I had to wait while Anita swung us back Then we seemed too high I waited with my last bomb The other platforms were occasionally dropping them I had been too hasty too prodigal Had we broken the ship s dome with a direct hit It seemed not The brigands were sending up catapulted light flares They came from positions on the rocks outside the ship They mounted in lazy curves and burst over us The concealing darkness broken only by the flares of explosions enveloped the enemy Our camp searchlight was still struggling with it But overhead where the few little platforms were circling and swooping the flares gave an almost continuous glare It was dazzling blinding Even through the smoked pane which I adjusted to my visor I could not stand it But these were thoughts of comparative dimness In a patch where the Earthlight struck through the darkness of the rocks I saw another of our fallen platforms Snap and Venza It was not they but three figures of our men One was dead Two had survived the fall They stood up staggering And in that instant before the turgid black curtain closed over them I saw two brigands come rushing Their hand projectors stabbed at close range Our men crumpled and fell We were in position again I flung my last missile watched its light as it dropped On the dome roof two of Miko s men were crouching My bomb was truly aimed perhaps one of the few in all our bombardment which landed directly on the dome roof But the waiting marksmen fired at it with short range heat projectors and exploded it harmlessly while it was still above them We swung up and away I saw high above us Grantline s platform recognizing its red signal light There seemed a lull The enemy fire had died down to only a very occasional bolt In the confusion of my whirling impressions I wondered if Miko were in distress Not that We had not hit his ship perhaps we had done little damage indeed It was we who were in distress Two of our platforms had fallen two out of six Or more of which I did not know I saw one rising off to the side of us Grantline was over us Well we were at least three And then I saw the fourth Grantline is calling us up Gregg Grantline s signal light was summoning us from the attack He was a thousand feet or more above us I was suddenly shocked with horror The searchray from our camp suddenly vanished Anita wheeled us to face the distant ledge The camp lights showed and over one of the buildings was a distress light Had the crack in our front wall broken threatening explosion of all the buildings The wild thought swept me But it was not that I could see light stabs from the cliff outside the main building Miko had dared to send some men to attack our almost deserted camp Grantline realized it His red helmet light semaphored the command to follow him His platform soared away heading for the camp with the other two behind him Anita lifted us to follow But I checked her No Off to the right across the valley But Gregg Do as I say Anita She swung us diagonally away from both the camp and the brigand ship I prayed that we might not be noticed by the brigands Anita listen I ve got an idea The attack on the brigand ship was over It lay enveloped in the darkness of the powder gas cloud and its own darkness bombs But it was uninjured Miko had answered us with our own tactics He had practically unmanned the ship no doubt and had sent his men to our buildings The fight had shifted But I was now without ammunition save for two or three bullet projectors Of what use for our platform to rush back Miko expected that His attack on the camp was undoubtedly made just for that purpose to lure us back there Anita if we can get down on the rocks somewhere near the ship and creep up unobserved in that blackness I might be able to reach the manual hull lock rip it open and let the air out If I could get into its pressure chamber and unseal the inner slide It would wreck the ship Anita exhaust all its air Shall we try it Whatever you say Gregg We seemed to be unobserved We skimmed close to the valley floor a mile from the ship We headed slowly toward it sailing low over the rocks Then we landed left the platform Let me go first Anita I held a bullet projector With slow cautious leaps we advanced Anita was behind me I had wanted to leave her with the platform but she would not stay And to be with me seemed at least equally safe The rocks were deserted I thought that there was very little chance that any of the enemy would lurk here We clambered over the pitted scarred surface the higher crags etched with Earthlight stood like sentinels in the gloom The brigand ship with its surrounding darkness was not far from us No one was out here We passed the wreckage of broken projectors and gruesome shattered human forms We prowled closer The hull of the ship loomed ahead of us All dark We came at last close against the sleek metal hull side slid along it to where I was sure the manual lock would be located Abruptly I realized that Anita was not behind me Then I saw her at a little distance struggling in the grip of a giant helmeted figure The brigand lifted her turned and ran I did not dare fire I bounded after them along the hull side around under the curve of the pointed bow down along the other side I had mistaken the hull port location It was here The running bounding figure reached it slid the panel I was only fifty feet away not much more than a single leap I saw Anita being shoved into the pressure lock The Martian flung himself after her I fired at him in desperation but missed I came with a rush And as I reached the port it slid closed in my face barring me XXXVII With puny fists I pounded the panel A small pane in it was transparent Within the lock I could see the blurred figures of Anita and her captor and it seemed another figure there The lock was some ten feet square with a low ceiling It glowed with a dim tube light I strained at it with futile silent effort The mechanism was here to open this manual but it was now clasped from within so would not operate A few seconds while I stood there in a panic of confusion raging to get in This disaster had come so suddenly I did not plan I had no thought save to batter my way in and rescue Anita I recall that I finally beat on the glassite pane with my bullet projector until the weapon was bent and useless And I flung it with a wild despairing rage at my feet They were letting the ship s air pressure into this lock Soon they would open the inner panel step into the secondary chamber and in a moment more would be within the ship s hull corridor Anita lost to me The outer panel suddenly opened I had lunged against it with my shoulder the giant figure inside slid it It was taken by surprise I half fell forward Huge arms went around me The goggled face of the helmet peered into mine So it is you Haljan I thought I recognized that little device over your helmet bracket And here is my little Anita come back to me again Miko This was he His great bloated arms encircling me bending me backward holding me helpless I saw over his shoulder that Anita was clutched in the grip of another helmeted figure No giant but tall for an Earth man almost as tall as myself Then the tube light in the room illumined the visor I saw the face recognized it Moa I gasped So I ve got you Miko Got me You re a fool to the last Haljan A fool to the last But you were always a fool I could scarcely move in his grip My arms were pinned As he slowly bent me backward I wound my legs around one of his it was as unyielding as a steel pillar He had closed the outer panel the air pressure in the lock was rising I could feel it against my suit My helmeted head was being forced backward Miko s left arm held me In his gloved right hand as it came slowly up over my throat I saw a knife blade its naked sharpened metal glistening blue white in the light from overhead I seized his wrist But my puny strength could not hold him The knife against all of my efforts came slowly down A moment of this slow deadly combat the end of everything for me I was aware of the helmeted figure of Moa casting off Anita and then the two girls leaping upon Miko It threw him off his balance and my hanging weight made him topple forward He took a step to recover himself his hand with the knife was flung up with an instinctive involuntary balancing gesture And as it came down again I forced the knife blade to graze his throat Its point caught in the fabric of his suit His startled oath jangled in my ears The girls were clawing at him we were all four scrambling swaying With despairing strength I twisted at his wrist The knife went into his throat I plunged it deeper His suit went flabby He crumpled over me and fell knocking me to the floor His voice with the horrible gurgling rasp of death in it rattled my ear grids Not such a fool are you Haljan Moa s helmeted head was close over us I saw that she had seized the knife jerked it from her brother s throat She leaped backward waving it I twisted from beneath Miko s lifeless inert body As I got to my feet Anita flung herself to shield me Moa was across the lock back up against the wall The knife in her hand went up She stood for the briefest instant regarding Anita and me holding each other I thought that she was about to leap upon us But before I could move the knife came down and plunged into her breast She fell forward her grotesque helmet striking the grid floor almost at my feet Gregg She s dead No She moved Get her helmet off There s enough air here My helmet pressure indicator was faintly buzzing to show that a safe pressure was in the room I shut off Moa s Erentz motors unfastened her helmet and raised it off We gently turned her body She lay with closed eyes her pallid face blue With our own helmets off we knelt over her Oh Gregg is she dead No Not quite but dying Gregg I don t want her to die She was trying to help you there at the last She opened her eyes The film of death was glazing them But she saw me recognized me Gregg Yes Moa I m here Her vivid lips were faintly drawn in a smile I m so glad you took the helmets off Gregg I m going you know No Going back to Mars to rest with the fire makers where I came from I was thinking maybe you would kiss me Gregg Anita gently pushed me down I pressed the white faintly smiling lips with mine She sighed and it ended with a rattle in her throat Thank you Gregg closer I can t talk so loudly One of her gloved hands struggled to touch me but she had no strength and it fell back Her words were the faintest of whispers There was no use living without your love But I want you to see now that a Martian girl can die with a smile Her eyelids fluttered down it seemed that she sighed and then was not breathing But on her livid face the faint smile still lingered to show me how a Martian girl could die We had forgotten for the moment where we were As I glanced up I saw through the inner panel past the secondary lock that the hull s corridor was visible And along its length a group of Martians was advancing They saw us and came running Anita Look We ve got to get out of here The secondary lock was open to the corridor We jammed on our helmets The unhelmeted brigands by then were fumbling at the inner panel I pulled at the lever of the outer panel The brigands were hurrying thinking that they could be in time to stop me One of the more cautious fumbled with a helmet Anita run Try and keep your feet I slid the outer panel and pushed at Anita Simultaneously the brigands opened the inner port The air came with a tempestuous rush A blast through the inner port through the small pressure lock a wild rush out to the airless Moon All the air in the ship madly rushing to escape Like feathers we were blown with it I recall an impression of the hurtling brigand figures and swift flying rocks under me A silent crash as I struck Then soundless empty blackness XXXVIII Is he conscious We d better take him back get his helmet off It s over We can get back to the camp now Venza dear we ve won it s over He hears us Gregg He hears us He ll be all right I opened my eyes I lay on the rocks Over my helmet other helmets were peering and faint familiar voices mingled with the roaring in my ears back to the camp and get his helmet off Are his motors smooth Keep them right Snap he must have good air I seemed unhurt But Anita She was here Gregg dear one Anita safe All four of us here on the Earthlit rocks close outside the brigand ship Anita She held me lifted me I was uninjured I could stand I staggered up and stood swaying The brigand ship a hundred feet away loomed dark and silent a lifeless hulk already empty of air drained in the mad blast outward Like the wreck of the Planetara a dead useless pulseless hulk already We four stood together triumphant The battle was over The brigands were worsted almost the last man of them dead or dying No more than ten or fifteen had been available for that final assault upon the camp buildings Miko s last strategy I think perhaps he had intended with his few remaining men to take the ship and make away deserting his fellows All on the ship caught unhelmeted by the explosion were dead long since I stood listening to Snap s triumphant account It had not been difficult for the flying platforms to hunt down the attacking brigands on the open rocks We had only lost one more platform Human hearts beat sometimes with very selfish emotions It was a triumphant ending for us and we hardly gave a thought that half of Grantline s men had perished We huddled on Snap s platform It rose lurching drunkenly barely carrying us As we headed for the Grantline buildings where still the rift in the wall had not quite broken there came the final triumph Miko had been aware of it and knew he had lost Grantline s searchlight leaped upward swept the sky caught its sought for object a huge silver cylinder bathed brightly in the white searchbeam glare The police ship from Earth TWO PLANETS CLASH FOR LUNAR TREASURE Gregg Haljan was aware that there was a certain danger in having the giant spaceship Planetara stop off at the moon to pick up Grantline s special cargo of moon ore For that rare metal invaluable in keeping Earth s technology running was the target of many greedy eyes But nevertheless he hadn t figured on the special twist the clever Martian brigands would use So when he found both the ship and himself suddenly in their hands he knew that there was only one way in which he could hope to save that cargo and his own secret that would be by turning space pirate himself and paying the BRIGANDS OF THE MOON back in their own interplanetary coin Here is a science fiction classic as exciting and ingenious as only a master of super science could write When RAY CUMMINGS took leave of this planet early in nineteen fifty seven the world of modern science fiction lost one of its genuine founding fathers For the imagination of this talented writer supplied a great many of the most basic themes upon which the present superstructure of science fiction is based Following the lead of Jules Verne and H G Wells Cummings successfully bridged the gap between the early dawning of science fiction in the last decades of the Nineteenth Century and the full flowering of the field in these middle decades of the Twentieth Born in eighteen eighty seven Cummings acquired insight into the vast possibilities of future science by a personal association with Thomas Alva Edison During the nineteen twenty s and nineteen thirty s he thrilled millions of readers with his vivid tales of space and time The infinite and the infinitesimal were all parts of his canvas and past present and future the interplanetary and the extra dimensional all made their initial impact on the reading public through his many stories and novels Previously published in an ACE edition is his novel The Man Who Mastered Time D one hundred seventy three End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Brigands of the Moon by Ray
